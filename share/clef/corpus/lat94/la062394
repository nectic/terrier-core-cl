NEWS BITES: CALL ME DOC

 The Italian government has granted the famed red wine Sassicaia, which sells 
for $75 a bottle, the right to carry the DOC certification mark. DOC, which 
stands for Denominazione di Origine Controllata , was set up in 1963 as the 
formal system of approving the use of regional names on wines conforming to 
specific production regulations that guaranteed the consumer would get a wine 
typical of the region named on the label.Anything else had to be labeled as 
simple table wine, or vino da tavola . 
</P>
<P>
 The system was intended to guarantee quality, but since it was based on 
tradition alone, it discouraged experimentation -- for instance, in production 
methods or grape varieties. Ironically, by the early 1970s some of Italy's best 
and most expensive wines (such as Sassicaia) were labeled vino da tavola . DAN

NEWS BITES: HARDLY HEALTHFUL

 OK, it's good to eat healthfully. Is it more expensive? Yes, at least for now, 
find researchers at the Department of Human Nutrition in Adelaide, Australia.In 
a study published recently in the Journal of Nutrition Education, they show 
that the most common way to eat a more healthful diet -- replacing high-fat or 
high-salt prepared foods with their low-fat and low-sodium counterparts -- is 
more expensive. At least until some future day when manufacturers provide a 
greater range of more healthful products at lower cost, it seems your best bet 
to eat healthfully and save money will be to restructure your diet from the 
ground up. And that, the authors of the study note sadly, is a great deal more 
difficult for most people than simply swapping one food for another. BRUCE

NEWS BITES: ET TU, ROMANO?

 U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) figures show that Reggiana 
cattle, the traditional dairy breed in the Parmesan cheese-producing region of 
Reggio-Emilia, are among 53 breeds of livestock in risk of dying out in Italy 
as agricultural production methods change. A spokesman for the consortium of 
Parmesan producers has acknowledged that there are only 1,400 Reggianas left, 
despite efforts by farmers to increase their numbers. The reduction has been 
under way since World War II, the spokesman explained. "Today one uses Dutch 
cows of Canadian stock which produce much more milk, but the quality of 
Parmesan has not suffered," he claimed. "It is compatible with that produced 
from the Reggiana." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelo Paracucchi, one of Italy's best known chefs, disagreed. "It can't be 
identical if one has gone from cows producing 20 litres a day to 60 litres a 
day. This means that one has a less fatty milk with all the consequences that 
follow, including a more watered-down cheese." 
</P>
<P>
 Also said to be threatened is the quality of Italian prosciutto now that the 
Romagnolo pig also has become very rare, with only nine of them alive last 
year. The consortium of prosciutto producers has played down these declines, 
saying they reflected changes in taste: "Consumers are gearing their demand to 
less fatty foods." The Lite of the Milky Way 
</P>
<P>
 Milky Way, the malted milk and caramel chocolate bar, went reduced-calorie a 
couple of years ago with the Milky Way II. Now -- reformulated with 
polydextrose and a triglyceride called caprenin for texture -- there's an even 
lower-calorie version. Containing only 160 calories and half as much fat as 
most chocolate bars, Milky Way Lite is the first candy bar to meet the FDA's 
Nutritional Labeling and Education Act regulations so that it can legally call 
itself Lite. Oh, yeah -- another technique for reducing calories was making it 
only five ounces. Apparently dieters confided that they'd have a better chance 
with a smaller bar. The King of the Jungle Bar 
</P>
<P>
 In essentially unrelated chocolate news, tomorrow Nestle's issues a special 
edition chocolate bar molded with scenes from the Disney cartoon "The Lion 
King." You won't be able to miss it, with its jungle label and gold foil 
wrapping. CHARLES PERRY

GARDEN FRESH; THE WINE-DIPPED LEAVES OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's as though Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and revelry, had taken up 
gardening. He picked his lettuces and dipped them in wine -- from young rose to 
vintage Burgundy. Thus red-leaf lettuces were born. 
</P>
<P>
 Like yellow in tomatoes, blue in potatoes, purple in peppers and black in 
beans, red sets a lettuce apart. But when lettuce is red, it's not one color 
but many. Every hue of green is splattered, marbled or tipped with every hue of 
red. You can forget what you were saying when your eye lights on Merveille des 
Quatre Saisons, its crinkled leaves luscious burgundy, hot pink, lime and 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing I do with each new red lettuce is to serve it on its own, 
simply dressed with mild olive oil, fresh lemon juice, salt and pepper. That's 
the best way to judge its flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I look for ways to enhance its beauty. Although the flavor of red 
lettuces may be mild, you can slip them into a dish meant for cress -- lots of 
freshly ground pepper gives the oomph. Buttermilk soup with finely chopped 
crunchy red lettuce is an example. Sometimes I treat them as a pot herb -- thin 
red ribbons with those of sorrel and chopped parsley stirred into broth.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I mix bunches of ribbons with fettuccine at the table -- lots of garlic and 
cheese -- tossed so fast the leaves barely wilt. In a stir-fry with other 
greens, I add half the red lettuce leaves in large pieces at the end, and then 
-- for special color and crunch -- toss in raw leaves just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not to forget the composed salad -- it's fun putting tasty reds 
together -- perhaps on a bed of torn red lettuce leaves, crescents of ruby 
grapefruit, clusters of red grapes, rings of red onions, leaves of opal basil, 
and crimson nasturtiums glistening with oil and red wine vinegar.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooked until tender-crisp, red lettuces turn mysterious hues. Bunches of red 
romaine tied with string and briefly poached in broth, then baked in a shallow 
dish topped with cheese, are superb. Red crisphead lettuces are terrific 
roughly chopped and cooked uncovered in a heavy skillet with a drizzle of olive 
oil. Use medium heat and stir almost constantly to keep from scorching -- about 
five minutes in all. (The best way for a special red lettuce is to simmer 
ribbons in a little cream then top with fine shreds of Parmigiano Reggiano 
cheese and a dash of freshly grated nutmeg.) 
</P>
<P>
 The one or two offerings of red-leaf lettuces at the supermarket give no hint 
of the wealth of cultivars we can grow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In practical terms, there are four sorts of lettuces, great reds in every one. 
 
</P>
<P>
 * Looseleaf has no curled heart; the leaves gather in a loose rosette. This is 
the easiest type of lettuce to grow.  
</P>
<P>
 * Butterhead lettuces do form a head, but a loose and floppy one -- the leaves 
are velvety and the interior is blanched creamy white. Bibb and Boston 
lettuces, for instance, are butterheads.  
</P>
<P>
 * Romaine (or Cos) lettuce heads grow straight up, the leaves long and narrow 
and stiff. Romaines are the best value among lettuces, being the most 
nourishing and giving the greatest yield for space.  
</P>
<P>
 * Crispheads are what we think of as Iceberg lettuces. They're the slowest to 
mature and most difficult to grow well. Actually, Icebergs are descended from 
Batavians, a European style of crisphead with looser heads and crunchier 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the border, I love Iceland poppies among red lettuces -- the poppies hover 
over them like brilliant butterflies. Red lettuces resemble exotic roses and 
even crisp-heads have an aureole of floppy leaves. The produce man strips off 
these large leaves, but you and I can arrange them on a platter as a leafy 
doily for the fish, or chop them up and add their flavor to a soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Lettuce wants rich, loose, well-draining soil, and full sun where it's cool, 
part shade where it's hot. Summer-grown lettuces need a deep mulch -- straw or 
leaves -- and the soil should be constantly moist but not soggy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the high desert, sow from early autumn through winter. In the hottest parts 
of the interior, you're safest with autumn-sown lettuces. Outdoor sowing time 
then is through summer. Everywhere else in Southern California, traditional 
sowing time is early autumn through spring. But there are ways to coax lettuce 
from summer. 
</P>
<P>
 For hot summer starts, choose heat-resistant cultivars. Loose-leaf lettuces 
are the least likely to go to seed. Lollo Rossa has deeply furled leaves, ice 
green with reddish tips. Red Salad Bowl has leaves like those of oaks in 
autumn. Mascara also has dark red oak leaves that hold their color in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Red Riding Hood is a heat-resistant red butterhead, even redder than Merveille 
des Quatre Saisons. Rosy, a crisphead with leaves tinted red to burgundy, grows 
well in less than ideal conditions. Sierra is a Batavia, bright-green tinged 
bronze-y red. It's famous for keeping its head when everyone around it has 
bolted. Canasta is another Batavia, green leaves dappled red with a mellow 
flavor that is impressive spring through summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lettuce seeds won't germinate when the soil is warmer than 80 degrees, so 
sprinkle a pinch of seeds in a container of soilless mix and put it somewhere 
indoors at about 70 degrees, keeping it moist but not wet. Or you can sprinkle 
seeds in a moist spot outdoors under a thick broad plank. Look under it daily. 
Once the seeds sprout, remove the plank immediately. Give the seedlings 
diffused shade with a propped-up screen or brush of some sort, or move them 
next to pole beans, climbing cucumbers and staked tomatoes. Cage in chicken 
wire against nibbling critters and keep an eye out for slugs and snails. 
</P>
<P>
 If you sow a pinch of seeds every week or two, you won't have to worry about 
lettuce turning bitter as it flowers and goes to seed. You'll always have sweet 
leaves. (Lettuces that start to flower are edible, though. They'll be bitter, 
but just pretend they're chicory.) When seedlings are two inches high, 
transplant or thin them to stand about six inches apart. It's important any 
time of year to pick lettuce young -- whether leaf by leaf from the outside of 
the plant at the base or by taking the whole head. You can pick crispheads and 
Batavias leaf by leaf until they form a head. 
</P>
<P>
 In autumn, sow seeds of butterhead Brune d'Hiver, one of the most beautiful 
and flavorful of lettuces. In cold climates under a floating row cover, it will 
sail through winter, although plants won't grow. Rouge d'Hiver is a loose 
romaine lettuce with gorgeous rosy leaves, tolerant of heat and cold -- one to 
grow most of the year. In the mountains, in the January thaw, scratch seeds of 
butterhead May King into the cold frame, keep them covered, and harvest 
red-tinged leaves the end of spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then in early spring, sow the tender, slightly tangy Merveille, above (aka 
Four Seasons). For a nutted lettuce, grow butterhead Pirat, mottled bronze and 
green. For its endurance as the weather warms, plant crisphead Red Grenoble, 
with sparkling red leaves. Red Sails, a handsome loose leaf, will do well just 
about anywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of these lettuces are crinkled and curled. They need careful rinsing, but 
not much before serving. Drop leaves into a big bowl of warmish water. Change 
waters until there is no sand at the bottom of the bowl. Spin the leaves dry in 
a salad spinner, then refrigerate in a bowl with a damp cloth over them. They 
will keep fresh several hours. Then prepare as desired. 
</P>

 Don't think because berries make the dressing, that this is a woman's luncheon 
sort of salad. Sweet basil, orange juice and freshly ground pepper give it 
snap. When the present flush of strawberries is past, crimson raspberries are 
even more delicious.  
</P>
<P>
 Tangy berries do well with rich flavors, so you might serve the salad beside 
broiled sea bass or halibut steaks garnished with lemon slices, and crispy 
baked shoestring potatoes. A light dry white wine, then pistachio ice cream for 
dessert. The lettuces and the dressing may be prepared several hours in 
advance.  
</P>
<P>
 RED-LEAF LETTUCES WITH SWEET BASIL-BERRY DRESSING 1/2 cup smooth puree of 
fresh strawberries (from about 2/3 cup, hulled) or fresh raspberries (from 
about 1 cup) 3 tablespoons to 1/4 cup fresh orange juice 2 tablespoons oil 1/2 
tablespoon minced fresh sweet basil leaves or 1/2 teaspoon crumbled dried basil 
leaves Salt Freshly ground white pepper 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, 
optional 5 quarts loosely packed red-leaf lettuce torn into large-bite-size 
pieces 
</P>
<P>
 In small pitcher, blend berry puree, orange juice (1/4 cup for strawberries, 3 
tablespoons for raspberries), oil and basil. Season to taste with salt and 
white pepper. If more tartness is desired, add lemon juice to taste. Heap 
lettuce in bowl, preferably glass or contrasting color. Cover dressing and 
lettuce. Chill. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before serving, stir dressing to blend. Then pour over lettuce. Toss with 
hands for gentlest, most thorough mixing. Makes 8 servings.

THE PORTABLE SALMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEV BENNETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On French beaches, where sunbathers don't want to waste a minute of precious 
tanning time, pain bagnat , a hefty sandwich filled with tuna, olives, onions 
and a vinaigrette dressing, is very popular. 
</P>
<P>
 In this country, a portable meal that's more than a little meat between two 
limp pieces of bread is always desirable. It's lunch in a loaf and a great 
alternative to juggling several food packets and dishes for outings. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a cue from the French, I recommend deluxe salmon salad sandwiches. The 
recipe is special, starting with homemade bread and including freshly cooked 
salmon and the pungent addition of capers and olives. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have time to bake your own bread, buy two good, crusty half-pound 
loaves. Another shortcut: Either start with fresh salmon steaks or use canned 
salmon. The sandwich itself takes minutes to assemble. DELUXE SALMON SALAD 
SANDWICHES 1 tablespoon capers 8 kalamata olives, pitted and chopped 12 cherry 
tomatoes, quartered 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large shallot, minced Juice 1/2 
lemon 8 large basil leaves, shredded 2 cups flaked, cooked salmon Salt, pepper 
2 loaves Homemade Bread 
</P>
<P>
 Combine capers, olives, tomatoes, oil, shallot, lemon juice and basil leaves 
in large bowl. Stir gently but well. Add salmon and toss. Season to taste with 
salt and pepper. Set aside 30 minutes for flavors to blend. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, cut each loaf of Homemade Bread in half. Scoop out some of inside 
dough to create cavity. Pack each with half of salmon salad. Makes 2 large 
sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : To serve as luncheon dish, spoon salmon salad onto 2 plates and pass 
bread on side.  
</P>
<P>
 If desired, grill or poach 2 medium salmon steaks. For poaching use 
combination of half white wine and half water to cover fish. Or, use 1 
(1-pound) can salmon. Remove bones and drain well. 
</P>
<P>
 HOMEMADE BREAD 1 tablespoon active dry yeast (slightly more than 1 envelope) 2 
to 2 1/4 cups bread flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 1/4 cups 
room-temperature water 1/3 cup whole-wheat flour 1 to 2 tablespoons cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
 Combine yeast, 1 cup bread flour, salt, sugar and water in bowl of heavy-duty 
electric mixer. Beat hard 2 minutes with flat beater. Add whole-wheat flour. 
Beat hard 2 minutes longer. Change to dough hook. Gradually add remaining 1 to 
1 1/4 cups bread flour and beat to form soft but not sticky dough. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover dough with dish towel. Set aside at room temperature 4 hours, punching 
dough down about once per hour. When rising time is finished, punch dough down 
once more. Divide dough into 2 portions. Shape into 2 round loaves. Place on 
baking sheet dusted with cornmeal. Cover with dish towel and set aside to rise 
at room temperature 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 450 degrees 10 minutes. Spray loaves with water. Reduce heat to 350 
degrees and bake until light and crusty outside and browned on bottom, about 15 
minutes longer. Cool breads on wire rack. Makes 2 loaves.

GOOD COOKING: DRESSING UP THE PICNIC TABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like barbecues, picnics give the impression of having come together all by 
themselves. Of course, we know they really don't, but the illusion is 
important. So consider the three recipes that follow -- basic picnic foods that 
can be varied with seasonal vegetable salads and fresh fruits as the summer 
drifts on.  
</P>
<P>
 Firm, pale-green picholine olives are great for nibbling unadorned but even 
better when marinated with orange zest and herbs. Pates are carefully made meat 
loaves, weighted down as they cool to make a very compact texture that slices 
neatly and easily. Take along crusty bread and a choice of mustards and crisp 
tart pickles ( cornichons ) to go with this ground turkey pate. 
</P>
<P>
 Chocolate cake is everybody's favorite; the problem is getting the cake to 
survive, so that it doesn't become too soft and gooey in the warm weather. The 
thin, moist truffle cake fills the bill; it has a deep chocolate flavor, so it 
needs no frosting, just a dusting of powdered sugar on top. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on how many are in your party, cheeses and more cold meats can be 
added to the picnic basket. These recipes can be prepared several days ahead 
(the cake freezes very well) to make the last-minute preparations and purchases 
easier to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If picholine olives are difficult to find in your area, substitute other green 
or mild black olives with pits. The stripper gadget is a companion to the 
zester; it removes the zest in ridged strips. Otherwise, use a sharp 
swivel-bladed vegetable peeler.  
</P>
<P>
 ORANGE HERBED PICHOLINE OLIVES 2 cups picholine olives 1/2 teaspoon dried 
oregano 1/2 teaspoon thyme 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon orange 
juice Zest 1 large navel orange, removed with stripper 
</P>
<P>
 Combine olives, oregano, thyme, olive oil, orange juice and orange zest. Mix 
well. Refrigerate, well covered, at least 3 days or as long as 2 weeks. Serve 
at room temperature. Makes 2 cups.

<P>
 In this pate, ground turkey has been substituted for the customary veal. The 
pa te should be made about three days in advance, so the flavors have a chance 
to blend.  
</P>
<P>
 COUNTRY PATE 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large onion, minced 4 large cloves 
garlic, minced 5 slices bacon (apple-wood smoked, preferred) 2 tablespoons soft 
bread crumbs 3 tablespoons minced parsley 3 tablespoons snipped chives 3/4 
pound ground lean pork 1 pound ground turkey 1/4 cup Cognac 1 large egg 2 large 
egg whites 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme 1/4 teaspoon dried 
oregano 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon 
ground cinnamon Dijon mustard Cornichons Thinly sliced rustic baguette bread 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in medium non-stick skillet. When hot, add onion and garlic. Cook 
until tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to 4-cup bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Mince 2 slices bacon in processor with metal blade or by hand. Add to onion 
mixture along with bread crumbs, parsley, chives, pork, turkey, Cognac, egg, 
egg whites, salt, thyme, oregano, allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon. Mix with 
wooden spoon until well combined. In skillet saute small bit of mixture to 
taste for seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoon pate mixture into greased 3-cup terrine mold or baking dish lined with 
parchment paper. Bang pan down several times to eliminate air bubbles. Top with 
reserved bacon slices, arranged in single layer. Cover tightly with foil. Put 
terrine in pan slightly larger than terrine dish. Set on oven rack. Carefully 
pour in hot water to reach half way up sides of dish.  
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 350 degrees 2 1/2 hours. Remove from water bath. Cool on rack, 
weighting pate down (brick or large stone wrapped in foil works well). Chill 
(still weighting down until well chilled) at least 2 days, before serving. Can 
be made 4 days ahead and refrigerated, or can be frozen 3 months. Serve 
chilled, thinly sliced, with mustard, cornichons and thinly sliced bread. Makes 
1 (7-inch) loaf, about 8 to 10 servings.

 This cake bakes into a thin, dense and moist layer. It slices neatly into 
small portions for guests who just want a taste.  
</P>
<P>
 MOIST TRUFFLE CAKE 1/2 cup unsalted butter 3 ounces semisweet chocolate 2 
tablespoons unsweetened cocoa (preferably Dutch-processed) 4 large eggs, 
separated 3/4 cup sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons water Dash salt 2 teaspoons vanilla 
1/4 cup cake flour 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 1 tablespoon powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter with chocolate and cocoa in microwave oven or stove top in double 
boiler. Transfer to mixing bowl to cool slightly.  
</P>
<P>
 Use mixer to whip egg yolks, sugar, water, salt and vanilla on high speed 2 
minutes. Add chocolate mixture on low speed, then flour. 
</P>
<P>
 Whip egg whites and cream of tartar in clean mixing bowl until they hold soft, 
moist peaks. Thoroughly mix in 1/4 of egg whites into cake batter. Gently fold 
in remaining whites. Transfer to greased (8-inch) springform pan, bottom lined 
with greased foil and floured. Wrap outside of springform with foil to 
eliminate any leakage. 
</P>

EXOTIC FRUIT; THE FRUITS OF HOME; MEMORIES: AMERICANS MAY CRAVE THE 
STRAWBERRIES AND PEACHES OF SUMMER, BUT PEOPLE FROM TROPICAL COUNTRIES YEARN 
FOR CHERIMOYAS, TAMARINDOS AND THE SPIKY FRUIT CALLED DURIAN.

 " Sumptuous baskets of fruit: manga-espada, carlota, custard apple, and 
itiuba, manga-rosa, sapotes, sapodillas, hog plums, Malay apples, cashew fruit, 
Surinam cherries, jambos, Chinese gooseberries, 11 types of banana, and slices 
of pineapple and watermelon. " -- Jorge Amado, "The War of the Saints" 
</P>
<P>
 My friend Nancy Zubiri says that if she were asked to choose three foods 
before dying, one of them would be a mango. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wouldn't be just any mango. Sweet Mexican mangoes are common in Los 
Angeles, but you cannot find the dozen or so varieties that abound in tropical 
climates. There is no place in Southern California where you can walk down 
streets lined with mango trees, where the fruit is so abundant that its smell 
permeates the air as it lies rotting on the ground because there's just too 
much to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 And, says Zubiri, mangoes in Southern California just don't taste like the 
ones in her native Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor like the ones in Brazil, says Lea Beatriz Zaguri. "We had so many types of 
mangoes," she says wistfully, reminiscing about a variety called the Carlotinha 
, the "little Carlota," which is "very, very small, very, very sweet and very, 
very juicy." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Philippines, says Fay Cabanada, the mangoes grown in her family's mango 
plantation were also "very, very juicy, but with little fiber, elongated and 
yellow," but try as she might, she just can't get them to grow the same way 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We all yearn for the foods we grew up with: Americans have a yen for freshly 
baked apple pie, Fourth of July corn on the cob, hamburgers on the grill. For 
those who grew up in other lands, the longing is often for those fruits that 
may have been taken for granted because of their abundance, but maddeningly 
enough, are difficult to find -- if at all -- in this country where everything 
else seems to be available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strawberries, raspberries, nectarines and cherries, those were exotic to me 
when I was growing up," says Tuni Szpiro, a Colombian who has lived in Los 
Angeles for eleven years.  
</P>
<P>
 "But now, do you know what I'd like the most? A jugo de lulo ( lulo shake), 
just blended, with all that green foam, like a green cappuccino. Ay, that would 
be heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 But the tart lulo , greenish-yellow outside, pulpy green inside and used 
mostly for milk or water shakes, is impossible to find fresh in Los Angeles. It 
is also next to impossible to find the Javanese salak or snakeskin fruit, the 
Philippine lanzone , the Thai rambutan , or the Brazilian caju  
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many fruits over there," says Ivan Tekawy, a Java native who 
runs Bali Place, a restaurant in West L.A. "Now I can't remember them all 
anymore."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort not to forget, people from other countries flock to ethnic 
markets and farmers markets throughout the area, sometimes finding fruits they 
thought they would never see again, but which, seemingly by some miracle, have 
appeared on the stands for one day. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more, fruits from other lands are showing up in regular markets -- 
cherimoya , passion fruit, pepino and feijoa , for instance. And when people 
don't find the real thing, there are always frozen and canned fruits, which are 
imported liberally because they are free from insect infestation. But alas, 
they never taste quite as good.  
</P>
<P>
 The alternatives are better than none, but they are still a poor substitute 
for people like Steven Lam; he cherishes memories of his grandmother giving him 
fresh fruit after his daily afternoon naps in the sweltering heat of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Fruit, says 18-year-old Lam, a recent graduate of Santa Monica High School, is 
one of the reasons he goes back to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing I eat when I get home is fruit," he says. "I love fruit. 
Every time I go back, I get off the plane and my grandparents have bought me a 
basket of litchi." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are fresh litchi, of course, not the canned variety we're used to 
getting at most Chinese restaurants. Real litchi has a pink thin shell that 
cracks easily to expose the whitish, grape-like fruit inside. It is sometimes 
available in Los Angeles in Asian markets, but its cousin, the smaller longan , 
almost never is. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a longan tree in our back yard (in Vietnam)," he says. "Actually, it 
wasn't our tree, it was the neighbor's, but the branches went over so we picked 
them," he adds, laughing. "The skin is brown, and you don't have to peel it, 
you just press it, and the fruit pops out and you suck it. My parents get it 
frozen in Little Saigon, but it's nowhere compared to the fresh ones."  
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Lam, his favorite fruit, the notorious durian, is found in 
Southern California. But one has to hurry to the Thai markets when a durian 
shipment comes in; they often sell out in a day, despite the fact that the big, 
spiky fruit -- expensive in its native habitat -- is outrageous here, costing 
up to $40 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered a delicacy in most Southeast Asian countries, durian is best known 
for its extremely pungent smell, so strong and -- for many people -- so 
offensive that in many Asian countries it is not allowed on trains and planes 
or in posh hotel rooms. But the smell is not a deterrent to its advocates, who 
swear by its custardy texture and peculiar taste, a mixture of sweet vanilla 
and cooked onions. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy fruit, which is found throughout Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and 
the Philippines, grows in a tree similar to the elm and falls to the ground 
when ripe. This could be a problem for potential passers-by, who could get 
knocked unconscious by the force of a six-pound durian falling on their heads. 
Fortunately, says Lam, "My parents say durian falls only at night, so they 
don't hurt anyone when they fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Lam, of course, is a staunch durian fan whose mother regularly makes durian 
shakes for dinner (made with frozen durian pieces and milk) and who is amused 
when his American friends complain about the durian smell ("What is that?" they 
ask disgustedly when the Lam family buys fresh durian and loads it in the car). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Vaughn's husband wasn't so charitable. "The first time I bought fresh 
durian here and took it home, my husband freaked out," says the Thailand native 
who now works in Los Angeles' Bangluck Market. "He said it smelled like someone 
had died." Durian used to be Vaughn's favorite fruit, but now she finds it "too 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she longs for fresh rambutan, the litchi-tasting fruit that on the 
outside looks like a hairy flower. "Last time I went to Thailand, I bought 
about four pounds and ate them in one day," recalls Vaughn with a smile. Here 
she settles for the canned rambutan, sold in virtually all Asian markets, and 
as far as fresh fruit goes, she indulges in her other passion: green mango. 
</P>
<P>
 When I tell her that in Colombia green, tart mangoes are eaten with salt, she 
brightens up. In Thailand, she explains, green mango is eaten with different 
dips. One is a mixture of sugar, salt and red chile. The other, her favorite, 
is a mixture of fish sauce, chile, sugar, red onion and dried shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
 For a minute I think I've misunderstood. Fish sauce and sugar? It sounds 
pretty awful. "No, no," she says. "Let me bring you some." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn requests the dips from the little kitchen alongside the market, where 
she works as head cashier, and in a few minutes I have a plate full of sliced 
green mango and the two dips. I try it tentatively. They're hot. They're 
delicious. They're even better than with just salt -- and I tell her so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She smiles modestly. "We eat the green guava slices with the same dips," she 
explains. "In Thailand, there are always little carts in the street that sell 
fruit and have the dips." 
</P>
<P>
 Little fruit-vending carts, it seems, are the most common of sights in all 
tropical countries, regardless of the latitude. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colombia, that's also where Tuni Szpiro would get her coconuts and green 
mangoes. "Coconuts here," she states, "don't taste like coconuts. The coconuts 
they sell in the streets back home, those are real coconuts!" But when she gets 
a craving for green mango, something that happened periodically during her 
pregnancy, she rushes to a local Thai market. 
</P>
<P>
 Szpiro has, in fact, scouted all the locations in the L.A. area where tropical 
fruits might be available, and she regularly finds one thing or another. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first moved here, there were no fruits, but in the past three to five 
years, I've found guavas, feijoas (also known as pineapple guavas), cherimoyas 
and even guanabanas. " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, says Karen Caplan, president of Frieda's Inc., a company that 
imports exotic fruit, many of those fruits that seem readily available only now 
have been around for more than 20 years. Frieda's supplies major supermarkets 
with horned melon, feijoa , passion fruit, Asian pears and cherimoyas, among a 
huge selection of fruits, most of them imported from New Zealand.  
</P>
<P>
 One fruit she does not stock, however, is the guanabana , or soursop, a large 
cousin of the cherimoya, with similar texture and seeds, but with a much tarter 
flavor. This makes it a candidate for water- or milk-based shakes, or vitaminas 
, as they are known in Brazil. They're jugos (juices) in Colombia, batidos in 
Cuba or simply licuados throughout most Latin American countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Colombia, jugos are an obligation," says Szpiro. "Every day, you have 
fresh jugos , at all hours. Jugo de lulo , maracuya (passion fruit), mora (a 
cousin of the blackberry). All day long, that blender goes vroom , vroom !" 
</P>
<P>
 Although Szpiro can readily find her favorite jugo fruits, passion fruit and 
tamarillo , she never makes jugos with them. At $1 a pop for each tiny maracuya 
, a glass of juice is just too expensive. Instead, she eats them alone -- 
they're sweeter here than in Colombia, she says -- and she looks for her juices 
in other places. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've noticed is that in many of those smoothie stands at the beach or in 
the malls, they make our same jugos , only the fruits are different. I always 
ask them not to put in yogurt or ice cream, just milk or water, and they're 
delicious." 
</P>
<P>
 Lea Beatriz Zaguri, who grew up in Brazil drinking vitaminas -- so called 
because they're rich in vitamins -- also finds that smoothies are a good 
substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Here every morning I make shakes with banana and milk, pineapple or papaya," 
she says. It's her way of eating fruit at least once a day. "Of course," she 
adds, "In Rio we eat fruit all the time. On every corner there's a stand to 
make shakes, and all the fruits are placed against the wall. You pick your 
fruit and they make your vitamina ." 
</P>
<P>
 Her favorite is an avocado ( abacate ) smoothie, made with milk and sugar. An 
unlikely combination for many palates. "The first time I went to Mexico I asked 
for an abacate shake with sugar and they said 'Are you crazy?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her request is less likely to get laughed at in Los Angeles, where many Asian 
-- especially Indonesian -- restaurants serve avocado smoothies, mixed with 
coconut and sometimes jackfruit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Philippines, halfway across the globe from Zaguri's birthplace, Fay 
Cabanada also grew up on jackfruit and many of the same fruits as Zaguri, 
sometimes even calling them by the same name: the little siriguelas , which 
grow in very hot areas and must be eaten straight from the tree almost the 
minute they ripen; the anonas , which in Brazil is called fruta de conde , 
count's fruit, and is similar to a cherimoya but has spiky skin; and the many 
types of mangoes and bananas.  
</P>
<P>
 While most people are content looking in stores for their favorite fruits, 
Cabanada has gone a step beyond: She grows fruit in her own back yard. "I try 
to look for fruits around here that are similar to the ones back home," she 
says. "I have banana trees at my house . . . lemon trees, Santa Rosa plums, the 
big grapefruit we call pomelo and Japanese persimmon, although that isn't from 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Her newly planted cherimoyas are not from home either, surprisingly enough. 
Cabanada discovered them in the States and eats them as a substitute for the 
similar-tasting apis , a cross between the sweetness of the cherimoya and the 
sourness of the sour-sop. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some fruits, however, have no substitute. "We have a fruit called lanzone , 
which grows in clusters. The skin is a bit thicker than a grape, and inside 
it's white and translucent, like a small plum," she explains. "I haven't even 
seen them preserved here." 
</P>
<P>
 There's really nothing much you can do when you're yearning for a fruit that 
can't be found, except yearn some more or forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't long for fruits here very much," says Zaguri. "During the summer 
I do, but even then, not like back home. Maybe it's because life and fruits are 
more sensual there." 
</P>
<P>
 In "The War of the Saints," Brazilian novelist Jorge Amado writes about the 
"intoxicating aroma of fruit . . . the smell of ripe jackfruit." 
</P>
<P>
 Zaguri's recollection of that same smell is similar: "There's a big park in 
Rio near the city, with a lot of plants and water, and you find jaca , 
jackfruit, all along the way," she says. "And when it falls to the ground, it 
releases this incredible smell, this strong, wonderful smell." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the smell of home. 
</P>
<P>

 This isn't the sort of flan most of us are familiar with -- more a mousse than 
a caramelized custard. But it is delicious. There are two ways to make the 
dessert: frozen so it takes on the consistency of an Italian semifreddo and 
makes a wonderfully cool summer treat, especially with the creme Anglaise, or 
set in the refrigerator where it becomes a light, mousse-like-dessert.  
</P>
<P>
 Fresh or prepared mango pulp can be used. If you use fresh, peel the mango, 
puree it in a food processor or blender, then strain the puree. If you find 
mango pulp in bottles (at many supermarkets and Latino grocers), simply puree 
the pulp in a food processor or blender; you don't need to strain it.  
</P>
<P>
 MANGO "FLAN" 1/2 cup boiling water 1 1/2 tablespoons unflavored gelatin 2 egg 
whites 1/2 cup sugar 1 1/2 cups pureed mango pulp 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream 
Creme Anglaise, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Pour boiling water over gelatin in bowl and let dissolve. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Place egg whites in mixing bowl and beat until firm. Continue to beat, 
gradually adding sugar. Beat to soft peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir together pureed mango, cream and dissolved gelatin in bowl until well 
blended. Gently fold in sweetened egg whites. 
</P>
<P>
 If flan is to set in refrigerator, place mixture in 1 (4-cup) souffle mold. 
Refrigerate several hours. Serve with Creme Anglaise. 
</P>
<P>
 If flan is to freeze in freezer, place mixture in 1 (9-inch) loaf pan. Freeze 
several hours. Serve with Creme Anglaise. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving, without Creme Anglaise, contains about: 129 calories; 19 mg 
sodium; 21 mg cholesterol; 6 grams fat; 18 grams carbohydrates; 2 grams 
protein; 0.26 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Creme Anglaise 1 1/2 cups milk 1/2 vanilla bean 3 egg yolks 1/2 cup sugar

 Heat milk and vanilla bean in heavy-bottomed saucepan just to boiling point. 
While milk heats, whisk egg yolks and sugar in bowl until light and fluffy. Add 
small amount of hot milk mixture to yolk mixture and whisk thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly pour egg mixture into hot milk, whisking constantly. Heat over low heat 
until mixture coats back of spoon. Do not allow mixture to boil. Strain and 
chill. Makes about 2 cups.

 Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and 
recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. Commercial egg substitutes that 
have been pasturized may be used in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances. 
Check egg substitute package for applications.

 This tasty and simple dish is a Caribbean staple that can be eaten as a 
dessert or as part of a main meal. The combination of salty cheese and sweet 
ripe plantain is delicious.  
</P>
<P>
 ABORRAJADOS 4 ripe plantains Oil 1/4 pound cotija cheese or other white salty 
cheese 2 eggs, beaten 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 4 tablespoons 
flour Guava paste, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Peel plantains and slice diagonally. Place oil, 1/4 inch up sides, in large 
saute pan and heat. Add plantain slices and fry until golden. Remove plantains 
and pound gently between pieces of wax paper to flatten. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut cheese into pieces small enough to fit on top of plantain slices. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Mix eggs with baking soda, salt and 2 tablespoons flour in bowl to make 
batter. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil for frying in large saute pan or deep-fryer. 
</P>
<P>
 Make "sandwich" by placing slice of cheese on top of 1 plantain. Smear cheese 
with guava paste and top with second plantain. Press sandwich together to seal. 
Sprinkle with flour, dip in batter and fry in oil until golden. Repeat with 
remaining plantain slices and cheese. Makes about 20 sandwiches. 
</P>

 If you can't find fresh passion fruit, you can use bottled or frozen pulp. You 
can even substitute other fruits, such as lulo, curuba or mango pulp. No matter 
what, you should get a beautifully colored, light and tasty dessert. To get the 
pulp out of fresh passion fruits, simply open the hard shells and scoop out the 
pulp.  
</P>
<P>
 PASSION FRUIT MOUSSE 3/4 cup passion fruit pulp (equivalent to about 10 
passion fruits) 1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin 2 tablespoons cold water 1/2 
cup boiling water 6 egg whites 1 cup sugar Creme Anglaise, optional

 In tropical countries, especially during the summer, shakes are everyday 
refreshments. Milk- or water-based, they're easy to make and can be done with 
virtually any fruit. You can use frozen tropical fruit pulp (lulo, passion 
fruit, guava, tamarillo, guanabana, tamarind) or fresh fruit such as pineapple, 
papaya, mango, cantaloupe or strawberries mashed into pulp.  
</P>
<P>
 The amount of sugar you add will depend on the natural sweetness of the fruit 
you use. Always taste before adding sugar.  
</P>
<P>
 TROPICAL FRUIT SHAKE 1 part fruit pulp 2 parts water or milk Ice Sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Place fruit pulp, water, ice and sugar to taste in blender. Process until 
frothy.

 It's impossible to list all the ethnic markets in Southern California where 
exotic fruits are sold. What follows is just a sampling of places to buy fruits 
from tropical zones. 
</P>
<P>
 * Major Supermarkets: Lucky's, Ralph's, Von's, Gelson's, Bristol Farms stock 
fruit imported by Frieda's, Inc. Gelson's has quite a large selection that 
includes passion fruit, cherimoya, tamarillo , pepinos , horned melons, feijoa 
, kumquats, Asian pears and different types of bananas. All market chains carry 
plantains and fresh coconut. Locations throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * Latino Markets: Most stock "Mexican" papaya (the large variety of papaya) in 
addition to green and ripe mangoes and a large array of bananas and plantains. 
Depending on the season, some markets occasionally carry misperos , cherimoyas 
and passion fruit. Many also carry frozen fruit pulp of more common fruits and 
of fruits not easily found fresh here, including guanabana , lulo , tamarind 
and curuba . Addresses of a few locations follow: 
</P>
<P>

EXOTIC FRUIT; IT'S RARE, IT'S EXOTIC, IT'S FROM GRANADA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Silber still likes to talk about his first tropical fruit. In fact, he 
and his wife Tina named their Granada Hills nursery after it. And he has a 
photo album documenting his success with the babaco (pronounced ba-BAH-co) 
papaya. 
</P>
<P>
 In the album are many pictures of Silber, Zsa Zsa Gabor and babacos at a gala 
tropical-fruit event. In some of the pictures, Zsa Zsa holds the oblong green 
fruit, the size and shape of a skinny, fluted football. Silber says of Zsa Zsa: 
"She looks good there -- she's 70 years old, except, as you can see, she's 
fat." 
</P>
<P>
 About the babaco, however, Silber has nothing but good things to say. "Such an 
interesting fruit," he exclaims. "It's aromatic and tastes like a cross between 
a banana and a pineapple, only not as sweet. It needs sugar, but that's OK. You 
can't add flavor or aroma to a fruit, but you can add sugar. And there's no 
waste with the babaco. It has no seeds and you can eat the skin. The plant is 
compact, but it's a big producer." 
</P>
<P>
 In another photo album, there are pictures of award-winning babaco pies and 
cakes and savory dishes that Tina created. When sliced, the deep-yellow babaco 
makes a pretty star shape with a hollow center that Tina often fills with 
deep-purple passion fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the babaco is only one of 65 rare and exotic plant species the 
Silbers propagate and grow at the Papaya Tree Nursery. This 
nursery/demonstration orchard is located in the yard around the Silbers' white 
and gold-ocher ranch-style home. There is no sign outside, but those with an 
eye for unusual flora won't find the place difficult to spot. In a neighborhood 
of lawns and shade trees and rose bushes, the Silbers' is the only house 
surrounded by caper bushes, Persian mulberries, banana trees, tropical guavas 
and mango trees, with white bags covering the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 David Silber, now in his 50s, gave up engineering at the peak of his career to 
raise rare tropical and sub-tropical plants. "I'm a kind of guy who likes to do 
his own thing," he says. Deeply tanned, with curly silver hair and lively blue 
eyes, Silber greets his customers in gym shorts and a sweat shirt cut off way 
above the waist. He wears a toothpick behind his ear. He's cheerful, chatty, 
philosophical, uninhibited -- in the middle of a conversation, he's likely to 
squat down suddenly and rock on his toes to stretch his troublesome back.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I like plants," he says. "We were vegetable growers before, but all this 
started 14 years ago, when a neighbor gave us some cherimoya and guava plants 
-- offbeat things. I joined the California Rare Fruit Growers, a club that 
provides information to growers. I'm a contributing editor with them now -- I 
used to be a reader." 
</P>
<P>
 In the kitchen, Silber slices off a wedge of pepino dulce , a pale-orange 
heart-shaped fruit with fuzzy purple stripes that has suffered, says Silber, 
from absolutely no promotion. Juicy, vaguely sweet, the pepino dulce tastes 
like a melon and is related to the tomato. "It's good marinated in orange juice 
or served with prosciutto," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 A scrub jay flies into the adjacent lanai , perches on a basket handle and 
stares expectantly at Silber. Silber calmly shakes chopped nuts from a can and 
scatters them on the TV tray near the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 As the jay eats his nuts, I'm given a chunk of ice cream banana, also called a 
blue Java, a thick, waxy-looking fruit that -- although not as sweet as tiny 
supermarket manzano bananas -- does indeed have good flavor and a dense, creamy 
texture. Silber next cuts into a purple passion fruit, which is commercially 
grown in Hawaii. The dark center looks like inky tapioca and has a very strong, 
very rich, slightly fetid flavor. Silber explains, "It's used only as a 
condiment -- it's too strong to eat by itself." 
</P>
<P>
 To counter the passion fruit, there's the creamy, smooth, sweet white sapote 
from Mexico. "Mix it with ice, milk, a little sugar and you have an excellent 
milk shake," says Silber. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we leave the kitchen to tour the grounds, there's a slice of Dorset 
golden apple, a handsome, well-shaped yellow fruit with attractive, blushing 
shoulders, a beguiling crispness and friendly sweet taste. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In general, Silber searches out high-quality, large-fruited species that grow 
well in Southern California. "Once I find a species, I develop mass propagation 
techniques, although mass, in my case, is probably seven or eight plants." 
Silber laughs. "I'm inquisitive. More so than average. I want to know things. 
I'm in a restaurant shaking pepper on my food and I think, 'Where does pepper 
come from? A tree? A bush?' A vine, I find out. I do some research. I got some 
vines, but I killed them. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The Silbers' yard is a pleasant mixture of orchard and nursery. There's a 
small, tidy greenhouse and shade rooms for seedlings, cuttings and grafted 
cultivars. Throughout the yard, rows of trees and bushes in black plastic pots 
are clearly marked and priced. Trees, bushes and vines firmly rooted in the 
ground provide living proof that these rare and exotic species do indeed thrive 
in Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 "The good thing about having a home demonstration orchard as well as a 
nursery," Silber says, "is that customers can see what the plant looks like and 
what the fruit tastes like. Also, we sell the fruit at certified farmers 
markets, so that's another source of income. And the orchard's a source of 
food: We eat the fruit. And we eat a lot of fruit, all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 Silber grows a productive Florida mango called Edward in containers; Edward, 
he claims, is one of the world's best mangoes. We also pause before a 
California mango named Thompson, whose branches are loaded. "Look at those 
fruitskies," says Silber. 
</P>
<P>
 We are joined intermittently on our tour by Tina, who gives cooking and 
preparation advice, and the scrub jay, who alights on nearby branches and 
flicks his tail to get our attention. 
</P>
<P>
 I learn that the gray-green, spoon-sized fruit I'd known all my life as a 
guava is the Brazilian fruit called feijoa . When the Silbers speak of guavas, 
they're referring to large tropical varieties whose fruits ripen in the fall 
and come in three colors -- white, "Red Indian" and magenta -- and weigh up to 
a pound. "With green guavas," Tina says, "I make an American 'apple' pie that's 
just delicious. With ripe fruit, I make nectar with a little lemon juice, sugar 
and water. You can freeze the pulp." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The front yard is dominated by a large olive tree. Silber uses its limbs as 
support for three types of pitahaya plants. The pitahaya plants look like 
skinny, vine-like cacti; the fruit is smooth, petaled, not unlike a 
prickle-free cross between a prickly pear and an artichoke, only fluorescent 
red; inside, its berry-like meat is a deep-hot fuchsia. 
</P>
<P>
 The first fruit of the spring grows nearby on a large, dark and furry-leafed 
bushy tree: Big Jim loquats, the Silbers claim, grow as large as baseballs and 
taste like cherimoyas.  
</P>
<P>
 Also in the front yard are Persian mulberries, the pepino dulces (whose bushes 
do look like a cross between a tomato and a pepper), and Oro Blanco grapefruit 
from southeast Asia that both Tina and David Silber insist is the world's best 
grapefruit. 
</P>
<P>
 On the side of the house, in raised beds, the Silbers grow six kinds of 
bananas that they believe are particularly well adapted to our Southern 
California climate: apple, Ice Cream, Dwarf Jamaican Red, Dwarf Brazilian, 
Dwarf Orinoco and Raja Puri, an Indian banana. Big clumps of hanging fruit are 
wrapped in blue plastic to protect them from the sun -- the San Fernando Valley 
lacks the leaf cover of tropical forests. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back yard, longan and lychee trees grow under shade cloth along with 
allspice trees ( pimentas ), which are native to Jamaica. David crumples up a 
leaf. It smells like spice cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Surinam cherries, of which Silber seems quite fond, are adorably and perfectly 
fluted. They start out a tangerine orange and ripen into classic, black-red 
cherry-ness and look as pretty as something you'd pin on a hat. They don't 
taste much like cherries, but have a thick, almost swampy flavor -- and they 
don't hold up well in cooking: You can't make a pie from them, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grumichama, a Brazilian cherry, is, according to Silber, even better than 
Bing: wine-y. But there are only a few on a plant and a potential customer is 
coming in the afternoon, so we'll have to take his word for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Silber stops to sing the praises of Acerola cherries, originally from 
Barbados: "They're the best source for Vitamin C. Put them in full sun. You'll 
get a lot of cherries, five crops a year. You can eat them fresh; they're sweet 
and delicious." 
</P>
<P>
 Another item Silber likes to promote is the Miracle Fruit, a berry that, when 
chewed, makes acidic things, such as yogurt or lemon, taste sweet. "It's 
physiological," Silber explains. And, indeed, it works, only the sweetness is 
less like sugar and more like saccharin, and it lingers long after the thrill 
of sucking sweet lemons wears off -- about an hour. Better yet, suck an actual 
sweet lemon, originally from Persia and now available in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Silber's back begins to act up, and he gets's a bit tired. Tina, 
watering nearby, is keeping a concerned eye on him. But the man's interest in 
his work is virtually irrepressible. He talks on with enthusiasm, about 
grafting, about watering (bananas, and indeed, most tropicals, says Silber, 
require twice the water of citrus). He talks about his passion for plumerias, 
those beautiful waxy flowers so popularized by Hawaiian leis, and about the 
idiosyncrasies he encounters in propagating and caring for each plant. "Every 
tropical is a different story," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One last question: What is he working on now? 
</P>
<P>
 Silber frowns and removes the toothpick from behind his ear. "Sapodillas or 
Chicos from South America," he says. "star fruit from India. Pawpaw from the 
American South." (he sings a song about the pawpaw patch, then explains that 
pawpaws are "like cherimoyas, only better, and they've found an anti-cancer 
drug in the bark of the tree." 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks some more. "Tree tomatoes or tamarillos . Pitahayas . Oh, and 
Chinese mulberries." He pulls out another photograph album and shows me 
pictures of fruit that look like small clumps of rose-red brains. "I sold them 
at the farmers market and people came back for more," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 He thinks some more. "Pineapples. Jack fruit. Egg fruit or canistel. 
Pistachios. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The list, he acknowledges, could go on forever. 
</P>
<P>

IN THE KITCHEN; RATATOUILLE: GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So far, my pampered, cosseted vegetable plants have produced neither tomatoes 
nor peppers nor eggplants. But I have tuned up the grill and barbecued a few 
dinners, meaning it's time for ratatouille. The garden will just have to catch 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, few things match the taste of grilled meat quite as well as this 
changeable vegetable stew. A little smoky, a little sweet, its melting 
tenderness plays well against the crisp char of a good steak or grilled 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 It's great summer food for reasons beyond taste. One of the things I like best 
about ratatouille is the way it mutates from dinner to dinner, depending on 
what ratios of vegetables and herbs are at hand and how I feel when I'm cooking 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is clean-out-the-fridge food. If I have a lot of zucchini, then the 
ratatouille will be firmer and sweeter. If there's more eggplant, it's softer 
and smokier. It's rare that I have too many peppers -- any surplus usually 
winds up being grilled, peeled and stored covered with oil -- but if I happen 
to have green or yellow instead of red peppers, they go in the dish and the 
final result changes subtly with the substitution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same with herbs. I think there should always be some parsley and 
probably some basil as well, but really, I use whatever I have in the garden. 
My ratatouille underwent a make-over when I moved a few years ago. I threw a 
couple of stems of a big bush that I thought was Greek oregano in the pan, but 
it turned out it was marjoram instead. What the heck, I like it anyway. Another 
time, I added summer savory just to see what that was like. It was good too. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a ratatouille that I make when I'm in a hurry -- cook the onions, then 
the eggplant, then peppers, zucchini and tomatoes all in the same pot. Then 
there's the ratatouille I make when time is on my side. That's the one I like 
the best and -- since it's little more trouble to make a double or triple 
recipe -- I invariably wind up with enough for two or three meals. 
</P>
<P>
 I make this extended version of ratatouille by cooking each ingredient 
separately, then combining them for a final simmer. This way, each vegetable 
keeps some of its identity, making for a more varied and colorful stew. At 
least, that's how I figure it. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought it was my idea -- that's also the way I cook vegetables to go with 
stews and boiled dinners -- but it turns out it's been all over the place and I 
just never noticed. In fact, in Richard Olney's new cookbook, "Lulu's Provencal 
Table" (HarperCollins: 1994; $35), there is a ratatouille built along these 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are a couple of differences: Olney -- or more accurately, Lulu Peyraud, 
whose recipes he's brought to print -- grills the peppers first and then cooks 
the final melange for more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Grilling the peppers I can go for; not so the long cooking. While some people 
like ratatouille to be a jammy, almost spreading consistency, I like mine with 
some tooth left and a little textural diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 But hey, with a dish like this, fix it however you want. It's summer and 
there's no sense getting worked up over something this good. RATATOUILLE Olive 
oil 1 yellow onion, coarsely chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced Salt Freshly 
ground pepper 1 1/2 pounds eggplant 3 sweet red peppers 3 small zucchini, to 
equal 1 pound, ends trimmed and soaked in cold water 30 minutes 6 plum 
tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 3 
tablespoons assorted fresh herbs (parsley, thyme, basil, marjoram and oregano) 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in medium non-stick saute pan over medium-high 
heat. When hot, add onion and cook, stirring until translucent but not brown, 
about 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, just until 
onion begins to brown. Do not let garlic brown. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. Remove to mixing bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 If using slender Asian eggplant, cut into quarters lengthwise and then into 
1-inch sections, without peeling. If using round Italian eggplant, trim top and 
bottom, peel and cut into 1-inch dice. 
</P>
<P>
 Using same saute pan, heat another tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat 
and add eggplant. Cook, stirring constantly, 5 minutes or until eggplant begins 
to brown. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking until eggplant is rather 
soft, about another 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Combine 
with onion in mixing bowl. If necessary, divide eggplant in half and repeat, 
using another tablespoon oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove tops and bottoms of peppers, cut in half lengthwise and remove seeds 
and fibers. Cut into 1/2-inch strips lengthwise and then into 1-inch dice. 
Again using same saute pan, heat another tablespoon olive oil over medium-high 
heat and, when hot, add peppers. Cook, stirring, until peppers become tender, 
about 5 to 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Combine with onion 
and eggplant in mixing bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut zucchini into quarters lengthwise and then into 1-inch sections. Using 
same saute pan, heat another tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat and add 
zucchini, stirring constantly until zucchini just begin to brown. Reduce heat 
to medium and cook until tender-crisp. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Combine with onion, eggplant and peppers in mixing bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Increase heat to high and add tomatoes to saute pan. Stir and add balsamic 
vinegar. Cook briefly, scraping bottom of pan to get up any brown bits, pour 
over vegetables and stir to combine. 
</P>
<P>
 Empty contents of mixing bowl into large saute pan and cook over medium-low 
heat until vegetables are cooked thoroughly. Onion, eggplant and peppers should 
be very soft, and zucchini should still have some bite. During last 5 minutes, 
add mixed herbs and stir well. Taste again. Adjust seasonings, if necessary. 
Serve hot or at room temperature. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 144 calories; 60 mg sodium; trace cholesterol; 9 
grams fat; 15 grams carbohydrates; 3 grams protein; 2 grams fiber.

 To get to Trabuco Oaks Steak House, you zoom up El Toro Road into a landscape 
of rolling hills and cookie-cutter housing tracts, screech right at a 
Harley-infested tavern, wind on past thistle fields and shady live-oak bowers, 
dusty hillsides and a dry stream bed to what seems like the east side of the 
moon, if the moon smelled like woods moke and had a gravel parking lot filled 
with late-model cars. The place has survived fires, minor political fracases 
and a policy, cheerfully ripped off from Tucson's famous Pinnacle Peak, of 
cutting the necktie off anybody who dares to wear one into the restaurant.

 "Watch out," says the manager as he scissors through a nice-looking red silk 
rep. "I haven't hurt anybody yet, but you never know."

 Trabuco Oaks is probably the most famous steakhouse in Orange County, a 
politicians' dive where you're likely to overhear gossip on the Republican 
primaries for just about any office; a haunt for groups of businessmen who 
drive up from Newport Beach and Irvine to eat great slabs of cow and have their 
ties amputated. Richard Nixon used to like the place, a fact reported in a fair 
number of his obituaries: His severed tie is preserved under glass next to Bebe 
Rebozo's in sort of a presidential shrine near the door. A minute or two from 
good hiking trails, just down the road from a posh resort, Trabuco Oaks is a 
good destination for a weekend road trip -- but don't forget to reserve, or 
you'll wait for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pretty incredible sight, the back dining room of Trabuco Oaks, a sort 
of ramshackle wooden thing with trees growing through the roof, forests of 
business cards stapled to the walls, and necktie corpses hanging from the low 
ceiling like so many floppy stalactites. After a couple of the place's strong 
bourbon-and-sodas, you may feel as if you have been swallowed by a vast, 
multicolored beast. 
</P>
<P>
 A mural flanking the parking lot announces something called the Chicken Lips 
Coffee Club, but the chicken at Trabuco Oaks is pretty ordinary, either 
battered and fried into dryness or skewered and grilled into wood. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be a Ramrod, a Cowgirl and a L'il Wrangler, but the currency at 
Trabuco Oaks is the two-pound Cowboy Steak, a truly serious piece of meat. This 
hillock of steer is the size of a small Alp, crusted black over a wood fire and 
bleeding rare if you order it that way, fibrous and mineral-rich, by far the 
best steak in the house. It is also so much thicker than the steaks you're used 
to seeing that it seems almost ridiculous on its sizzling metal platter, like a 
top sirloin that Fred Flintstone might eat, though two people will put a bigger 
dent in it than you may think. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Cowboy Steak -- with practically anything here -- come giant heaps of 
excellent thin-cut fries, a ramekin of smoky charro beans, a few slices of 
white-bread garlic toast and a green salad with Italian dressing that may 
remind you of the salads at your junior high cafeteria. There are also, as 
pretty much the only appetizers here, the cheese-topped skillets full of 
sauteed zucchini and mushrooms that you may have considered sophisticated 
dinner party food when you moved into your first college apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert is something called a Cherry Gizmo, sort of a deep-fried burrito 
stuffed with cherry-pie filling instead of beans, topped with whipped cream and 
a curl of soft-serve frozen custard, and served on a bed of more cherry-pie 
filling . . . perhaps the least subtle dessert since the Twinkie, but strangely 
suitable to an overblown steak meal. Trabuco Oaks Steak House

FRESH FOR THE SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Until recently, choices in tomatoes were limited to large, medium or small. 
Cherry and plum tomatoes were about as exotic as the fruit got. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you might find tiny berrylike tomato clusters on the vine (currant 
tomatoes), beautiful pear-shaped tomatoes the size of a thumb in yellow, green 
and red hues, or green- and yellow-striped tomatoes that are as sweet as any 
red variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomatoes are among the great delights of summer; they come in a dozen flavors 
and textures. 
</P>
<P>
 When preparing a classic tomato, mozzarella and basil salad, I use beefsteak 
tomatoes. I love the way the tomato juices blend with the oil and vinegar into 
a "soup" that I can sop up with Italian bread. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rice, bean or corn salad, cherry, currant or small pear tomatoes are just 
right. These sturdy picnic salads call for small tomatoes that hold up well for 
several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If I want sweet taste without a lot of liquid, I return to plum tomatoes. For 
sauteed scallops with tomato salad, I want the scallops to remain firm with a 
slightly crisp outer skin. Pairing them with plum tomatoes assures that result. 
SAUTEED SCALLOPS WITH TOMATO SALAD 1 1/2 cups diced plum tomatoes 1 medium 
shallot, diced 1 tablespoon capers, drained 2 tablespoons minced basil 2 
tablespoons olive oil Salt, pepper 2 tablespoons flour 1/2 pound scallops 2 
lemon wedges 
</P>
<P>
 Combine tomatoes, shallot, capers, basil, 1 tablespoon oil and salt and pepper 
to taste in medium bowl. Stir gently but well. Set aside for flavors to blend. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour and salt and pepper to taste in paper bag. Slice each scallop 
widthwise in half for faster cooking. Rinse under cold water and pat dry. Place 
scallops in bag and shake to coat with flour. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat remaining tablespoon oil in medium skillet. Shake off excess flour from 
scallops and cook in heated oil in single layer, turning to brown both sides, 
about 2 minutes per side. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, spoon tomato salad onto 2 dinner plates. Spoon sauteed scallops on 
side. Garnish each plate with lemon wedge. Makes 2 servings.

WINE: TEMPEST IN A WINE BARREL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a wine reviewer writes that he or she tasted a wine in a winery's cellar 
and loved it, I wouldn't rush out to the nearest wine shop. That same wine will 
be quite a bit different when tasted much later, thousands of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet through an implication that something fishy was afoot in such a tasting 
experience, Robert M. Parker Jr., arguably the most powerful wine writer in 
America, has been sued for libel by Francois Faiveley, owner of the famed 
Domaine Faiveley in Burgundy. The lawsuit, filed in France against Parker and 
his publisher, Simon & Schuster, seeks unspecified damages for a phrase that 
appeared in the Third Edition of "Parker's Wine Buyer's Guide," published last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's reviews of Faiveley's 1990 Burgundy's -- published before all the 
wines were even released -- were quite favorable. His average score for 32 of 
Faiveley's 1990 Burgundies was 88.75 out of 100, a very high average. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Parker's comments that Faiveley objected to in the lawsuit. The offending 
quote: "On the dark side, reports continue to circulate that Faiveley's wines 
tasted abroad are less rich than those tasted in the cellars -- something I 
have noticed as well. Ummm . . . !" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A story in the Wine Spectator magazine said that "sources close to the case" 
claim Faiveley "was upset because he felt the comment implied that he provided 
Parker, and his customers in his cellars, with higher-quality wines than those 
that were finally shipped." 
</P>
<P>
 Faiveley is quoted as saying he filed the suit because "I want people to know 
that we are honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, who is an attorney as well as publisher of the Wine Advocate 
newsletter, hasn't returned phone calls to his office in Monkton, Md. Simon & 
Schuster also declines to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute strikes me as a bit odd. Anyone who evaluates wines in winery 
cellars, where the wines are so young -- and in most cases not even bottled -- 
must know that the wine when finally bottled and shipped will be different, 
often very different. 
</P>
<P>
 Winemakers with whom I've spoken say such wines are so young that anyone, 
including the person who made the wine, would be hard-pressed to be accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When you taste wines that young, there is a lot of doubt that your evaluation 
will be meaningful," said Richard Arrowood, winemaker at Arrowood Winery in 
Sonoma Valley. "You can like one wine one day and hate it the next. I've been 
fooled so often by my own wines. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how hard we try to learn (about barrel tasting), there are so many 
turns in the road. At this young age, the wines are not dependable. You can get 
a rough idea about how a vintage is going to go, but you don't get much about 
specific wines. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we don't blend our wines until they have had a full chance to age 
in the barrel. Two years out of three, wines that we intend for our Reserve end 
up in our second-label wine." 
</P>
<P>
 Arrowood said he hated doing barrel sample tastings because they are so 
variable. "I don't think anyone can predict how a wine is going to turn out," 
he says, "not even the winemaker. I can't."  
</P>
<P>
 Not only is barrel tasting very difficult to do with precision, but there have 
long been allegations that some wineries in California and other places keep 
selected barrels of wine for visiting wine writers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One Napa Valley winemaker, who asked for anonymity, was asked if he had ever 
served a writer a sample of wine from a single, hand-selected barrel and had 
represented that as the final product. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, you're talking human nature here," he said. "If we are going to go to a 
tasting and we have to take a sample of our wine, are we going to go to our 
worst barrel? Come on." 
</P>
<P>
 Another major drawback of tasting wines so early is that after they leave the 
barrel, they change radically. Individual barrels are blended with dozens, 
hundreds of other barrels. Then the wine may be fined or filtered. In fining, a 
neutral agent is put into it to clarify it. Filtration further removes material 
that could hurt aroma, taste or texture. Filtration helps some wines, hurts 
others, and not even the winemaker can be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 After this the wine is aged in the bottle, again altering its aroma and 
flavor. Then it is trucked to a warehouse, usually not under refrigeration. If 
it is shipped during the day, did the driver leave the truck in the sun while 
he ate lunch? If so, the wine could deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the wine is shipped by sea on a freighter, usually not in cool 
conditions. There it is jostled and bumped around until it reaches another 
warehouse. Later it is shipped to a retailer, who stacks the stuff on the floor 
of a wine shop that may be heated on cold days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that the farther a wine travels from its source, the more likely 
it is to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arrowood: "You can't do this (barrel tasting) with any degree of 
accuracy. The wine is only a road map. There are no specific directions on 
which way it is going, or what it will be like when it gets where it's going." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, in a recent Wine Spectator, staff writer James Laube reviewed 
1993 California Cabernet Sauvignons -- evaluating the wines some three months 
after harvest, two years before they will be bottled and perhaps three to four 
years before they will be released. (Laube's rating of the vintage: "At this 
early stage, 1993 does not look like a great year.") 
</P>
<P>
 Some day, I suspect, this rush to judgment may prompt a reviewer in quest of 
the very first review of the year to taste grapes on the vine and then predict 
when the resulting wine will be ready to drink. Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Folonari Pinot Grigio ($6.50) -- Pinot Grigio grows well in the cooler 
areas of northern Italy, where it makes a delicately spicy, fairly simple white 
table wine. The widest-selling Italian Pinot Grigio in the United States, from 
Santa Margherita, sells for $17 and is rarely seen for less than $13. Prices 
like this are far too expensive. Some restaurants sell it for $30, an outrage. 
At less than half the retail price, the Folonari Pinot Grigio is a great value. 
</P>
<P>
 The aroma is delicate and spicy, with nuances of figs, fresh melons and 
citrus. The aftertaste is crisp, fresh and uncomplicated. The balance of this 
attractive wine makes it perfect for serving as an aperitif or with lighter 
hot-weather foods such as seafood salads or grilled fish or poultry. This wine 
will be seen discounted in some shops at close to $5.

THE TRUE CHARRO CHAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoyed Russ Parsons' piece on fajitas ("In the Kitchen," June 2). The way 
he describes eating fajitas is the way we bolillos , or white people, used to 
eat them when I was growing up in Harlingen, in south Texas.But I had friends 
who were Mexican cowboys, rancheros , and they fixed it completely differently 
and it was amazing. It is still one of my favorite ways to cook meat. 
</P>
<P>
 When you buy the fajitas (skirt steak), buy them untrimmed, with all the fat 
and gristle still covering it. You may have to go to a Latino market to find 
these. Put them on the grill -- unmarinated, unseasoned, un- everything -- and 
char them good on both sides, for about 10 or 15 minutes. It goes against your 
grain to see it, but trust me, char it. You think, "My God, I'm burning the 
thing," but something wonderful happens, cooking between two layers of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 When you pull the fajitas off the grill, use a knife and fork to just peel the 
fat off like an orange, then cross-cut the meat and make your tacos. My friends 
would throw some corn tortillas on the grill just before serving to warm them 
up. Then all you need is some pico de gallo salsa made with lots of fresh 
cilantro. 
</P>
<P>
 The taste is out of this world. No salt, no pepper, no marinating, no nothing, 
but it's got a wonderful kind of earthy, meaty flavor to it.

BUILDING UP CALIFORNIA ABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KITTY MORSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There once was a time when abalone, this most succulent of shellfish, was 
plentiful along the Pacific Coast of North America. Within barely a generation, 
however, the delicate mollusk and its distinctive ear-shaped shell has become a 
rarity in the wild, a victim of gastronomic overkill. Experts have several 
explanations for this unfortunate depletion. The main reasons include 
overfishing and illegal gathering of undersized abalones. 
</P>
<P>
 Abalones also suffer from the gluttonous appetite of such natural predators as 
California sea otters, whose taste for it rivals that of discriminating 
epicures. These various factors account for the 90% drop in commercially 
available wild abalone over the past 30 years, principally along the Southern 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, there is new hope for American abalone fanciers. Thanks to a handful 
of forward-thinking aquaculturists who have established commercial abalone 
"farms," Pacific red abalone is making a domesticated comeback. The endeavor 
requires intensive scientific research as well as staggering amounts of 
patience, for abalone in the shell grows only one inch a year and requires up 
to three years before it reaches marketable size. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologist John McMullen, a 20-year veteran of abalone production and founder 
of AbLab in Port Hueneme, Calif., was one of the first to farm abalone. He 
specializes in live, three-inch California-farmed abalone in the shell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to know they're really eating abalone," he explains. "There's 
a lot of consumer education involved. Abalone is still relatively unknown 
outside California." 
</P>
<P>
 At AbLab, the abalone is nurtured from the egg stage, when it is tinier than a 
grain of sand, to marketable size. For three years, the pampered mollusks feed 
on sea water and fresh kelp in large round tubs located within a few feet of 
the beach and cooled by fresh ocean breezes. The end product is so tender that 
"we don't even need to pound it into a steak," says McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther up the California coast, Pacific Mariculture occupies the edge of a 
low, scraggly cliff a few miles north of Santa Cruz. Fittingly, the farm lies 
in the shadow of the oldest Indian midden (prehistoric refuse mound) in 
California, a pile consisting largely of discarded abalone shells; it once 
belonged to the Alones -- whence the name abalone. The shimmering blue crescent 
of Monterey Bay serves as a backdrop. In the distance, glistening acres of kelp 
nurture some of the best fishing grounds in the state, a fact not lost on the 
army of sea gulls and brown pelicans floating lazily over the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Home to one of the world's richest ecosystems, this area was recently declared 
a marine sanctuary. The fresh sea water of Monterey Bay is continuously pumped 
into the 400,000-gallon tank towering over the Pacific Mariculture acres -- 
water that, in turn, is funneled into dozens of fiberglass tubs brimming with 
abalone in various stages of growth. In some tubs, seedlings are so small as to 
be almost invisible to the naked eye. In others, clouds of bubbles breaking 
through the blanket of fresh kelp are telltale indicators of the "baby" 
abalones' healthful appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Mariculture maintains close ties with the University of 
California-Santa Cruz (and also with Stanford University), which advises the 
company in matters of animal selection and improved breeding techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw what the future would be," says Pacific Mariculture's president, Dr. 
Peter Scrivani, a founder and researcher for the project. "It's simply 
old-fashioned farming with a college education." Their most popular product is 
the Petite 1 3/4-inch abalone, popular with Bay Area chefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Like their colleagues at Pacific Mariculture, Chris and Linda Van Hook of 
ABALONE International in Crescent City, Calif., have spent years perfecting 
their product. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have been bank tellers; we would have made more money," says Chris 
Van Hook, whose hearty laugh belies the fact that he spent eight full years 
exploring the Pacific Coast from Baja California to Vancouver, securing the 
perfect site and the permits that would allow him to grow ocean-raised abalone. 
Crescent City's wide oceanic harbor, close to the Oregon border, fit the bill 
perfectly for Van Hook to fulfill his ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The year 1988 marked the beginning of ABALONE International and a 40-year 
lease in the waters of Crescent City Harbor. Armed with a B.A. degree in 
environmental studies from the University of California-Santa Barbara, the 
aquaculturist started toying with the idea of producing abalone commercially as 
far back as 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nearly all land-based farms were started in the '70s when energy wasn't a 
major consideration," he says. "We set about it totally the opposite way. We 
asked ourselves, where should we go? Rather than remaining landlocked, I 
preferred to go out in the ocean with my cages." 
</P>
<P>
 In a departure from most other similar ventures, Van Hook's abalones grow in 
cages hanging from a long floating dock, inside converted plastic barrels that 
have had top and bottom removed and replaced with plastic mesh to allow for 
free circulation of sea water. When they reach 39 millimeters in size, the 
juvenile abalone are transferred to large, rectangular plastic mesh cages that 
hold vertical panels. The abalone attach themselves to the panels in the same 
way they attach to rocks in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 A labor-intensive feeding process ensures correct nutrition, requiring kelp to 
be gathered from wild kelp beds (for which a small fee is paid to the state), 
then brought to the farm site and cut up into small pieces before being fed to 
the developing abalone. Three years later, the three-inch mollusk will be ready 
for market, a lengthy process by any stretch of the imagination, and one that 
explains the abalone's relatively high market price. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A sideline of ABALONE International's commitment to sound environmental 
practices is its cooperation with the Del Norte County Abalone Replant Program. 
Funds gathered through fines levied by the county's fish and game department 
purchase three-quarter-inch abalone in order to "replant" them in the rocks 
lining the county shoreline. Through such programs, hopes Van Hook, wild 
abalone might once again thrive in California waters. 
</P>
<P>
 At US Abalone in Princeton, south of San Francisco, farming is also a family 
operation. Tom Ebert, an aquaculture scientist and a veteran of 17 years in 
abalone research and production, holds a master's degree in marine research 
from the Moss Landing Marine Laboratory in California. He credits his father, 
Earl, a research director at the California Department of Fish and Game for 
more than 30 years, with being one of the pioneers in abalone research in the 
state. Ebert's brother, David, who holds a Ph.D. in marine ecology and 
fisheries science, is now in charge of expansion and development. 
</P>
<P>
 US Abalone actually consists of two operations: one on land and the other at 
sea. At the Santa Cruz facility, the abalone is raised in raceways, or long 
troughs, continually fed sea water and seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the open ocean location in Pillar Point Harbor, abalone are raised in large 
cages suspended from 20-by-12-foot rafts just inside the breakwater. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The flavor of the meat depends upon food and water quality," explains Tom 
Ebert, who, like his colleagues, sees a tremendous national potential for 
farm-raised abalone. "Much of our success in marketing our product domestically 
depends on educating the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Although national consumption is increasing, thanks to many upscale chefs' 
predilection for the product, much of the California abalone production is 
still bound for the Japanese market, which tolerates premium prices. Thanks to 
these commercial producers, American consumers may well join in the abalone 
feast once again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Van Hook credits his friend Diane Davies with developing this recipe. 
"Don't forget to save the shells," he advises. "They make beautiful containers 
for the sauce." Placed in the refrigerator on a drain board so they do not sit 
in water, abalone will stay alive for three days, and fresh for four additional 
days. Abalone can also be prepared immediately and frozen between layers of wax 
paper.  
</P>
<P>
 ABALONE IN JADE SAUCE 10 (2 1/2-inch) abalone 2 tablespoons minced ginger root 
3/4 pound spinach, rinsed, stemmed and patted dry 1 bunch chives, rinsed and 
dried 4 sprigs cilantro 4 basil leaves 1/4 cup chicken stock 3/4 cup whipping 
cream 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon Chinese chili sauce 1 tablespoon 
cornstarch 1 tablespoon cold water 1/4 cup butter, cut up Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse, tenderize and thoroughly dry abalone scallops. Rub scallops with half 
of ginger root. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sauce, process spinach, chives, cilantro, basil and remaining ginger 
root in increments until finely chopped in blender or food processor. Add 
chicken stock and process until fairly smooth. Add cream, salt and chili sauce. 
Process until pureed. Place mixture in medium saucepan over low heat and bring 
to simmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, combine cornstarch with 1 tablespoon cold water in small bowl. Mix 
until smooth. Add mixture to simmering sauce. Stir until well blended. Cook, 
stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 2 to 4 minutes longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Place prepared abalone on baking sheet. Dot with butter. Season to taste with 
pepper. Bake abalone at 500 degrees until flesh turns white and is firm to 
touch, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from oven. Spoon sauce in pool on dinner plate. 
Place abalone on top of sauce. Serve immediately. Makes about 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : To prepare and tenderize abalone, run thin-bladed knife around inside 
edge of shell to shuck out meat. Discard visceral parts without trimming off 
dark edges. Then place abalone scallop in plastic zipper food bag. With wooden 
mallet, using sharp wrist movements, tap flesh repeatedly without ripping 
apart, working in circular motion, starting from center, to obtain uniform 
thickness. Repeat same procedure for other side. Or place abalone scallop on 
lower half of tea towel, fold other half over scallop and pound as directed. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This recipe from Pacific Mariculture calls for the small abalone, usually 
reserved for appetizer-size helpings. Leave the abalone in the shell until 
ready to use.  
</P>

 HORSEFLESH: They shoot horses, don't they? Don Anderson says they do. He's the 
instructor of the soon-to-be disbanded horse-training program at Moorpark 
College. And he says he wants to prevent horseflesh dealers from buying any of 
the 40 horses that must be sold as surplus state property to the highest bidder 
(B1) . . . . "Between 75% and 80% of the horses at those sales go to the 
killers," Anderson said. "You're going to have to put me away and throw away 
the key before I let that happen."

 TOP-RATED HAMS: As defending champs, Conejo Valley Amateur Radio Club members 
will scramble to the top of Rasnow Peak on Saturday. They'll string antennae on 
polls and mount satellite dishes on trailers. During a 24-hour marathon, the 
club's battery-powered transmitters will try to reach out and touch more ham 
radio operators than any other competitor in America. Dick Anderson expects 
half of the club's 100 members to join in the national contest: "We've won the 
last four years in a row." 
</P>
<P>
 TEEN CHALLENGE: Now that summer is here, many teen-agers face their most 
difficult decision of the year: What to do before school resumes? Some teens 
loathe the idea of breaking training as world-class couch potatoes . . . . But 
billiards are big in some cities (Ventura County Life, Page 8). There's 
skating, miniature golf, or even a summer job. It doesn't have to be drudgery. 
Magic Mountain hires 3,000 summer workers. "We're definitely in a big hiring 
mode," a spokesman says. "We've got excellent, excellent opportunities for 
teens." 
</P>
<P>
 TRADING PLACES: Sandi Webb is weary of all the attention given to sports 
heroes with feet of clay . . . . So the Simi Valley councilwoman wants the city 
to issue its own set of trading cards featuring its police officers. Their 
height, weight, arrest records and other stats could be listed on the back. 
She'd like to see police dog cards too. Said Webb: "It would boost morale and 
make officers role models more than some of these sports figures we've been 
hearing so much about."

 Stupid criminal tricks: A CHP officer spotted a man boldly driving alone in 
the car-pool lane of the Ventura Freeway and tried to pull him over, Sgt. Ernie 
Garcia reports. The motorist fled but was involved in a minor accident and 
placed in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 When the suspect was booked, Garcia said, "the officer located $4,550 in cash 
in (his) pockets along with a note threatening to shoot people if he was not 
given money." 
</P>
<P>
 Further investigation linked him to a bank robbery that had occurred about 
five minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia put this incident under the heading of: "Another reason motorists 
should not abuse the High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention another reason motorists should dispose of their used holdup 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 More deadly than the critics: Newsman Paul McLean noticed a Mid-City billboard 
for the Jack Nicholson movie "Wolf" alongside a billboard for a werewolf's 
worst enemy, the "Silver Bullet" (Coors variety). 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't hurt a bit: Asked to name the highlight of the school year, the 
kindergartners at Fremont Elementary School in Long Beach gave teacher Irl 
Noble the expected answers, i.e., recess, cafeteria, science lab. All but Cory 
Absmeier, who chirped: "Going to the dentist." 
</P>
<P>
 No, he isn't a pint-sized version of the masochist who rejects anesthesia in 
"Little Shop of Horrors." Actually, young Cory was referring to his class's 
field trip to observe a local tooth-driller. 
</P>
<P>
 But what will they do for the World Series?As Karen Young's photo illustrates, 
the folks at the Right Move delivery service got into the spirit of the World 
Cup by adding a couple of familiar spheroids to their logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Melting plot: The era of Raymond Chandler-type L.A. mysteries -- with their 
virtually all-white casts -- is over. For a 1990s suspense yarn about the City 
of Angels to be relevant, it must reflect the diversity of the area, as does 
"The Killing of the Saints," by Alex Abella. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 There's a murder involving a Holocaust survivor (who owns an L.A. jewelry 
store), his Armenian manager, his Mexican American assistant manager and a 
black guard who's an ex-pro football player, as well as a Vietnamese customer 
and two Cuban gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's a Cuban investigator who survives a murder attempt by two Crips 
(and is treated by an Indian doctor). The investigator is haunted by memories 
of an ex-girlfriend who ran off with a Colombian drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there's a trial involving a Chinese American prosecutor and such 
witnesses as a Mexican disc jockey, a parking lot attendant who says he's a 
Guatemalan, a Thai coroner, a Nigerian anthropologist, as well as a courtroom 
demonstration of a voodoo-like Santeria rite. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the city, as well as the airport, should be named L.A. International. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, things aren't that bad in L.A.!A sign posted alongside the Xerox machines 
in the Downtown Federal Building says: 
</P>
<P>
 "No coping after 1:45 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 We've found that when we're having trouble coping with the afternoon, guzzling 
a couple of Silver Bullets works wonders. LAny: 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyatt Regency hotel in Downtown L.A. has announced a special "rate of $89 
per night (single or double occupancy) for all media covering the O.J. Simpson 
story." In the rooms rented to the scribes, the Hyatt would be well advised to 
hide the keys to the portable refrigerators.

O. J. SIMPSON'S CHASE, ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The freeway pursuit of O.J. Simpson was the most surreal event I've ever seen 
-- especially watching the throngs of people who were lined up for miles, 
waving signs and cheering him on. Like so many other people, I am shocked by 
this situation and firmly believe that O.J. is innocent until proven guilty in 
a court of law. But if convicted, this guy will be found guilty of crimes that 
are no less brutal and appalling than anything the Manson family did. And yet 
literally thousands of people in Southern California thought it appropriate to 
cheer. DAVID ELLIS 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I suspect I'm not alone and others thought as I did as we watched, as if 
mesmerized, O.J. Simpson's car, trailed by scores of police vehicles, traverse 
our too-familiar and suddenly empty freeways toward Simpson's suicide or 
arrest. We heard the fugitive/hero held a gun to his head and learned that the 
driver of the car heading toward an unknown destination was his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, amid this sad and almost classically tragic tale, there was, at 
last, in the midst of moral confusion, a pure and known definition. As "hero," 
"superstar," "fan" and "voyeur" grew increasingly muddled, the definition of 
"friend" was affirmed anew: Al Cowlings.

 I certainly hope that the various law enforcement agencies are going to bill 
and collect from O.J. Simpson the amount that was spent to hunt him down and 
chase him up the freeway. As a taxpayer, I have no desire to have to pay for 
all that.

<P>
 A bright, glorious California Sunday morning and we are treated to the front 
page and additional inside pages of the few details regarding O.J. Simpson that 
anyone who has been under anesthesia for the last three days may have missed. 
To give credit where credit is due, there is a small, boxed item on Page 1 
mentioning that nuclear holocaust may have once again been postponed for the 
immediate present with the tentative agreement to a summit meeting between 
North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the heart of media-land, it's finally become obvious that the networks 
and the print media have realized how to get our rapt attention. Forget family 
programming, forget national sports playoffs, forget cultural events, we want 
mayhem, live on-the-spot coverage. We want to feel as though we are right there 
in the midst of whatever horror is taking place, be it earthquake devastation, 
fire ravages, torrential flooding, or just your basic L.A. miscellaneous crime 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 There are enough helicopters, mobile camera trucks, newspeople, amateur video 
cam owners in Southern California that we should be able to have our own 
all-news station covering what's happening on the streets of L.A. at every 
minute, be it ever so gruesome. We want to be part of it; we want to experience 
every in-depth interview with the grieving family members who are always asked 
the profound question, "How do you feel?" What an opportunity for programming 
around the clock! Who needs "60 Minutes" or CNN? In L.A., we want the real 
thing.

<P>
 The publicity we have been giving to the O.J. Simpson case is a sad commentary 
on our values and character. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, take the Sunday edition (June 19). You devoted two-thirds of the 
front page, and more than five additional full pages to O.J.! By contrast, you 
devote a space of only a few paragraphs on the front page to the proposed 
summit meeting between North and South Korea on the nuclear bomb issue. No 
wonder our country is in trouble! 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of O.J., how does the Los Angeles Police Department explain the 
preferential treatment it has been giving him? Here is a man they accuse of 
double murder, and they allow him to "negotiate" his surrender; manage to lose 
him for eight hours after he escaped; chase him on L.A.'s most busy freeways 
for two hours on Friday afternoon under nonstop, coast-to-coast, live 
television coverage, causing terrible inconvenience and aggravation to millions 
of Los Angeles motorists during this unprecedented chase. 
</P>
<P>
 The general tone of all this publicity is to solicit sympathy for this "fallen 
hero." Let us not forget who the real victims are in this case. Those that 
deserve our sympathy are the murdered ex-wife of O.J. and her male friend, 
their parents, sisters and brothers, and most of all O.J.'s two young children, 
whose mother he is accused of murdering.

 When did idle speculation rise to the level of front-page headline status 
("Simpson's Peculiar Behavior Could Aid in His Defense," June 19)? 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of obvious and trite observation I expect to see on local 
television news when they need to fill time, not on the front page of a major 
newspaper. The "legal experts" are entitled to their opinions, but please put 
them in the proper place; they are not news.

 O.J. Simpson, according to his lawyer, was "tearful" because he was separated 
from his children on Father's Day (June 20). Crocodile tears, maybe. Can there 
ever be a time when children need their father more than when their mother has 
just died? And where was Simpson? Riding around in the back of a Ford Bronco, 
thinking only of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as disgusting as Simpson were all those people waving and holding signs 
that read "Go, O.J., Go!" and "We love you, O.J." Is it possible for a 
civilized person to be so lacking in self-esteem that he must invest in the 
deification of a football hero? To these people I say, "Get a life!"

 Fact: The number of domestic violence cases is reported to be higher on Super 
Bowl Sunday than on any other day of the year. Worse still, the number of 
convicted sports heroes is growing large enough to constitute its own team in 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 What can we squeeze out of Juice? Recognition that domestic violence is a 
problem of public health proportions which afflicts even the most adored and 
emulated in society. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to imagine a public service campaign better suited for the national 
sports associations -- including the NFL, the NBA, the NHL and major league 
baseball -- than the war against domestic violence. These organizations must 
pick up after their fallen stars with time, funds and the public commitment of 
their players.

 Does America really believe it is more important to be a good ball player than

 I never realized how much of a hero O.J. Simpson was to me until the murder 
allegations hit the press (Column One, "Illusion, Reality, and Our Heroes," 
June 17). Murder is for street thugs and desperate souls. O.J. is a legendary 
football star, a media darling, a family member. It can't be! 
</P>
<P>
 Even though I never saw him play in person, I joyfully applauded anytime his 
face was projected on the Coliseum big screen at USC games. His heroism is 
deep-rooted. He symbolizes the thrill and excitement of victory.  
</P>
<P>
 We believe in heroes like O.J. because we desire joy and happiness. What we 
fail to see is the heroes' tendency to crumble beneath the weight of our 
adoration.

 It is sickening to hear Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti earn his tough-on-crime 
brownie points by whipping up public opinion against O.J. Simpson. It seems 
unethical to me to make any media announcements until this innocent man is 
proven to be guilty in a court of law. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh the hypocrisy of Garcetti to tell us not to forget the motherless 
children, when he will not hesitate to do his best to make them fatherless as 
well, either actually or in effect.

 What has happened to our values? O.J. Simpson is not a great football player 
who happened to make a mistake, as one young fan stated. He is a convicted,

very well a long time ago.

ELATION GROUNDED IN SKEPTICISM; IS PYONGYANG READY TO PLAY BALL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton spoke with some caution Wednesday as he announced plans to 
resume high-level talks with North Korea, and he would have been remiss not to. 
The history of the American-North Korean dialogue, which includes two rounds of 
intense if frustrating meetings last year, does not encourage any abundance of 
confidence in Pyongyang's commitment to resolving the nuclear crisis it has 
invited. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, to be sure, North Korea may really be ready to swap its suspected 
nuclear weapons program for international aid for its rickety economy and 
greater political respectability, including even Washington's diplomatic 
recognition. Alternatively, it may only once again be stalling, as it has so 
often in the past, while it proceeds apace with its nuclear development. 
</P>
<P>
 That possibility isn't necessarily lessened by Clinton's assurance that 
Pyongyang has agreed to the three conditions set by the United States: that 
recently removed spent fuel from its experimental reactor won't be reprocessed 
to extract plutonium for weapons, that the reactor won't be refueled and that 
international inspectors will be allowed to keep watch at the reactor site. 
North Korea can agree to these things and still continue secret work on its 
nuclear program. As U.S. intelligence officials have noted, North Korea has 
other suspected nuclear facilities to which inspectors from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency have been refused access. What's going on at those sites 
is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning of this crisis, speculation about what the world's most 
isolated and insular regime might be up to has divided along two main lines. 
One is that Pyongyang's nuclear program is above all a bargaining chip, to be 
exchanged at the appropriate moment for the aid it so desperately needs and the 
recognition it so desperately craves. The other line holds that North Korea's 
nuclear weapons plans are scarily real, that Kim Il Sung is determined to build 
bombs not just for himself but, for the right price, to share with such other 
menacing states as Iran and Libya. 
</P>
<P>
 The message that former President Jimmy Carter brought back from his trip to 
Pyongyang last week was that Kim was ready to be conciliatory. Official 
diplomatic soundings confirmed an interest in renewed talks. Sometime soon, 
then, the United States will have a chance to assess Pyongyang's inclinations 
firsthand. "The world will be the winner if we can resolve this," Clinton said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the President added the essential reference to reality: "But we haven't 
done it yet."

GUN CONTROL WATCH; NUTS OVER GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When will America get the message? 
</P>
<P>
 When Dean Mellberg legally purchased a military-style assault rifle from a 
federally licensed gun dealer in suburban Spokane, Wash., he was asked what he 
intended to do with the gun.His reply, "Target plinking and maybe some 
hunting." 
</P>
<P>
 Right. Five days later the former serviceman, 20, who was discharged from the 
Air Force in May because of psychiatric problems, calmly entered nearby 
Fairchild Air Force Base, took out his newly purchased Chinese-made MAK-90 
semiautomatic assault weapon and began firing as fast as he could pull the 
trigger. The result: five people killed, including an 8-year-old girl, and 23 
others wounded before Mellberg himself was shot to death by military patrol 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Would the pending federal assault gun ban have prevented such an atrocity? 
We'll never know. But we do know that the legislation, despite have cleared 
both the House and the Senate, is languishing in a conference committee. That's 
inexcusable. 
</P>
<P>
 House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), who represents the district where the 
shootings took place, called the incident a "senseless tragedy." But so is 
congressional dithering on the gun issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress must get the assault gun ban to the President. And it should pass the 
so-called Brady II bill, which mandates national gun licensing and registration 
provisions, sets limits on gun possession and tightens restrictions for gun 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the kind of future we want for America -- not more Spokane-style 
tragedies.

KICK THAT BLOCK!; THINKING CREATIVELY ABOUT KEEPING THE RAIDERS IN THE COLISEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone agrees that the 70-year-old Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, near 
Downtown, needs to be rescued from decline -- but in recent years something 
always has kept that from happening. First, contractual obligations related to 
the 1984 Olympics prevented major changes in the facility. Then there was a 
major recession from which California only now is starting to recover. Finally, 
last January, came the big earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is no small achievement that the stadium has continued to operate 
profitably and that before the Jan. 17 temblor some improvements indeed were 
made -- among them new locker and restroom facilities and prime seats closer to 
the playing field. That says a lot about the persistence of the Coliseum 
Commission, which oversees the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But rebuilding from the earthquake is by far the toughest challenge the 
commission has faced. It is reassuring that the contractors involved in the 
$42-million rebuilding project promise that repairs will be complete when the 
football season starts in September. But it is even more reassuring to have 
learned recently that Coliseum commissioners are trying to find imaginative 
ways of keeping their chief tenants, the Los Angeles Raiders, who are being 
wooed by several cities with newer stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission plans to offer Raiders owner Al Davis what amounts to a 
rent-free deal for the coming season. At first glance that might seem a 
giveaway Los Angeles can ill-afford, in that the Raiders have paid roughly 
$800,000 a year. But the key is the creative way that money would be used. The 
Raiders would pay into a fund set aside for construction of luxury boxes, a key 
improvement needed to keep the old stadium competitive -- and an improvement 
that Davis has been pressing for. While $800,000 is hardly enough to build the 
boxes, it could be used to leverage loans, bonds and other financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's hoping that Davis, sorely tested by past promises to build luxury boxes

PACKING IN THE NICOTINE; FDA POINTS TO SECRET DEVELOPMENT OF GENETICALLY 
ALTERED TOBACCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Food and Drug Administration is to regulate the nicotine in cigarettes 
as a drug, as the American Medical Assn. and many others urge, it must first 
show that tobacco companies deliberately manipulate the level of nicotine in 
their products. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco companies, responding to charges that they spike cigarettes with 
nicotine to keep smokers addicted, deny that they're doing anything more than 
trying to assure consistency in taste to keep their customers happy. 
</P>
<P>
 But David A. Kessler, the FDA's commissioner, has presented Congress with 
evidence that Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. has secret- ly developed and is 
using in its cigarettes a genetically altered tobacco plant -- called Y-1 -- 
whose nicotine content is more than twice that found naturally in tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 If not quite a smoking gun here surely is a smoldering leaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown & Williamson says Y-1 was prompted by a government effort in the 1970s 
to reduce the tar in cigarettes, tar being the residue of particulates that are 
believed to contain cancer-causing compounds. But cutting tar also meant 
cutting nicotine levels. Y-1, according to Brown & Williamson, was nothing more 
than a "blending tool" to compensate for that loss. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, we are left to wonder, why did Brown & Williamson deny to the 
FDA as recently as May 3 that it had developed a high-nicotine plant? And why, 
on June 10, did officials of DNA Plant Technology of Berkeley, on contract to 
Brown & Williamson to work on tobacco breeding, tell the FDA that they had been 
authorized by the company to say that Y-1 "had never been commercialized," 
meaning used in cigarettes. In fact, as the tobacco company admitted when 
confronted with the evidence, Y-1 is currently in five of its brands. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence for nicotine manipulation grows, and the public health case for 
regulating this drug has been firmly made. Primary emphasis, as Kessler says, 
should be on keeping teen-agers from ever getting hooked on tobacco in the 
first place. Millions of Americans are already doomed to die prematurely 
because of smoking. With sound regulation, there's a chance that millions of 
other lives might be saved.

PERSPECTIVES ON BOND ISSUES; CALIFORNIA VOTES NO ON THE FUTURE; STATE PUBLIC 
FINANCE IS A MESS; WE NEED TO CHALLENGE OUR SACRED COWS, INCLUDING POPOSITION 
13. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD B. PEISER, Richard B. Peiser is director of the Lusk Center for Real 
Estate Development at USC. He is currently on sabbatical at Magdalene College 
of Cambridge University.State public finance is a mess; we need to challenge 
our sacred cows, including Proposition 13. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The defeat of every bond measure on the June 7 ballot is the tip of the 
iceberg for California's most fundamental weakness: its public-finance system. 
Since this is a long-term crisis, unlike the riots or the earthquake, it 
clearly does not register yet on public consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 In the June election, voter preferences were loud and clear: Fiscal concerns 
override physical concerns; it's more important to keep taxes low than to 
improve bridges, highways and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it really matter if we continue to postpone public investment? 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake bonds present a good example of what lies ahead, especially for 
those who were affected by the freeway collapses. We could have saved the $26 
million spent to repair the collapsed section of the Santa Monica Freeway if 
the $3.7 million planned for strengthening it had been spent in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Other public-investment delays could be equally damaging. Proposition 1B would 
have authorized $1 billion for construction, reconstruction and modernization, 
including seismic safety, for public schools. Defeat of 1B shows that we 
clearly do not believe that public schools warrant investment that could reduce 
earthquake damage. The defeat of 1C sends the same message with respect to 
public colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 One might infer from these defeats that the vote was simply held at the wrong 
time. In the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression, voters 
are rightly concerned about whether they can afford any new public programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vote is symptomatic of a much greater crisis -- the breakdown of 
California's public-finance system. Public finance has always depended on an 
unwritten contract between voters and the state: that voters will bring a 
public-regarding spirit when they vote on public expenditures -- a concern for 
the long-term future of their city and state. 
</P>
<P>
 When the public fabric begins to shred, and there is plenty of evidence that 
is happening now, people who can afford private services -- schools, police, 
transportation -- do so. Those who can't suffer or leave. 
</P>
<P>
 When people and businesses leave, especially those that contribute more than 
their fair share to the economy, our ability to pay for public services is cut. 
It may not be noticeable at first, because the initial cuts are made in 
maintenance and repair budgets. However, when the deferred maintenance or lack 
of repair becomes apparent -- as it did so dramatically in the Santa Monica 
Freeway collapse -- then the deteriorating condition of public facilities 
becomes hard to ignore. More and more people, fed up with crime, graffiti, road 
delays and other manifest signs of the deteriorating urban fabric, move away, 
causing the public purse to shrink still further. The downward spiral 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 The public-finance mess creates a double bind for cities, since sales taxes 
are one of the few sources of revenue for enhancing local budgets. Fiscal 
zoning leads to absurd planning -- cities fall over one another to offer 
subsidies to car dealers because they bring in sales-tax revenues, while trying 
to avoid fiscally less-desirable land uses such as manufacturing, which only 
brings in jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a solution? 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to call for a state initiative, sponsored at the highest levels of 
government, to reform California's public-finance system -- one empowered to 
challenge our most sacred cows: Proposition 13, the percentage of votes 
required to pass bond issues and the referendum process, which makes a mockery 
of democratic grass-roots politics by favoring those interest groups that have 
the most money and can generate the most publicity or confusion in the minds of 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Our leaders also need to be smarter about the way they frame critical 
public-investment decisions. A fundamental principle of public finance is the 
"matching principle" -- those who benefit from a public investment should pay 
for it. The seismic-safety propositions on the June ballot were approved by 
significant margins in Los Angeles County, where memories of the Jan. 17 
earthquake were strong. Unfortunately, voters in Northern California disagreed. 
A mechanism is needed to implement the matching principle. If the bonds had 
been designated for public improvements in Southern California and voted on by 
Southern Californians alone, they would have passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the public expenditures undertaken by government, the most important 
are the ones that save us money in the long run. When we have to spend 90 times 
more than we would otherwise have spent, as in the case of earthquake repairs, 
then there is little money left to pay for the things that voters obviously do 
care about -- more police on the streets and safer neighborhoods.

PERSPECTIVES ON BOND ISSUES; BONDS HAVE BOMBED; TRY TOLLS; WITH VOTERS IN AN 
ANTI-TAX MOOD AND GAS-TAX VALUE SHRINKING, TOLL LANES MAKE SENSE; 91 FREEWAY 
WILL TEST THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. POOLE JR., Robert W. Poole Jr., president of the Reason 
Foundation, has been an adviser to the U.S. and California transportation 
departments. The views expressed here are his own. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, California taxpayers have delivered a striking blow to the 
government's best-laid plans. Defeat of the $2-billion earthquake-bond measure 
leaves state transportation plans seriously short of funds. In order to keep 
freeway earthquake retrofitting moving forward, Gov. Pete Wilson has moved to 
delay at least $1-billion worth of freeway and rail projects. Thus, freeway 
bottlenecks, needed high-occupancy vehicle lanes and badly needed repaving and 
modernization all will have to wait -- unless we can come up with another 
source of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current anti-tax mood, another increase in the gasoline tax or the 
sales tax will face tough sledding. Gasoline taxes are unpopular and our sales 
tax already puts California at a disadvantage compared with neighboring states. 
That leaves just one other choice: tolls. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of transportation-policy experts think that the gasoline tax 
should be phased out and replaced with direct-user payments. Steadily 
increasing fuel economy and the advent of alternate fuels will continue to 
shrink the real value of gas-tax receipts, further imperiling the health of the 
infrastructure. Tolls can be fine-tuned to make sure that heavy trucks truly 
pay their way. And by increasing the tolls at rush-hours in congested cities 
like Los Angeles, people will have strong incentives not to drive alone at 
those times. Moreover, technology has given us low-cost, nonstop electronic 
toll-collection systems that make toll booths as obsolete as blacksmith shops. 
</P>
<P>
 A major benefit of shifting toward tolls is the ability to leverage scarce 
government highway funds with private capital. Many California highways, 
freeways and bridges could be self-supporting from tolls alone. That projected 
revenue stream is bankable: Investors will put up funds to build a new bridge 
or modernize a highway if they can count on being repaid from toll revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the Legislature tested this idea by authorizing Caltrans to 
request proposals from the private sector for four new toll facilities as pilot 
projects. The four projects selected after a grueling competition represent 
$2.5 billion in net new investment in California's transportation system. The 
first of these is now under construction in Orange County, adding four express 
lanes to the Riverside (91) Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress took note of California's experiment and decided it was a good idea 
to attract private capital into the nation's highway system. The Intermodal 
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act contains innovative public/private 
partnership provisions to do just that. Traditionally, states have been 
required to match their federal highway funds with state funds, typically 80% 
federal to 20% state. Under the new provisions, California could use a portion 
of its federal funds to attract private funds. In many cases, just 25% or 33% 
of a project would be federal, with the balance coming from investors, not the 
state. The upshot: The same federal dollars would stimulate much greater total 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Highway Administrator Rodney Slater endorsed this approach last fall 
when he told reporters, "We've got to get the private sector involved to a 
greater extent in financing highways." Last year, Washington state enacted 
legislation to implement this new approach. Last month, the state's Department 
of Transportation received proposals from 11 consortiums for 14 projects valued 
at $4.8 billion. They will select up to six for fast-track development. Sad to 
say, California has so far failed to follow through. Draft legislation to 
implement the public-private partnership provisions of the Transportation 
Efficiency Act has been floating around Sacramento for nearly two years, but 
the governor has failed to give it his blessing. Yet Washington state's recent 
experience demonstrates that private capital and expertise are available, 
willing and able to step forward to help solve California's infrastructure 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson's approval ratings grew dramatically when he gave the private 
sector performance incentives to rebuild L.A.'s quake-damaged freeways. A bold 
program to enlist the private sector to modernize our transportation system 
could gain him further points. On the other hand, Kathleen Brown is an expert 
on bonds and infrastructure finance. Searching for new ideas to make California 
great again, Brown could steal a march on Wilson by embracing the idea of 
public/private partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Business as usual will not restore California's greatness. Modern "smart 
highways" infrastructure will make California a better place to live and work. 
Our political leaders need to get behind such innovative approaches.

COLUMN LEFT/ BARBARA BOXER: HEALTH CARE OF WOMEN ISN'T NEGOTIABLE; ABORTION 
COVERAGE FOR ALL MUST BE INCLUDED IN ANY REFORM PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BOXER, Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) is a U.S. senator. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Passage of health-care legislation will be a defining moment for the women of 
this nation. For the 29 million women with no health insurance, for the 
millions at risk for breast cancer and for the 3 million who will face a crisis 
pregnancy, health-care reform holds so much promise -- and so much risk. 
</P>
<P>
 In this, the greatest nation in the world, it is unconscionable that most 
women do not have coverage for preventive procedures like mammography; that 
women under 30, the group most likely to have children, are also the group 
least likely to have health insurance, or that Congress has repeatedly failed 
to ensure that disadvantaged women have access to a full range of 
pregnancy-related services. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a historic opportunity to change all this. If done right, health-care 
reform can address the specific and unique needs of this nation's women. If 
done right, health-care reform can ensure universal coverage and provide a full 
range of pregnancy services to all women. If it is not done right, it will 
represent not only a missed opportunity, but also a major step backward for 
many American women. 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who will try to distort this issue and play politics, claiming 
that some pregnancy-related services are too controversial and should be taken 
out of the health-care package. Unfortunately, they miss the point. Any 
health-care reform that does not adequately address the needs of women -- 52% 
of the population -- is no reform at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Real health-care reform means expanding private coverage, not taking away 
benefits that we already have. Currently, two-thirds of private 
health-insurance plans routinely cover all pregnancy-related services. A recent 
public-opinion survey found that 68% of voters want the health-benefits package 
to include medical procedures currently covered by private health insurance. 
The new plan must not take away vital reproductive-health services that 
millions of women have today and may need tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 For women facing crisis pregnancies, the difficult decision of abortion is for 
a woman, her family and her doctor, within the framework of her religious 
belief. It must be made in the doctor's office, not in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Health-care legislation working its way through Congress carefully addresses 
these moral and religious views by permitting health-care professionals or 
facilities to opt out of providing abortion services. These legislative 
proposals make the point very clear: If you are morally opposed to a medical 
procedure, you cannot be required to perform it. 
</P>
<P>
 This opt-out provision strikes the critical balance between respecting the 
beliefs of some and protecting the health-care needs of others. If Congress 
were to take the unfortunate step of scaling back the list of pregnancy -- 
related services, we would open a Pandora's box of possible discriminatory 
treatment in our new health-care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to a particular medical service gives no one the right to redline 
the health-care plan for American women. If we do not allow coverage of 
abortion, where will this lead? Will we eliminate coverage for contraception, 
AIDS or blood transfusions because of the objections of one group or another? 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has forwarded to Congress a plan that provides health 
security to all Americans and helps improve a system that has too often 
neglected women. Congress must now act swiftly to enact real health-care 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 If we fail, the impact on women will be swift and devastating. Eliminating the 
full range of pregnancy-related services will not reduce the number of 
abortions. It will only make abortion more difficult and dangerous, putting 
women's lives and health at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 It will mean that fewer doctors will perform abortions. Women will have to 
travel farther and delay medical care. Safe medical abortion, available in only 
17% of the counties in the United States, will become increasingly difficult to 
obtain. And there will be more unintended pregnancies, higher rates of infant 
mortality and more babies born too early, too small and too sick. 
</P>
<P>
 We are standing at a crossroads. We can choose the path that will endanger the 
health and lives of countless women by eliminating coverage for abortion. Or we 
can allow those providers with conscientious objectors to opt out of abortion 
services while providing insurance coverage for the full range of 
pregnancy-related services, ensuring that abortion remains safe and, at the 
same time, far less necessary. The contrast is stark, the choice clear.

 Disappointing Sales: The big news in this week's pop charts isn't that the 
Stone Temple Pilots' 196,000-selling album, "Purple," retained the No. 1 spot, 
which it did. More interesting is the relatively weak showing by two acts whose 
debut albums together sold more than 6 million copies in the United States last 
year. The Spin Doctors' new "Turn It Upside Down," the follow-up to "Pocket 
Full of Kryptonite," landed at No. 28 with only 38,000 units sold during its 
first week in the stores. And Grammy-winning group Arrested Development's new 
"Zingalamaduni," which follows its acclaimed album "3 Years, 5 Months and 2 
Days in the Life of . . . , " entered the chart at No. 55 with only 28,000 
units sold.

choreographer Martha Graham are being licensed for performance for the first 
time to several university and professional dance companies, including the 
Paris Opera Ballet, the National Ballet of Holland, the Juilliard School, 
Florida State University and the University of Illinois. Graham's ballets -- 
which are also being negotiated for by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater 
and the Joffrey Ballet -- have generally been reserved for the New York-based 
company that bears her name. Only Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project 
and a company in Israel have previously been allowed to perform Graham's works, 
which are known for their signature narrative style. The new licensing is part 
of the Martha Graham Centennial Celebration, a multifaceted tribute, chaired by

JAZZ REVIEW; TRUMPETER HARRELL PROVIDES RICH IMPROVISATION AT CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trumpeter Tom Harrell once said that he sees himself as the vehicle for the 
music he plays, rather than its creator. His opening night performance at 
Catalina Bar & Grill on Tuesday was a powerful visual illustration of his 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with a five-piece unit, Harrell was a stoic, almost statue-like 
figure. Between his choruses, he stood erect, head hung low, arms at his side, 
his face devoid of expression. But when he raised his instrument (fluegelhorn, 
for most of the set), the music poured forth with astonishing richness and 
complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 In solo after solo in the largely original collection of tunes, Harrell 
reached for the outer limits of the harmonies, pushing his technique, not in 
the service of virtuosity alone, but toward an ever more expansive sequence of 
variations. It was jazz improvisation at its finest. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Harrell's group included four excellent players, their ensemble 
interaction, especially between drummer Billy Hart and bassist Larry Grenadier, 
left something to be desired. Pianist Donald Brown contributed first-rate, 
McCoy Tyner-inspired solos, and tenor saxophonist Don Braden provided a strong 
front-line balance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the object of attention was clearly Harrell. Fascinating to watch, even 
more fascinating to hear, he is one of the most remarkable performers on the 
contemporary jazz scene. 
</P>
<P>

ART REVIEWS; BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHS OF A BEAUTIFUL WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the more interesting Conceptual artists of the 1970s, Post-Conceptualist 
Christopher Williams refuses to acknowledge a mind-body split. His art 
addresses the senses, as well as the part of the brain that questions cultural 
codes, layered references, catalogues of inconsistencies and ideologies -- 
recalcitrant and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 At Margo Leavin Gallery, a new body of work titled "For Example: Die Welt ist 
Scho n (Revision No. 3)" looks like a suite of photographs by a flighty 
perfectionist. There are heavily saturated color portraits of Japanese women; 
crisp architectural studies of the headquarters of L.A.'s Department of Water 
and Power and straight images of museum collectibles that are transformed into 
exquisite, surreal icons before our eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the title of the exhibition asserts that "the world is beautiful," 
Williams' work is not strictly about beauty. It is rather about how beauty is 
constructed by the aestheticizing glance of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams borrows his title from a 1928 book of photographs by Albert 
Renger-Patzsch and August Sander, in which those German Modernists attempted to 
document all the beautiful things of this world (plants, animals, landscapes, 
buildings, etc.). In restaging this Utopian, if Sisyphean, project, he frames 
the politics of Modernism. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams demonstrates how the styles and genres of Modernist photography 
create various classes of objects and subjects. Ethnographic photography turns 
artifacts into curiosities; architectural photography transforms living spaces 
into ruins; nature photography evacuates the natural. The result is a world not 
merely beautiful, but regulated: processed, labeled, colonized and contained. 
</P>
<P>
 The political critique implicit here has been explicit in Williams' earlier 
work, most notably in "From Angola to Vietnam" and "Supplement." Postmodern 
obliqueness is deployed to challenge Modernist claims of objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in the end we are left precisely where we started, with a disparate 
group of beautiful photographs. This isn't a bad place to be, but neither is it 
the place where Williams' art is most important.

 Shackelford's Synthesis: In his first one-person exhibition at Ace 
Contemporary Exhibitions, Stephen Shackelford reveals not only a good working 
knowledge of recent art history but an impressive synthetic imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Stirred into one, big, aesthetic melting pot is a less bombastic take on 
Dennis Oppenheim's mechanized operatics, a more playful reading of David 
Ireland's Duchampian ethics, a diluted version of Robert Morris' hard-line 
threats and a satirical barb at Matthew Barney's absurdist athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter shows up in "Fly Chair," a bright orange chair suspended from the 
ceiling's rafters by a network of bungee cords, with a large propeller bringing 
up the rear and a motor crafted from a weed whacker in the front. During 
performances, Shackelford pilots this low-tech, anti-futuristic, but apparently 
efficient vehicle. During the exhibition, it remains empty, less an index of 
the artist's physical derring-do than a mark of his smart-alecky nature. 
</P>
<P>
 If this piece is still, nothing else in the room is. Everywhere are buzzes, 
whizzes and blasts. 
</P>
<P>
 In one corner an amplifier magnifies the sound of an electric guitar 
repeatedly striking the wall, in a surprisingly rhythmic kind of head-banging. 
Elsewhere, a punching bag spins in circles, its tinker-toy propeller moving so 
quickly it's as dangerous as a buzzsaw. Box springs and a clean, white pillow 
look more inviting, but as soon as your head touches the pillow, heavy-metal 
music blares. 
</P>
<P>
 Like second-prize winners at a science fair or elegant solutions to 
non-problems, Shackelford's devices are provocative but somewhat beside the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so a large installation in which a silent, pitch-black room is suddenly 
transformed into a firefly-filled night sky. The viewer's body triggers a 
motion sensor that causes a legion of mechanized, buzzing objects to swarm 
overhead. In turn, Shackelford triggers in us a dramatic shift in perception, 
as well as the vertigo we crave from science, technology and (come to think of 
it) art.

 Stouthearted Men: What is it to be a man? 
</P>
<P>
 This is the question Daniel Kaufman asked 75 men, aged 11 to 92, including 
Guardian Angels, retired lumberjacks, attorneys, dry cleaners, gang members and 
Zen priests. Their handwritten statements, along with photographic 
self-portraits each shot with the aid of Kaufman and a 30-foot cable-release 
cord, are now on view at Newspace. 
</P>
<P>
 It is interesting that Kaufman insists each subject control his own portrait, 
choosing the context, props, lighting, etc. Control is, of course, among the 
most stereotypical of masculine attributes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a man, to me, means being in control of my life . . . sometimes of 
other people's lives," notes one individual clad in black leather and studs. 
More interesting, however, is that, despite everything, so few of these men 
actually seem to be in control. 
</P>
<P>
 One, who identifies himself as "proud and gay," photographs himself in his 
closet. Another, a fireman pictured in uniform clutching a squirting hose, 
notes that masculinity is "showered" on men, seemingly unaware of the irony. An 
up-and-coming corporate type with a fat cigar between his teeth writes that "a 
man is firm; a woman is soft." Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar -- but not 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the so-called men's movement represents a valid interest in redefining 
(or at least interrogating) masculinity, Kaufman's survey doesn't go very far 
in that direction. On the whole, his is a pedestrian effort whose sum never 
adds up to more than its individual parts. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be because Kaufman himself seems to be the only man involved who is 
interested in ceding control. For the artist, however, this is a dangerous 
position to take. Allowing 75 different people to have a voice may be 
exemplary, especially in light of the myth of the solitary, masculine 
artist-genius. Here it results in little more than a lot of noise.

 Splashy Sarcasm: Does spirituality exist in a world where pilgrims trek to Las 
Vegas as if it were Mecca? What might a consumerist mandala look like? When 
ignorance masquerades as populism, who benefits? 
</P>
<P>
 In new work at Rosamund Felsen Gallery, Karen Carson asks serious questions, 
though her tongue is planted so firmly in her cheek that they occasionally come 
out garbled. 
</P>
<P>
 With signage that looks as though it were picked up ready-made at the hardware 
store, lettering as easy to read as names on the shirts of gas station 
attendants and graphic images that might have been snatched off pinball and 
slot machines, Carson's large, vinyl banners play at a familiar, down-market 
vernacular. Less plebeian are the messages her splashy standards spell out, 
which concern birth and death, the body and the soul, the self and the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Translated into either/or propositions, these mimic the structure of Western 
metaphysics, the format of a late capitalist opinion poll, the appeal of 
fundamentalist religion and the all-or-nothing mentality of a gambler. Such 
juxtapositions are intriguing, though their power is muted by a marked sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
 This strategy usually works for Carson, but here her tendency to play it for 
laughs interferes with larger plans, suggesting that this project is not quite 
finished.

THEATER REVIEW; SHAKESPEARE COMES TO VIVID LIFE IN 'ALMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you are among that very vocal group that thinks William Shakespeare did not 
write the plays, you might look in on Gregory Bell's "Alms for Oblivion," 
Shakespeare Orange County's first 1994 production. 
</P>
<P>
 It might change your mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Written and performed by Bell, under Sherman Howard's crystal-clear direction 
at Chapman University, "Alms" is an introduction to the Bard, popping through a 
time warp to make it perfectly clear that contrary to the opinion of some 
scholars he is not uneducated; he is conversant with court figures and their 
shenanigans, and he is a poet. 
</P>
<P>
 He also admonishes us that his literary children should not be taken from him 
any more than the children of any proud parent should be.  
</P>
<P>
 Bell's Shakespeare is very convincing, primarily because a ton of research has 
allowed him to create the full-blooded, rounded figure of a man, a playwright, 
a family man -- even though he strayed in several directions -- and a father 
who grieved because his wife, Anne, would not join him in London, where his 
work took him. 
</P>
<P>
 This Bard is a man of all time, at home wherever -- even on present-day Venice 
Beach (which he calls "lost Italy"). He stumbles on stage over an anachronistic 
metal folding chair and professes his amusement at such modern-day 
accouterments as sunglasses, hair that is tinted neon colors and shoes with 
wheels. But that's only a conceit to draw the viewer with him back in time.  
</P>
<P>
 The first act is light, airy, gossipy and detailed, with the many moments and 
moods that lead Shakespeare eventually to London and to the Globe. He is a 
raconteur, a wit, willing to poke his elbow at his listener to punctuate a joke 
or take a pratfall to make a point. 
</P>
<P>
 The second half of the evening slowly develops into something darker. Here we 
find a portrait of the maturing Shakespeare, bemoaning the early death of his 
son Hamnet, finding his way through the labyrinthine puzzle of royal politics 
and cogitating on the rewards and disadvantages of fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's Shakespeare grows in size and develops a deep, ocher patina. At the 
end, he quotes Prospero from "The Tempest." Shakespeare is at the end of his 
own tempest; when Prospero speaks of breaking his magical staff, the poet 
breaks his quill pen. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Howard has given Bell an intricate framework for his insightful 
portrait, physically inventive, varied in tone and splashing joyfully over the 
playwright's life like a cascade of recalled incident and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, however, Bell's variegated hues and delicate pirouettes of intellect, 
both in writing and performance, that give life to his creation. 
</P>
<P>

St., Orange. Tonight through Saturday, 8 p.m., Sunday, 3 p.m. $18-$20. (714)

TV REVIEW; 'REAL WORLD' AS MTV SEES IT: ENTERTAINING 3RD-YEAR KICKOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As far as social anthropology goes, it's got a good beat and you can dance to 
it. Yes, it's time for another shotgun wedding -- or shotgun melting pot -- of 
disparate twentysomethings as the third season of MTV's "The Real World" 
commences tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the awesomely pre-furnished apartment where seven lucky lab rats 
will be thrown together and peeped upon for 4 1/2 months is in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the new S.F. roommates arrive with flowers in their hair? Will bloodshed 
and/or lovemaking ensue, or are we just in for several months of dirty-dishes 
bickering? Will we wish them all dead at 21? More significantly, can "The Real 
World" hope to compete with the unreal world at this late date, now that 
"Melrose Place" has finally gotten good 'n' popular and proven fiction stranger 
than truth? 
</P>
<P>
 The good news -- or maybe not, if you're prone to guilt about your voyeuristic 
pleasures: Even with an untested crop of new kids on the Lombard Street block, 
the premiere is inordinately entertaining, and the follow-up episodes previewed 
equally so.  
</P>
<P>
 As before, MTV slowly introduces the quirks of the seven, bringing some of 
them to the pad in pairs. Cory, 20, a very suburban San Diego lass, takes the 
train up with Pedro, 22, a Cuban-born Floridian who has a surprise to share 
with her and his other new 'mates: He has full-blown AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere that same day, Judd, 24, a savvy aspiring cartoonist from Michigan, 
is taking a cab into the city with Rachel, 23, an Arizonan of Latino descent, 
and she has an even bigger shockeroo to spring on the gang: She's a (you better 
sit down for this) Young Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Also sharing the peanut butter are three S.F. residents: Pam, 26, an Asian 
American med student; Mohammed, 24, an African American musician and poet; and 
white punk Puck, 25, a perpetually scabbed bike messenger who proudly blows 
snot rockets, has "I don't use utensils, ever" as his eating motto and is 
easily the most likely to be voted out of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems like just about everything is represented here -- except maybe crippling 
introversion. The demographic spread is artificial but perversely and 
educationally fun; naturally, there will be emblematic confrontations over 
issues of race and AIDS awareness as well as body odors, though it takes till 
the third episode for the first roomie to be reduced to tears. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Real World" has its season premiere with two consecutive episodes 
beginning at 10 tonight on MTV.

KITCHEN-SINK OMELET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY ROSBOTTOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This large omelet, which is made in the style of a Spanish tortilla, takes 
only about 25 minutes to assemble and prepare. Chopped onions and garlic are 
sauteed in a heavy skillet. Next, paper-thin potato slices are lightly browned 
in the same pan, and a mixture of beaten eggs and cheese is added. The omelet 
is cooked until the eggs are almost completely set; then the dish is set under 
the broiler for a few minutes to finish the cooking. The omelet is unmolded and 
garnished with chopped tomatoes and cilantro. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because so many people are watching their cholesterol and fat grams, I used a 
minimal amount of butter in this dish and replaced eggs with egg substitutes -- 
with great results. And, although this omelet made a fine, improvised entree, I 
am planning to use it soon for a Sunday-morning brunch. POTATO AND JACK CHEESE 
OMELET 
</P>
<P>
 6 large eggs or equivalent of egg substitute 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 pound nonfat or low-fat cream cheese, broken into chunks 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup shredded Jack cheese with peppers 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup finely chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1 baking potato, peeled and cut into 1/8-inch-thick round slices 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup diced, seeded tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
 Place eggs, cream cheese and Jack cheese with peppers in mixing bowl. Whisk 
well until mixture is well blended. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Generously spray 9- or 10-inch heavy skillet with non-stick cooking spray. Add 
1/2 tablespoon butter to pan and set over medium-high heat. When butter is hot, 
add onion and saute until tender, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 minute 
more. Remove mixture from pan to side dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Spray pan again and add remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter. When hot, add potato 
slices and cook, stirring and turning, until golden on each side, about 5 
minutes. Spread cooked potatoes to cover entire bottom of pan. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. Then evenly spread garlic-onion mixture over top. Pour in 
egg mixture and cook, using spatula continuously to loosen edges, about 10 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 When eggs are set but still not completely firm, place pan 5 to 6 inches under 
broiler to finish cooking, 2 to 3 minutes. Run spatula around edges and under 
omelet to loosen. Invert onto serving plate. Garnish with tomatoes and 
cilantro. Cut into 6 wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 4 to 6 
servings.

A CRY FOR SWEET SIMPLICITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE LEVY BERANBAUM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I always knew that bakers were a different breed. After all, it takes a 
special type of temperament to make one willing -- in fact, desirous -- to 
weigh and measure with precision. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until my visit to the Lenotre School in Plaisir, France, that I 
discovered just how much the rest of the culinary world looks at us as 
oddities. In France, bakers are referred to as "the military," only a ganache 
away from the fanatic title "St. Cyr" (equated with West Point) reserved for 
the chocolatiers. 
</P>
<P>
 In this country, many upscale restaurants also have separate work stations for 
pastry chefs. 
</P>
<P>
 This special interest and attention has inevitably led to some instances of 
overpresentation, in which a fledgling pastry chef may feel compelled to follow 
the trend of tortured trapezoidal presentations, brilliant when executed by a 
skillful technician but often ridiculously unnecessary when not. 
</P>
<P>
 I am beginning to yearn for homey and inviting pastry, carefully prepared, but 
alive. It was at Manhattan's Mad 61 where I found a perfect example: a panna 
cotta, prepared by pastry chef Stacie Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 This Italian dessert is similar to a caramel custard but made with gelatin 
instead of egg yolk for a lighter, cleaner taste and an intriguingly resilient 
texture. In fact, it is a dessert of such astonishing purity and simplicity 
that I knew I would want to enjoy it again and again.  
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Pierce shared her recipe, which is a refined version of one given 
to her by an Italian friend's grandmother. Pierce's addition of sweetened 
condensed milk results in a velvety texture and rounded creamy flavor. In 
addition to the caramel version, she recommends adorning panna cotta with 
nothing but fresh seasonal berries. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, this dessert is simply nothing short of heaven. PANNA COTTA 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups whipping cream, preferably not ultra-pasteurized 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise (if using Tahitian, use 1/2 bean) 
</P>
<P>
 1 envelope plus 3/4 teaspoon unflavored gelatin 
</P>
<P>
 Stir together cream and sweetened condensed milk in 4-cup heat-proof measure. 
Add vanilla bean and sprinkle gelatin on top. Let stand at least 5 minutes. 
Scald mixture either in microwave oven on HIGH (100% power) 3 minutes, or in 
saucepan on stove-top over medium-low heat, until small bubbles form around 
periphery, stirring often. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean. Strain mixture. Pour into caramel-lined 
molds or, if to be served plain, poured into 6 lightly oiled (6-ounce or 
3/4-cup capacity) ramekins or custard cups. Cover tightly with plastic wrap. 
Refrigerate at least 4 hours or up to 3 days. 
</P>
<P>
 To unmold, run small spatula around edge of each ramekin. Place serving plate 
over top and invert, inserting metal spatula into side between Panna Cotta and 
ramekin to create air pocket. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Variation: 
</P>
<P>
 To serve with caramel sauce, stir together 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water in 
small, heavy non-stick saucepan until sugar is completely moistened. Place over 
medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves and syrup is 
bubbling. Stop stirring completely and allow syrup to boil undisturbed until it 
turns deep-amber color (350 to 370 degrees on candy thermometer). 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately remove from heat and pour syrup into glass measure (sprayed with 
non-stick vegetable spray) to stop cooking. Use greased tablespoon to quickly 
pour 1 tablespoon caramel into each ramekin, turning and rolling ramekin until 
caramel evenly coats sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Refrigerate ramekins until caramel is hardened, or allow to harden at room 
temperature. Pour Panna Cotta into ramekins. Cover tightly and refrigerate at 
least 6 hours, preferably overnight, to allow caramel to liquefy. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : Rinse used vanilla pods well under hot water and dry in warm spot 
several days until totally dry. Use pods to flavor sugar or sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 If caramel hardens before you've finished pouring into all 6 ramekins, 
microwave few seconds until pourable.

DOLLAR CLIMBS, PULLING STOCKS, BONDS WITH IT

<P>
 The dollar rebounded from its postwar low against the Japanese yen Wednesday, 
bringing relief to stocks and bonds, whose fortunes had sagged this week along 
with the ailing U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 But prices plunged in commodities ranging from grains to gold, taking a 
closely watched inflation index sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar had tumbled through the key psychological level of 100 yen Tuesday 
as the Federal Reserve Board showed no signs of defending the greenback, 
prompting traders to quote ever lower dollar-yen rates in a test of the central 
bank's resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments Wednesday by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who said the United 
States and other industrial nations are ready to act if necessary in response 
to the recent plunge in the dollar, helped shore up sentiment in financial 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned by recent movements in the (foreign) exchange markets," Bentsen 
said in a statement. "We are carefully monitoring developments." 
</P>
<P>
 The comment was viewed as a warning to currency speculators that intervention, 
involving massive dollar purchases as well as a hike in U.S. interest rates, is 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar recovered in late New York trading to close at 100.95 Japanese yen 
after crumbling Tuesday to a new post-World War II low of 100.35. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the German mark, the dollar rose to 1.605 marks from 1.594 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The steadier dollar and falling bond market interest rates after several 
unsettled sessions helped the stock market snap a three-session string of 
losses that clipped more than 97 points from the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow finished up 16.80 on Wednesday at 3,724.77, well below its best levels 
of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outpaced declines on the New York 
Stock Exchange by about 3 to 2. Big Board volume fell to 251.11 million shares, 
down from 298.73 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among market measures comprising a wide range of stocks, the NYSE composite 
index rose 0.87 to 249.97, and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.75 to 
453.09. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller issues advanced 3.95 to 712.74, 
thanks largely to a recovery in technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street reacted calmly to comments about the economy by Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan, who testified before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 On general economic matters, the Fed chief said the outlook for further growth 
is bright, and he implied that additional interest rate hikes aren't imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 But Greenspan's remarks to the House Budget Committee didn't put worries about 
the dollar completely to rest. He said the Fed must be mindful of the dollar's 
movements and that the central bank, along with the Treasury, is monitoring the 
currency closely. 
</P>
<P>
 The inflation-wary bond market found added relief from dramatic declines in 
commodity prices, which were largely attributed to dips in precious metals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities, which recently jumped 
to a 3 1/2-year high, skidded for the third consecutive day, sinking 3.42 
points to 230.87. 
</P>
<P>
 The index dropped on declines in grain prices, livestock, cotton, coffee, 
cocoa, sugar, energy and precious metals. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold fell $4.80 on the New York Comex to close at $389.50 per ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's key long bond plunged to 7.40% from 7.49 on 
Tuesday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, shot up 1 point. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds also got a shot in the arm from unexpectedly robust demand for new 
five-year notes sold by the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Among stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Silicon Graphics spurted 2 3/4 to 21 3/4 after the company and AT&T 
announced a joint venture to sell "video servers" that will deliver TV 
programs, movies and music through communications systems such as AT&T's 
long-distance network. AT&T was unchanged at 55 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Electric lost 1/4 to 45 7/8 after the company said the chief 
executive of its Kidder Peabody brokerage unit, Michael A. Carpenter, had 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 * Zenith Laboratories fell 1 3/4 to 14 1/8. It said it received a warning 
letter from the Food and Drug Administration on testing procedures at a plant 
in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel was up 1 3/8 to 59 1/4 and Oracle Systems rose 1 1/4 to 36 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sheffield Medical Technologies, a medical development company, climbed 1 
3/16 to 5 3/4 on news that it acquired a worldwide license to an HIV-AIDS 
vaccine technology under development. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Paging fell 1 5/8 to 6 5/8 after saying late Tuesday that its 
operating income and cash flow over the next few quarters may be lower than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Argosy Gaming rose 1 to 13 1/2. It said it opened a casino in the Kansas 
City area. 
</P>
<P>
 Recoveries on European stock markets helped put American investors in a buying 
mood. London's Financial Times-100 average rose 20.2 points to close at 2,960.4 
points, while Frankfurt's DAX average ended at 1,994.42, up 11.15 points. Share 
prices also closed higher in Paris and Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average ended down 231.84 points at 
20,581.32, and Mexico City's Bolsa index was down 0.06 point at 2,257.63.

INSIDE OUT: FASHION; IT'S THREE TIMES THE CHARM ON HOT 'TEEN SCENE

 Aset of 16-year-old Minnesota triplets won 'Teen magazine's annual Great Model 
Search in Santa Monica on Tuesday night. Since the Dahm sisters are identical, 
they counted as a single entry -- one of 20,000 received by the L.A.-based 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister just sent in our pictures without even telling us," Erica Dahm said 
by phone from a suite at the Hotel Nikko. Nearby, sisters Nicole and Jaclyn 
were having their hair pulled into French twists and "tons" of makeup applied 
for the big event later that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 We asked Erica to describe what she/they look like. "Well, we have long, 
straight blond hair and we're not tan." This last part elicited disagreement 
from her siblings, but Erica stood fast. "And we have blue eyes." No argument 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous winners of the 13-year-old 'Teen model search, we learned, include 
"Saved By the Bell's" Tiffani-Amber Theissen and Ford Agency model Paige 
Tiffany Hall. (If only Faith Ford, co-star of "Murphy Brown," had stuck a 
Tiffany in her name somewhere, she might have been spared the humiliation of 
finishing as a mere finalist.) 
</P>
<P>
 Merging their beings into a single beauty contestant doesn't strike the 
sisters as odd. "We do everything together -- go shopping, play softball, 
regular teen-age things." But around fifth grade, the sisters did decide to 
quit dressing in matching outfits. Now, they wear the same styles -- but in 
different colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads turned when the Dahms cavorted at the beach the other day. One was asked 
to play volleyball, which, of course, is the ultimate gesture of acceptance in 
L.A., we explained. But what people most often blurt out to the triplets is, " 
'Are you related?' " Erica said, bursting into giggles. " 'No,' I tell them, 
'we just look alike.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody's Perfect: The preview of Donna Karan's fall collection at Neiman 
Marcus next week comes on the heels of considerable travails at the designer's 
New York-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 David Golden, the former chief financial officer, has sued the fashion firm 
for $60 million, charging he was fired because he refused to lie about 
corporate finances. The company is suing Golden for gross negligence, and 
company officials claim that he was lewd in his interactions with female 
employees. The New York Times this week detailed how, in recent years, company 
expenses have outstripped profits, partly because of lagging fragrance sales 
and tardy shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at I. Magnin this week, we noticed workers moving the contents of 
the Donna Karan boutique into a smaller space that previously housed the Sonja 
Rykiel collection. Rykiel was bumped up to Karan's larger space. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Karan's critics crow, they'd best consider her passionate and loyal 
fans. Women's Wear Daily reported Monday that customers in New York ordered 
$650,000 worth of the designer's fall collection during a recent two-day trunk 
show at Bergdorf Goodman. And when the collection stops in Beverly Hills next 
week, look for a standing-room-only crowd.

 Red Hot Chili Baron: Jones is the latest groovy restaurant to be opened by 
Sean MacPherson and Jon Sidel -- who, as you know, already count the Olive, 
Small and Swingers among their cool eateries. On Saturday night, Anthony Kiedis 
arrived at the place looking pretty cool himself. The Red Hot Chili Peppers' 
little lead singer dashed in wearing a '20s-style aviator cap, its chin straps 
all aquiver. We imagined him bopping from one hot spot to another behind the 
wheel of a vintage, uh, airplane. Has he been trading beauty secrets with Diane 
Keaton again? 
</P>
<P>
 Bad Behavior: What are the most frequently shoplifted beauty products? No, 
it's not some $400-an-ounce perfume or tiny, $100 jars of wrinkle cream. 
Surprisingly enough, the five beauty items real-life shoplifters covet most, 
according to Real Beauty magazine, cost less than

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; MUSHY DECLINE TO SENTIMENTALITY FOR BRITISH 
ARISTOCRACY; ASPECTS OF ARISTOCRACY B Y DAVID CANNADINE ; YALE UNIVERSITY 
PRESS; $30, 320 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After David Cannadine's "The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy," a 
vintage work on the subject, his essays in this new book come more or less as 
bin-ends. The title is exact: They develop in detail a wide miscellany of 
subjects encompassed but not necessarily explored in the first book. 
</P>
<P>
 They range from a thorough account of the debts of the Dukes of Devonshire to 
the elaborate and purposeful ceremonials devised by the viceroy, Lord Curzon, 
in India. They include a seriocomic history of the explosive Baron Strickland 
of Sizergh, who managed -- serially and sometimes simultaneously -- to be a 
member of the House of Commons, a peer in the House of Lords, a political 
leader in Malta, and a colonial governor in the Leeward Islands and Tasmania. 
They include a sunny portrait of a family of gentry, a faintly rancorous list 
of the scandals attending Winston Churchill's aristocratic relatives, and a 
sketchy account, whose rancor is not in the least faint, of Vita Sackville-West 
and Harold Nicolson. 
</P>
<P>
 The rancor comes from generally laudable exasperation. Cannadine is not 
exactly an iconoclast; the British aristocracy has long stopped producing icons 
of either the grand or villainous sort. What has enveloped it, over the past 
half-century, is a mushy, in part trans-Atlantic, sentimentality: the romance 
of country houses and a gracious way of life.  
</P>
<P>
 Cannadine, who writes in lively, dispassionate and fascinating detail about 
the shifting structures of power and wealth in an aristocracy that took longer 
than any other to decline, is attached to his subject, diverted by it, fair to 
it. But he can't stand the mush. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually he is cool and only mildly ironic. But his war against the reverential 
sometimes carries him too far. His essay about Churchill's relatives, the 
Marlboroughs and others, aims to place Winston in the context of an 
aristocratic tradition that has more to do with the rakehell antics of the 
Regency bucks than the tactful shabby tweediness of their successors. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one reason, he notes, that so much of the British upper class so 
passionately distrusted him up until the war. Fair enough. But in detailing the 
scandals and implying that Churchill himself was not free of them, Cannadine 
uses altogether too many "it was rumored" and "it was widely whispered." He can 
sound like the Daily Mail -- or the Times of London quoting the Daily Mail. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Vita and Harold, Cannadine is irked by their stylish legend and, 
particularly, by their son and biographer, Sir Nigel Nicolson, whom he calls 
the family "publicist, editor, apologist." They were snobs and mediocrities, he 
argues. 
</P>
<P>
 True, in part, and in part patently untrue. Nicolson's diaries and sketches 
may lack grandeur, but they do not lack greatness. Boswell was once 
underestimated in the same way Cannadine underestimates Nicolson: both were 
silly, snobbish and had no dignity. And both wrote of their worlds with 
unquenchable life.  
</P>
<P>
 Insisting that Nicolson's homosexuality is a relatively minor issue, Cannadine 
writes that his first book was a study of Verlaine, "the French poet and 
degenerate." Yes . . . as in Faulkner, the American novelist and lush, and 
Flaubert, the French writer and syphilitic, and. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from these two essays and one or two that are rather humdrum, 
Cannadine's bin-ends include some splendid items.  
</P>
<P>
 Lord Curzon's meticulous organization of the Durbar honoring the coronation of 
Edward VII included his choice of the books to be placed in the bookcases of 
each of the visiting dignitaries and his order to delete from "Onward Christian 
Soldiers" the stanza with the line about "Crowns and Thrones may perish." The 
point of the grandeur was to make the Indian notables realize what a great 
thing it was to be part of the Empire. "Just as oratory was verbal advocacy, 
ritual was visual advocacy," this early imperial spin-master wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Baron Strickland, half-Maltese and half-British by origin and 
about 200% British by conviction, would make a first-rate movie if Sir Alec 
Guinness were still available for such things.  
</P>
<P>
 Strickland was never quite accepted by either side; his vigorous pro-empire 
stance alienated the Maltese and embarrassed London. He had the sense, though, 
to marry into a powerful aristocratic family; his career was a succession of 
posts won by string-pulling (and obsessively devoted work) and lost by 
quarreling (and obsessively devoted work). 
</P>
<P>
 Cannadine has the art to assemble a suggestive portrait out of straightforward 
sentences and scholarly facts.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the best essays in the book seems simply to be a chronological account, 
yet it has the savor of evocation. It describes the rise of the Cozen-Hardy 
family from an 18th-Century Norfolk farm to the ownership of breweries and 
thousands of acres to several generations of lawyers, judges, editors and a 
barony; and then fading, in one case into a bed-and-breakfast establishment.  
</P>
<P>
 Scrupulous, gentle, civic-minded and connected by marriage to the leading 
families in the county -- among them, the mustard Colmans -- they represented 
what for most of this century many of the English would think of as England at 
her best.

RSVP; OFFICIAL MAYORAL HOUSE GETS READY FOR FACE LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Daly is to the Los Angeles mayor's Getty House what Jacqueline Kennedy 
Onassis was to the White House. Similarly, she gives wonderful parties. 
</P>
<P>
 With Daly at the microphone, there was spontaneous combustion Tuesday evening 
on Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills at the Palladian estate of Lynda and 
Stewart Resnick (owners of the Franklin Mint). 
</P>
<P>
 Under an arbor of red bougainvillea were 13 antiques and special packages, 
such as new kitchen cabinets, needed for the Getty House Restoration Foundation 
in its efforts to spiff up Mayor Richard Riordan's official Hancock Park 
residence. (He won't live there, but city entertaining will take place there.) 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 250 guests had spectacular fun setting up consortia to buy the 
items offered wholesale from cooperative antiquarians and designers. Things 
started slowly. Then the Resnicks signed their name to the Sheraton bench that 
will go in the garden sitting room. The message was relayed to the crowd, 
sipping champagne and nibbling hors d'oeuvres from silver trays. The action was 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 As Chris Lewis put it, "I put the muscle on Leonard Straus," and Pat Haden 
joined as the trio signed for the Georgian secretary for the living room. Beth 
Lowe pondered signing for the Regency table to grace the front hallway. "Bob's 
out of town, if he doesn't know and maybe with some creative banking . . . " 
She did it. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirlee Fonda and Chris and Dick Newman created a "politics makes interesting 
bedfellows" group with Michael and Lori Milkin, Sheila Allen and Debby and Tom 
Tellefson to syndicate purchase of the mahogany bureau circa 1810. Verna Harrah 
and Leonard Rainowitz put dibs on the chinoiserie dining-room cabinet. With 
husbands again absent, Jane Eisner, Libby Doheny, Judy Angelo and Carolyn 
Cleator splurged to purchase the California Rinaldo Cuneo painting "Desert 
Hills" for the mayor's study. 
</P>
<P>
 The real panic set in as the $20,000 kitchen cabinetry was unclaimed toward 
the end. Janet and Bruce Karatz, Dick and Chris Newman and John and Jeanie 
Cushman enticed, "Want to go in with us?" Ron Burkle, Bill and Nadine Tilly, 
Jerry and Sharon Katell, and who knows who else, did. Said Cushman, the 
real-estate magnate, "The kitchen is the most important room in a house." 
</P>
<P>
 After they bought, each syndicate was photographed with Riordan and received 
bronze Getty House medallions. Now, the work looms. Designers will decorate 
room by room to execute the color palate of "Getty green," claret red and 
parchment chosen by Susan McConaghy. Work begins Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone was saying it was one of the best parties of the year. The Resnicks' 
chef, Dennis Starks, created Towers of Pisa rice, beet and carrot mousses, 
chicken legs and rare beef, consumed while the palms swayed and the chitchat 
billowed under white umbrellas. Then, Daly told all to move into the 
Versailles-like Resnick living room where Christy's Christopher Burge sent 
vibrations through the chandeliers, goading generous bidders in a live auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Margie Petersen bid $5,500 to lunch with Riordan, Charles Elkins picked up two 
seats for "The Three Tenors" concert July 16, and Jay Grodin snagged six World 
Cup tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening still on a high, the crowd circulated through the Resnicks' music 
room, marveling at the period beaux-arts furniture before consuming a dome of 
chocolate mouse, rice pudding and blackberry tarts in the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 The engraved crystal gavel presented to the Resnicks said it all, "A million 
thank-yous."

 The Scene: A churning, celebrity-rich crush of bodies was shoe-horned into the 
Hollywood Athletic Club on Tuesday night for Pool Aid '94, the third annual 
celebrity pool tournament to benefit AIDS Project Los Angeles. The event 
included the tournament (grand prize, a Suzuki RF 600 motorcycle), an auction 
of such items as Sting's autographed bass and a "celebrity challenge table" 
where just plain folks could drop balls with their favorite stars. 
</P>

 Who Was There: Celebrity hosts Luke Perry, Stephen Baldwin and Jason Gedrick 
joined dozens of celebrities from TV, movies, music and sports, including Gene 
Simmons and Paul Stanley from KISS, Ben Stiller, Ellen Barkin, Judd Nelson, 
Catherine O'Hara, Nicole Eggert, James Wilder, Melanie Hutsel, Leonardo 
DiCaprio, retired football pro Eric Dickerson, plus throngs of rank-and-file 
Hollywood types, which pushed the head count to about 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment: As if all the celebrity shoulder-rubbing wasn't entertaining 
enough, performing onstage were Linda Perry (no relation to Luke) of 4 Non 
Blondes, Mark Curry and Hell's House Band, Robert Swordes, Threshing Floor and 
headliner Urge Overkill, who brought with it a surprise onstage visit from the 
Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "Stephen Baldwin and I worked on a film and we'd shoot pool when we'd 
do night shoots, because we'd be so tired we couldn't sleep," says Pool Aid 
mastermind Gedrick ("Sweet Justice," "Class of '96"). "When it got to be 
competitive, I figured, 'Hey, instead of making this an addiction and some sort 
of compulsion on our parts, why don't we turn it into something good?' And it 
became Pool Aid. It's insane how huge and awesome it's become."  
</P>
<P>
 Biggest Fan: Fan Mary Lew came out from Hackensack, N.J., donating more than 
$200 for one reason -- to play Baldwin. "I've never held a pool cue in my 
life," Lew says. "But it's going to benefit AIDS (projects) and that's what 
it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Freebies: What else? Safe-sex information and condoms -- including the new 
Reality condoms for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: The event raised $50,000. "The money," says Bill Jones, APLA's 
director of development, "goes to a wide variety of different programs that 
help people who are living with AIDS -- food banks, counseling, a dental 
clinic, legal services and about 25 other services like that that really help 
people in very practical ways."

WESTSIDE WATCH: THE GAWKERS REMAIN ON ROCKINGHAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson's neighbors are less accustomed than most to hosting a media 
freak show. 
</P>
<P>
 For its residents, part of the attraction of Rockingham Drive and its 
surrounding streets has been the isolation from messy urban scenes of any sort. 
The price of this tranquillity comes high -- the Simpson mansion is estimated 
to be worth $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 With its manicured lawns, lush landscaping and luxury cars, the neighborhood 
whispers wealth. It even smells good: The night air at this time of year is 
filled with the scent of night-blooming jasmine -- an odd sensory counterpoint 
to the thwacking blades of news helicopters overhead the night O.J. was holed 
up in the driveway of his mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 THE LOOKY-LOOS: Since the slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman, the neighborhood has been invaded not only by media hordes, but also 
by the hoi polloi. Some pose for photos standing in front of O.J.'s gates, 
which are festooned with hand-lettered signs, mostly of support for the former 
football star. The signs are wildly incongruent with their upscale 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, just after O.J. had arrived home in what would be the end of 
the freeway pursuit of him, carful after carful of looky-loos parked on 
Brentwood side streets. People ran at breakneck speed, some with tots in tow, 
to get as close as the police would allow to the scene in Simpson's driveway.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the steady stream of gawkers has not abated. They're even debating 
the merits of the case out there: One day this week, a woman screamed at a man, 
who posted a sign unfriendly to O.J. The two got into a verbal sparring match 
that escalated when several others joined in. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J.'s neighbors are coping as best they can. One man said the situation made 
him feel vulnerable. "It's a whole world falling apart in a second," said the 
neighbor, who did not want his name used. 
</P>
<P>
 As for their once-tranquil enclave, the neighbor said: "This used to be a 
low-profile area. Not anymore."

 PASADENA: In a claim filed last week, the city's former safety officer alleges 
he was fired for reporting safety problems in the city's Fire Department. 
George Leverette, 59, said he learned in April that a Cal-OSHA investigation of 
alleged safety problems within the Fire Department was under way. He attempted 
to cooperate with state investigators and resolve the problems internally, he 
said, and reported communications and training deficiencies in the Fire 
Department directly to Fire Chief Kaya Pekerol on May 17. Leverette was fired 
from his $49,000-a-year job June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: The city has declined to settle a federal lawsuit against the city 
by the American Civil Liberties Union. On May 25, the ACLU of Southern 
California filed a suit against the city, claiming that its courtesy code 
ordinance is unconstitutional. The code, which requires City Council members to 
be courteous, was approved in 1992, partially because of a volatile councilman, 
Isaac Richard. In response to the lawsuit, the City Council has approved a 
resolution, noting that the courtesy code applies only to conduct, not speech. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN MARINO: Local business leaders, aided by City Manager Keith Till, are 
hoping to create a business improvement district to revitalize the Huntington 
Drive area, where "For Lease" signs are becoming common. The district would 
cost businesses $65,000 for marketing, planning, street banners, flower pots 
and other promotional items. The average business would pay $17.59 per month, 
with a maximum of $25 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 SIERRA MADRE: Two residents are planning to circulate a citywide initiative 
petition to restore two Planning Commission seats eliminated by the City 
Council last month. Caroline Brown and Linda Thorton have published a notice of 
their intent to circulate a petition to amend Sierra Madre's code to restore 
the Planning Commission to seven members. In approving the change last month, 
the council said a five-member commission would be more efficient and have 
fewer absentees. The two community activists must gather the signatures of more 
than 10% of Sierra Madre's registered voters to get the issue on the ballot. 
They need 746 signatures.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: SOCCER'S SUCH A HIGH FOR THIS GUY, HE TAKES TO CAMPING ON 
HIS ROOF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SOCCER STUNT: Manhattan Beach writer Paul Harris has for years been a soccer 
player, a soccer referee and even a soccer writer. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the start of the World Cup competition in Los Angeles and 
several other U.S. cities, he was alarmed at the apathy people had about the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 So last Friday, he took a bold step: onto the roof of his home. He vows to 
stay there as long as the U.S. team remains in the tourney. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, he was still there, camped out on a specially designed perch. 
He has with him a TV set, sleeping bag, writing desk and extra clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Americans don't understand the passion of the game," said Harris, 
59. "So you have got to do something that people cannot ignore. I had to 
isolate myself fully in the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 While the games are played, Harris covers himself with a blanket and watches 
the TV set so he's not bothered. At other times, he sleeps on the perch, writes 
about soccer and eats his meals.  
</P>
<P>
 This "World Cup Nest," as he calls it, has caught the attention of passersby, 
and cars have slowed down to honk in support of his stunt. His wife painted a 
sign on the garage: "USA All the Way." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors on the 800 block of 9th Street were at first a bit curious about 
Harris' camp-out but have gotten used to it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't make any noise," he said. "I'm also the Neighborhood Watch captain. I 
can see everything from up here."

 A BENEFACTOR'S BARBECUE: For the past three years, Torrance restaurateur 
Alfredo Garnica has funded the cost of reading tutors at Towne Elementary 
School in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the students got a taste of their benefactor's business. Garnica 
threw a barbecue at Victoria Park in Carson for more than 700 of the school's 
children, who feasted on hamburgers, hot dogs and ice cream. He has held the 
barbecues since he first adopted the school in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started talking to the principal, and she told me how poor the kids were, 
two and three families to a house, wearing the same clothes, never having 
enough food," said Garnica, 38. "I didn't believe it at first." 
</P>
<P>
 At the first barbecue, he was most struck by the youngsters' voracious 
appetites.  
</P>
<P>
 "They went back for seconds and thirds, and they were putting food in their 
pockets. I asked them, 'What are you going to do with that?' And they said, 
'We're going to take it for dinner.' That's when I realized it was real." 
</P>
<P>
 Garnica knows what sort of life many of these children lead: He grew up poor 
in Gardena. "I know what it's like to eat nothing but beans and tortillas and 
Kool-Aid," he said. "I never knew what dessert was; I never tasted cheesecake 
or prime rib until the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, Garnica got a job working for a restaurant and rose from 
stock clerk to manager in two years. Combining savings and loans, Garnica 
bought a country-Western bar in Hawthorne and eventually turned it into the 
California Bar and Grill, a bar and restaurant serving burgers, sandwiches and 
salads. He opened a second location in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gives everything he has to the kids," said Donna Haupt, one of Garnica's 
restaurant managers.

 SIGNS OUT OF TIME: With the California primary over, candidates have to clean 
up their mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Many South Bay cities have ordinances that require candidates to take down all 
the colorful campaign signs that have adorned local street corners and strip 
malls for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, some candidates have been slow to follow the law. 
</P>
<P>
 On a five-mile stretch of Sepulveda Boulevard in Torrance, primary losers Ron 
Florance, David Bohline and William Dannemeyer all had campaign signs up the 
day after a city-imposed two-week deadline for their removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance, who lost in the 36th Congressional District, had more than 15 signs 
along that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly is a blight on the city," said Monte McElroy, environmental 
quality administrator for Torrance. But sign rules vary. Carson and Lawndale, 
for example, allow a 30-day grace period for removing signs.  
</P>
<P>
 So who's to blame? The candidate has to find out the rules for each city, 
McElroy said. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 6 years old when I discovered I wanted to become a firefighter. My 
mother and I were watching Dad fight a fire, and when my mother wasn't looking, 
I snuck away and climbed up one of the ladders and got on the roof. One of the 
firemen saw me and grabbed me and carried me down, and of course my mother was 
horrified. But I knew then that that's what I was going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Larry D. Schneider, 66, Los Angeles City Fire Department battalion chief, 
whose family includes nine firefighters.

CITY HALL NEWS; JUDGE DISMISSES CHALLENGE TO ELECTION OF ARCADIA COUNCILMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying there was insufficient evidence of election fraud, a Superior Court 
judge has thrown out a legal challenge to Arcadia City Councilman Sheng H. 
Chang's April election victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Stephen E. O'Neil dismissed the lawsuit Thursday filed by Chang's 
opponents, citing a lack of clear and convincing evidence of significant voter 
fraud that would have altered the result.Chang won his seat by 287 votes on 
April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge granted a motion for dismissal made by Chang's attorney, Walter 
Shatford III, after two days of trial, in which only the citizens group, 
Arcadia Citizens for Fair Voting, presented its case. The group includes 
Geraldine Fasching, the wife of defeated Councilman George Fasching, and Shao 
Hua Wen, former president of the Arcadia Chinese Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleged that Chang won because of illegal votes cast by non-residents 
and non-citizens. It accused his campaign of registering unqualified voters, 
paying for votes and illegally collecting absentee votes. Almost all 
accusations revolved around absentee ballots cast by people with Asian 
surnames. 
</P>
<P>
 Min-Mey Chang, who ran her husband's campaign, testified that she improperly 
mailed five sealed absentee ballots to the city clerk because she misunderstood 
the election laws. The judge said the incident fell far short of organized 
voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Two residents from Los Angeles testified that a friend of the councilman's 
wife had persuaded them to vote illegally in Arcadia. However, the judge said 
he was not convinced that these incidents were linked to the Changs or that 
other non-residents voted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just so excited. It's like I'm a kid again," said Chang, 51, a Chinese 
American physician and the first member of an ethnic minority ever elected to 
the council.

COMMUNITY CALLS MAN'S FLYERS RACIST; ACTIVISM: MATERIAL WARNS WHITES OF DANGER 
OF BEING KILLED BY LATINO GANGS. SELF-DESCRIBED 'AGITATOR' SAYS HE'LL CONTINUE 
DISTRIBUTING THEM UNTIL THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ACTS TO STOP GANG VIOLENCE IN 
OAKWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man whose group has handed out 2,000 flyers warning whites they are in 
danger of being shot by Latino gangs has vowed to continue distributing the 
material unless the business community steps up concern over gang violence in 
the Oakwood section of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Community and business leaders were quick to denounce the flyers, distributed 
last weekend in upscale shopping districts near Oakwood, as racially 
inflammatory and counterproductive to ending the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Crayton, a self-described "agitator" operating out of Wesley House, a 
crisis intervention center in Oakwood, expressed hope this week that the flyers 
would scare off customers at local businesses, which would in turn motivate the 
business community to pay more attention to rampant gang violence in Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not really here to hurt anyone, but we're dying here," said Crayton, a 
black activist who claims to represent the Shoreline Crips, a local gang. 
"We're tired of carrying casket after casket. The smell of death is everywhere, 
and we're trying to share our misery with the people we spend our money with." 
</P>
<P>
 A war between black and Latino gangs in Oakwood has killed at least 17 people, 
many of them innocent bystanders, and injured 55 during the past nine months. 
Crayton blames the bloodshed on "outside boys," mainly Latinos, and described 
the flyers as an attempt to show whites that Oakwood is under siege. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers were distributed to shoppers last weekend on Abbott Kinney 
Boulevard and on Main Street in Venice and Santa Monica -- artsy, upscale 
commercial districts bordering Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers read: "WARNING UNSAFE AREA; White Customers Shopping in this 
Section of Venice May be Shot Dead by Mexican Gangs -- Without Notice." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Department officials said there is no record of any whites 
being shot by Latino gangs in the shopping areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A second handout was distributed in much smaller numbers within the Oakwood 
community. It urged residents to "stop snitching" on local black men. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see black men carrying guns through your yard, support him -- give 
him a sack full of bullets!" the flyer said. "Our youths are out there risking 
their lives to protect you older folks from Mexican bullets." 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who have complained that their efforts to end the gang war have been 
stymied by a lack of cooperation from Oakwood residents, were muted in their 
response to the flyers, which appear to be protected under the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody wants to pass out flyers, even if it's something untrue and 
something we don't like, there's nothing we can do," said Sgt. Andrew Smith of 
the LAPD Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 But community leaders were quick to distance themselves from the handouts, 
some of which bore the name of the New Bethel Baptist Church in Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything about it," said New Bethel Pastor Marvis Davis. 
"Whoever wrote it put the name of the church in there so people would read it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Prang, a spokesman for City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district 
includes Venice, condemned the flyers as "absolutely outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're inflammatory, they're counterproductive, they're not helpful in 
addressing some of the very serious problems we're having in Oakwood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants, tormented by a lingering recession, handled the flyers as if they 
carried a deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Most said they threw them away almost the moment they received them. An 
employee of one store walked around snatching flyers from car windshields 
before anyone had a chance to read them. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Tantau-Smith, a board member of the Abbot Kinney District Assn., refused 
to discuss the flyers in her jewelry store this week within earshot of 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the privacy of a back room, she defended the Abbott Kinney business 
community as deeply concerned about the violence and active in trying to stop 
it. She also disputed the notion of an all-white business community, noting 
that many stores in the district are black-owned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really appalled that there's racism out there as intense as this flyer 
indicates," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zeneta Kertisz, a gallery curator on Abbott Kinney, termed the flyers a 
genuine, if misguided, call for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate they had to go to such an extreme to get the attention," 
Kertisz said. "You tend to scare people and alienate people even more, but I 
understand why they're doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers, according to a credit line at the bottom, were distributed by 
"Venice Pathfinders," a "group of Local African-American Men . . . Committed to 
Real Solutions for the Venice Situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Crayton, publisher of a controversial newsletter that is critical of Oakwood 
community leaders, described himself as the roving coordinator of the 
organization. He contends Oakwood is the target of a land grab by well-healed 
developers, a popular theory among some locals. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview this week, he called for federal low-income housing 
complexes to be patrolled by members of his group; the establishment of a "free 
enterprise zone" in Oakwood, Santa Monica and the waterfront to "convert the 
Shoreline Crips into small businesses," and a meeting with local business 
leaders to discuss the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 If such a meeting is not held, Crayton vowed to hand out flyers at tourist hot 
spots like the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica and Ocean Front Walk in 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 He voiced little sympathy for the businesses that could be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the extreme, they're talking about an inconvenience or a loss of profit," 
he said. "We're talking about loss of life."

PASADENA COUNCIL KICKING ITSELF OVER WORLD CUP SNAFUS; GOVERNMENT: SOME 
OFFICIALS COMPLAIN OF LACK OF CITY RECOGNITION AND LESS-THAN-ANTICIPATED 
REVENUES. AN EXPERT NEGOTIATOR MAY BE NEEDED FOR FUTURE EVENTS, THEY SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even before the World Cup tournament began last week, Pasadena officials felt 
as though they had taken some cleats in the shins from the organizers of the 
international soccer event. And some community leaders now wonder whether the 
city has what it takes to negotiate with world-class organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have bungled this affair," Councilman Isaac Richard said this week. "We 
have allowed this community to be exploited by the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 First, World Cup organizers vetoed a plan to raise money to promote economic 
development in the city, in which the Chamber of Commerce would have sold 
soccer tickets at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Los Angeles -- not Pasadena -- was made the site of Soccerfest, the 
World Cup's official festival of related recreational and promotional 
activities. When city officials tried to set up their own soccer festival, 
World Cup officials refused to let it operate within the World Cup-controlled 
venue on game days at the Rose Bowl (where the competition's championship 
culminates on July 17) and allegedly warned away major sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last week came the ultimate insult: The words Los Angeles were affixed 
to a World Cup sign right outside the Rose Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we ought to . . . direct the staff to have (the sign) removed and 
present it to Los Angeles as a gift," Councilman William M. Paparian quipped 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebellious City Council members also proposed tearing down the sign and 
defiantly opening their festival, called Soccer Carnaval, on game days at a 
venue farther from the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city has backed down on all three plans, eventually acknowledging that 
World Cup organizers were within their rights on all the issues. The Soccer 
Carnaval, which is opening a week later than originally planned, will run only 
on non-game days. And a sign recognizing Pasadena was added in front of the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems have prompted a new look at the way the city deals with the 
organizers of mega-events, especially since the Rose Bowl's hosting of the 1993 
Super Bowl also failed to live up to its original promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard and Councilman Chris Holden said in recent interviews that Pasadena 
should consider hiring an expert negotiator in the future to cut the best deal 
with top-of-the-line organizers. City Manager Philip A. Hawkey and his staff 
now handle contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minor incidents have turned into major problems," Holden said. "We keep 
crying over the spilled milk, but it's milk that we spilled." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of hiring an expert negotiator has appeal for other city leaders as 
well, including Chamber of Commerce President-elect Michael Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's bureaucrats, Hawkins said, have "proven over and over again that 
they're not real good at it." 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the recent disputes, World Cup officials held their ground, backed 
by the terms of their contract to use the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey, said that some of the problems might have been avoided through an 
agreement allowing the city more leeway, but he defended his staff's overall 
performance given the size of the event. The city manager opposes bringing in 
an outside negotiator for future events. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of this has to do with ongoing, day-to-day relationships," he said. "To 
have a negotiator would make it more impersonal, and in some instances, more 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 One expert who has negotiated major events with Pasadena said the council, not 
its negotiators, is the problem.

 "A professional negotiator would be hamstrung by the same things that, in my 
opinion, have hamstrung earlier negotiations . . . very simply lack of clear 
direction and communication from the council," said the expert, who asked to 
remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflicts over Soccer Carnaval, a monthlong festival of soccer, crafts and 
live entertainment, could cost the city a considerable amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for Soccer Carnaval were launched last year after Pasadena lost 
Soccerfest. Soccer Carnaval was supposed to generate $3.2 million, including 
money from major sponsors. About $650,000 was expected to go to Pasadena to 
help pay for as much as $1.2 million in city expenses for security related to 
the games at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city never secured any major corporate sponsors, and organizers now 
estimate that Pasadena will get $300,000 or less from its festival. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have accused World Cup officials of doing everything possible 
to hurt Carnaval, including discouraging prospective sponsors and spiking plans 
to open the festival on game days, when the biggest crowds are expected in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 But the World Cup organization's agreement with Pasadena included "sole and 
complete" control of the Rose Bowl and surrounding area, and the World Cup 
officials did not want Carnaval on game days. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup Assistant Vice President Brad Rothenberg said there is no rivalry 
between Carnaval and Soccerfest. He said World Cup, for security purposes, did 
not want more people flooding the area on game days. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg also denied that those associated with the World Cup had warned 
away sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey acknowledged that the city had no clear-cut grounds to challenge the 
World Cup decision to keep Carnaval from operating on game days. Nevertheless, 
Pasadena had hoped World Cup officials would give in to the city's request, 
Hawkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, World Cup was within its rights to block the chamber's plan to sell 
game tickets at a profit to raise money for economic development, Hawkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hawkey said the disappointments are minor compared to the economic 
benefits that the games will bring to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of fans are expected to spend millions in local restaurants 
and stores. In addition, World Cup is paying Pasadena $2 million for use of the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena had expected to receive about $1 million from the 1993 Super Bowl but 
was forced to settle for about $150,000 after the local organizer, the Los 
Angeles Sports Council, said the event yielded less money than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, which had considered taking legal action, decided to accept the 
lesser amount and not antagonize the Sports Council, which could help the city 
secure future Super Bowls.

SENDING A MESSAGE ON HISTORY TO JAPAN; EMPEROR'S VISIT: ASIAN AMERICANS FROM 
SAN GABRIEL VALLEY JOIN PROTESTERS SEEKING APOLOGY FOR ATROCITIES DURING 1930S 
AND '40S. 
</P>

<P>
 It might have been a parade, snaking down an entire city block with Korean 
folk drummers, Chinese flags and Buddhist monks with flowing robes and shaved 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 But the placards gave the truth away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan, Apologize, Do Not Distort History," one sign said. "Asian Holocaust, 
the Forgotten Holocaust," read another. "Japanese Militarism Is Nazism," said a 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the placards were held aloft proudly by Gloria Tong of Monterey Park 
and her daughters Faith, 12, and Sheena, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tongs were among 400 Asian Americans, many from the San Gabriel Valley, 
who marched for three miles in the hot sun on Tuesday, weaving from Chinatown 
to City Hall to the Japanese Consulate to demand that the Japanese emperor -- 
who was lunching with Mayor Richard Riordan in Downtown Los Angeles -- 
apologize and pay reparations to victims of crimes against humanity committed 
by his country during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar protest held last week in Barnes Park in Monterey Park drew 400 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Tong said she brought her children to Tuesday's demonstration because "they're 
Chinese, they should learn about the massacres by the Japanese, and they're not 
going to learn it in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through this protest, at least the Japanese emperor can bring back a message 
to his people," Tong said. "Kids in the new Japanese generation need to know 
the truth. The government should pass on to a new generation that they did 
something wrong. They have to recognize and say they did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Germany, which was forced to atone publicly for its war crimes, Japan 
has successfully downplayed its role as an aggressor in World War II, and 
Japanese history textbooks make few references to the estimated 30 million 
people that Japanese troops killed from 1931 to 1945 in China, Korea and 
Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Emperor Akihito has expressed "regret" over the war between Japan and the 
United States, but has not formally apologized to the United States for his 
country's role in the war. Kaoruko Sasamoto, press officer for the Japanese 
Embassy in Washington, disputed the number of people killed by Japanese troops, 
adding: 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan is deeply remorseful about the events of great dimension (that occurred 
during the war) and the suffering and sadness caused to the people of the 
United States and Asia. Based on this, Japan has decided to be a pacifist 
country and contribute to world peace and prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over reparations has only grown hotter with the passage of 
time. While demands for apologies and reparation did not come up during Emperor 
Hirohito's 1975 visit to the United States, they are being pressed upon his son 
nearly 20 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of the movie "Schindler's List" has spurred on Asian Americans, 
some civic leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the Holocaust West being publicized, but no one's talking about the 
Holocaust East," said Ting Huang, a spokesman for one of the organizing groups, 
United Against Japan for Justice and Reparations Committee, which is based in 
Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was one of several groups that presented the Japanese Consulate 
with a letter to Akihito. A letter from the reparations committee asked Akihito 
to "assume the historic responsibilities for the Japanese aggression against 
China and the world, thus closing one of the most shameful and barbaric eras in 
Japan's history." 
</P>
<P>
 While the war is more than half a century old, many of the protesters were 
young. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Fan of Temple City, whose father was executed by the Japanese in Shanghai 
during the war, brought his son Fred, 23. The younger Fan said he was there to 
prevent history from being whitewashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard a lot of things from the Japanese, like, 'Can't you just forget 
it, it was 50 years ago,' but that's like telling the Jews, 'Can't you just 
accept the Holocaust,' or telling Japanese Americans, 'Can't you just accept 
the internment camps,' " Fan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang Yun, a South Pasadena filmmaker and Southern California chairwoman of the 
Washington-based reparations committee, was another who marched. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before Pearl Harbor, millions and millions of Chinese were slaughtered at the 
hands of the Japanese, and the world turned a deaf ear. I just don't understand 
it," Yun said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Japanese American groups, politicized by their fight for reparations from 
the U.S. government for the internment camps of World War II, are also putting 
pressure on Japan. One who drew cheers Tuesday was David Monkawa, staff 
director of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Committee for Redress and 
Reparations, a Japanese American organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we (Japanese Americans) are one of the only groups to get 
reparations for crimes, but we're here to offer our heartfelt and undying 
support to get reparations for all those of you who have been victims of 
Japanese imperialism in World War II," Monkawa said.

INGLEWOOD OKS LICENSE FOR CARD CLUB AT HOLLYWOOD PARK; GAMING: OFFICIALS SEE 
CASINO AS THE CITY'S FINANCIAL SALVATION. THEY PREDICT $4 MILLION IN REVENUE 
THE FIRST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hailing the Hollywood Park card club as the fiscal savior of Inglewood, the 
City Council voted Tuesday to issue a license to the club, which officials 
expect to contribute about $4 million in taxes to the city for fiscal year 
1994-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're elated to issue this license," said Mayor Edward Vincent before the 
vote. "That card club saves us all -- it saves the residents of Inglewood." 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office gave two former National Football League 
executives, Don Klosterman and Eddie LeBaron, preliminary permission last week 
to run the club. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had counted on having $4 million from the card club to balance 
its budget, and the casino's planned July 1 opening date means Inglewood should 
make at least that much in taxes, said City Manager Paul D. Eckles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put that budget together a few months ago when we didn't have as good an 
idea of when the opening would actually be," Eckles said. "But now that $4 
million becomes really tangible. It makes me feel confident that that's a 
realistic number." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said the city's deficit occurred because state and federal funds the 
city typically receives dried up during the recession.  
</P>
<P>
 Eckles has estimated that the card club eventually could provide $10 million a 
year to Inglewood's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 With the prospect of $4 million from the club plugged into the city's 
finances, the council voted Tuesday to accept a $55-million budget for fiscal 
year 1994-1995 that does not expand city programs but contains no layoffs. The 
council is scheduled to vote on the budget next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I propose to do is watch the card club open and see how it does before 
increasing . . . the budget," Eckles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-table card club, which will feature Asian games, is scheduled to be 
open around the clock, seven days a week. It is to be located in the track's 
Cary Grant Pavilion, along with retail shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park has hired about 1,500 people to work as dealers, security 
guards and cooks in the casino restaurant. In the last year, about 6,300 people 
have applied for jobs at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval of the card club has led to talks about reopening the Airport 
Park Hotel and building a 16,000-seat amphitheater, and has renewed interest 
from development companies in revitalizing the Market Street-La Brea shopping 
district, Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, Hollywood Park made a deal with Klosterman, who was general 
manager of the Los Angeles Rams in the 1970s, and LeBaron, a former Washington 
Redskins and Dallas Cowboys quarterback and executive for the Atlanta Falcons 
in the 1980s, allowing them to run the club, if the partners would pay the 
racetrack $3 million a month in a multiyear deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the state attorney general's office uncovers financial troubles or 
concerns with their backgrounds during a routine investigation, Klosterman and 
LeBaron will be granted a permanent gambling license by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some loose ends with regard to their background and the financial 
aspects, but generally those issues are pretty minimal," said Debbie Wiley, 
chief of the attorney general's gaming registration unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at the big picture when we do this and try to have a comfort level 
with the applicants, and we already have that," Wiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The card club suffered several major setbacks before finally gaining state 
approval.  
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature approved a bill that would have allowed Hollywood Park to run 
the card club, but Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed it. He agreed with Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren, who opposes licensing clubs owned by unknown stockholders because the 
state does not have a full-time investigative commission to oversee gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 The city then found investors, including Edward Allred, a partner in the Los 
Alamitos Race Course, to run the club, and it was scheduled to open in January. 
But the attorney general's office refused to issue a license on the grounds 
that Allred previously owned stock in out-of-state gambling businesses.

FISHERMAN ARRESTED OVER SEA LION'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Pedro commercial fisherman has been arrested for allegedly putting an 
explosive device in a fish and feeding it to a wild sea lion nicknamed Jelly, 
blowing up the animal's head.  
</P>
<P>
 The sea lion's bloody death near Berth 73 in Los Angeles Harbor was witnessed 
by numerous horrified onlookers, police said, including a group of 
schoolchildren who were passing by in a harbor tour boat. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy investigation, Los Angeles Port Police arrested Vincent 
Terzoli, 39, at his home in San Pedro on Friday on a felony charge of cruelty 
to animals in the April 8 incident. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 
three years in prison and a $20,000 fine. After his arrest, Terzoli denied 
injuring the animal, telling reporters: "This is nothing but a lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Port Police Lt. Martin Renteria said Jelly, also known as Oscar, had for 
several years been a frequent visitor at waterfront commercial fish markets in 
the area and often was fed fish scraps by workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jelly was part of the community," Renteria said. "He was almost a pet. It 
would be like somebody going out and killing your dog or cat." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Terzoli was aboard his docked fishing boat, the St. 
Joseph, when he fed the sea lion a fish carcass booby-trapped with a "seal 
bomb," a device similar to an M-80 firecracker that has the explosive power of 
a quarter of a stick of dynamite. The sea lion swam away with the fish in its 
mouth and was eating it when the seal bomb went off. The animal's body sank and 
was not recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Renteria said the motive for the attack was not known. But many commercial 
fishermen complain that sea lions, which have become increasingly numerous in 
recent years, often steal their catch. Fishermen are allowed to use seal bombs 
as a last resort to scare away persistent sea lions but are not permitted to 
injure them. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Erica Martin of the environmental crimes division of the 
Los Angeles district attorney's office is prosecuting the case. "We believe the 
killing of sea lions is rampant among fishermen," she said. "We intend to send 
a message that this will not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
 However, a woman who works in the commercial fishing industry in San Pedro, 
who declined to be quoted by name, said she hopes not all fishermen will be 
blamed for the alleged actions of one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid this is going to give fishermen a bad name," she said. "I think 
most fishermen have a lot of respect for all sea life. All the people who work 
on the wharf were sad to see something like this happen. That sea lion wasn't 
bothering anybody."

DUARTE COUNCIL SENDS PROPOSED UTILITY TAX TO VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to avert a recall drive against the mayor, the City Council has 
voted to put a proposed utility tax on the November ballot rather than decide 
the issue itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will decide Nov. 8 whether they want the utility tax, which for one 
year would be set at 3% but could increase to as much as 5% before it ends in 
1999.The initial 3% tax on water, electricity, telephone and cable television 
bills would cost the average household $5 to $10 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the people support the utility tax and I just want to go-ahead 
verify this on the ballot," Mayor Margaret F. Finlay said. 
</P>
<P>
 David A. Covert, spokesman for the Duarte Taxpayers Group that opposes the 
tax, called the decision "a victory for Duarte taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 "The residents of this community will get to decide whether they want higher 
taxes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, the taxpayers group filed documents to initiate a recall 
drive against Finlay after the council told staff to draw up a budget for the 
fiscal year beginning July 1 to eliminate a $1.5-million shortfall that 
included a new 3% utility tax. Finlay was targeted because the group considered 
her the leading tax proponent. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's special meeting, the council voted 4 to 1 to let the voters 
decide the issue. Council members John F. Fasana, Ginny Joyce, James D. 
Kirchner and Finlay supported the motion. Councilman Phil Reyes dissented. "I 
think people are tired of taxes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the budget plan, the shortfall would be made up by $880,000 in cuts, 
including the layoff of two employees, $194,000 in fee increases and $480,000 a 
year from the proposed 3% tax.

 The poster depicts a stunning sight: an unarmed man confronting a tank in Tian 
An Men Square during the Chinese crackdown on democracy in 1989. The Chinese 
government never acknowledged the number of people killed and the names of 
those wounded or imprisoned -- or identified the man who defied the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the message on the poster doesn't seem necessary though it's 
hard to ignore its power: "One Man standing against madness kindles anew the 
sparks of freedom and elevates the spirit of Man. How can we not stand with 
him?" 
</P>
<P>
 That is one of the 15,000 domestic and international political posters that 
Venice resident Carol Wells has collected through the Center for the Study of 
Political Graphics, the West Hollywood nonprofit organization she founded five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center, she collects, preserves, documents and circulates the poster 
art among schools, universities and galleries nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Each poster makes a statement about human struggle. With pictures and few 
words, the posters track social and political history. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells staunchly believes that any image, in the proper context, can help 
educate people. "By preserving graphic legacies of historical movements for the 
next generation you provide an accessible link to the suffering of all people. 
. . . Putting a poster of Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney -- two Jews and an 
African American who died together in the '60s for the same (civil rights) 
cause -- next to posters of anti-Semitism and white supremacy is making a 
powerful connection." 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the posters in the collection have been donated by 
"people (who) know that we're the only organization which will use them in the 
same spirit and meaning they (were) made: to create a better life," Wells said 
from her office at the center, which is supported by grants and individual 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The posters in the collection date to 1905. Although many are worth thousands 
of dollars, they are never sold. Unlike most library collections, these posters 
are often loaned and are readily available for viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the posters were inspired by American politics and concerns -- 
women's rights, the labor movement, AIDS, peace movement and Latino and 
African-American issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1990, Wells proposed doing an exhibition of posters having to do 
with American intervention in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The following month, the Persian Gulf War began. She scrambled for posters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened so fast. The ultimatum date to Iraq (to get out of Kuwait) was 
Jan. 15, 1991. Six days after the bombing started we had 30 posters from high 
school students and a half-dozen from professionals. The show was titled 'The 
Price of Intervention From the Korean War to the Gulf War.' The point was that 
each of these wars failed in its publicly stated goal. We tried to make 
connections for people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit received a great deal of media coverage because there was so 
little opposition to the war. "Dissent," said Wells, "is central to 
patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells is no stranger to dissent herself. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, she found it hard to make a connection between her studies -- her 
major was social work -- and her political activities at UCLA, where she 
participated in sit-ins for civil rights and against the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Alaska -- the last frontier, a place totally out of character with 
my life. I was a pacifist and here I am in a place where disputes were solved 
by gunfights." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells lived in a trailer and supported herself by holding down a combination 
of jobs like commercial fisher, folk singer, portrait painter and bartender. It 
was during her bar-tending days that she witnessed the gunfights. 
</P>
<P>
 She eventually returned to UCLA and entered graduate school. The day she 
registered for classes in 1970, four students at Kent State were slain by 
National Guardsmen during an anti-war protest, sharpening public opposition to 
U.S. involvement in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells had trouble reconciling why she was studying 11th- and 12th-Century 
French architecture while America was shooting its young. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it wasn't until she went to Nicaragua in 1981 that she saw how her two 
passions, art and politics, could be connected through poster art -- seeing the 
political posters associated with the Sandinista revolution made the connection 
obvious to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I realized what I wanted to do, it made no sense to wait two years 
to finish my dissertation. UCLA taught me that all art is political," she said. 
</P>

TOPICS; EDUCATION; PRINCIPAL'S CHALLENGE IS ONE FOR THE BOOKS; STUDENTS SURPASS 
LINDA KAMINSKI'S REQUEST TO COLLECTIVELY READ FOR 250,000 MINUTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Exasperated by television's enormous influence over children, some educators 
will do almost anything to get their kids to read. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Linda Kaminski. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaminski, Allendale Elementary School's principal, thinks it is inappropriate 
to bribe children to read with gifts or special treatment or a promise to eat 
worms, as one educator recently did. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want children to sustain an interest in reading, there has to be 
intrinsic motivation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why when Kaminski challenged her 500 students to read for a total of 
250,000 minutes in 25 days, she did not mention the reward that would await 
their success. 
</P>
<P>
 When the students, who are in preschool through the sixth grade, surpassed 
their goal, their reward fit their achievement. Kaminski brought everyone out 
to the school's playing field, where they could sit on the grass and read alone 
or with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 A pigtailed 8-year-old named Erica Morris sat on a purple and white striped 
towel. Her large eyes grew even larger as she turned the page of her book. 
"It's a mystery," she said as she held the book out to display its cover. "It's 
my favorite and so is 'The Secret Garden.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Erica said she enjoys reading books because of all the new vocabulary she 
learns and that she tried to read two chapters every day to help meet what 
parents and teachers called "the Kaminski challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Six-year-old James Wilson agrees. "I like books better than TV, because 
sometimes TV is too scary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaminski is so proud of her students' success that she is going to challenge 
them to read 1 million minutes next year. "Reading is something to love," she 
said. "I want them to discover that for themselves."

TOPICS; POLITICS; NEW COUNCILWOMAN DRAWS CONTROVERSY; THE APPOINTMENT IN CARSON 
OF MARY ANNE O'NEAL TO A VACANT SEAT OVER THE SECOND-HIGHEST VOTE-GETTER IN THE 
ELECTION ANGERS SOME AFRICAN AMERICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a planning commissioner, Mary Anne O'Neal reviewed meeting packets of 
information that were about an inch thick. As the newest member of the Carson 
City Council, the materials she wades through twice a month have expanded to 
three to four inches thick.  
</P>
<P>
 The controversy surrounding her grew with the workload. 
</P>
<P>
 It started only moments after she was appointed in May to the seat left vacant 
when Councilman Michael I. Mitoma was elected mayor April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of residents milled outside the council chambers, shaking their heads 
and asking about the procedure for a recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Others lambasted the council for rejecting the second-highest vote-getter in 
the election to pick O'Neal, who has never run for office. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the joke of the century," resident Tommie Williams told the council. 
"You all are a total embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though you think you've done a good deed for the community, I think 
you've made a mistake," said Harold Williams, who is no relation to Tommie 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Neal's supporters are equally vocal. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's probably the most gracious woman alive," said Mitoma, who appointed her 
to the Planning Commission and voted for her appointment to the council seat. 
Learning the ropes can take a couple of years, he said, but O'Neal's comments 
during meetings reveal that she has been doing her homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilman John H. Anderson was appointed to a seat on the council in 
1988. Remembering the criticism he endured, he offered his help to O'Neal, who 
will serve until the city election in April, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my experience, it was very difficult," Anderson said. "There were many 
people who wanted someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate many people wanted this time was Keith McDonald, part of United 
Voice, an African American political group that ran a slate of candidates. 
McDonald came in second to Lorelie S. Olaes in the April 12 election.  
</P>
<P>
 McDonald, son of Assemblywoman Juanita M. McDonald, was among the 11 people 
who submitted resumes to the council to indicate their interest in the vacancy. 
Although O'Neal is an African American, she was not a member of United Voice.  
</P>
<P>
 After O'Neal's appointment was announced at the May 17 council meeting, Olaes 
abruptly left the dais. Olaes supported McDonald for the open seat and said the 
city should consistently choose the second-highest vote-getter to fill 
vacancies.  
</P>
<P>
 Olaes said this week she has known O'Neal for several years and that her anger 
wasn't directed at her.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal supported Mitoma in the recent election, rather than his opponent, 
James H. Peoples, who is African American. Community members have suggested 
that Mitoma might be able to influence O'Neal because he chose her for the 
Planning Commission and voted for her appointment to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal said she believes the anger in the African American community stems 
from the lack of success for black candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I did not run for office, there was some frustration," O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial anger among some African Americans about the appointment may 
decrease as the community faces problems such as violence and community 
awareness, said United Voice President Walter Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 And friction among residents over how O'Neal got into office may decrease over 
time, Olaes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the community will be taking a wait-and-see attitude, but I think 
they will be pleasantly surprised," Olaes said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal said she's been trying to be a "good listening ear" for the city's 
residents, but she also knows budget cutbacks will mean "having to do more with 
less." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now she said she considers herself more of a community activist than a 
politician, but when asked about running for office in the next election, she 
answers like a seasoned politico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will wait and see. It's too early to tell," she said.

BRIEFLY; EDUCATION: LIBRARY OPENS HOMEWORK CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Students now have access to computers, printers, reference material and a 
stack of school supplies at the San Pedro Regional Branch Library. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch is the 10th Los Angeles Public Library to establish a homework 
center for students with funds provided by private corporations.It officially 
dedicated the center Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids for one reason or another don't have a place to do homework," 
library spokesman Robert G. Reagan said. "What (the libraries) are really 
targeting with all these programs is giving kids who might otherwise drop out 
of school an alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 The homework center allows students to write term papers, prepare for 
Scholastic Aptitude Tests, learn math and improve reading skills. CD-ROMs 
provide a wealth of reference data, Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's librarian Giovanna Mannino said the homework center is filled every 
day, even now that school is out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's actually busier in the summer," she said. "The children are using it for 
the fun of using educational computer programs and developing computer skills 
because most of them don't have a computer at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Mannino said a trained tutor has been working 15 hours a week to help students 
at the San Pedro branch, 931 S. Gaffey St. 
</P>
<P>
 The Library Foundation of Los Angeles got funding for the San Pedro homework 
center from Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilmington Branch Library will open the next homework center, he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: GLENDORA; CHARGES AGAINST SCHOOLTEACHER RAISED TO MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Criminal charges against a high school teacher were upgraded to first-degree 
murder Friday after one of the women she is accused to shooting in Glendora on 
June 1 died. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Ruth Greene, a 51-year-old former teacher of the year at Sunny Hills 
High School in Fullerton, allegedly shot her ex-lover, Loretta Coller, 62, of 
Glendora, and Coller's current companion, Martha Pereida, 49, of Alhambra, in 
Coller's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Coller, a retired teacher who was shot in the upper chest and whose spinal 
cord was severed by the bullet, died at 1 a.m. Friday at Huntington Memorial 
Hospital, said Glendora Police Sgt. Tim Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer said that Coller 
died of complications that set in as a result of the gunshot wound. She had 
been in a coma for the previous four or five days, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pereida, who was shot in the leg, was treated for her wound and released from 
a local hospital shortly after the incident. Greene still faces an attempted 
murder charge in the shooting of Pereida. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene has pleaded not guilty to both charges. She is being held at the Sybil 
Brand Institute for Women in Los Angeles on $300,000 bail. Her preliminary 
hearing has been set for Aug. 5.

EPA OFFICIALS TO DETAIL PLANS FOR TESTING, CLEANUP OF DDT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans for extensive testing in a South Bay neighborhood contaminated with DDT 
will be outlined tonight at a public meeting organized by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials also will answer questions about two nearby toxic waste 
sites, potential health effects and the agency's plans for cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was prompted by the discovery this spring of DDT-laced fill in at 
least two back yards north of West 204th Street between Normandie and New 
Hampshire avenues in an unincorporated area east of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA has excavated the two back yards and will test neighboring yards to 
determine the extent of the contaminated fill. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the contamination unleashed a public controversy, and some residents 
have complained of ailments such as nausea and headaches that they believe are 
linked to chemical contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, agency officials will report tonight on plans to test indoor air 
and tap water in some homes. They plan to check for chemicals from two nearby 
toxic-chemical sites: Montrose Chemical Corp., which is a former 
DDT-manufacturing plant, and the Del Amo Study Area, once the site of a 
synthetic rubber manufacturing plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose is a federal Superfund site, and the Del Amo site is a nominee for 
the Superfund list, which includes the nation's 1,200 most hazardous toxic 
waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum will begin with an open house from 6 to 7 p.m., in which residents 
can talk one-on-one with representatives from the EPA, county and state health 
agencies, potentially responsible companies and a community action group. 
</P>
<P>
 The public meeting will run from 7 to 9:30 p.m. Both events will be at the Van 
Deene Elementary School auditorium, 826 W. Javelin St., near Vermont Avenue.

WHERE PARENTS AND KIDS LEARN TO GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most surprising thing about being a parent, Oscar Guillen says, is 
learning that love is not all you need. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't do everything. You have to understand what children need; put 
yourself in their situation," said Guillen, a Peruvian native and member of 
Gardena Adult School's Child Observation class. "I had to learn to be my 
child's coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Guillen, his daughter Betsy, 5, and about 20 other parents with children in 
tow gathered last week at Guenser Park in Torrance for an end-of-the-year 
celebration of the class, which has met once a week since September. 
</P>
<P>
 The course, which has been offered since the 1930s, uses a hands-on approach 
to parenting, with adults and children participating in the class. In an age 
where divorce, single parenthood and children born out of wedlock are as common 
as colds, instructor Eileen Kapp says her class is needed more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents sometimes have false expectations of their children," said Kapp, a 
vibrant woman with a New York accent. "For example, they expect a 2-year-old to 
understand sharing. They don't."  
</P>
<P>
 Kapp, who has taught the class for 21 years, divides three hours evenly 
between children and adults. Preschool children learn phonics, pre-reading and 
math-readiness skills. Adults observe and use their time to discuss everything 
from nutrition to discipline techniques and trouble-shooting at home. Parents 
working toward a high-school diploma can get credit for the class.  
</P>
<P>
 "We really help each other out," said Steve Gmur, a class member with wife, 
Maria, and 5-year-old son, Robby. "It's fantastic. We can express frustration 
about kids with other parents who are experiencing the same problems." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, participants ranged in age from 20 to 60 and included fathers and 
grandparents and cut across ethnic lines, attracting whites, Asians, blacks and 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Ashimine, 61, said the adults and children feel comfortable enough 
to learn, and keep coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents need to get involved with their kids, but they don't always have the 
time," said Ashimine, who attends the class with her 3-year-old grandson, 
Michael, while his parents are at work. "My daughter does her best to come here 
when she has the time, or can get off. But it's hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Aileen Araki joined the class a few months ago and is one of its most vocal 
proponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son Steven has learned a lot," she said. "He wouldn't take part in groups 
before. He recently passed a pre-kindergarten test with very high marks. A 
teacher asked him where he learned so much, and he said, 'In this class.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Kapp, who plans to start an English-as-a-second-language parenting class in 
the fall, says she likes the eclectic nature of the group. "There's a very 
strong bond among new parents, grandparents, everybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident last week when the seven 5-year-olds in the class wore white 
mortarboards and "graduated" in the park under an arc of pink and blue 
balloons. As Kapp read off names, parents cheered and snapped photos. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really teaches kids to interact with each other," said Shari Johnson, a 
class member for two years. "She makes learning fun, she encourages the kids. . 
. . Basically, she teaches you how to love them."

TOPICS; ENVIRONMENT; WATER AGENCIES TO FIGHT REOPENING OF LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of local water agencies led by the Main San Gabriel Basin 
Watermaster will fight Browning Ferris Industries' decision to reopen the 
controversial Azusa Landfill to household waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The group filed a petition with the State Water Resources Control Board this 
month to stop BFI subsidiary Azusa Land Reclamation Co. from accepting 
household trash at the site, said Mark McDonald, attorney for the watermaster, 
the agency that distributes water from the San Gabriel ground water basin and 
oversees Superfund cleanup efforts of the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 The landfill in an old rock quarry south of the Foothill Freeway began taking 
household trash again May 19. It sits atop an aquifer that supplies water to a 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's foolish to believe this landfill won't threaten the region's water 
supply," McDonald said. The San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, a 
coalition member, has indicated that it will sue BFI if there is any evidence 
of ground water contamination from the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition said the state Court of Appeal and the state water board ordered 
the facility three years ago to stop taking household trash other than 
construction and demolition debris. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the operator lost a lengthy battle to expand the municipal trash 
landfill by 302 acres, with the judge saying enlargement would threaten the 
aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 But landfill operators say the court order and subsequent instructions from 
the state water board allow dumping of household waste in the existing 80-acre 
landfill and the placing of inert construction materials in the 302-acre 
expansion. At the time of the court order, they said, they thought the original 
site was full. But because of new mapping technologies and decomposition of 
waste, the company now says it has room for 160,000 truckloads of household 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition fighting the landfill also includes the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California, the Three Valleys Municipal Water District and 
the Upper San Gabriel Water District.

 The San Gabriel Valley Mosquito Abatement District is offering tips for 
residents with mosquito problems during breeding season, which starts with warm 
weather and extends to September. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mosquitoes transmit serious diseases. Female mosquitoes can transmit the 
St. Louis encephalitis virus, which can cause inflammation of the brain and 
spinal cord. Between 1984 and 1993, Los Angeles County had 25 reported cases of 
the virus, including one death. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials encourage residents to eliminate breeding sources such as 
standing water in buckets, planters, old tires, cans, jars and other 
containers. For residents who have ponds, the district will provide free fish 
that eat developing mosquito larvae. Information: (818) 814-9466.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; LIBRARY DIRECTOR RESIGNS FOR JOB IN INDIANAPOLIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena Library Director Edward M. Szynaka, who led the successful 1993 
campaign for a library tax, has resigned his position, effective Sept. 9, to 
head the larger Indianapolis/Marion County Library system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very exciting opportunity, one that I couldn't pass up," said Szynaka, 
46, who has headed Pasadena's library system for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indianapolis system, with its 22 branches, serves 1.2 million people 
compared with the 130,000 people served by Pasadena libraries, Szynaka said. He 
starts at $88,000 a year, about the same as his Pasadena salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Szynaka is leaving behind a financially stable library system, which had 
services restored after the passage of the library tax.

 Starting in the fall, children of Torrance workers who live outside the city 
must get a permit to attend schools in the Torrance Unified School District.  
</P>
<P>
 The school board voted unanimously Monday to revise the system that allowed 
workers' children from other districts to attend elementary and middle schools 
in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said enrollment has increased steadily for the past four 
years, creating the potential for overcrowding. The changes allow the district 
to give priority to Torrance residents.  
</P>
<P>
 Non-resident students who already attend school under the program will be 
allowed to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, non-residents may enter Torrance schools only by applying for an 
inter-district permit and will be admitted only if space is available. The 
permit program requires students to maintain good records in attendance, 
academic achievement and behavior. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; DESALTER'S SUCCESS MAY BE MULTIPLIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Part of the South Bay's vast underground water supply, which becomes salty 
from encroaching seawater, is made fit for drinking by a high-tech desalinator 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The C. Marvin Brewer Desalting Facility is the only plant in Southern 
California to use reverse osmosis to produce drinking water from brackish 
wells. The $2-million desalter began pumping in May, 1993, and provides 1.5 
million gallons of fresh water each day from two wells in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 As the cost of importing water to the area continues to rise, experts say, 
cleaning up local water sources will become more economical. Judging by the 
success of the Torrance desalter, more wells in the area probably will get 
reverse osmosis units, said Torrance Water Department analyst Charles J. 
Schaich. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts believe 20 to 30 wells in the South Bay could be retrofitted with 
desalting units. 
</P>
<P>
 In reverse osmosis, high-pressure pumps force water through membranes that 
filter out even the tiniest particles. Every few years the membranes must be 
replaced, but with only a daily visit from a monitor, the desalter runs itself 
24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The two wells became 10 to 20 times saltier than fresh water and were closed 
in 1985 because of ocean water that crept inland underground. Water officials 
attribute the saline plume that has contaminated wells in the South Bay to 
overzealous pumping of ground water early this century. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1920s, water pumped from local wells watered farm fields and sated 
thirsty families. Industrial use also drained the underground water table, 
allowing saltwater to move in. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the pumping grew, the ground water started lower and the seawater started 
coming in," said John Onkka, a water resources planner for the Central Basin 
Municipal Water District. "By the 1940s it became a very serious problem."  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, voters opted to create the Central Basin district, and its 
counterpart West Basin Municipal Water District, to manage water resources. 
Central Basin, which owns the Torrance desalter, provides about 60% of the 
water used in Los Angeles County's coastal cities.  
</P>
<P>
 To push back the seawater, engineers built a series of injection wells that 
run from Los Angeles International Airport south to the Palos Verdes Hills. The 
pumps force water into the ground, increasing pressure and pushing the ocean 
water back toward the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 20 years to complete the string of injection wells, and by the time 
they started pumping, a pool of briny water was trapped inland and is still 
migrating through the local aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance desalter taps the leading edge of that 600,000-acre-foot pool of 
salty water. One acre-foot is about the amount of water a family of five would 
use in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20% of Torrance's water comes from wells. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; FIRE CHIEF RETIRES IN SETTLEMENT WITH CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire Chief Michael Olson, who was under investigation for alleged misuse of 
city property, has retired as part of a settlement with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty.Norman Herring said the City Council, meeting in closed session, 
decided Monday to end an investigation of Olson's actions, opting instead to 
reach a settlement with him "to bring this matter to a close." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson, who served in the Fire Department 26 years and was fire chief nine 
years, could not be reached for comment. But Mayor Albert Vera said Olson's 
retirement will be effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the settlement, Olson gave up any rights he may have had 
under workers' compensation and wrongful-termination laws but will receive his 
retirement pension of about $60,000 a year, according to the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson, 51, was placed on administrative leave May 30, when city officials 
began to look into allegations that he had allowed the misuse of city property. 
The city has declined to elaborate on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Before being placed on administrative leave, Olson had applied for a 
disability retirement and workers' compensation benefits, stemming from open 
heart surgery in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mutual agreement," Vera said of Olson's retirement. "It was in the 
best interest of the city." Had the city continued its investigation and not 
granted Olson's retirement request, the ensuing termination proceeding would 
have been lengthy and expensive for the city, Vera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Fire Chief Gary Hoover will continue to serve in that role until the 
city selects a new chief, Vera said. CAROL CHASTANG

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; HIGH SCHOOLS TO BE SHUT DURING LUNCH

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concern about student safety and complaints about high school students' 
behavior off campus led the school board to close high school campuses during 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 At a board meeting Monday, the Torrance Unified School District voted 
unanimously to keep all students at school during lunch, beginning in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said neighbors complained about students littering and 
creating disturbances.  
</P>
<P>
 Students will be allowed to leave school grounds only if they have written 
permission from their parents on a particular day. Currently, students may 
request a pass that allows them to leave every day. School officials estimate 
that 70% of the students enrolled this year have permission to leave campus for 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the transition, the district has added vending carts that serve fast 
food at the high schools. The district also recently added fencing around 
Torrance and South High Schools. MARY GUTHRIE

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COVER STORY; MOUNTAINS OF TRASH TROUBLE; VISITORS TO SAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, Donna Thompson found a dinette set during the annual Operation 
Supersweep in San Gabriel Canyon. The year before that, Marie Lopez stumbled 
upon a bag of hypodermic needles. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the pickup yielded more routine refuse: three tons of bottle caps, 
food wrappers, beer cartons and used diapers, all artifacts of the canyon's 3 
million annual visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 With burgeoning urban areas pushing up against the mountains of the Angeles 
National Forest, as many as 30,000 people visit San Gabriel Canyon each day on 
summer weekends, bringing with them some of the urban ills they seek to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The scars of recreational use are evident along the stream bed. A paper plate, 
still smeared with food, floats in the water. Graffiti disfigures the rugged 
canyon wall. A box full of plastic soda bottles and picnic debris sits nearby, 
along with several soiled diapers. Squirrels scamper in an overflowing trash 
bin. The bathroom of a nearby picnic area is swamped with used toilet paper and 
puddles of urine. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Los Angeles County Health Department, human waste and other 
pollution in the stream could spread disease among swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is outrageous in terms of the threat you have for public health," said 
Dennis Rose, a cabin owner in the canyon who has made a personal quest of 
wiping out graffiti and clearing trash. "This terrifies families, so you have a 
lot of people that come up here, they see this and they don't come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Canyon plunges south toward Azusa out of the San Gabriel 
Mountains, branching off into east and west forks near the bottom. Altogether, 
about 35 miles of stream are accessible to visitors on foot or in cars. It's 
the most popular of several canyons in the U.S. Forest Service's Mt. Baldy 
District near Azusa, but Tom Spencer, recreation director for the district, 
said the problems there are typical of the district as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people go to a place that's trashed, people think, 'That's the way it's 
supposed to be and someone's going to come in and clean up after me,' " said 
Spencer. "We call it a stadium mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 But the district doesn't have the resources to go picking up after humanity. 
The budget that includes maintenance along undeveloped areas of the streams and 
roadsides is $76,100 this year, down 20% from last year. Last year, three 
Forest Service employees covered those areas; now there's only one. Spencer 
said, however, that additional funds from parking fees may allow the Forest 
Service to hire another staffer and provide more toilet and trash facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 There are nine permanent toilet facilities in the canyon and six pairs of 
portables. That's more than there used to be, but the area really needs three 
to four times that number of portables, Spencer said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to 1992 we didn't have portable toilets," he said. "There was a lot 
more human waste scattered around the canyon bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to improve conditions, Rose, the cabin owner, has alerted county 
health officials to the potential environmental dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter he wrote last August to Jack Petralia, director of environmental 
protection for the county's Department of Health Services, prompted the 
department to investigate the health risks of litter next to the stream. 
</P>
<P>
 Petralia, in turn, wrote to Forest Supervisor Michael Rogers in September, 
saying that trash, soiled baby diapers and human feces were found in the stream 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Water from the San Gabriel River is collected and treated by the Covina 
Irrigation District and wholesaled to numerous public water supply systems in 
the San Gabriel Valley," Petralia wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Water quality data from the Los Angeles County Public Works Department was 
inadequate to determine the health risk, he said, but "conditions observed 
along the stream beds indicate that water contamination from human excrement is 
likely." 
</P>
<P>
 Any contaminants would be filtered out at the water treatment facility, 
Petralia said, and would not threaten drinking water supplies. But they could 
be a problem for swimmers who get a mouthful, he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "National forests are open," Spencer said. "They're designed to be used by the 
general public. Individuals take on a lot of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, visitors do accept the responsibility. The Forest Service 
scatters 30 large roll-away trash bins throughout the area, and people use 
them. But the trash overfills the bins, which are emptied once a week -- not 
often enough to keep up with the stacks of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers noticed during a 1989 study that canyon users tried to stack 
garbage as neatly as possible next to full trash bins or trash cans, Spencer 
said. But animals -- raccoons, foxes, squirrels and bears -- would scavenge for 
snacks at night, scattering the refuse up to 50 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Forest Service can't schedule more frequent pickups right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're limping along on one worn-out garbage truck," Spencer said, 
adding that a new one should be on hand by the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 To fill the gap between the resources available and the resources needed to 
maintain the canyon, the Forest Service relies on volunteers as well as court 
referrals -- primarily those convicted of misdemeanors and sentenced to 
community service. Members of numerous private and public groups also chip in 
on weekends, helping with maintenance and education. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most extensive efforts involves Ecoteams, a collaboration among the 
Forest Service, the Los Angeles Conservation Corps and the California 
Environmental Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams provide bilingual safety and environmental information to forest 
users, as well as jobs to young men and women from inner-city areas of Los 
Angeles. Workers hike the forest in pairs, explaining to visitors why garbage 
must be packed out, and how to avoid trampling stream vegetation. They also 
warn about forest hazards such as poison oak or diving into a shallow pool of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-seven Ecoteam members work in the Angeles National Forest each weekend. 
They are paid $35 to $80 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Environmental Project also coordinates scheduled cleanups by 20 
to 60 volunteers. The groups remove litter in San Gabriel Canyon about twice a 
month, but once again, garbage pickup is a stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so many volunteers cleaning up trash that the Forest Service can't 
keep up with the bags," said Scott Mathes, executive director of the 
organization. "Sometimes the bags sit there for two or three days, and by then 
sometimes the animals get to it and scatter it into the streams." 
</P>
<P>
 Another partnership is the annual Operation Supersweep, co-sponsored since 
1980 by the county Agriculture Department, the Hughes Ecology Club, the Boy 
Scouts of America and the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in the early morning, hundreds of volunteers ranging from 
grade-school children to grandparents are shuttled to sites in the canyon, 
where they turn the task of trash collecting into a family outing. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the scouring efforts of 383 volunteers left the canyon in as close 
to pristine condition as possible, although they knew it wouldn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be surprised. In a few weeks, it builds back up again," said Marie 
Lopez, one of the event's coordinators. "The next big dump is going to be the 
Fourth of July weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, less than two weeks after the June 4 volunteer cleanup, the stream 
bed already was littered anew with cans, disposable diapers and other trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The canyon's last line of defense is Dennis Rose, who has single-handedly 
vowed to keep the canyon's main road, California 39, graffiti-free. Spencer 
calls Rose "a one-man graffiti-cleaning machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Spencer said, Rose is registered as a volunteer with the Forest Service, 
which pays for the paint he uses to cover graffiti along the highway. Rose 
estimates that previously he spent $1,400 of his own money on the chore. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving along the winding road, Rose pointed out the square gray patches that 
mark his efforts. But he pulled over and sighed in frustration over a new batch 
of blue and black insignias scrawled on rocks along the canyon wall. That would 
take a team of workers with steam-cleaning equipment to remove. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's an area that's in need of just some tender loving care," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose is eager to take on such a project, but he said his hands are tied by 
Forest Service regulations limiting the involvement of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer said the Forest Service is legally responsible for volunteers and 
cannot recruit more people than it has the staff to oversee. Ironically, the 
same staff cuts that hinder the Forest Service's ability to provide basic 
services also keeps it from using volunteers to pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 To Rose, who grew up in the area, witnessing the forest's degradation is like 
watching the slow decline of an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to ride up here on a bicycle when I was a kid," he said. "The canyon 
used to be much more pristine. The Forest Service (officials) haven't 
redeployed their resources to adjust to the number of people using this 
canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer said the problem is that funding for national forests is set up on a 
uniform scale, regardless of the rate of recreational use. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to national forests in rural areas, "urban national forests are much 
more highly impacted by use, because we're dealing with urban problems and 
urban issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angeles National Forest currently represents 70% of the open space in Los 
Angeles County, Spencer said. By 2015, it will probably represent 90% of the 
county's undeveloped land. As open space throughout the county shrinks, the 
forest will become more precious -- and more threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a big psychological reassurance there to say I can see the 
mountains and there aren't houses all over them," he said, "to be able to wake 
up after a storm and see the snowcap."

COMMUNITY NEWS: LAWNDALE; CITY OKS UTILITY TAX, LAYOFFS TO CUT DEFICIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council levied a 5.5% utility user tax and laid off 17 city employees 
to help make up a $1.1-million budget shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members unanimously passed the $7.8-million budget, which included the 
new tax and the layoffs, on June 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax will be tacked on to electricity, telephone, gas, cable television, 
water and cellular telephone bills. Residents' utility bills are expected to 
rise an average of $88 a year, said Tom Devereux, city director of community 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility tax is expected to raise $860,000 in the first year and a little 
more than $1 million in 1995-96, Devereux said. The tax also is expected to 
allow the city to keep a $200,000 reserve, said Jan Rush, city finance manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-income, disabled and senior citizens are exempt from the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax will take effect July 15 but won't be reflected on customers' bills 
until August. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members also cut seven full-time and 10 part-time workers from the 
payroll to save the city an estimated $200,000, said Julie Carter, assistant to 
the city manager. Although no cash severance was awarded, full-time employees 
were allowed to use sick leave to look for work, and health insurance benefits 
were extended through August, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the cuts came from the maintenance department, whose work will be 
done through contracts with private firms. JON GARCIA

 Torrance officials dedicated a new park recently to a Torrance couple who were 
credited with sparing the area from high-rise development before their deaths 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, at 220 Via Riviera in the Hollywood Riviera section of the city, was 
named Mantovani Park in honor of Robert and Juanita Mantovani, who were killed 
in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Juanita and Bob were always concerned with preserving natural beauty," said 
Marie Watson, Juanita Mantovani's 81-year-old mother. "It's wonderful that they 
are remembered in this beautiful park." JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; EX-LONG BEACH OFFICIAL TO BE INTERIM MANAGER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 James A. Algie, former Long Beach financial director, has been hired as 
interim city manager for Hawthorne.  
</P>
<P>
 Algie, 63, was unanimously selected by the City Council earlier this month to 
run Hawthorne for three months while the officials search for a permanent city 
manager.Algie, who holds a master's degree in public administration, ran the 
Long Beach finance department for 12 years before retiring in April.  
</P>
<P>
 Algie replaces City Manager James H. Mitsch, 56, who was fired Friday. Mitsch 
has been criticized for the city's financial woes and has been on paid 
administrative leave for a month, said Doug Gates, city personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is facing an estimated $2-million budget deficit that forced 
officials to change from a one- to a two-year budget cycle in March. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter signed by Mayor Larry Guidi, Mitsch was told he was fired because 
the council lost trust and confidence in his ability to serve as city manager.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted June 13 to authorize more than $12,000 to hire an 
executive search firm to find a permanent city manager. JON GARCIA

COMMUNITY NEWS: MANHATTAN BEACH; RAILROAD DIDN'T OWN LAND STRIP, COURT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A strip of open space that runs through Manhattan Beach did not belong to the 
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Co. when it sold the land to the city, 
the state Court of Appeal has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 The court confirmed a lower court's decision that sided with 67 heirs of the 
Redondo Land Co.The heirs claimed that in an 1888 agreement the land company 
gave an easement to the railroad but did not transfer ownership of the 
property. It should have reverted to them as soon as it was no longer used by 
the railroad, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-foot-wide strip runs from the northern border of Manhattan Beach 
through the city to the border of Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in 1986, the railroad removed the tracks from the land and sold it to 
the city for $4.2 million and two residential properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redondo Land Co. heirs sued the city and the railroad in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Superior Court Judge William C. Beverly Jr. found the city and the 
railroad jointly liable. The value of the property has not been determined. 
City Manager Bill Smith estimated that the city has spent $1.5 million in 
attorneys' fees on the case. Smith said the city purchased the land for open 
space and recreation, and never planned to build on it. MARY GUTHRIE

SOUTH BAY COVER STORY; A FAMILY TRADITION; SECOND- AND THIRD-GENERATION 
SCHNEIDERS ARE CARRYING ON THE PRACTICE OF FIGHTING FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighting is a family affair. 
</P>
<P>
 They're everywhere, these firefighting families, families chock-full of 
fathers or sons or brothers or uncles or cousins or nephews, all dedicated to 
fighting fires -- "putting the wet stuff on the red stuff," as firefighters 
say. Perhaps more than in any other profession, the desire to become a 
firefighter seems to be passed on genetically, like a hot spot in the family 
DNA code. 
</P>
<P>
 There aren't any statistics on it, no known scholarly studies. But stop by 
almost any fire station in the South Bay, Los Angeles County, or the whole 
country for that matter, and chances are you'll see the phenomenon in action. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's tons of those kinds of families" among about 50,000 paid and 
volunteer firefighters in California, says Wally Hurst of the California State 
Firefighters Assn. "The joke is that it's probably some sort of genetic 
defect." (So far, at least, it's a predominantly male gene: Less than 1% of 
firefighters statewide are women.) 
</P>
<P>
 In Inglewood, Fire Department Capt. Dave Waldschmidt is the son and grandson 
of firefighters. In Hawthorne, Battalion Chief Bruce Bradford is the son-in-law 
of a former firefighter and the father-in-law of his firefighter son's 
firefighter wife. 
</P>
<P>
 In Compton, Fire Chief Milford Fonza, who started his career as the first 
African American firefighter in Iowa, is the father of a firefighter son. In 
the Los Angeles City Fire Department, there are the Olsen brothers -- Raymond, 
Robert and Richard -- all of them current or retired battalion chiefs, all of 
them the sons of former Battalion Chief Walter E. Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the many firefighting families, in perhaps none does that hot spot in 
the DNA burn more brightly than in the Schneider firefighting family. Ted, 
Larry D., Paul P., Howard N., Larry P., Scott, Howard R., Phil, Paul R. -- they 
are or were all firefighters, spanning three generations, accumulating between 
them almost 2 1/2 centuries of firefighting experience. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not even counting the four firefighting cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd be hard-pressed to name a major fire in the Los Angeles area within 
memory that hasn't had a Schneider or two, or three, fighting it: the Hollywood 
Park Race Track fire in Inglewood in 1949, the Hollywood Riviera Hotel fire in 
Torrance in 1958, the 1961 Bel-Air fire that destroyed 500 homes, the 1965 
Watts riots fires, the 1992 riot fires, the Los Angeles firestorms of 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 It all started with grandpa Ted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Schneider started working for the Los Angeles City Fire Department in 
1912, a time when firetrucks were still pulled by horses. He was only 17, a 
year short of the minimum age, but he wangled a job as an "extra man," 
available when needed. He was paid by the fire.  
</P>
<P>
 Ted later began working for the Fire Department full time. In 1923 he moved to 
the county fire department and began organizing fire districts in what are now 
Watts, Gardena and Baldwin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he and his wife, Adelaide, had five sons. Three of them -- Howard 
N., Larry D. and Paul P. -- became Torrance and Los Angeles city and county 
firefighters. (Another son, Bob, was killed in 1940 when a bulldozer rolled 
over on him while he was working for the Forest Service clearing a firebreak in 
the Malibu area.)  
</P>
<P>
 Ted Schneider retired in 1955, after more than four decades of firefighting. 
When he died in 1977, three of his grandsons also had become firefighters. 
Eventually, five of Ted's grandsons would become firefighters -- Larry P. with 
the Los Angeles City Fire Department Engine Company 41 in Hollywood, Phil and 
Paul R. with Los Angeles County Fire Department, and Howard R. and Scott with 
the Torrance Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Schneider boys, becoming firefighters seemed like the natural thing to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all grew up hearing fire bells," says recently retired Torrance Fire Capt. 
Howard N. Schneider, 62, who spent 40 years with the department. He means that 
literally: To receive fire calls when the fire company was out of the station, 
Ted Schneider installed an extension of the firehouse phone in the family home 
near the corner of 97th Street and Normandie Avenue. Adelaide served as the 
temporary dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father lived the fire department," Howard N. Schneider says. "Our whole 
lives revolved around it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 6 years old when I discovered I wanted to become a firefighter," says 
Larry D. Schneider, 66, a Los Angeles City Fire Department battalion chief. "My 
mother and I were watching Dad fight a fire, and when my mother wasn't looking, 
I snuck away and climbed up one of the ladders and got on the roof. One of the 
firemen saw me and grabbed me and carried me down, and of course my mother was 
horrified. But I knew then that that's what I was going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was probably the biggest influence on my life," says Paul P. 
Schneider, 71, a retired County Fire Department assistant chief. "I used to 
hang out at the fire station all the time, and get to see the firemen. They 
were a great bunch of guys. It was only natural for a kid to want to be like 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 For the succeeding generation of Schneiders, the dose of firefighter 
indoctrination increased exponentially: They got it not only from their fathers 
and grandfather but from their uncles as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you grow up in a firefighter family like ours, you hear all the war 
stories," says Larry's son Phil, 31, an 11-year veteran of the Los Angeles 
County Fire Department. "The fires, the rescues -- the job is what everybody 
talks about. It's exciting to a kid. It makes you want to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent more Christmases and birthdays at the fire station when I was a kid 
than I did at home," says Paul R. Schneider, 27, a Los Angeles County 
firefighter since 1988. "The fire station was home in a lot of ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Children of firefighters cite several reasons why they wanted to become 
firefighters themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, it's steady work -- there will always be fires, and thus 
firefighters. It's also pretty good money. According to the State Firefighters 
Assn., firefighters in the Los Angeles area make $45,000 to $50,000 a year, 
base salary; fire captains average about $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the major reason the children of firefighters want to become firefighters 
is admiration. They admired Dad and his firefighter colleagues, and they 
admired the way Dad and his friends were admired by others. On any elementary 
school playground in America, to have a dad who was a firefighter was 
considered far cooler than to have a dad who was a lawyer or a banker or even 
the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there are some drawbacks to the firefighter's life -- for example, the 
near certainty that sometime in your career you're going to get hurt. In 1992, 
the last year for which figures are available, 1,641 firefighters were injured 
in California -- about one out of every 30 on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Every one of the Schneiders has been injured while fighting fires. Howard N. 
Schneider, for example, was forced to retire this year because of heart and 
lung damage he suffered when he tore off his protective face mask to warn his 
fellow firefighters about toxic materials in a 1985 industrial fire in 
Torrance. Phil Schneider suffered first- and second-degree face burns battling 
brush fires. Larry D. Schneider was severely burned when a roof he was working 
on collapsed and he fell into the fire. And so on throughout the Schneider 
family, a litany of burns and bruises and scrapes and breaks and seared lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the risk, or maybe at least partly because it is a dangerous and 
daring occupation, the children of firefighters seem driven to do whatever is 
necessary to follow their fathers into the station house.  
</P>
<P>
 Scott Schneider, for example, wanted to be a firefighter so badly that he 
"divorced" his firefighter father. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not quite like it sounds. Howard N. Schneider adopted Scott when he was 2 
years old, and like every other Schneider kid, Scott grew up wanting to be a 
firefighter like his dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all I ever wanted to do," Scott says.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1975 Scott got a job as a firefighter at Hughes Aircraft Corp., but his 
ambition was to become a city firefighter somewhere. A few years later, there 
was an opening at the Torrance Fire Department. Scott was qualified for the 
job, but there was one problem: Torrance had a nepotism ordinance specifying 
that immediate family members of city workers couldn't hold jobs in the same 
department. And Scott's dad, Howard, was a Torrance Fire Department captain. 
</P>
<P>
 So Scott called a buddy of his and started legal proceedings to have the buddy 
and his wife adopt him. When the adoption went through, it legally severed 
Scott's earlier adoption by Howard; Scott was, legally speaking, no longer 
Howard's son, and thus could join the Torrance department. The Torrance 
nepotism ordinance later was thrown out, and Scott was readopted by Howard.  
</P>
<P>
 Being the son or daughter of a firefighter still can be a disadvantage in 
getting a firefighter's job, at least in the same department. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, for example, there was an outcry in Long Beach when seven of the 21 
applicants chosen to attend the city's firefighting academy turned out to be 
the sons of Long Beach firefighters. The 21 had been selected from more than 
600 applicants who were considered qualified, who in turn had been chosen from 
5,000 total applicants -- an indication of just how tough the competition for 
firefighters' jobs is. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of firefighters' sons in the group was not unusual. Ken 
Brondell, a Los Angeles City Fire Department firefighter and a director of the 
State Firefighters Assn., remembered that when he attended firefighting academy 
25 years ago, one-third of his classmates were sons of firefighters. That was 
about average, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters say it's only natural for their offspring to do well in fire 
department selections. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's probably an advantage for them because they tend to be more tenacious 
in seeking the jobs," Brondell says. "They start sooner, and they focus 
themselves on getting the education they need to make them more acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, a number of Long Beach observers cried foul, saying that the 
sons of firefighters obviously had been given special consideration. As a 
result, five of the firefighters' sons were bumped, at least temporarily, from 
the academy list. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them was Michael DuRee, 26, whose father is Long Beach Deputy Chief 
Rick DuRee -- himself the son and grandson of Long Beach firefighters. Michael 
would have been -- and eventually may still be -- the fourth generation to 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was disappointing," says Rick DuRee, adding that he understands the public 
perception that firefighters' sons had an advantage. They do have an advantage, 
but not an unfair one. "You do have an edge, because you know what to do to 
prepare yourself."  
</P>
<P>
 DuRee and others believe that the firefighting family tradition will continue, 
although the sons and daughters of firefighters may have to seek out jobs on 
other departments to avoid, as in Long Beach, the appearance of favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to find fewer sons and daughters on the same 
department," DuRee says. "But the tradition will continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters predict the tradition will also include more minority families in 
the future. After decades of inequities in hiring, in recent years fire 
departments have opened -- or been forced to open -- their ranks to minorities. 
(The Los Angeles City Fire Department, for example, which was less than 6% 
minority 20 years ago, now is 37% minority.) And it appears that the trend of 
firefighters' children becoming firefighters extends to minority firefighting 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Already we're seeing black and Hispanic firefighters whose sons and daughters 
are on the job now," says Brondell of the firefighters association. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son wanted nothing else in life but to be a firefighter," says Compton 
Fire Chief Fonza, whose son is a firefighter in his home state of Iowa.  
</P>
<P>
 And what about the Schneider family? Is there a fourth generation of 
firefighters waiting in the wings? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to have my kids continue the tradition," Torrance 
firefighter/paramedic Scott Schneider says of his 10-year-old son Nicholas and 
6-year-old daughter Natalie. 
</P>
<P>
 And will they? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," says Schneider, "their favorite TV show is 'Rescue 911.' "

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST LOS ANGELES; RESIDENTS' GROUP PROTESTS HIGH-RISE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA BIRCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of residents is fuming over a proposal to build a 28-story 
structure at Wilshire Boulevard and Barrington Avenue, on a site they say is 
overdeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner and developer of the site, Barrington Plaza Ltd., wants to tear down 
the two-story commercial building at 11704 Wilshire Blvd. and replace it with a 
structure containing 335 apartments, retail and restaurant space, recreational 
facilities and a multilevel parking garage for tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the plan -- who include some tenants living in the adjacent 
Barrington Plaza apartment towers, nearby residents and community activists -- 
argue the new building would worsen traffic along an already congested Wilshire 
Boulevard, lower property values, obstruct views and drive residents away. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sense to this except greed," said Nita Rosenfeld, a member of the 
Brentwood Federation who lives near Barrington Plaza. "It's been a very happy 
place for seniors and those with moderate incomes." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Barrington Plaza's tenants are elderly. The developer plans to set 
aside 67 apartment units as affordable housing for older residents, according 
to Barrington Plaza Ltd. spokeswoman Billie Greer. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Barrington Plaza towers were built in the early 1960s, the structures 
were the area's largest housing development. The need for moderate-income 
housing in the Westside prompted the city planning department to approve the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the new building would be three stories taller than the tallest of the 
Barrington Plaza towers, the developer must obtain zoning and density variances 
before construction can begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer said the project would provide the city with much-needed housing and 
create jobs. The project also includes street and traffic improvements at the 
Wilshire and Barrington intersection, so automobile congestion would actually 
ease, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude opposes the project, agreeing with 
critics that the new apartment building would add to congestion in the area. 
Braude's chief deputy, Cindy Miscikowski, said there are other areas nearby 
that could be developed without a need for variances. 
</P>
<P>
 Miscikowski said that if the developer gets the requested zone and density 
changes, "it will be much harder to argue when the next guy wants to come in 
and do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrington Plaza Ltd. may have already won the first round of the battle, 
however. Despite opposition from Braude and a planning commission staff report 
disapproving the developer's requests, commissioners voted 3 to 1 last month to 
recommended approval of the density and zoning changes. The planning commission 
must finalize and adopt its final staff report on the project before the matter 
can be considered by the City Council. Action on the report is expected June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Shaughnessy of the West Los Angeles Community Organization, a local 
neighborhood group, is mobilizing residents to fight the plan. His group has 
collected more than 100 letters addressed to Mayor Richard Riordan denouncing 
the project. DONNA BIRCH

COMMUNITY NEWS: INGLEWOOD; CITY OKS $150,000 SETTLEMENT OF SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously approved a $150,000 settlement in a case where 
police officers beat and injured a man they mistook for an auto theft suspect.  
</P>
<P>
 The settlement stems from a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles by Victor Mansour of Monterey Park, who claimed his civil rights were 
violated when he was beaten with batons by Inglewood police officers, said Gary 
Casselman, Mansour's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got the wrong guy and there was no justification for beating him," 
Casselman said. Mansour suffered a fractured sinus bone, bruises and a head 
wound that required five metal staples during the early morning incident Aug. 
15, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 While pursuing two African American suspects, police officers found Mansour, a 
white man, hiding in the bushes near Market Street and Florence Avenue. 
Mansour, 40, who has a learning disability and is manic-depressive, had gone to 
sleep in the bushes after he became lost and scared, Casselman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansour refused to cooperate with police and eventually came after the 
officers with his arms flailing, said City Atty. Howard Rosten. They thought he 
was the suspect, Rosten said, explaining that it was dark and the man had 
facial hair.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a terrible misunderstanding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Oliver Thompson, who was named in the suit along with four police 
officers, said the officers acted properly in the situation because Mansour did 
not follow the officers' directions.  
</P>
<P>
 "We did an administrative investigation and found no criminal wrongdoing on 
the part of the officers," Thompson said. A grand jury and the district 
attorney came to the same conclusion, Rosten said. The four officers were 
placed on administrative leave during the investigation but all are on active 
duty again. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided to settle the case out of court rather than face a costly 
trial, Rosten said. JON GARCIA

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: CALIFORNIA CUCINA MIXES ITS ACCENTS

 California Cucina: The name suggests Italian food filtered through a 
Californian sensibility once again -- ho hum. But on closer examination one 
finds that the owner and the bistro-like decor at this Rolling Hills Estates 
establishment are actually French, and the chef is Basque. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to scare away customers with a French name and an all-French 
menu," says owner Jo Etesse, born in the revered French city of Lourdes at the 
foot of the Pyrenees, "because many people still think of French food as heavy 
and expensive." So Jo and brother Jean Yves, who owns a restaurant in Toluca 
Lake, went with the popular cuisine of the day -- Italian -- but with some 
interesting additions. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Claude Bellocq's appetizer list tempts with the likes of scallops 
provencale sauteed with garlic, olive oil, and tomato ($7.50), grilled polenta 
smeared with melted goat cheese, ($7) and calamari fritti served with a spicy 
tomato sauce. A specialty of Nice, pissaladiere ($6), is a flaky, pizza-like 
tart topped with caramelized onions, anchovies and black olives. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular chopped salad ($4.50) features organic mixed greens, roasted bell 
peppers, feta cheese, garbanzos, marinated eggplant, zucchini and Kalamata 
olives. Another nod to Nice, the Nicoise salad ($5), contains tuna, eggs, 
anchovies, olives, bell peppers and green beans. Pastas to look for are simple 
angel hair with plum tomatoes, fresh basil and garlic ($7.50), the 
full-flavored penne with a turkey breast, red and yellow bell peppers, basil, 
garlic and crumbled feta ($9.50), and spinach fettuccine with a chicken breast, 
sun-dried tomatoes, cilantro and tequila cream sauce ($9). 
</P>
<P>
 Jo's mussels ($9.50) are a Basque-style mussel saute with onions and green, 
red and yellow peppers in a light tomato sauce given a meaty boost with ground 
pork and prosciutto. 
</P>
<P>
 California Cucina is at 767 Deep Valley Drive, Rolling Hills Estates. (310) 
377-2533. Open seven days 11 a.m. to 11 p.m..

IN THE YEAR 2000, PETERSON ASPIRES TO BE A PERFECT 10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are 10 reasons why Tage Peterson figures to return from Tallahassee, 
Fla., this weekend wearing a gold medal around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 They are, in order, the 100-meter dash, long jump, shotput, high jump, 400 
meters, 110-meter hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin and 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, who will be a sophomore at Azusa Pacific University in the fall, is 
talented in virtually every individual event, making him one of the top young 
decathletes in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, 19, is competing in the U.S. Junior National Track and Field 
Championships this week. His short-term goal is to place among the top two 
finishers and qualify for a spot on the U.S. team that will compete in the 
World Junior Championships July 20-21 in Portugal. His long-term goal is a spot 
on the U.S. Olympic team that will compete in the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping to win this meet in Florida, but in the decathlon your goal is 
always to better than you did the time before," Peterson said. "As long as I 
keep increasing my point total, I'll be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson brought joy to the Azusa Pacific campus last month with his 
performance during the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics Track and 
Field Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson finished third in the decathlon with a career-best 7,267 points and 
established an NAIA decathlon record for the long jump with a mark of 24-feet-3 
1/4. He also won the regular long jump competition with a career-best leap of 
25 feet. Peterson's efforts were instrumental in helping Azusa Pacific win the 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (regular) long jump came after I had finished the 400, the last event on 
the first day of the decathlon," Peterson said. "I didn't feel real great and 
thought I'd be lucky to get 23 feet. I had no clue that I had that type of jump 
inside of me after competing in five events." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2, 185-pound Peterson arrived at Azusa Pacific from Marana High in 
Tucson, Ariz., where he was a Track & Field News Prep All-American in the 
decathlon. Peterson, who also played football and basketball in high school, 
had begun training for the decathlon as a sophomore at the suggestion of Coach 
Marty Honea, who had been an NAIA All-American in the decathlon at Pt. Loma 
Nazarene. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson finished fifth that year in the Junior Olympics, improved to fourth 
the next year and won the event as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking to go to a (NCAA) Division I school out of high school," 
Peterson said. "But the more I looked at Azusa Pacific, the more I felt this 
was the right place for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Track and field isn't like basketball where if you go to a small school, you 
probably won't get the chance to play against and compare yourself to the most 
talented players in the country. In track, you can look at the marks and see 
where you stand." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said he was impressed by Coach Terry Franson and the fact that 
Olympian Dave Johnson was a former Cougar athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 Franson had Peterson train alongside Johnson during preseason workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Johnson) gave me a lot of advice in the pole vault and hurdles and things 
I need help with," Peterson said. "It's good to watch someone who is good at 
something and then mimic them. I learn a lot that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson benefits from natural athletic talent on the first day of decathlon 
competition. He acknowledges that the second day is a far greater challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day is pretty easy, the second day technique comes more into play," 
Peterson said. "I have to spend a lot more time on improving that second day. 
I'm really working on throws, hurdles and the pole vault. Those are things 
we're stressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson encourages other young athletes to give the decathlon a try. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to love it to be able to do it," he said. "I'm not saying it has to 
be your life, but it's almost like you have to have that curiosity that asks, 
'What can my body do next?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what keeps bringing you back."

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; THE SURF TURF WARS; COMPETITION FOR PRIME SPOTS HAS 
FORCED SURFERS TO RESORT TO TRESPASSING, FISTICUFFS, EVEN NIGHT RIDING, IN 
THEIR ENDLESS PURSUIT OF THE PERFECT WAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 AT SUNSET, AS DOZENS OF SURFERS are leaving the water at Malibu's Surfrider 
Beach, Tim Dion straps on a battery belt, a toggle switch and a helmet fitted 
with a 100-watt light. 
</P>
<P>
 He picks up his surfboard and wades into the darkening sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Within moments of paddling out, Dion, his head lamp shining, is riding the 
curls alone, a surreal beam streaking through the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only way I can avoid the crowds," he said after coming ashore. 
"It's peaceful; no cars on the highway; totally quiet. I put on my waterproof 
Sony Walkman, my (light) and I'm in my own world." 
</P>
<P>
 With interest in surfing seemingly at an all-time high, so too is competition 
for prime Westside wave-riding spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers are making room by trespassing on private beach property or 
confronting rivals -- sometimes with their fists. But they have also resorted 
to more creative means. 
</P>
<P>
 Some take to the water at night. Others tap high-tech wave forecasting 
services to meet the surf the very minute it arrives. And still others travel 
to Southern California's offshore islands -- even distant countries -- to catch 
the perfect wave, perfectly alone. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a struggle for space in a sport that, for many who practice it, thrives 
on solitude. Sharing a wave, many surfers believe, violates the aesthetics of 
surfing, and can even be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really need one person per wave to get a clean ride," said David Clark, a 
longtime surfer from Santa Barbara. "It's not like skiing where you have a 
whole mountain. If more than one is on a wave, you're riding their wake, 
adjusting your ride. It's like a traffic jam." 
</P>
<P>
 After growing steadily for decades, the popularity of surfing has exploded in 
the last two years, according to an expert. Mike Kingsbury, managing director 
of the Surf Industry Manufacturers' Assn., a trade organization representing 
the surf apparel, equipment and accessories industries, says a recent industry 
survey estimates that 1.5 million Americans will surf actively (at least four 
times) in 1994. That figure is a significant increase from the 1.1 million who 
said they actively surfed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 California accounts for about 45% of the national total, with a majority of 
that share in the Southland. Said Kingsbury: "Increased television coverage is 
driving interest in the sport and many baby boomers who once gave up surfing in 
the '70s are now going back in the water and bringing their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Westside, the result has been further crowding at such popular surf 
spots as Topanga Beach, Malibu Surfrider Beach, Zuma Beach, Leo Carillo State 
Beach and County Line. Up to 200 surfers pack the lineup at each place on 
summer weekends, jostling for position, trading words and, occasionally, 
exchanging blows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I'll see two to three fights a day on a good swell. There are just 
so many more surfers than waves," said John Baker, a longtime Malibu lifeguard. 
"The caliber and competition of surfing has also gone way up." 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters is a more aggressive attitude displayed by a younger 
generation of surfers. "In the '80s the image was almost clean-cut and yuppie," 
said Martin. "Now the look has gotten more grungy, with surfers wearing 
tattoos, nose rings and earrings and having a more hostile attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers say Point Dume and Trancas Point in Malibu are known local areas where 
non-resident surfers can be verbally and sometimes physically harassed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've witnessed fights, cars ruined, fins punched off (surfboards) and people 
told to leave," said Ted Silverberg, a Point Dume resident who operates a 
surfing school in the area. "Localism is a backward mentality, but sometimes I 
can understand it after watching two guys (from outside the area) leaving 16 
cigarette butts and two Coke cans on the beach and screwing up in the water all 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Trespassing is another symptom of increasing congestion among surfers. Though 
open beaches and public trails to the water abound from Santa Monica to Ventura 
County, some areas north of Zuma Beach have several miles of limited access. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Sunday afternoon, one surfer near Trancas ducked under barbed wire 
and tiptoed down the side of a cliff on private property to get to the peeling 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such an inland influx of surfers on weekends that you have to resort 
to the private areas to get a good quota of opulent waves," he said, declining 
to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 But fisticuffs and fence-climbing are not for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers are exploring new methods of crowd avoidance. Perhaps the most 
striking is surfing at night. 
</P>
<P>
 On full-moon nights when the surf is up, as many as 25 surfers ride the waves 
at Malibu's Surfrider Beach, a small fraction of the daytime crowd. Some tape 
flashlights to their arms. Others mark their wet suits and surfboards with 
fluorescent paint, tape or sticks to improve vision and avoid collisions with 
other surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dion says he has developed a special camaraderie with his fellow night 
surfers. One, a comedian, often takes to the water after his midnight routine 
at local clubs; another howls at the moon (usually after arguments with his 
girlfriend), and a third relies on nighttime surfing to sober up after parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiters at nearby Alice's Restaurant say that the flickering lights startle 
diners, some of whom asked if Martians were invading. 
</P>
<P>
 Those participating in the midnight recreation say the experience can be 
surreal and at times unnerving. The ocean is aglow, with the breaking waves and 
paddling of surfers creating splashes of light. At night, an errant piece of 
seaweed brushing against the legs can cause even the most hardy waterman to 
genuflect wildly. And then there are encounters with real-live denizens of the 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time I was riding a wave and got hit in the stomach by a bunch of flying 
fish which knocked the wind out of me," said Dion. "Thank God they weren't 
swordfish." 
</P>
<P>
 Many surfers who are determined to ride waves during the day have turned to 
wave forecasting services for high-tech help. One of the most heavily used is 
Surfline/Wavetrak in Huntington Beach. Owner Sean Collins often can predict 
wave heights to within a foot, up to two weeks in advance, for almost any beach 
in the world. His swell forecasts for Westside beaches are rarely off by more 
than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Most good surfing waves are spawned by storms far out in the Pacific Ocean. 
Collins tracks wind speeds and wave heights via private satellites, the 
National Weather Service, the U.S. Navy, forecasts from other countries such as 
New Zealand, and signals from an assortment of buoys and boats far out at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The raw data is run through a custom-made computer program that crunches out 
specific information for particular beaches. Wave size and direction are 
calculated and then adjusted to account for the "shadowing" effects of Southern 
California's nine offshore islands and underwater shelving, which can sometimes 
eliminate the potency of some swells. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfline/Wavetrak boasts better than 90% accuracy and receives 3,000 to 4,000 
calls daily on its 900 number, which costs $1.50 per call. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, the use of wave forecasting has made the rush for the water 
even more intense. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days when swells would hit, you'd have it uncrowded until word 
filtered through the pipeline," said Mikke Pierson, owner of Z.J. Boarding 
House, a surf shop in Santa Monica. "Now, when people know a big swell is 
coming, there's a rush on equipment, and they're out at the beach before the 
waves have even arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dion: "Guys are getting off work and changing their whole schedule. There 
is no element of surprise left." 
</P>
<P>
 Some surfers have sought sanctuary from the growing throngs on such offshore 
islands as San Clemente, San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's clean water, no hassles, no pollution or development. It's just the 
way it was 500 years ago," said Jefferson Wagner, owner of Zuma Jay's surf shop 
in Malibu and an avid Channel Islands surfer. "The beaches are so clean the 
sand squeaks beneath your feet when you're walking." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wagner says a forbidding local scene is developing even on the Channel 
Islands. Some spots there are staked out by surfers who feel entitled to the 
turf because they also fish commercially in nearby waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Other surfers look farther afield. In fact, most serious wave riders say that, 
given the crush for surfing space in Southern California, travel has now become 
a mandatory part of their lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "A trip to another country is a throwback to the early days of surfing," said 
Chris Martin, owner of Toucan Surf Tours in Newport Beach, which runs trips to 
Costa Rica and other countries in Central America. "It's uncrowded and has the 
pioneer feeling California and Hawaii had in the late '50s before Gidget." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin sends roughly 1,000 surfers a year -- many of them Westside residents 
-- to a variety of surf locales far down the coast. Prices range from $600 to 
$800 for a one-week trip including air fare, a vehicle and hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Another popular destination is Tavarua Island in Fiji, which boasts excellent 
year-round surf and is prominently featured in in the new surfing film "Endless 
Summer II." 
</P>
<P>
 David Clark, part owner of Tavarua Island Tours in Santa Barbara, has a lease 
on the 20-acre island, which has only 12 cottages, each accommodating two 
people. The surfer population is never allowed to exceed 20. The cost is about 
$135 per night including accommodation, meals and the use of five boats to 
ferry guests to the surf reefs. Round-trip air fare is about $900. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Le Blanc, a salesman at Becker's Surf and Sport in Malibu, surfed Tavarua 
in 1992 and said it was worth the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to capture that feeling of just being with my friends, no vibes, 
just serenity," he said. "To get that, you really have to travel quite far 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Westside surfers prefer to exploit the 1,000-mile Baja coastline, which 
has some beaches never walked upon by man. 
</P>
<P>
 Air charter companies using propeller planes ferry groups of four to five 
surfers to desolate beaches and islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular destinations are Scorpion Bay, about 600 miles south of the border, 
and Isla Natividad, about one-third of the way down the Baja coast. Jeff Kurtz, 
an avid surfer who grew up in Brentwood, works as a part-time pilot for Baja 
Air Ventures in San Diego. The company flies surfers to isolated spots all over 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Such "Baja bush pilots" must exhibit great daring and initiative to cope with 
surfers' demands and the bumpy state of small-town runways. For instance, Kurtz 
says the Mexican government began blowing up small village runways in Baja a 
few years ago to deter drug runners from hop-scotching on their journeys north. 
</P>
<P>
 After many trips, Kurtz says, he has persuaded many of the locals to repair 
their landing strips by giving them gifts and bringing in extra business. 
</P>
<P>
 The generosity has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 On one night trip last year, with four white-knuckled surfers in the back of 
his plane, Kurtz began to run out of gas over Punta Abreojos, a small town 400 
miles south of the U.S. border. Unable to find the runway, he buzzed the 
village center. Within minutes, dozens of local residents drove their cars out 
to the landing area and illuminated the dirt strip with their car headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us thought we were in the last moments of our lives. We had been 
looking for a lighthouse but there was no moon and it was pitch black," he 
said. "Surfers will do anything to get out of crowds and into virgin areas." 
</P>
<P>
 To escape the multitudes, others have abandoned wave riding in favor of 
alternative modes of surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Harris, a Hollywood resident, says he stopped vying for waves at Malibu's 
beaches and now sky surfs -- sky diving with his feet strapped to a board about 
the size of a snowboard from a height of 12,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to wait for swells, it's always consistent, and I don't have to 
deal with any crowds," he said. "I can carve, track, flip, roll, twist, spin 
and bank, just the way I used to surf Malibu." 
</P>
<P>
 The sport, which has about 500 participants worldwide, was invented in the 
late 1980s in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 When Santa Monica surfer Todd Roberts tires of the crowds and lack of surf, he 
heads to Lake Havasu, where he spends time wake-boarding -- being towed behind 
a power boat on a small surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the middle of winter, there's no crowds, no other boats and the water is 
like complete glass," he said. "You can flip, carve, jump the wake and bash the 
lip off the wake." 
</P>
<P>
 But for some die-hard surfers, wave riding remains the ultimate sport -- even 
if it has to be done at unusual times and places. 
</P>
<P>
 Dion says some of his most treasured experiences have been on his board on a 
dark night at Malibu, across the bay from the din of Los Angeles, quietly 
bobbing up and down on the swells. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to many guys who never surf in the daytime," he said. "It all 
comes down to one man, one wave."

AFTER STARTING SPOILERS 25 YEARS AGO, HE HAS GAME DOWN PAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A quarter-century of sets, spikes and blocks have taken their toll on Pat 
Zartman. At 52, he realizes that the physical demands of coaching volleyball 
have begun to wear him down. 
</P>
<P>
 "My body is starting to feel it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zartman has no plans to hang it up, at least not until 2001. That is the 
year his youngest daughter will pass through the junior program of the South 
Bay Spoilers, the volleyball club Zartman founded in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a club for college-age women, the current version of the Spoilers is made 
up of girls age 11 to 15. Zartman calls them the "second generation" of 
Spoilers because many have ties to former players in the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mostly just friends of daughters," said Zartman, a Hermosa Beach 
resident and teacher at Torrance High. "It's kind of a family-based 
organization today. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, we helped the players hone their skills for college and open 
the door for international play. Now the focus is on preparing them for high 
school and putting them in position to get scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
 The Zartmans, the first family of Spoilers, demonstrate the deep roots of the 
club. Pat Zartman was the original coach and continues to help train the 
players. His wife, Sharkie, 44, was a player for 13 years, during which time 
the club won four United States Volleyball Assn. national titles. She now 
coaches the team for 11-year-olds, which includes the Zartmans' youngest 
daughter, Chrissie. 
</P>
<P>
 Eldest daughter Teri plays on the Spoilers' team for 15-year-olds coached by 
Pat Zartman, and helped Bishop Montgomery High reach the State Division III 
final as a freshman last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best example of the club's close-knit history belongs to Ann 
Corlett, who coaches her granddaughter on the team for 13-year-olds. Corlett 
was Sharkie Zartman's first volleyball coach at American Martyrs Catholic 
school in Manhattan Beach. Corlett's daughter, Denise, was an All-American at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spoilers have enjoyed a rich tradition, and there figures to be much 
reminiscing Saturday night when the club marks its 25th anniversary with an 
informal gathering at King Harbor Seaside Lagoon in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've invited some of the old Spoilers back," Pat Zartman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of former players includes "several collegiate All-Americans, 
national team players and high-profile people," Zartman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the biggest names to play for the club were Flo Hyman, a standout on 
the 1984 U.S. Olympic women's team that won the silver medal, and Elaine Roque, 
now one of the top players on the women's pro beach tour. The 6-foot-5 Hyman, a 
Morningside High graduate, died in 1986 from Marfan's syndrome, a rare 
congenital disorder usually found in tall people. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyman and Roque, then a senior at Santa Monica High, helped the Spoilers win 
their first USVBA national title in 1977, in the open division. The club later 
won titles in the masters division (over 30) in 1980, '81 and '82. 
</P>
<P>
 Zartman remembers that it took some coaxing for him to start the Spoilers in 
1970. A football coach and teacher at Bishop Montgomery at the time, he was 
playing volleyball on an open team when he decided to give coaching a try. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some girls came to me and asked me to coach them," he recalled. "Being a 
realist, I was good but not great as a player, but some of the girls had the 
potential to be national team members. The right thing to do was to help them. 
I decided to be a coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his successes with the Spoilers, Zartman was the U.S. women's 
national team coach in 1974, when he set up the year-round training program 
that is the model today for the men's and women's national teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Zartman also coached the Los Angeles Starlights for a year in the Major League 
Volleyball Assn., a women's indoor pro circuit that folded after 2 1/2 seasons 
because of financial reasons. Zartman stopped coaching after the first season, 
in 1987, because of a salary dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone by her husband, Sharkie Zartman coached the El Camino 
College women's team to two state titles and nine conference titles from 
1976-85. A former UCLA and national team player, she was named to the beach 
volleyball Hall of Fame last year. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the Zartmans' coaching expertise goes toward training their 
daughters and their friends. The Spoilers started a junior program in 1989 
after years of operating a women's team. The season starts in January and lasts 
through June. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to coach our own kids," Pat Zartman said. "We felt we could do it 
more inexpensively. Most of our training is on the beach, which is cheaper, 
what with gyms getting so expensive (to rent)." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the club's four teams, only one, the 12-year-olds coached by Karen Schulte, 
will compete in the Nike Volleyball Festival starting Monday at UC Davis. Last 
year, the Spoilers' 14-year-old team won the title, considered the equivalent 
of the national championship. Teri Zartman and Kristine Sigel, who plays for 
Mira Costa, led the 14-year-olds to the 1993 title and, more recently, earned a 
single-A amateur rating as a two-player beach team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes more patience working with people who don't have skills or athletic 
backgrounds, but working with my daughters and their friends is probably the 
most rewarding thing I've ever done," Pat Zartman said. "As they grow up, I 
realize I'm not going to see them every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are days I'm really going to cherish." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if his knees do ache.

EDUCATION: MARY LAINE YARBER; GRADUATING SENIORS KNOW THEY WILL FACE HARDSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For several years now I've read media reports about how much tougher it is 
these days for high school graduates to succeed in college or in the job world. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree. 
</P>
<P>
 But when such reports go on to say that graduates are naive or ignorant about 
life's hardships, I beg to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a recent survey of my own students, who will graduate in two weeks, 
shows just the opposite: Although my students are hopeful about their futures, 
they are well aware that many difficult and even frightening obstacles lie 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what some of them had to say: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't yet know much about life, and people are already expecting me to make 
decisions," said Cecilia Wong, who is struggling to decide on a college major. 
"If I make the wrong decision, I'll have to live with it for the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the path will include college. Richard Zheng is eager "to learn 
more, to have fun and to have more friends," he said. "When I talk to 
middle-aged people, 90% of them talk about their college life. Their stories 
really excite me."  
</P>
<P>
 The students are already aware, however, of the trials of college life. 
</P>
<P>
 "In college, there is too much competition between students," Wendy Arbeit 
said, "and C's are considered utter failure." 
</P>
<P>
 Elva Gonzalez sees money as a potential problem. "My fear is that I won't be 
able to make it through college because I will have to work," she said. "If I 
don't get a good-paying job (while in college), I'm going to have to choose 
between college and work." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of students worry that they may not be able to attend college at all 
because they are not legal residents and thus cannot qualify for scholarships 
or other monetary help. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, who asked to remain anonymous, dreams of studying science at 
UCLA. "When I (found out) I couldn't have the money to pay for college, I felt 
very sad," she said. "I work very hard to get good grades, and now I can't do 
anything to continue my studies." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of raising a family was mentioned by many of the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to end up with a good husband who has a good career, doesn't drink or 
smoke, and is a great and supporting father, like my dad," Laura Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan to put my whole life into my children," Sigrin Torres explained. 
"They'll be loved and nurtured throughout their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many adults, most of these teen-agers are haunted by the unpredictable 
job market. For example, Huvishka Mustamandy wants a career in criminal law but 
worries that he'll "go through years of college and won't find a job." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid of being unsuccessful; I don't like to depend on others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Achieving a general contentment with life is a concern of my students too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just know and have heard of many people who aren't happy in the life they 
are living," Randie Flower said. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, she's afraid of unknowingly choosing the wrong career. Likewise 
for Jenny Reifel-Saltzberg, who is now headed to Portugal as a foreign exchange 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest fear is that I won't get a job I like, or I'll be stuck in a city 
or town I don't like," she said. "I'm also afraid I won't be happy with the 
person I want to marry." 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Cueva worries about bad choices too. "My main fear," she said, "is 
that I don't become a teacher and end up being something else which I don't 
like." 
</P>
<P>
 Some grads have a more basic (and chilling) fear: violent death. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main fear is dying before I accomplish all of my goals," Hugo Ramirez 
said. "I want to get married, finish college, travel and design my own house." 
</P>
<P>
 Said David Aghai: "With the way society is today, I hope to make it past my 
college life. A big worry for me is to stay alive."

PASADENA; COUNCIL KICKING ITSELF OVER CUP SNAFUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN and RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before the World Cup tournament began last week, Pasadena officials felt 
as though they had taken some cleats in the shins from the organizers of the 
international soccer event. And some community leaders now wonder whether the 
city has what it takes to negotiate with world-class organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have bungled this affair," Councilman Isaac Richard said this week. "We 
have allowed this community to be exploited by the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 First, World Cup organizers vetoed a plan to raise money to promote economic 
development in the city, in which the Chamber of Commerce would have sold 
soccer tickets at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Los Angeles -- not Pasadena -- was made the site of Soccerfest, the 
World Cup's official festival of related recreational and promotional 
activities. When city officials tried to set up their own soccer festival, 
World Cup officials refused to let it operate within the World Cup-controlled 
venue on game days at the Rose Bowl (where the competition's championship 
culminates on July 17) and allegedly warned away major sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last week came the ultimate insult: The words Los Angeles were affixed 
to a World Cup sign right outside the Rose Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we ought to . . . direct the staff to have (the sign) removed and 
present it to Los Angeles as a gift," Councilman William M. Paparian quipped 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebellious City Council members also proposed tearing down the sign and 
defiantly opening their festival, called Soccer Carnaval, on game days at a 
venue farther from the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city has backed down on all three plans, eventually acknowledging that 
World Cup organizers were within their rights on all the issues. The Soccer 
Carnaval, which is opening a week later than originally planned, will run only 
on non-game days. And a sign recognizing Pasadena was added in front of the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems have prompted a new look at the way the city deals with the 
organizers of mega-events, especially since the Rose Bowl's hosting of the 1993 
Super Bowl also failed to live up to its original promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard and Councilman Chris Holden said in recent interviews that Pasadena 
should consider hiring an expert negotiator in the future to cut the best deal 
with top-of-the-line organizers. City Manager Philip A. Hawkey and his staff 
now handle contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minor incidents have turned into major problems," Holden said. "We keep 
crying over the spilled milk, but it's milk that we spilled." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of hiring an expert negotiator has appeal for other city leaders as 
well, including Chamber of Commerce President-elect Michael Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's bureaucrats, Hawkins said, have "proven over and over again that 
they're not real good at it." 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the recent disputes, World Cup officials held their ground, backed 
by the terms of their contract to use the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey, said that some of the problems might have been avoided through an 
agreement allowing the city more leeway, but he defended his staff's overall 
performance given the size of the event. The city manager opposes bringing in 
an outside negotiator for future events. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of this has to do with ongoing, day-to-day relationships," he said. "To 
have a negotiator would make it more impersonal, and in some instances, more 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 One expert who has negotiated major events with Pasadena said the council, not 
its negotiators, is the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "A professional negotiator would be hamstrung by the same things that, in my 
opinion, have hamstrung earlier negotiations . . . very simply lack of clear 
direction and communication from the council," said the expert, who asked to 
remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflicts over Soccer Carnaval, a monthlong festival of soccer, crafts and 
live entertainment, could cost the city a considerable amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for Soccer Carnaval were launched last year after Pasadena lost 
Soccerfest. Soccer Carnaval was supposed to generate $3.2 million, including 
money from major sponsors. About $650,000 was expected to go to Pasadena to 
help pay for as much as $1.2 million in city expenses for security related to 
the games at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city never secured any major corporate sponsors, and organizers now 
estimate that Pasadena will get $300,000 or less from its festival. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have accused World Cup officials of doing everything possible 
to hurt Carnaval, including discouraging prospective sponsors and spiking plans 
to open the festival on game days, when the biggest crowds are expected in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 But the World Cup organization's agreement with Pasadena included "sole and 
complete" control of the Rose Bowl and surrounding area, and the World Cup 
officials did not want Carnaval on game days. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup Assistant Vice President Brad Rothenberg said there is no rivalry 
between Carnaval and Soccerfest. He said World Cup, for security purposes, did 
not want more people flooding the area on game days. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg also denied that those associated with the World Cup had warned 
away sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey acknowledged that the city had no clear-cut grounds to challenge the 
World Cup decision to keep Carnaval from operating on game days. Nevertheless, 
Pasadena had hoped World Cup officials would give in to the city's request, 
Hawkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, World Cup was within its rights to block the chamber's plan to sell 
game tickets at a profit to raise money for economic development, Hawkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the World Cup organization also was within its legal rights when it 
resisted a request by Pasadena officials to remove Los Angeles from a sign in 
front of the city's beloved Rose Bowl, the city manager acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hawkey said the glitches are minor compared to the economic benefits that 
the games will bring to Pasadena.

A WAVE OF THE FUTURE. . .; COACHING PEPPERDINE BASKETBALL TEAM IS FULLER'S 
DREAM JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 In 1978, Pepperdine was desperate to find a guard to complement high-scoring 
Ricardo Brown. Gary Colson, the Waves' coach, was impressed with Vincennes 
(Ind.) Junior College's Tony Fuller, but unsure whether the guard was willing 
to come to Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing he said was hello and goodby during his 48-hour visit," said 
Colson, now the coach at Fresno State. "We figured he didn't like us at all. I 
was shocked he still wanted to come." 
</P>
<P>
 After a successful career as a player and assistant coach at Pepperdine, Tony 
Fuller has returned to his alma mater as the school's basketball coach. He 
replaced Tom Asbury, who resigned April 12 to take over the Kansas State 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been my dream to coach at Pepperdine," Fuller said. "About 16 
years ago, I decided I wanted to coach and when I came here, I decided this was 
the place I wanted to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, who played and coached under Jim Harrick at Pepperdine, is described 
by his mentor as a soft-spoken leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony was a tremendous player for me," said Harrick, who hired Fuller as an 
assistant when he became UCLA coach in 1988. "The thing I remember most about 
Fuller is that he would play for two hours and never say a word. You never knew 
he was around." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller came to Pepperdine after two seasons as coach at San Diego State. The 
Aztecs were 2-26 the season before Fuller's arrival and finished 8-21 in 
1992-93 and 12-16 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I describe him as quietly effective," Harrick said. "He proved to be that way 
as an assistant and head coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, 35, defends his soft-spoken mannerisms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where does it say a coach has to be wild and crazy to be successful?" Fuller 
said. "I always manage to get my point across. We all coach and lead by 
personality. I'm a regular guy, nothing fancy, nothing great, nothing 
philosophical. I'm a guy who came up the hard way. Hopefully, my personality 
will shine through." 
</P>
<P>
 His first move as Waves coach was to promote Marty Wilson to full-time 
assistant. He recently added Bob Mandeville, an assistant at San Diego State, 
to his staff and signed Ventura College point guard Joey Ramirez. He also hopes 
to sign former Notre Dame High standout Monte Marcaccini, who has been released 
from his commitment to Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of an eerie feeling how many lives have been affected by this 
move," Fuller said. "People thought it was an easy decision to leave San Diego 
State, but it wasn't. People said I was making a lateral move and it would not 
help my career. They said the same thing when I left UCLA as an assistant to go 
to San Diego State. But I guess you have to have faith in yourself before 
someone else does." 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves return five players, including two part-time starters, from last 
season's team, which finished 19-11 and lost in overtime to Michigan, 78-74, in 
the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seems like a nice guy," Pepperdine forward Clark James said. "From what 
people told me about him, he is a very good person and a very good coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Said former Banning High standout Bryan Hill: "As a coach, he seems down to 
earth and easy to talk to. He expects his team to walk around in a prestigious 
manner and uphold the image of the school. He doesn't want his team to be known 
as a bunch of knuckleheads." 
</P>
<P>
 Practice for the Waves begins Oct. 15, but Fuller does not have time to sit 
around and enjoy the ocean view from his Malibu office. He has the Pepperdine 
basketball camp to run, which began its first session Sunday. He is also busy 
preparing for the recruiting and evaluation period that begins July 5. Fuller 
pointed out that the new scholarship limits from 15 in 1992 to 13 in 1994 will 
work to Pepperdine's advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be very patient and maintain high standards," Fuller said. "I 
think we're going to surprise a few people with who we get." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller hasn't charted out offensive and defensive game plans for his team 
because he has never seen them play. He said his coaching philosophy is 
dictated by personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it depends on the talent you have," Fuller said. "You need to put 
players in position where they can be successful. I like to be up-tempo and I 
like to play pressure defense. We're going to play basic basketball with no 
wild free-wheeling thing. We're going to emphasize team defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, however, will have a tough time duplicating Asbury's success. Asbury's 
teams compiled a 125-59 record in six seasons, including 19-11 last season, and 
three NCAA tournament berths. Four starters, however, have completed their 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "People around here expect victories and we have our work cut out," Fuller 
said. "We lost our top four players in terms of scoring, minutes played and 
leaders in every statistical category."

 Pepperdine Wave coaches are starting to come and go as often as the changing 
of the tide. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's respected baseball coach, Andy Lopez, announced his resignation 
Monday to accept the coaching job at Florida.

<P>
 Lopez, the Wave coach for six seasons, guided Pepperdine to the 1992 national 
championship and made three other NCAA playoff appearances. His record at 
Pepperdine was 241-107. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who attended San Pedro High and UCLA, had wanted to stay in Southern 
California because his parents and his wife's parents live in the South Bay. He 
also coached at Cal State Dominguez Hills for six seasons before replacing Dave 
Gorrie as Wave coach in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will always be thankful for the great experience I had during my six years 
at Pepperdine," Lopez said. "I'm leaving a great university and moving away 
from my friends and family. (However,) the total package that Florida offered 
to me was tough to turn down." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez replaces Joe Arnold, who retired June 1 after 11 seasons at Florida. The 
Gators were 40-23 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, 40, would not comment about his reported five-year contract, with a 
base salary of $140,000. He can also earn additional money from radio and 
television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a terrific opportunity for Andy Lopez and his family, and 
we're certainly going to miss him," said Tim Wilhelm, Pepperdine assistant 
athletic director. "At the same time, this is very complimentary to the 
program. It means that we hire very capable coaches who become in demand by 
other programs. It is unusual for a school like Florida to be making an offer 
to a Pepperdine baseball coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is the second coach to leave Pepperdine in two months. Tom Asbury 
resigned April 12 as men's basketball coach to take over the Kansas State 
program. Tony Fuller was named to succeed Asbury last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very good university for coaches to do good things and be rewarded 
for their success," Wilhelm said. "Pepperdine baseball took another step two 
years ago when the team won the national championship. I think coaches realize 
they can achieve that goal here." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm said the process of finding a successor for Lopez has already begun 
but added "there is no time frame." 
</P>
<P>
 "What once was perceived as a good job, I think has become an outstanding job. 
We expect to hear from a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez became a hot commodity after Pepperdine won the 1992 national title. He 
was offered the Washington State job after Bobo Brayton announced his 
retirement and was a candidate for the Arizona State job. Longtime Sun Devil 
Coach Jim Brock died June 12 of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said he was contacted last week about the Florida opening and considered 
all offers before making his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm relieved the (interviewing) process is over because it was tough 
recruiting (at Pepperdine) the last two years," Lopez said. "I got tired of 
answering questions about whether I would be there in the future."

 Red Grooms' replica of a Target department store has all the items that 
shoppers would want -- except long lines at the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
 Grooms' "The Discount Store, 1970" is a witty and wry depiction of a Target 
store. Using wood, canvas and myriad other materials, Grooms built a 
1,500-square-foot walk-through replica, complete with wooden shopping carts, a 
garden center with seeds and a soda counter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real puzzle" to put together, said Nora Halpern, founding director 
of the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art at Pepperdine University, where the 
exhibit will be shown through Sept. 25. "We got to know each piece intimately." 
</P>
<P>
 Loaned to Pepperdine University by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los 
Angeles, this elaborate work has never been shown in its entirety. The display 
also includes a video component on the making of the piece and the premiere of 
"Flea Market," a recently completed wall relief depicting a popular New York 
flea market. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit shows how well Grooms understands the chaotic, consumer-oriented 
world that we live in, said Halpern, who believes the success of Grooms' work 
can be attributed to the fact that it often prompts conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pokes fun at people's attitudes toward art. . . . He believes that (art) 
should be enjoyable," Halpern said. "This group of works shows the serious 
issues of commerce and trade in a playful and engaging way." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit is also a fun way to spend an afternoon browsing the 
larger-than-life works. Halpern will conduct a free children's workshop at 
11:30 a.m. on July 23. Children will have the opportunity to learn about the 
exhibit as well as participate in a hands-on workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Target: Red Grooms!" exhibit will be shown through Sept. 25. Frederick R. 
Weisman Museum of Art, Pepperdine University, 24255 Pacific Coast Highway, 
Malibu. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Admission 
is free. Information: (310) 456-4851. CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

WORLD CUP '94; HISTORIC EVENT FOR THE UNITED STATES; GROUP A: STEWART PROVIDES 
THE DECISIVE GOAL AS AMERICANS STUN COLOMBIA, 2-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Hey, USA, Americans really can play soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 On an afternoon when everything went just about perfectly, the Americans 
shocked Colombia, 2-1, Wednesday at the Rose Bowl, putting the United States in 
commanding position to advance past the tournament's opening round for the 
first time since 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible, it's historical, it's very cool," defender Alexi Lalas said. 
"If there is one thing this World Cup has shown, it's that any country can beat 
any country." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first World Cup win for the United States since the 1-0 shocker 
over England in 1950, and now only a one-sided loss against Romania on Sunday 
can prevent the Americans from advancing to the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proved to the world today against Colombia -- they have a great team -- 
that it is not important that you win all the games," said Ernie Stewart, who 
scored the winning goal in the 52nd minute. "It is important you don't lose any 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, coming off Saturday's 1-1 tie with Switzerland, caught a 
break when Colombian defender Andres Escobar kicked John Harkes' crossing pass 
for Stewart into his own net with 10 minutes to go in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, seven minutes into the second half, Stewart collected a through pass 
from Tab Ramos and beat goalkeeper Oscar Cordoba with a right-footed shot. From 
then on, the Americans outplayed Colombia, whose only goal came in the final 
minute, when Adolfo Valencia put a shot over goalkeeper Tony Meola. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia, one of the pre-tournament favorites, is in danger of elimination 
because of this defeat and Saturday's 3-1 loss to Romania. The Colombians may 
have been shaken by a death threat against midfielder Gabriel Gomez that was 
sent earlier Wednesday by fax to the team's hotel in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia coach Francisco Maturana said the person who sent the fax threatened 
to blow up Gomez's house in Colombia. Maturana, who said he considered 
resigning before the game, replaced Gomez with Herman Gaviria. 
</P>
<P>
 With the San Gabriel Mountains serving as a majestic backdrop and a full house 
of 93,194 in the Rose Bowl, the United States scored two goals against Colombia 
for the first time. The Americans had been 1-6 against the Colombians, losing 
six straight since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted three points out of this game," Meola said, "and people didn't 
think we could do it and we did it." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. players feared the crowd would be against them and cheer for Colombia, 
but at the game's start it appeared 60-40 for the Americans. By the end of the 
game, the mountains echoed with chants of "U-S-A! U-S-A!" as the players jumped 
on each other in triumph and Meola danced across the field with an American 
flag over his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcelo Balboa left the field draped completely by an American flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 24 teams in the World Cup, 16 advance to the second stage, when the 
knockout phase begins. Those 16 are the top two teams in each group and the 
four third-place teams with the best records.

WORLD CUP '94; ANALYSIS; ARGENTINA SERVES NOTICE THAT IT'S READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY TRECKER, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Argentina has figured out a way to have two conductors for its orchestra, 
turning that apparent contradiction into a potent attacking force that fired a 
warning shot across the bow of any would-be World Cup winner Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not so much that the 1978 and 1986 champions routed Greece, 4-0. It was 
the way Fernando Redondo and Diego Maradona played together that will make 
other Cup contenders take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo, 25, a gifted central midfielder who first came to the fore in the 
1992 Intercontinental Cup in Saudi Arabia, was the dominant player on a rainy 
day. Maradona, 33, was a rare "second among equals" to his younger playmaker. 
This pattern had not emerged in the past 18 months, as Maradona flirted with 
retirement and comeback. His indecision combined with a Redondo slump, which 
began with his Tenerife club in Spain and continued through the 1993 Argentina 
qualifying saga. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, there was no question Redondo was back at the top of his game. 
Drifting imperially from one penalty box to the other, he tackled with ease, 
set Argentina fastbreaks in motion with delightfully angled passes, touched 
short feeds to Maradona, Gabriel Batistuta or Claudio Caniggia, and even 
managed the occasional sleight-of-foot on the edge of the Greek penalty area 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona, instead of being eclipsed by his partner, was enhanced in stature. 
Once the Greeks abandoned the idea of having Panagiotis Tsalouchidis drape 
himself all over Maradona in the guise of man-marking, a ploy that lasted 45 
minutes and meant the already undermanned Greeks were virtually operating with 
10 men, the great Argentine captain surged into the game with remarkable pace 
and agility. 
</P>
<P>
 If some of his moves were largely made up of feints and hints, there was 
enough of real value to demonstrate that he has come to the United States to 
show this public something of his legendary power. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Maradona isn't the speed burner of 1986, but there were two weaving runs 
and plenty of excellent passes Tuesday, all crowned with a 60th-minute goal 
that came from a string of passes set in motion by Redondo. In that case, 
Maradona pounced on the finish, turning at the 18-yard line to unleash his 
drive to the top left corner. But the setting-up sequence was made by Redondo, 
who took a pass from Jose Chamot, initiated a couple of one-twos, then got out 
of the way to watch the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 18 months, this was something we did not see from Alfio Basile's 
team. Even as Argentina successfully defended its South American Championship 
in Ecuador last summer, it was a case of perseverance, not proficiency, that 
got the job done. Redondo was unable to assert himself in midfield, quick 
Caniggia was in the middle of a 15-month drug suspension, and Chamot had not 
been discovered by Basile. 
</P>
<P>
 That Argentine side spent more time getting in its own way than causing 
trouble for the opposition. The problems persisted through this spring, when 
Basile was criticized for persisting with Maradona and questioned for not 
changing his tactical formation. For this day, at least, he won't have to 
answer any critics. Caniggia is back and flashed something of his old form. 
Oscar Ruggeri looked happier in central defense with Chamot beside him, and 
Redondo had great support from Diego Simeone and Abel Balbo whenever he went. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the same Argentine style as 1986, but it was virtually the same 
concept. Built around a three-man backfield and five players operating in 
midfield, the idea always has been to spring the front-runners with passes 
launched from a moving shield. Nobody can time those better than Maradona, but 
Redondo and Simeone have learned from observation. Batistuta needed only a 
minute to collect one such pass to score the first goal; Simeone drew a penalty 
from another near the end of the match, before Batistuta scored his third goal 
on a penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether this Argentina team can emulate the 1986 champions may depend on what 
happens here Saturday against Nigeria. Another exhibition of dominance from 
Redondo and Maradona would convince most this team is real. 
</P>
<P>
 We know that Nigeria, the African champion, figures to be stronger than the 
willing, but outmanned Greeks. What we have yet to find out is how good this 
Argentina team can be.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; TIME TO CUT OFF 'PLAY ON' CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 International soccer officials said Wednesday they were unhappy with some of 
the officiating at World Cup '94, and threatened to release referees who have 
been sub-par. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he refused to identify any referees, Joseph Blatter, general 
secretary of FIFA, soccer's world governing body, said a few of the first 13 
matches were poorly officiated, among them Tuesday's Argentina-Greece game in 
Foxboro, Mass.The referee there was Arturo Angeles of Temple City in his World 
Cup debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Blatter said FIFA was disappointed by the lack of fouls for tackling from 
behind, and the roughness in guarding such stars as Diego Maradona of 
Argentina, Roberto Baggio of Italy and Romario of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 A review by FIFA's officiating council is expected to be completed this 
morning in Irving, Tex., but results will not be announced until Monday. Any 
referee deemed below par will be barred from calling any more games. ELLIOTT

 (After playing to a 1-1 draw with Germany,) Spain, too, can feel far more

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; IN DEFENSE OF MEOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a goalkeeper, the United States' Tony Meola is inclined to protect his 
turf. But never has he been more defensive than he was in the months before the 
World Cup when some reporters suggested that U.S. coaches should bring in 
goalkeeper Kasey Keller for a look. 
</P>
<P>
 Meola fumed, insisting that the U.S. team wouldn't need Keller, who plays for 
Millwall in England's first division, because it already had a starting 
goalkeeper -- Meola. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was interesting to see Keller listed prominently in an article in 
Wednesday's edition of " '94 Cup Daily" about stars from around the world who 
are not playing in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the newspaper's masthead, its founder and chief executive officer 
is Michael F. Sanchez, who is one of Meola's best friends. And Meola is one of 
the paper's regular columnists.  
</P>
<P>
 The headline over the pictures of the missing players: 
</P>
<P>
 "Wish You Were Here . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 In Keller's case, maybe not. RANDY HARVEY

THE NBA; TIMBERWOLVES HELD AT BAY IN MINNESOTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUN POWELL, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The whole idea was insane anyway. How could anyone offer $152 million for a 
basketball team without a history, a present and a near future, and call it 
sound financial judgment? And how could the National Basketball Association say 
with a straight face, "We're delighted to welcome Bob Arum into our exclusive 
world of ownership?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Timberwolves are staying in Minnesota. Arum is staying in boxing. And 
because of that, you can bet the league office is wiping its brow and breathing 
a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolves were headed to New Orleans until last week, when the league's 
relocation committee examined the finances of Arum's group, Top Rank, and 
abruptly canceled the Louisiana Purchase. The committee found Top Rank's 
proposal "a speculative and inadequately financed plan" and will recommend to 
NBA owners to dismiss the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, given a choice of cities, the owners would probably opt for New Orleans. 
Minneapolis is very cosmopolitan and clean, but this tends to be overlooked 
from November through March, when the wind chill becomes a bitter pill. They'd 
prefer gumbo over ice-fishing every time. 
</P>
<P>
 But, plain and simple, the NBA couldn't afford to approve this move, given the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a drop in scoring and an increase in violence, the league's image 
isn't exactly on an all-time high right now. And the last thing the NBA needs 
is another punch to its soft underbelly. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of watching teams pack and move from Kansas City-Omaha to 
Sacramento and Buffalo to Los Angeles via San Diego, the NBA has prided itself 
on stability. Imagine, then, the potential embarrassment of a team leaving 
Minneapolis after only five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolves had tremendous fan support in the Twin Cities and a decent facility 
in the Target Center. They just don't have owners with deep pockets and 
financial foresight. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the Arum issue. NBA Commisssioner David Stern said he didn't 
have any problem doing business with Top Rank. But more than one league 
official said it was near unanimous - that hardly anyone wanted anything to do 
with Arum, the boxing promoter with the slippery-slick image. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, the relocation committee did a thorough check of the New Orleans 
group, hoping to find a measure of doubt, which it says it did. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum wasn't New Orleans' only problem. The city doesn't have a suitable arena 
and wouldn't have one in place in time for next season, although there were 
plans for a $100 million, state-of-the-art facility. There's also the 
uncertainty of the New Orleans market and whether the city would support the 
NBA. Plus, backed against the summer deadline for the 1994-95 schedule, the 
league had to act quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to suggest that the Wolves' situation is secure, however. There's 
still the matter of settling the $74 million debt on the Target Center. Stern 
believes the local government can resolve the financial crisis and find 
suitable owners who will keep the team in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember this: The current Wolves' owners, Harvey Ratner and Marv Wolfenson, 
can apply for relocation again next March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the league hopes the Wolves will be in the hands of the kind of 
ownership it can live with . . . either in Minneapolis or New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first selection in the June 29 draft is a no-brainer. Glenn Robinson's 
going to the Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it gets interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Mavericks are expected to take point guard Jason Kidd. However, 
they're also high on Grant Hill and have listened to offers for Jim Jackson, 
who could be exchanged for a young, established point guard. The feeling is 
Hill is capable of playing some point guard, and he'd eventually become a 
better player than Jackson in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit Pistons will settle for either Kidd or Hill at 3, while the 
Wolves, who need inside help, may lean toward power forward Juwan Howard over 
small forward Donyell Marshall at 4. That would leave Marshall for the 
Washington Bullets, who are already overloaded at forward and may trade up or 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 One player who appears to be slipping in the lottery is center Yinka Dare. 
Some scouts are nervous about the raw Nigerian. He played only two years of 
college ball and measured a few inches shorter than his listed 7-foot-1 at the 
Chicago combine. 
</P>
<P>
 One who's on the rise is 6-9 forward Brian Grant of Xavier, who played well in 
the Phoenix combine and has impressed several teams in pre-draft interviews. 
Grant may sneak into the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks, Mavericks and Philadelphia 76ers, all young teams looking to 
rebuild, have the best chances to re-tool through the draft. They hold six of 
the draft's top 20 choices as a result of trades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks, selecting first and 18th, will receive the Orlando Magic's 
first-rounder. It was a gift from the Magic, because the Bucks surrendered 
forward Anthony Avent, who was on the Orlando bench by season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks (second and 19th) received the Glden State Warriors' 
first-rounder as part of a three-way swap in 1992. In a deal that also included 
the Chicago Bulls, the Warriors got Byron Houston, while the Bulls settled on 
Rodney McCray. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sixers (sixth and 20th) received the Utah Jazz's first-rounder as part of 
the Jeff Hornacek-Jeff Malone deal. 
</P>
<P>
 A few other trades that reshaped the order of this year's first round: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Seattle SuperSonics are choosing 11th overall. The pick belonged to the 
Charlotte Hornets, who didn't exactly expect to lose Larry Johnson and Alonzo 
Mourning to injuries and fall into the lottery when they included the pick in 
the Kendall Gill trade last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Warriors have the Cleveland Cavaliers' pick (16th overall) as 
compensation for the Tyrone Hill trade. This could prove costly for the Cavs, 
because Hill is an unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Clippers will receive the Atlanta Hawks' first rounder (25th overall) 
to complete the Dominique Wilkins-Danny Manning deal. The Clippers could have 
opted for Atlanta's pick next year, which would have been wise, because there's 
a small chance that Manning may not re-sign with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The New York Knicks have the Houston Rockets' pick (26th overall) in one of 
the stranger deals in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Rockets sent Tim McCormick to the Hawks four years ago, the deal 
required the Hawks to send a 1994 first-rounder to Houston if McCormick, who 
had knee trouble, missed 100 games over the length of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 When McCormick was traded to the Knicks for Maurice Cheeks in '91, the clause 
followed him. McCormick retired shortly afterward and has worked the past few 
seasons as a broadcaster for the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Richard Dumas is expected to receive clearance from his counselors to 
play on the Phoenix Suns' summer-league team. Dumas missed the entire 1993-94 
season after relapsing into substance abuse last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns are being cautious with Dumas, however, and haven't embraced his 
return just yet. "He's got to take the next step and go from there," said Suns 
president Jerry Colangelo. "If he can handle it, then we'll see about next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 You want to give him a second and third try but he has to show he can deal 
with it." Dumas' importance to the Suns depends on Charles Barkley's status for 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 If Barkley decides to play -- doctors have already determined that he doesn't 
need back surgery -- then the Suns may try to trade Dumas.

NEWSWIRE: BUCKS TRADE NORMAN, GET HINSON FROM HAWKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forward Roy Hinson, who has sat out almost all of the last four seasons 
because of knee injuries, was traded by the Atlanta Hawks to the Milwaukee 
Bucks on Wednesday for forward Kenny Norman. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-9 Hinson, 33, was acquired by the Hawks two years ago from the New 
Jersey Nets.In 1990-91, his last active season, Hinson played only nine games, 
averaging 4.6 points per game for the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, also 6-9, is a former Clipper and seven-year veteran who averaged 11.9 
points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.7 assists for the Bucks last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Coach Mike Dunleavy acknowledged that the move was designed to make room 
under the NBA team's salary cap. Milwaukee, which won the first pick in 
Wednesday's NBA draft and is expected to choose Purdue's Glenn Robinson, hopes 
to sign him to a multiyear deal projected to run as high as $100 million.

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; $94.7-MILLION BUDGET BOOSTS FEES, TRIMS JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Renting movies at the library, being fingerprinted at the police station and 
getting a permit for a satellite dish will cost residents more under Torrance's 
$94.7-million budget for fiscal 1994-95, which was approved at Tuesday's City 
Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Through fee increases, use of one-time funds, reducing supplies for city 
departments and deleting 44 vacant positions, the city balanced a budget that 
at one time had a projected deficit of $5.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had said earlier that the large deficit made layoffs a 
possibility, but members of the council opposed staff cuts. Instead, through 
attrition and redeployment of several employees, no layoffs were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of special funding sources, a few employees were added to public 
safety departments in response to public concern about safety. Four police 
officers and three firefighters will be added. 
</P>
<P>
 The money for the new positions comes from the half-cent sales tax made 
permanent under Proposition 172, a statewide ballot measure passed by voters in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In conjunction with the new budget, the council amended the city law setting 
the utility users tax. A claim of exemption by Mobil Oil prompted clarification 
of the code, City Atty. John Fellows said. Mobil sued the city earlier this 
year over the tax dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The council increased certain city fees. If police officers cited a resident 
for a loud party, for example, the old fee was $97, or 50% of estimated cost to 
the city. Now the fee for a loud party will be $195, or 100% of the estimated 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Recovering the cost for fingerprinting by the Torrance Police Department 
increases the fee from $5 to $10. 
</P>
<P>
 At the library, video rentals used to be $1 for three days, but the new budget 
sets the fee at $1 per day. That fee might increase again as the city juggles 
library hours and services and the amount budgeted for that department. 
</P>
<P>
 For some health, safety and regulatory fees, the city will recover 30% of its 
costs. Satellite dish fees fall under this category. Although the city used to 
collect $109 for each dish, or 17.9% of the cost, it now will collect $182, or 
30%. MARY GUTHRIE

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; HER PROGRAM HELPS REIN IN 
DISABILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 "Look at Nikki!" Nora Fischbach said excitedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikki, a 2 1/2-year-old girl with Down's syndrome, was into a full stand on 
the back of a pony, a feat that lasted only a second or two. But that was 
enough to make Fischbach happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It teaches them (disabled children and adults) to trust and overcome their 
fears," explained Fischbach, program director for Special Equestrian Riding 
Therapy in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1987, the program has helped children and adults overcome their 
disabilities, build speech and muscular control and resolve emotional problems, 
all on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has helped Nikki with balance and walking," said the child's mother, 
Sandi Finch of Calabasas, who has been bringing Nikki to the center since 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Finch said the program has made a world of difference for Nikki, who excitedly 
gives the sign that means "horse" when the car has turned off the Ventura 
Freeway and onto Kanan Road, which leads to the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikki's training sessions begin with volunteers selecting a helmet for her 
before sitting her in a special training saddle on Pony Express, an older, 
white pony. 
</P>
<P>
 The gait of a horse is similar to that of a person, and the rider can learn 
the balance and motion of walking from the horse, Fischbach said. The 
difference between this and other forms of physical therapy, which can be 
grueling for a person with a disability, is that "when you're on a horse, it's 
fun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most handicaps are in your mind, and not your body," said Fischbach, 47, who 
has worked with the disabled as a volunteer since she was 13. 
</P>
<P>
 But even she has been surprised by the progress made at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the riders have taken their first steps "right here at the ranch," 
Fischbach said. She also has seen some speak their first words and others 
receive a big boost in self-esteem.  
</P>
<P>
 The riding therapy program was created by parents of disabled children. When 
Fischbach first heard of it shortly after its inception, she assumed it 
referred to the physically therapeutic benefits horseback riding offers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fischbach, who has a background in special education and behavioral 
therapy, was battling a case of encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain and 
spinal cord that had impaired her ability to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 She told the program's organizers, "If you can wait until I can walk again, I 
will help." She kept her word when she recovered from her illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischbach said working at the ranch keeps her spirits up. "I come here and 
everyone is smiling and laughing," she said. "I can't stay sad here." 
</P>
<P>
 Riders at the ranch range in age from 18 months to 57 years old. They learn to 
help groom the horse and prepare it for riding. Sessions may last from 30 to 90 
minutes depending on the rider's ability.  
</P>
<P>
 The horses are chosen carefully for their demeanor, and must learn not to get 
startled from the crashing noise of wheelchairs and crutches. 
</P>
<P>
 When riders fall, horses usually will stop and wait until they climb back on. 
The animals know that their riders are special and make accommodations for 
them, Fischbach said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch has 11 mostly older horses. Pony Express, in his mid-20s, is one of 
the gentler animals. After a ride, he will put his hoof in a rider's lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "They bond to the horses," Fischbach said. That helps to reach children with 
emotional problems, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The riders learn to be kind and how to treat animals well, to take pride in 
their achievements, to become aware of others -- lessons that can be 
transferred into their daily lives, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,000-acre ranch has an assortment of other animals such as ducks, pigs, 
peacocks, camels, llamas and ostriches, which also delight the riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was one rider whose first word was ostrich ," Fischbach said.

SHELTON STICKS IT TO STICH ON COURT 2; WIMBLEDON: AMERICAN STUNS FORMER 
CHAMPION IN FIRST ROUND, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stick another tombstone outside infamous Court No. 2, known as "the graveyard 
of champions," and busier than ever Wednesday, as unseeded Bryan Shelton 
shocked the late great second-seeded Michael Stich in three "did-you-see-that?" 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
 The American's 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 victory so thoroughly exasperated Stich that the 
former Wimbledon champion stormed off the sun-soaked court and didn't bother to 
look back, not even as a chorus of boos from the standing-room-only crowd of 
3,000 followed each angry step. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the games slipping away one by one, Stich had delivered a wonderful 
overhead smash to his equipment bag, followed soon thereafter by another 
tantrum that left a thin divot in the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't expect a player when he loses in three sets, having high 
expectations, to smile and say, 'Thank you very much, it was a great day,' " 
Stich fumed afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton was one of several Americans, some prominent, some not, who won 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Agassi, a former champion who is seeded 12th, needed nearly 3 1/2 hours 
and five sets to defeat Venezuela's Nicolas Pereira, 6-7 (7-4), 6-3, 6-4, 6-7 
(7-5), 6-4, to advance to the second round. Fifth-seeded Jim Courier, whose 
opening match was postponed Tuesday, beat Zimbabwe's Byron Black, 6-1, 6-7 
(7-5), 6-3, 6-4. It was Courier's fourth victory over Black in as many 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded and defending champion Pete Sampras had a much easier time in his 
second-round match, defeating fellow American Richey Reneberg, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2, 
in 87 minutes. No. 6 Todd Martin beat Germany's Patrick Kuhnen, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4, 
and Michael Chang ground out a 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-6), 6-7 (7-3), 6-4 victory over 
Australian Michael Tebbutt. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's play, Lori McNeil followed her upset of No. 1 Steffi Graf with a 
6-3, 6-7 (7-5), 6-3, victory over Japan's Yone Kamio. Ninth-seeded Lindsay 
Davenport of Murrieta reached the third round by beating South Africa's Tessa 
Price, 6-4, 6-2, in 69 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Shelton's shocker that sent the most shivers down Wimbledon's back 
Wednesday. Until late last week, Shelton not only was unseeded, he was 
uninvited. The Georgia Tech graduate, his ranking an absolute rambling wreck at 
No. 120, was reduced to having to earn one of the precious 16 qualifying spots 
for Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 He squeaked in -- his sixth Wimbledon appearance -- and then waited for the 
draw. The news was good. 
</P>
<P>
 He got Stich. 
</P>
<P>
 Since losing in the Wimbledon quarterfinals last year, Stich has done more 
diving than a Stuka. He lost in the first round of the 1993 U.S. Open, in the 
first round of this year's Australian Open and in the second round of the 
recent French Open. For Stich, the Slam events have been anything but Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this was Bryan Shelton we were talking about, the same guy who had 
never beaten a player ranked in the top five. A British journalist writing for 
the daily Wimbledon program said of the Stich match: "The American Bryan 
Shelton is allocated the bleak task of attempting to inter him." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: Shelton, one of only two African-American male players on the pro 
circuit, began the tournament with more losses than victories this season, 
14-12. His previous claim to fame was serving as a ballboy to Jimmy Connors 
during a 1977 match in Birmingham, Ala. Surely Stich could beat him . 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't. For only the second time in Wimbledon history, a No. 2-seeded 
player was sent packing after the opening round. It happened in 1931 . . . and 
then Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, another day, another upset, another American doing the heavy 
Wimbledon lifting. This time it was Shelton. A day earlier it was the unseeded 
McNeil, who beat Graf, merely the prohibitive favorite to win a fourth 
consecutive title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played a guy today . . . he could have closed his eyes and he could have 
hit the ball wherever he wanted to hit it," Stich said. "He had all the luck on 
his side. I didn't have one lucky ball for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton did have his share of shots that tripped over the net and fell in for 
winners. He hit an awkward backhand off the racket frame for another point. He 
kept his serves mostly deep and continually frustrated Stich, who yelled to 
Shelton in disbelief, "Are you OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton was better than OK, he was magical. Stich, who didn't play well or 
poorly, could find no weaknesses in Shelton's usually erratic game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he felt like I was playing really good tennis," said Shelton of 
Stich's on-court question. "He felt I was playing above myself, and I did play 
good tennis today." 
</P>
<P>
 He also had the ghosts of upsets past on his side. John McEnroe lost on Court 
2 in 1979. Connors staggered off its cozy, shaded confines in 1983. Ilie 
Nastase lost there in 1973, Arthur Ashe in 1976, Vitas Gerulaitis in 1979, Raul 
Ramirez in 1977, Tim Mayotte in 1990, Evonne Goolagong in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Stich, felled by the curse of Court 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "So now I know what it means," Stich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stich made one brief attempt to get back into the match. He was up, 2-0, in 
the third set, but then watched helplessly as Shelton won the next four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Stich held serve the next two times, but so did Shelton, who finally got the 
victory when the German's flailing backhand landed wide.

 Moments later, with Stich long gone, Shelton turned to the audience, raised 
his arms in triumph and began pumping his fists. In the stands was his brother 
Nathaniel, an Army captain stationed in Germany who had traveled to Wimbledon 
for the first time to see Bryan play. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nathaniel's hands was a homemade sign. "Go, Bryan," it read. 
</P>
<P>
 He did, all the way past Stich and into the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters later surrounded Nikki Pilic, the German Davis Cup captain and 
Stich's occasional teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Stich injured? Is there a problem? 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have a problem," Pilic said. "The problem is, he didn't serve very 
well. The problem was Bryan." 
</P>
<P>
 Wimbledon Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Spain's Conchita Martinez, now considered one of the favorites in the women's 
singles, defeated Japan's Nana Miyagi, 6-1, 7-6 (7-3). . . . Third-seeded 
Stefan Edberg and No. 5 Jana Novotna also won their Wednesday matches. . . . 
Pete Sampras, on Bryan Shelton's upset of Michael Stich: "A tough first-round 
match for anybody. I'm surprised, but I'm not that surprised. Upsets happen." 
And this: "Out of all the rounds, you feel a bit vulnerable in the first round 
or second."

GRIFFEY STEALS SHOW; ANGELS LOSE, SEETHE; BASEBALL: MARINER STAR'S RECORD HOME 
RUN BRINGS A CHEER THAT IRKS TEAM DURING 12-3 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was the moment Angel fans had been awaiting these last three days, and as 
soon the ball left his bat, they sucked in their breath while witnessing the 
historic shot. 
</P>
<P>
 They reacted as if Ken Griffey Jr. was one of their own, celebrating his 31st 
home run of the season en route to the Seattle Mariners' 12-3 victory over the 
Angels on Wednesday night before 22,305 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans erupted into cheers the moment the ball soared into the Mariner 
bullpen and were providing an ovation by the time he crossed home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't need any prompts by the scoreboard to tell them that Griffey had 
just made baseball history by hitting more homers than anyone by the end of 
June, eclipsing Babe Ruth's record of 30 set in 1928 and matched in 1930. It 
was Griffey's first homer in four games, but his ninth in the last 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey, who actually predicted that he would hit his 31st home run before 
batting practice, hit the shot against starter Brian Anderson. It traveled 404 
feet, his 11th consecutive homer of more than 400 feet. He now is on pace to 
hit 71 homers, 10 more than Roger Maris' 61 record-total in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really concern myself with history," Griffey said. "It's not going to 
help me. I don't want to be thinking, 'He hit a homer this day, so I have to 
hit one that day.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about the past. The homers will take care of the future. And 
that will make the present OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey, who actually came out for early batting practice Wednesday because he 
wasn't pleased with his swing, triggered a five-run onslaught that enabled the 
Mariners to overcome a 3-1 deficit. After Jay Buhner's three-run homer in the 
seventh, the only remaining suspense was whether Griffey would hit another. He 
instead finished the night with a double, homer and three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most amazing aspect of Griffey's home run binge is that he has as 
many homers this season as the Mariners (31-39) do victories. It's not exactly 
a feat the Mariners are proud of, but they pulled within one game of the Texas 
Rangers (32-38), who became the first team in baseball history to be in first 
place while being six games below .500. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, it was difficult to know if the Angels (31-42) were more upset with 
themselves or their fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel players privately have been seething for years while fans in their 
own park cheer harder for the likes of the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox and 
Detroit Tigers, but the reaction toward Griffey put them over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't stand it," Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. "I just wish more 
people would cheer for us than they do Ken Griffey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time it's been so noticeable. Really, I can't understand it. 
We're only 2 1/2 games out of first place. Can you imagine them doing this at 
Fenway or Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in Boston, and I never, ever, have seen anything like that at 
Fenway. If you rooted for someone there besides the Sox, you'd get a punch in 
the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I guarantee you if you wore a Lakers hat at the Garden, you wouldn't be 
leaving with it. Either that, or you'd be wearing it on some other place on 
your body." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel reliever Mike Butcher: "I think it's a joke, an absolute joke. It 
seems like we're on the road when we're at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann: "That's always been part of Anaheim. You 
have a lot of transplanted people here who have roots in other areas, so you 
feel like the visiting team sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get upset by it, but I know the players do."

LATEST POOR OUTING MYSTERY TO HERSHISER; BASEBALL: RIGHT-HANDER CONTINUES TO 
STRUGGLE DURING 7-6 LOSS TO PADRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser isn't worried about the mini-slump that has gripped him in his 
last three starts. He would simply like to find out what caused it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser lasted only four-plus innings Wednesday as the Dodgers lost the 
rubber game of a three-game series against the Padres, 7-6, before 30,978 at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. He was hammered for 10 hits and six runs, five 
of them earned, and was an admittedly puzzled man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just pitched poorly," said the 35-year-old right-hander. "When you pitch 
like that, you give up runs. I threw all right, but my location was off. I was 
high in the strike zone or over the middle of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been that long since I was pitching well, so I'm not jumping off 
any bridges, but I'd like to find some answers. When I'm not doing well, I 
don't just bang my head against the wall and keep doing the same things." 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser wasn't the losing pitcher -- Darren Dreifort was -- but that 
technicality hardly eased the pain of an outing that raised his earned-run 
average from 3.74 to 4.06. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely haven't found it," Hershiser said. "I guess if you haven't found 
it, you don't have it. I don't know. Is that right? Where's Yogi?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser's reference to the legendary linguist, Hall of Famer Yogi Berra, 
illustrated his remarkable ability to make the best of a bad situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he planned to tackle his problem, Hershiser said, "I'll just have to 
go through the normal process of breaking down my mechanics. I've been doing 
something that I'm sure can be corrected, and I can only hope I find the 
solution real soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser's troubles Wednesday saddled the Dodgers with a 6-2 deficit, and 
with Andy Benes pitching for the Padres, the game looked as good as over. But 
Benes gave up a solo home run to Carlos Hernandez in the seventh, and after 
Benes left, Raul Mondesi tied the score with a three-run shot against Mike 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort promptly surrendered the tiebreaking run in the bottom of the same 
inning, walking two and giving up Luis Lopez's career-high fourth hit, a 
double. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat ran Dreifort's record to 0-6 -- his ERA is 6.21 -- and he said 
afterward, "You don't want to walk anybody, let alone two guys. I've just got 
to keep working on things." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who made a rare start behind the plate as Mike Piazza was rested, 
analyzed Dreifort's difficulties by saying, "He was throwing too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Cory Snyder did all he could to re-tie the score in the eighth, but a 
combination of factors, among them his lack of speed, did him in. He doubled as 
a pinch-hitter for Henry Rodriguez and took third on Hernandez's long fly, then 
was cut down at the plate when he tried to score on Phil Plantier's bad throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "The throw hit me," Snyder said. "Then when I went to get up, the third 
baseman (Craig Shipley) kind of fell on me. I probably should have stayed, but 
I heard Joey Amalfitano (third base coach) yelling, so I gave it a shot. If I 
hadn't stumbled, I might have made it." 
</P>
<P>
 Amalfitano said of his decision to send Snyder home, "Give the third baseman 
credit. He didn't sit around and sign autographs. He got up and made the 
throw." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Piazza was in effect given the day off, Manager Tom Lasorda found a 
perfect spot for him to pinch-hit in the ninth. Piazza got the call after Jose 
Offerman led off with a walk. But Trevor Hoffman fired a 90-plus m.p.h. 
fastball past Piazza for a called third strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Two outs later, the last-place Padres were within eight games of the 
first-place Dodgers in the National League West, and their main man, Tony 
Gwynn, saw that as reason for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're heading in the right direction," Gwynn said.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The summer game -- basketball -- and our new national sport -- soccer -- made 
for some wonderful television Wednesday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 How bizarre, Houston winning a championship and the United States a World Cup 
game on the same day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon is to the Rockets what John Elway is to the Denver Broncos, 
the difference being that Olajuwon soon will be fitted for a championship ring. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Riley -- who joined another former Laker coach, Fred Schaus, as a 
four-time NBA finals loser -- really had no other option than to stick with 
John Starks and hope that he would regain his shooting touch. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 My NBA title choice for next season is Chicago, led by Michael Jordan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Draped in the American flag, Tony Meola reminded me of another goaltender 
named Jim Craig. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The most spectacular play of the game at Pasadena was not a goal, but Marcelo 
Balboa's near-miss bicycle kick in the second half. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland's upset win earlier in the day over Romania, which had beaten 
Colombia, must have been a huge boost to the Americans' confidence. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Can there be a better setting for football of any type than the Rose Bowl? . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Most surprising soccer statistic: Brazil and Germany have never met in a World 
Cup game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Astute comment by an ESPN announcer on the theatrics of German star Juergen 
Klinsmann: "It looks like he's been hit by a bomb, doesn't it?" . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Never have so many stretcher cases recovered so quickly. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If I'm the manager, I issue Tony Gwynn an intentional walk even if he does 
represent the winning run with a man on third, one out, and the Dodgers leading 
the Padres, 3-2, in the 13th inning Tuesday night at San Diego. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Ismael Valdes, the rookie relief pitcher just called up by the Dodgers, has a 
strong presence on the mound. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 How is Darryl Strawberry, who never has been considered a great outfielder, 
going to cope with the winds at Candlestick Park? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 So young San Francisco Giant right-hander Salomon Torres says he can't pitch 
at this level.Don't worry, Salomon. Neither can a lot of other National League 
pitchers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I can think of teams who needed Ron Gant more than the Cincinnati Reds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 How can the Kings even consider not re-signing Rob Blake, who becomes eligible 
for free agency July 1? Who knows what you're going to get as compensation. 
Blake is the team's best defenseman and he's only 24. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, Sam McMaster, but the addition of Bob Probert wouldn't make up for the 
loss of Blake. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak have new titles with the Lakers, but their job 
descriptions sound a lot like their old ones. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Kupchak, the general manager, is one of the most respected young executives in 
the NBA -- and West, the vice president in charge of basketball operations, one 
of the most respected older ones. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers could do worse than to hire Rick Adelman, the former Portland 
Trail Blazer coach who played at Pius X High in Downey and Loyola Marymount. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 If Jerry Ball really has trimmed down to 300 pounds, he could give the Raiders 
some quality depth in the defensive line. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Bob Larsen believes he could have the next great American miler in 
Mebrahtom Keflezighi, who won the national scholastic mile in 4:05. Well, maybe 
the next great 1,500-meter runner. The mile is rarely run anymore and the Bruin 
school record remains Bob Day's 3:56.4 in 1964. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Major sporting events in the L.A. area contributed approximately $2 billion to 
the local economy in 1993, according to a study conducted by a team of students 
from the Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The three headliners on the Forum boxing card Friday night -- bantamweight 
Marco Antonio Barrera, welterweight Jose (Shibata) Flores and featherweight 
Chico Castillo -- are a combined 67-1 with 43 knockouts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Williams' chin will be tested at the Grand Olympic Friday by Bert 
Cooper, who appears to be in good shape. Cooper knocked Michael Moorer down 
twice and nearly put away Evander Holyfield, but there is always the question 
of his conditioning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A win over Vinny Pazienza Saturday at the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas would 
do wonders for the drawing power of Roberto Duran, who needs the money despite 
all the millions of dollars he has made during a career that has spanned 28 
years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 News item: NBA rejects sale of Minnesota Timberwolves to group that includes 
boxing promoter Bob Arum. Reaction: With all the fighting in the league, Arum 
would have been a natural.

 GROUP E at Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy vs. Norway 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1 p.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TELEVISION: ESPN and Univision. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Italy will find Norway's defense every bit as difficult as 
Ireland's was. Using Jan Age Fjortoft as a lone striker in front of a five-man 
midfield gives Norway the flexibility to switch quickly from defense or 
offense. This transition game is one of the team's strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway also has a strong bench and uses its substitutes shrewdly. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, meanwhile, still is having trouble adapting to its new 4-3-3 alignment. 
Also evident in the 1-0 loss to the Irish was the ineffectiveness of veteran 
defender Franco Baresi. He has apparently lost that vital step needed at the 
World Cup level. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuseppe Signori, the only player Italy has these days who even resembles a 
striker, will be looking for his first World Cup goal. Roberto Baggio, who was 
supposed to be the brightest star of the tournament, has yet to shine. It's now 
or never for the ponytailed Bhuddist, who is likely to find an avowed 
Christian, Norwegian sweeper Rune Bratseth, blocking his way. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: With a rabid press baying for his blood and a team whose confidence 
has been rattled by a loss to Ireland, Italy Coach Arrigo Sacchi is a man under 
siege. If his team loses today, he might as well apply for permanent residence 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi's Norwegian counterpart, Egil Olsen, has no such worries and was 
pictured in a newspaper recently sun-bathing on the side of the field as he 
watched his players practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt was in excellent form against Mexico and 
will need to match that effort in this game. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: The Italians have to win; the Norwegians do not. Unlike the game 
against Ireland, Italy will have most of the fans on its side. The Italians 
will be out to redeem themselves and should do so by a single goal. Look for 
Italy to win, 1-0 or 2-1, and for the Italian press to then predict that Italy 
will win the World Cup. GRAHAME L. JONES

 GROUP C at Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea vs. Bolivia 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 4:30 p.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN2, Univision, International Channel; ESPN (9:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Erwin Sanchez, Bolivia's only player who competes in a 
European professional league, is a forward who could have an exciting afternoon 
against South Korean defenders Kim Pan-keun and Park Jung-bae. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez is joined on a potentially explosive front line by William Ramallo, 
nicknamed "the Phantom" after he had scored seven of his country's 22 goals in 
qualifying. In Bolivia's 1-0 loss to Germany, however, Ramallo could have been 
called the Phantom because he kept disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The man with the best nickname among the Bolivians, forward Marco (the Devil) 
Etcheverry, will not be playing. He was given a red card for rough play against 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean fans, celebrating a 2-2 tie with Spain, still are marveling over 
the last-minute goal scored by substitute Seo Jung-won. The other goal was 
scored by midfielder Hong Myung-bo, but the South Koreans could struggle 
against star Bolivian defender Gustavo Quinteros. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: The South Koreans hope to continue their surprisingly good play and 
the Bolivians hope to avoid elimination. The key is not attitude but altitude . 
</P>
<P>
 With their home field located in the highest capital city in the world, La 
Paz, the Bolivians dominated qualifying. If you think the Denver Broncos have 
an advantage in their mile-high city, try playing the Bolivians at 12,001 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 They won all five qualifying games there, one against World Cup favorite 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 But, alas, they returned to the lowlands for their final three qualifying 
games and went 0-2-1. Then they couldn't score in Chicago in the Cup opener 
against Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Foxboro Stadium being at 280 feet above sea level, the Bolivians are once 
again in danger of coming out flat. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: With two goals in the final five minutes against Spain, South Korea 
gained the confidence to advance past the first round for the first time in 
four World Cup appearances. The Bolivians have lost their Devil, can't count on 
their Phantom, and have been outscored in their three World Cup appearances, 
17-0. South Koreans by one. BILL PLASCHKE

 Wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat to shield him from the sun, Ireland Coach 
Jack Charlton led his team through its first practice at the Florida Citrus 
Bowl on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although earlier in the week he'd feared that the heat would drain his 
players, he was more optimistic after Wednesday's workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the weather is like it was today, it will be lovely," Charlton said, 
referring to the light breeze that moved clouds in front of the sun and cooled 
the field. "We would be delighted with that. . . . There is a nice gap in this 
stadium which allows wind to get in and out, which we didn't get on some of the 
other grounds that we played on here." HELENE ELLIOTT

 After watching all 24 World Cup teams play at least once, Blatter, general

 Behind every great team there is an absolutely appalling goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not sure if we have seen a great team at this World Cup yet, but I am 
quite certain we have seen some dreadful goalkeepers.Why do they pick 'em? 
</P>
<P>
 When you see a goalkeeper give a performance of genuine 24-carat awfulness, 
you have to wonder about his function in the team. It surely can't be that of 
keeping the score down. 
</P>
<P>
 Tying in first place for the worst goalie of the World Cup so far are 
Joseph-Antoine Bell, of Cameroon, and Oscar Cordoba, of Colombia.

 Three youths from Portland, Ore., and one from Garden Grove made that World

 Milutinovic walked away from his team's bench, scurried down the sideline and 
headed to the locker room with more than two minutes remaining in the first 
half. Never mind that the U.S. team was threatening to score and even had a 
corner kick. 
</P>

 "In important games I always try to leave the field early so I can prepare

 "Before the game the street was full of people driving around, waving flags, 
honking horns," said Martinez. "One of the employees has a 52-inch TV, so the

it was totally quiet. No one was out. It's kind of eerie.

 Major league baseball players aren't the only athletes threatening to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon's Indomitable Lions, whose lives off the field have been dominated by 
financial problems, have threatened to be no-shows for Friday's game at Palo 
Alto against Brazil unless they are paid the money they have been promised by 
their soccer federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankrupt federation appealed to the government, which dispatched sports 
minister Bernard Massoua to the team's training camp at Moraga, Calif., 
Wednesday with a suitcase filled with $535,000. 
</P>
<P>
 When the players responded with a fax to the government demanding more, the 
country's president, Paul Biya, arranged for an additional $400,000 to be 
delivered today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players are losing confidence, and they want a guarantee," said Coach 
Henri Michel, whose team tied Sweden, 2-2, in its first game Sunday at the Rose 
Bowl. "It's difficult to concentrate on games." RANDY HARVEY

<P>
 International soccer officials said Wednesday they were unhappy with some of 
the officiating at World Cup '94 and threatened to release referees who have 
been sub-par. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he refused to identify any referees, Joseph Blatter, general 
secretary of FIFA, soccer's world governing body, said a few of the first 13 
matches were poorly officiated, among them Tuesday's Argentina-Greece game at 
Foxboro, Mass.The referee for that game was Arturo Angeles of Temple City. 
</P>
<P>
 Blatter said FIFA was disappointed by the lack of fouls for tackling from 
behind and the roughness in guarding stars such as Diego Maradona of Argentina, 
Roberto Baggio of Italy and Romario of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 A review by FIFA's officiating council is expected to be completed this 
morning in Irving, Tex., but results will not be announced until Monday. Any 
referee deemed below par will be sent home. ELLIOTT ALMOND

<P>
 The improbable may have come to mind -- 1980 and Lake Placid, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you believe in miracles? Yes!" was the call that helped make Al Michaels a 
household name. The United States had just beaten the former Soviet Union in 
the Winter Olympics, 4-3, and would play in the gold-medal game against 
Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviets were international hockey's elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia has been among international soccer's elite. 
</P>
<P>
 And the United States beat the Colombians, 2-1, Wednesday at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Was this another case of do you believe in miracles?  
</P>
<P>
 Not according to U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic, called a miracle worker for 
coaching Mexico to the World Cup quarterfinals in 1986 and Costa Rica to the 
second round in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in miracles," he said, "because all these players today put 
forth a great effort and with great support of the fans. But it's very 
important that we don't think ahead. It's much more important to think about 
where we are now." 
</P>
<P>
 Where they are is in a game against Romania on Sunday that could win them the 
Group A championship after going into the tournament just hoping to avoid being 
the first host team to fail to advance into the elimination round. JIM HODGES

 Although most of the officials who run soccer are from Europe and South 
America, there was a decidedly pro-American sentiment at FIFA's World Cup 
headquarters in Irving, Tex., after the United States stunned Colombia, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best thing that could happen to the whole tournament," said Guido 
Tognoni, a spokesman for FIFA, soccer's world governing body."We've had many 
highlights, but this is the highlight for the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA has brought its international showcase, the World Cup finals, to the 
final frontier in an effort to plant a soccer foundation in America. But no 
matter how well-run the tournament, FIFA knew it would fail to grab the 
American public without the help of the home team. 
</P>
<P>
 Now international soccer is getting more help than it had imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an historical day for the U.S.," Tognoni said. "This is exactly the 
kick soccer needs in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Tognoni marveled at the change in American interest in the past 10 days, 
ignited when the United States opened the Cup with a 1-1 tie against 
Switzerland last Saturday. He said it would have been a disaster had the United 
States lost three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't expect such a euphoric crowd," Tognoni said of the American 
reaction to the tournament. "A week ago, most Americans knew only something 
about hooligans. Now they are finding it is a real sport and the American 
players are heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA always hopes the host country does well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans are not impressed by big names, they just try to go out and 
win," Tognoni said. "I think it is a great mentality. This winning spirit is 
typically American. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the end of the story yet." ELLIOTT ALMOND

 In the 1994 World Cup in the United States, authorities in Chicago tried to

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alex Diaz hit his first major league home run, off Ben McDonald, in an 
eight-run second inning that carried the Milwaukee Brewers past the Orioles, 
9-2, Wednesday night at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewers got nine hits and two walks in the second off McDonald (10-5) and 
Mark Williamson. Diaz hit a three-run homer and singled, and Matt Mieske and 
Dave Nilsson also had two hits in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 B.J. Surhoff hit his fourth homer for the Brewers, who have won six of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Eldred (8-7) pitched a three-hitter, walking four and striking out four in 
his fourth complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald allowed eight runs and seven hits in 1 2/3 innings. It was his 
shortest stint of the season and matched the third-shortest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 9, Detroit 6 -- Jim Thome hit two home runs for the first time in 
his career, and Sandy Alomar homered for the third consecutive game, powering 
the Indians past the Tigers in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The American League Central-leading Indians, whose 10-game winning streak was 
snapped Tuesday night in Detroit, will play their next 11 games at home, where 
they have won a club-record 19 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Martinez (6-4) pitched 6 1/3 innings for his fifth victory in his last 
eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
 John Doherty (6-5) was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 9, Minnesota 2 -- Mike Gallego's run-scoring single ignited a 
seven-run seventh inning, carrying the Yankees to a victory over the Twins and 
a three-game sweep in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Kamieniecki and Kevin Tapani were locked in a scoreless duel until the 
seventh, when the Twins scored on Alex Cole's sacrifice fly to take a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernie Williams doubled to lead off the bottom of the inning, and Tapani 
(8-4) walked Randy Velarde before Gallego's single tied the score and Mark 
Guthrie relieved Tapani. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing six-run barrage included Jim Leyritz's two-run single and Paul 
O'Neill two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Plate Umpire Larry Barnett issued a warning to both benches after Kamieniecki 
hit Shane Mack in the left wrist with a pitch in the fourth and Tapani hit 
Leyritz leading off the New York fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 3, Toronto 2 -- Tom Brunansky drove in two runs and the Red Sox 
completed a three-game sweep at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox had lost 11 in a row, their longest skid since 1932, before 
sweeping Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays have lost five in a row and eight of nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Nate Minchey (1-2), who entered with a 21.60 ERA, allowed four hits and struck 
out seven in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stewart (5-6) was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 10, Oakland 1 -- Bob Hamelin and Felix Jose homered, helping Tom 
Gordon and the Royals defeat the Athletics at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon (7-4) pitched 6 1/3 innings and gave up six hits, including Mark 
McGwire's home run. He escaped his biggest jam by striking out Terry Steinbach 
with the bases loaded to end the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 4, Texas 0 -- Wilson Alvarez, a loser of his previous two decisions 
after winning a club-record 15 in a row, got another victory by allowing two 
hits over eight innings as the White Sox beat the Rangers at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez (9-2) earned his first victory since May 27.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; LARKIN DELIVERS AGAIN FOR THE REDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Larkin continued his June surge Wednesday night with his second 
game-winning hit in two nights. His two-out single in the ninth inning against 
Rod Beck gave the Cincinnati Reds a 4-3 victory over the San Francisco Giants 
at Cincinnati, sending the Giants to their 11th loss in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Larkin hit a solo homer Tuesday night in the eighth inning of a 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the hottest hitter on their team right now," Giant Manager Dusty Baker 
said. "That wasn't a bad pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Larkin spent most of the first 10 weeks of the season trying to keep his 
average above .200. It's climbing fast now that he has hit in 15 consecutive 
games, jumping from .233 to .279 since June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 5, Atlanta 2 -- The Mets scored four runs in the eighth inning at 
Atlanta, helped by pitcher Greg Maddux's throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux appeared to be coasting to his 11th victory after retiring 16 batters 
in a row before Todd Hundley singled to open the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Thompson followed with a single that sent Hundley to third and 
pinch-hitter Shawn Hare singled off the center-field fence, scoring Hundley and 
sending Thompson to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Vina then sacrificed, but raced all the way to third as Thompson and 
Hare scored when Maddux (10-3) threw wide of first into the right-field bullpen 
area. Jose Vizcaino then drove in Vina with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally enabled Pete Smith (4-7) to beat his former teammates in his first 
appearance against the Braves. He went seven innings, giving up four hits, 
walking three and striking out two. Mauro Gozzo pitched the eighth and John 
Franco pitched the ninth for his 17th save. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Franco's 253rd save, most by a left-hander. He was previously tied with 
Dave Righetti, now with the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 5, Philadelphia 4 -- Kevin Stocker was tagged for the final out at 
Pittsburgh as he tried to dive over catcher Don Slaught for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies trailed when Stocker drew a leadoff walk in the ninth and took 
third on pitcher Alejandro Pena's errant pickoff throw. With one out, 
pinch-hitter Pete Incaviglia walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Hatcher followed with a fly ball caught by right fielder Orlando Merced, 
whose throw home arrived as Stocker neared the plate. Stocker dived over 
Slaught but also missed the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Slaught, meanwhile, held the ball aloft, waiting for umpire Jerry Meals to 
make a call. Stocker seemed to realize he had not been tagged, and tried to 
dive back over Slaught. Slaught, however, made the tag an instant before 
Stocker touched the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 14, Houston 5 -- The Rockies' Dante Bichette hit two homers and tied 
club records with five runs batted in and four hits at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Jones also had four hits and Vinny Castilla three as the Rockies 
hammered out 20, tying a team record. The Rockies also matched a season high 
for hits in an inning with five -- collecting that total in both the first and 
fourth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 6, St. Louis 4 -- Larry Walker had a three-run homer and Moises Alou 
a solo shot at St. Louis as Bob Tewksbury's career-worst slump continued at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Tewksbury (8-7) has been stuck on eight victories for six starts -- all losses 
-- during which he has a 10.13 earned-run average.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PIAZZA GETS THE DAY OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Piazza finally got some time off Wednesday after having caught 20 
consecutive games since May 29. 
</P>
<P>
 With a day game against the Padres on the heels of a 13-inning marathon 
Tuesday night, Manager Tom Lasorda decided it was time to give his all-star 
catcher a rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's stand-in, Carlos Hernandez, responded by hitting his first home run 
of the season. Piazza finally was used as pinch-hitter in the ninth. He has 
appeared in 68 of the Dodgers' 71 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "A day off here and an off day tomorrow should bring Mike back strong," 
Lasorda said. "I want him to catch about 140 games, but I've got to give him a 
rest once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza is batting .338, with 15 home runs and 65 runs batted in. He is leading 
catchers in the National League voting for the All-Star game in Pittsburgh July 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda doesn't buy the popular notion that a juiced-up baseball is 
responsible for the increase in home runs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think there's a lot of strong guys in baseball," he said. "The guys 
that are hitting home runs are capable of hitting them. Look what happened 
(Tuesday) night at Denver. A guy (David Nied) pitched a shutout." . . . Lasorda 
said that newcomer Ismael Valdes had worked himself into a prominent position 
in the Dodger bullpen by pitching hitless ball in his first five major league 
innings. "He's going to be a big addition to this club," Lasorda said. . . . 
Mitch Webster was still accepting congratulations for the first inside-the-park 
home run of his career, hit in the 13th inning Tuesday night. "It was fun." he 
said. "I hope I can do it at least once more." BOB WOLF

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; SALMON SAYS HE'S NOT WORTHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be the biggest thrill of his baseball career, an accomplishment that 
many major league players dream about but never realize. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, when asked about his hopes of representing the Angels at the All-Star 
game, right fielder Tim Salmon says that as great an honor as it would be, he 
simply doesn't deserve it. 
</P>
<P>
 Not this year. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he says, teammate Chili Davis should be going. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel I'm deserving," Salmon said, despite batting .282 with 15 homers 
and 53 runs batted in before Wednesday's game against the Seattle Mariners. "If 
you asked me who would get my vote, it would be Chili." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a designated hitter, was batting .336 with 13 homers and 52 RBIs before 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although third baseman Eduardo Perez says that he's ready to return to the 
Angels, batting .340 with 11 RBIs in 14 games at triple-A Vancouver, Manager 
Marcel Lachemann said that Perez probably will not be called up until after the 
All-Star break. . . . The Angels moved Mark Langston's scheduled start Friday 
back two days to Sunday, Lachemann said, simply to give him extra rest. 
Langston has not pitched past the seventh inning since opening day. BOB

HOLLYWOOD PARK; ARCANGUES, BAILEY REUNITING JULY 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arcangues and Jerry Bailey will be reunited again in the $750,000 Hollywood 
Gold Cup on July 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The rider when Arcangues scored his $269.20 upset in the Breeders' Cup Classic 
last Nov. 6, Bailey replaces Eddie Delahoussaye. 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoussaye has ridden the 6-year-old for trainer Richard Mandella in both of 
Arcangues' 1994 starts -- a victory in the John Henry Handicap on May 1 and a 
fifth-place finish in the Hollywood Turf Handicap on May 30. In the Turf 
Handicap, Arcangues ran contrary to his style as he either set or forced the 
pace, then had little to offer in the final quarter of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Bailey) rated him nicely in the Classic," said Mandella, who wasn't happy 
after Arcangues' last race. "And we wanted to try him back again." 
</P>
<P>
 Arcangues made his dirt debut in the Breeders' Cup Classic and will be 
returning to that surface in the Gold Cup. He worked six furlongs in 1:10 4/5 
over Hollywood Park's main track on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bothered by sinusitis for several months and able to ride only off and on, 
Delahoussaye gave up the mount on Strodes Creek in the Belmont Stakes on June 
11 and Bailey wound up riding him to a third-place finish behind Tabasco Cat 
and Go For Gin. Mandella said, however, that Delahoussaye's physical condition 
was not a factor in the decision to switch riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Laffit Pincay, Chris McCarron and John Atherton were off their mounts 
Wednesday because of illness. . . . Trainers Richard Mandella, Sandy Shulman, 
Dan Hendricks, Ed Moger Jr., Noble Threewitt and Jack Van Berg have been 
elected to the board of directors of the California Horsemen's Benevolent and 
Protective Assn. The 12 owners elected to the board were Gerry Behman, Gary 
Burke, Ron Charles, Marianne Chase, Ed Friendly, Bart Heller, Charles Kenis, 
Alan Landsburg, Marvin Malmuth, Jack Owens, and Mace and Samantha Siegel. The 
new board will hold its first meeting June 29. . . . Contrary to a published 
report, Grand Flotilla, the upset winner of the Hollywood Turf Handicap, will 
not run in the $500,000 Caesars International Handicap at Atlantic City on 
Sunday. The 7-year-old roan, who was 14-1 when he beat Bien Bien and six others 
in the Turf Handicap, worked half a mile in 47 4/5 on Tuesday. "He's nominated 
to the American Handicap (July 4) and we'll look at the Sunset (July 24)," 
trainer Jenine Sahadi said. . . . Saturday's Jim Murray Stakes at Hollywood 
Park will be the final race in this week's National Best Seven. The other 
races: the Hill Prince from Belmont Park, the Princess Rooney from Calder in 
Florida, the Blue Sparkler from Monmouth Park in New Jersey, the Very Subtle 
from Laurel in Maryland, the Chicago Budweiser Breeders' Cup from Arlington 
Park and the Mangaki from Golden Gate Fields. . . . Weights for the Gold Cup 
will be out Friday.

LOS ALAMITOS; TWO-YEAR-OLD TRIO PROMISING AT KINDERGARTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Jaime Gomez will start three 2-year-olds in Friday's $100,000 
Kindergarten Futurity, and although he predicts that his horses will run 1-2, 
it's possible that his best 2-year-old will remain in the barn that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Gomez saddled five of the 18 quarter horses trying to qualify 
for the Grade II Kindergarten. Four of the five are owned by Dutch Masters III 
and three of those will run Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fling King won the second trial in 17.99 seconds. Canthus was in the 
middle of the pack of qualifiers at 18.25 and Taras First Love squeaked in at 
18.40. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Dutchman, the fourth of the Dutch Masters III runners, missed by 0.02 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although The Fling King has always been the trainer's pick, he believed that 
Hi Tech Attack would give him a race. Unfortunately, Hi Tech Attack flipped as 
the gates sprung open and didn't finish the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Hi Tech Attack suffered only cuts and bruises from hitting the gate and will 
probably race next week. Meanwhile, The Fling King takes over as the trainer's 
first choice in the Kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 His second choice, Canthus, has a cataract in his left eye and runs with a 
blinker on that side. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll run better and better each time," Gomez said. "He could be a surprise 
in this one." 
</P>
<P>
 But Taras First Love, the stable's third horse in this race, is the barn 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 James Streelman and Denny Boer, the remaining two of the three Dutchmen who 
started Dutch Masters racing stable, bred all three runners and like their 
Kindergarten chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought (The Fling King) was our best chance to qualify," Streelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after 10 years as a race horse owner, he is not counting this one over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting, but we've had the fastest qualifier before and that doesn't 
always win the race," Streelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 To collect the $42,000 winner's share, The Fling King will have to beat My 
Left Foot and Cool Papa Bell, the second- and third-fastest qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 My Left Foot beat Hi Tech Attack in his first start and ran second to The 
Fling King in the trial, but ran greenly both times. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool Papa Bell comes to the Kindergarten with a little more experience. In 
four races, he has won three and finished third once. Cool Papa Bell was racing 
for the first time under the lights in his Kindergarten trial, which he won in 
18.08 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Bret Layne, the Dashing Val gelding is owned by James Kelly and 
Charles Grannon. Kelly manages Legacy Ranch, where the gelding was bred, and 
named him after James Thomas Bell, a baseball player in the old Negro leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's $110,000 Miss Kindergarten Futurity, trainer Danny Mitchell and 
owner Cathy Monji once again will have the fastest qualifier and the probable 
favorite in Dicey Secret. Qualifying for the Miss Kindergarten, Dicey Secret 
ran a 17.86, a length faster than the second-place finisher, Ms Dash 
Fascination. Ah Sigh, the third-fastest qualifier, also won her trial 
impressively. Owned by Frank Nakamura and trained by Charles Bloomquist, Ah 
Sigh is now two for two. Owners Carol and Edward DeNike, who own 3-year-old 
stakes runners Her First Cin and Streakin Millie, have another strong set of 
2-year-old fillies in A Total High and Dashing Dual. . . . Kent Desormeaux won 
the jockey challenge by winning the 870-yard race and finishing fourth in the 
400-yard race on Saturday. Along with Corey Nakatani and Chris Antley, 
Desormeaux was representing the Hollywood Park jockeys colony against Los 
Alamitos regulars riders Eddie Garcia, Jose Badilla Jr. and Jim Lewis.

<P>
 The Milwaukee Bucks traded former Clipper Kenny Norman to the Atlanta Hawks 
Wednesday for forward Roy Hinson, who sat out most of the last four seasons 
because of knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-9 Hinson, 33, was acquired by the Hawks two years ago from the New 
Jersey Nets. In 1990-91, his last active season, Hinson played only nine games, 
averaging 4.6 points per game for the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, also 6-9, is a seven-year veteran who averaged 11.9 points, 6.1 
rebounds and 2.7 assists for the Bucks last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Coach Mike Dunleavy acknowledged that the move was designed to make room 
under the NBA team's salary cap. Milwaukee, which won the first pick in 
Wednesday's NBA draft and is expected to choose Purdue's Glenn Robinson, hopes 
to sign him to a multiyear deal projected to run as high as $100 million. Pro

 Linebacker Clay Matthews, formerly of the Cleveland Browns, has reached

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK; LATE-MODEL STOCK CAR TOUR HAS BEEN SPREADING WEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A remarkable 10-race stretch of different winners in the NASCAR Featherlite 
Southwest Tour could end Saturday night in the $24,815 Coors 100 at the Orange 
Show Speedway in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the 10 previous winners are expected to be in the starting field when 
the late-model stock car series visits the quarter-mile paved oval in the 
bowl-shaped former football stadium. The only one with a victory at Orange Show 
Speedway is Dale Williams, who started the streak last Sept. 11 at Saugus 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a 55-year-old Sacramento real estate developer, was named rookie of 
the year last season and is fifth in Southwest Tour standings. He has twice 
finished fifth in six races this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure I can tell you why we won at the Orange Show," Williams said. 
"We qualified fourth and they inverted the top four. Then we pretty much outran 
them. This year we've qualified poorly with a new car and engine combination. 
Starting in the middle of the pack has been a crapshoot. I can't believe we're 
where we are in the points. I guess everybody else has had their problems, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning cars include six Chevrolets, two Oldsmobiles, a Pontiac and a Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Streak winners entered are Williams, Jim Inglebright, Steve Portenga, Bryan 
Germone, Ron Hornaday Jr., Mike Cofer and Lance Hooper. Hornaday, a two-time 
Southwest Tour series champion, has never won at Orange Show Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to extend the streak to 11 are two former runners-up in Orange Show 
races -- Bob Lyon of Newhall and Dennis Dyer of Palmdale. Another possibility 
is M.K. Kanke of Granada Hills, holder of the one-lap track record of 12,988 
seconds -- 69.295 m.p.h. -- set in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-lap, 25-mile race will start at 7 p.m. 
</P>

 TASTE O' PLENTY: The Taste of Orange County festival this weekend at the 
Irvine Spectrum includes lots of music (OC Live!) and a variety of children's 
entertainment. But the heart of the annual event is still the food: 37 
restaurants will have booths -- Friday night through Sunday night -- including 
first timers such as the Hard Rock Cafe and the Cheesecake Factory, both of 
Newport Beach. . . . Says festival spokeswoman Kristin Brief: "Most of the food 
items are $2 to $3. The idea is to sample as many restaurants as you can." 
</P>
<P>
 LOCAL CUP: All the attention may be on World Cup soccer, but another 
internationally popular sport gets a local showing starting today. Water polo's 
Alamo Cup runs through Sunday at Corona del Mar High School (C12). The U.S. 
national team plays Mexico at 8 tonight. Ricardo Azevedo, the U.S. team's 
assistant coach, isn't worried about being overshadowed by soccer: "I think the 
aquatic fans are going to be there no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 ORPHAN'S SONG: The ticket prices aren't as steep -- just $50 tops instead of 
$350 -- but fans of Latin singing star Juan Gabriel consider his appearance at 
the Pond of Anaheim Saturday night every bit as spectacular as Barbra 
Streisand's. The top Mexican balladeer brought out 75,000 people at the Rose 
Bowl last year. . . . Gabriel, 42, who was raised in an orphanage, says of his 
music: "When I was 15, I knew that I had to be somebody. So I exploited the 
only thing I knew, singing and songwriting."

 BIKE-A-WISH: If you're a frequent visitor to Las Vegas, you know it's about a 
five-hour drive from Orange County before you start losing your money. For Bill 
Harney of Santa Ana, it's a 27-hour trek. But he's guaranteed to come out 
ahead. Harney, 31, a limousine driver, bicycles to Las Vegas today for the 
Make-A-Wish Foundation, an annual trip he calls "an unmatched high." He hopes 
to raise about $2,000 in pledges for the foundation, which makes wishes come 
true for terminally ill children.

SIMPSON DEFENSE TEAM STUDIES POLICE EVIDENCE; COURT: THERE IS NO BLOODY SKI 
MASK, A PROSECUTOR SAYS. 911 TAPES TELL OF TUMULTUOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH 
EX-WIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As police released new details of a stormy encounter between a jealous O.J. 
Simpson and his ex-wife late last year, lawyers defending the football legend 
were allowed to examine detailed evidence in the double murder case against 
him, including coroner's photos, tissue and blood samples and tapes of an 
unusual three-hour interview he gave investigators the day after the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department released tapes of 911 telephone calls 
involving an October, 1993, incident in which Simpson allegedly kicked in the 
door at the home of his ex-wife. Police said Nicole Simpson told them that he 
had been at her house earlier in the evening and became upset over a picture of 
an ex-boyfriend in her photo album. A breathless Nicole Simpson is heard saying 
on one tape: "My ex-husband just broke in and he's ranting and raving. . . . 
He's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes provide new details of the tumultuous union between the former high 
school homecoming princess and the Heisman Trophy winner -- a relationship that 
prosecutors contend ended brutally when he killed Nicole and her friend Ronald 
Lyle Goldman eleven days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The high drama also spilled into the courtroom Wednesday, as the prosecutor 
shot down one of the more sensational reports in the torrent of coverage of the 
slayings: that investigators had recovered a bloody ski mask and booked it into 
evidence. "There is no ski mask," Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of Americans, already drawn to the strange, twisting saga via the 
unrelenting eye of the news media, were zoomed into the courtroom and 
inadvertently allowed to eavesdrop on a private exchange between the jailed 
sports hero and the bailiffs. "I'll do anything to stay out of that cell," 
Simpson said in a plaintive, personal aside picked up by a television 
microphone that the judge later sternly ordered removed. The comment -- the 
first personal reaction by Simpson broadcast since the sensational case 
exploded 10 days ago -- came as the officers tried to usher him from the 
courtroom during a break in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dark, pin-striped suit and tie-less shirt open at the collar, Simpson 
appeared more attentive and relaxed than during his first court appearance 
Monday. He said little, but no longer seemed dazed and groggy as his eyes 
scanned the spectators and reporters packed into the courtroom of Municipal 
Judge Patti Jo McKay. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the procedural hearing, the defense team, including two 
forensic pathologists, descended on the coroner's office to examine evidence 
under the supervision of the coroner, Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran. The 
coroner looked on but declined to answer any defense team questions about the 
evidence, said his spokesman, Scott Carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 After a four-hour review of material in a secured, subterranean area of the 
coroner's complex, the lead pathologist for the defense team, Dr. Michael 
Baden, emerged and immediately disputed chilling reports that Nicole Simpson 
had been nearly decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no. There is none," Baden said of the near-decapitation reports as he 
made his way to a waiting cab. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the defense team at the coroner's office and in the courtroom was a 
new co-counsel, retiring Santa Clara University School of Law Dean Gerald 
Uelmen. Lead attorney Robert Shapiro described Uelmen, 53, as "the foremost 
constitutional scholar in California" and said Uelmen would explore "statements 
that could prejudice or preclude a fair trial" for his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen, a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles who is considered an expert 
on the death penalty, has known Shapiro for 20 years and the two worked 
together on the high-profile slaying involving Marlon Brando's son. "I'm 
probably more of a scholar than an advocate," Uelmen said. "That can be a 
useful perspective in terms of some of the legal issues that might emerge." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles judge widely criticized for giving Simpson allegedly lenient 
treatment in a 1989 domestic battery case involving Nicole Simpson called a 
news conference to defend his handling of the case, saying that the athlete had 
received no special treatment. Judge Ronald R. Schoenberg said the city 
attorney's office agreed with a sentence that included no jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than a dozen black activists held a news conference in Watts to urge 
the media to focus on everyday African American heroes, rather than 
celebrities, and to bring balance to the coverage of O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Los Angeles detective wrapped up an unsuccessful hunt for the murder 
weapon in Chicago, saying he had recovered useful evidence and witness 
statements, leaving open the possibility that investigators could return to the 
city where Simpson headed after the slayings. Among the items collected by 
investigators were a broken glass and bloodstained washcloth. Simpson has 
maintained that a cut on his hand came from a glass that broke in the hotel 
room where he briefly stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Divorce court records offered new details about the financial and personal 
relationship between Nicole and O.J. Simpson. Nicole began dating the former 
sports star when she was 18 and just out of high school and moved in with him 
when she was 19, according to papers filed by her attorneys in the 1992 divorce 
case. Seeking large alimony payments to maintain a lavish, bi-coastal 
lifestyle, her attorneys portrayed Nicole Simpson as a community college 
dropout who sacrificed her own career to be a devoted companion to her 
high-profile husband who "required that she be with him." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles County Grand Jury on Wednesday continued -- for a fourth day 
-- hearing evidence in the O.J. Simpson case in secret. Jurors are due to 
return today to hear more testimony that prosecutors apparently hope will lead 
to an indictment against Simpson and eliminate a preliminary hearing June 30, 
the day the grand jury's term expires. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Washington, women's rights advocates and several lawmakers, citing the 
Simpson case, urged Congress to pass legislation requiring training on domestic 
violence for police officers and judges. National Organization for Women 
President Patricia Ireland said men who beat their wives are often treated 
leniently by the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, the most significant development was the acknowledgment that a 
bloody ski mask is not among the evidence against Simpson gathered by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro extracted the information when he said in court that the ski mask was 
among two items that had been reported as evidence by some journalists, but 
which were not on the list of evidence given to him by the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when asked, he would not say what the second item is. 
</P>
<P>
 In her remarks to McKay, Clark noted that statements that Simpson gave police 
the day after the slayings were made voluntarily and that he had waived his 
right to remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she would turn over a tape-recording of those statements to the 
defense team along with any other evidence or reports that the defense 
requested, including some raw notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark lost her bid, however, to videotape the defense team as it examined 
physical evidence gathered from the autopsies. But McKay ordered that someone 
from the coroner's office be on hand during the examination. In other rulings, 
McKay ordered that Simpson be provided with a cervical pillow to ease his 
discomfort from what his lawyer said is an old football injury. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Shapiro was given a set of autopsy reports and a still-sealed 
written narrative of the department's findings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the coroner's office Wednesday, Carrier would not comment on 
much-publicized television reports detailing gruesome crime scene theories, and 
attributed to a coroner's office source. "I think we heard all kinds of 
reports. There's been a lot of speculation. . . . We are saddened by it. . . . 
As far as we're concerned, they are rumors. We can't substantiate it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier said the doctor who performed the autopsy on both victims was Dr. 
Irwin Golden, who also was the forensic pathologist for the autopsies in the 
Menendez killings.

Rich Simon, Carla Rivera and Leslie Berger.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; OLYMPIC SKATERS TO ATTEND FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Olympic gold medal-winning figure skaters Viktor Petrenko and Oksana Baiul 
will detour from a 64-city American tour to greet admirers at the Los Coyotes 
Country Club at 5 p.m. July 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets, $45 for adults and $20 for children younger than 12, are on sale 
through today.Proceeds will go to upgrade the figure-skating arena in Odessa, 
Ukraine, organizer Maria Billey said. 
</P>
<P>
 For tickets, call Billey at (714) 522-8062. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park is one of the few cities where Petrenko and Baiul, the skater who 
nudged Nancy Kerrigan from the gold-medal pedestal at the 1994 Winter Olympics, 
have agreed to stop for fund-raisers, Billey said. 
</P>
<P>
 They are performing at The Pond of Anaheim on July 1 and at the Forum in 
Inglewood on July 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Billey, a longtime Buena Park resident, helped form the Friends of Ukraine 
National Olympic Committee in March to organize the event. They hope to raise 
$10,000 for the Odessa arena from ticket sales. The reception can accommodate 
up to about 400 people, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who attend the event will have their own table, said Billey, who 
lived in Ukraine until she was 15 years old. "I think it is very important for 
children to meet them," she said. "For the rest of their lives, they will 
remember this."LESLEY WRIGHT

PHILANTHROPIST CAROL CHAPMAN DIES AT 58 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carol Chapman, a Corona del Mar art consultant, philanthropist and 
daughter-in-law of the man for whom Chapman University was named, has died 
after a long battle with cancer. She was 58. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Chapman represented Oakland's Victor Fischer Gallery and sold many pieces 
of public sculpture in Orange County, including "Lightwave," a piece by 
sculptor Jerome Kirk that sits near the Chapman University auditorium. She 
later helped the university find a bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Chapman and her husband, C. Stanley Chapman Jr., were on the board of the 
St. Joseph Ballet, a Santa Ana group that involves inner-city youths in dance. 
For the last two years of her life, Mrs. Chapman spent much of her time and 
energy on the troupe and last year was named volunteer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carol was one of the most positive, vivacious, can-do people I've ever 
known," said Beth Burns, artistic director of St. Joseph Ballet. "Even in the 
final days of her illness she attended rehearsals." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Oakland, Carol Chapman met her future husband at a Stanford football 
game and married in 1958, joining one of Orange County's pioneering families. 
Her new father-in-law, C. Stanley Chapman Sr., who died in 1984, was Chapman 
University's most generous benefactor. He brought the tiny college to the city 
of Orange from Los Angeles County in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Chapman is survived by her husband; two sons, Greg Chapman of Long Beach 
and Scott Chapman of Germany; a daughter, Trish Chapman of San Francisco, and a 
sister, Salle Crittendon of Alameda. 
</P>
<P>
 A viewing will be held from 4 to 7 p.m. today at Pacific View Memorial Park, 
3500 Pacific View Drive, Newport Beach. A memorial service will follow Friday 
at 11 a.m. at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Chapman, who died Tuesday, will be buried in a private ceremony following 
the service. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to her 
favorite groups: St. Joseph Ballet at 220 E. 4th St., Suite 207, Santa Ana, CA 
92701; and the Yosemite Fund, 155 Montgomery St., Suite 1104, San Francisco, CA 
94104.

Orange County music roster. There's strength elsewhere in the lineup, too, as 
Taste presents an interesting array of national acts and local performers in 
jazz, rock, country and R&B. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Lobos, which headlines at 9:30 p.m. on Friday, has long been one of the 
most diverse and accomplished bands on the roots-rock scene. In recent years, 
it has become one of the most restlessly adventurous in a genre where 
established performers are prone to stay with what's tried and true. The 1992 
"Kiko" album, and this year's avant-garde "Latin Playboys" offshoot by Lobos 
David Hidalgo and Louie Perez, are evidence of that. While Hidalgo and Perez 
gain acclaim for their experimentation, it shouldn't be forgotten that the 
band's other singer-songwriter, Cesar Rosas, is one of the best writers of 
modern blues songs of the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore, who plays Sunday at 4:30 p.m., is a Texas singer-songwriter who 
combines a deep sense of country and rock tradition, an unforgettable voice, 
and a highly philosophical outlook informed by a long immersion in Hindu 
thought. Forget Garth Brooks and the other zillion-selling Nashville 
formula-mongers -- if you value country music with a distinctive vision, 
Gilmore's two most recent albums, "After Awhile" and "Spinning Around the Sun," 
are as good as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
 Also notable on the Taste schedule is Craig Chaquico, the former Jefferson 
Starship guitarist who switched gears last year and came up with a lyrical 
album of mainly acoustic guitar instrumentals. Guitarist Norman Brown's new 
funk-jazz album, "After the Storm," is the first release on Motown Records' new 
subsidiary label, MoJazz. Boy Howdy, a Los Angeles-Orange County band, has made 
a national splash lately with its rocked-up country music. The program also 
gives such solid Orange County club attractions as Missiles of October, the 
Derek Bordeaux Group, the Mike Reilly Band and oldies meister Greg Topper a 
chance to stretch out on bigger bandstands than usual. MIKE BOEHM

A TASTE FOR GUMBO AND COUNTRY; THIS YEAR, THERE WILL BE LINES FOR FOOD AND 
DANCING AT THE FEAST FEST IN IRVINE 
</P>

 If you still haven't developed an appetite for line dancing, perhaps this 
weekend's Taste of Orange County at the Irvine Spectrum will wet your whistle. 
Live country music and tush-pushing lessons will be served for the first time 
at this year's feast fest. 
</P>
<P>
 The 60-minute line-dance lessons will be offered once on Friday and Saturday 
and twice Sunday. Festival attendees may also enjoy jazz, blues, rock 'n' roll, 
reggae and zydeco music while sampling foods from 35 Orange County eateries. 
The munchies cost $1 to $5 per dish, but all musical performances, line-dance 
lessons and other entertainment at the festival is included in the daily 
admission price of $3 to $6. 
</P>
<P>
 Each line-dance lesson, led by deejays from country station KIK-FM (94.3), 
will be held an hour before appearances by country acts (including the Justice 
Band and Boy Howdy), so that neophytes can test their new skills if the music 
is suitable. (Jimmie Dale Gilmore, whose idiosyncratic style blends country, 
folk and pop, has yet to record anything remotely line-danceable. But as the 
"cosmic cowboy," who has studied East Indian religions, might say, an open mind 
is an asset.) 
</P>
<P>
 Boots aren't necessary for first-timers; any comfortable pair of shoes will 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth annual Taste even offers countrified food from the Buffalo Ranch 
Steakhouse of Mission Viejo, Burrell's Barbecue & Cafe and Millie's Country 
Western Cafe of Irvine, and the Ragin' Cajun Cafe of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's activities include magic acts, dance performances and pantomime. 
Plus a fireworks display is planned for Sunday at 9:30 p.m. Kids may 
alternatively opt to embarrass their parents by learning line dances in half 
the time it takes mom and dad. Hey, it's been known to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the Taste of Orange County's proceeds benefits The Los Angeles 
Times Fund, which supports local youth organizations.

IT SCARED HER SO; HER ROLE IN 'SUPERSTAR' HAS GIVEN SYREETA WRIGHT 'A WHOLE NEW 
LIFE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "OOOhh, I was sooooo scared," Syreeta Wright shrieks, recalling the first time 
she played Mary Magdalene in "Jesus Christ Superstar," last October in Buffalo, 
N.Y. "I was so scared I can't remember doing it. It's a blank now. I really 
didn't think I was going to make it through another night." 
</P>
<P>
 She did, of course. Since that attack of the opening-night jitters, she has 
been singing the role about eight times a week in the national touring company 
of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, which is at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center through Sunday. She is featured on several songs, including the 
well-known "I Don't Know How to Love Him." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that first night had to have been nerve-racking. "It was," as she puts 
it, "the opening night of a whole new life" -- which may sound melodramatic 
(actually, Wright is a bubbly, outspoken chatterbox who makes everything sound 
melodramatic). But it's nonetheless true. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was it her first theatrical role ever, it was the first time she had 
sung professionally since the early '80s. Back then she'd been in the final 
stages of her career as an R&B singer-songwriter at Motown, where she was best 
known for her work with Stevie Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the world of music seemed like a logical step. A recent divorce 
had left her "emotionally drained, and I always felt I had been born to sing. I 
missed it badly. I wasn't sure how to get back into it, but I never thought it 
would be through theater." 
</P>
<P>
 She has her pal Carl Anderson to thank for the opportunity. Anderson, who 
plays Judas in the show, alerted her to auditions for the role of Mary 
Magdalene. "I never thought I'd get it," Wright recalls. "It's very different, 
in terms of breathing and technique, from the kind of pop singing I'd done. But 
I taught myself how to do it and got the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Pittsburgh, Wright grew up in a suburb of Detroit, started out singing 
jazz, and switched to R&B when she got a shot to record for Motown in 1968. She 
turned out to be one of those "budding superstars" who never got past the 
budding stage, never scoring a hit of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some wonderful years at Motown, but I was also frustrated and unhappy," 
she says. "I never did what I wanted to do. I was always butting heads with the 
executives about my career." She also was butting heads with Wonder, to whom 
she was married briefly in the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 She had her biggest successes collaborating with him, helping to write his hit 
"Signed, Sealed and Delivered" and working on songs for his "Where I'm Coming 
From" and "Music of My Mind" albums. He, in turn, co-wrote and produced her 
"Stevie Wonder Presents Syreeta" album in 1974. "Of my six albums, that was the 
best," she recalls wistfully. "What's funny is that we were going through a 
divorce while we were making it. It wasn't a very happy time. But I'm friends 
with him now." 
</P>
<P>
 Her final album with Motown was 'Spell," produced in 1983 by Jermaine Jackson. 
"I didn't like the way it turned out," she says. Her harsh summary of her 
Motown years: "It was like a bad marriage. You have to know when it's not going 
to work and call it quits. But I was young and dumb. I should have broken away 
from Motown years before I left but I didn't have enough sense to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, though, she's raring to plunge back into the biz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been doing a lot of writing, but that's about to change. I'm going 
to buy a little keyboard for the road so I can start writing regularly again. 
Then I'll start making demos and looking for a record deal." 
</P>
<P>
 What about the theater? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably be with this show until February. I'd consider another show if 
it was the right show and I didn't have to travel too much. I'll have to wait 
until this show is finished before I figure out my next step." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Jesus Christ Superstar." 
</P>
<P>
 When: 8 p.m. Thursday and Friday, June 23 and 24; 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Saturday,

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: THE PAUL BUTTERFIELD BLUES BAND, "THE PAUL BUTTERFIELD 
BLUES BAND" (1965) ELE KTRA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just about every white blues musician in the '60s learned his or her craft by 
memorizing and mimicking records by the genre's great artists. But Paul 
Butterfield -- who grew up in Chicago, the hub of the electric urban blues 
movement that developed after World War II -- actually apprenticed with many of 
the legends. As a teen-ager, the budding singer and harmonica player hung out 
at the blues clubs on the Windy City's South Side until he managed to work his 
way onto the stage with the likes of Otis Rush and Howlin' Wolf. So it may not 
have been a startling revelation when the debut album by Butterfield's band 
turned out to be an authentic and moving representation of American blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing covers with original material, "The Paul Butterfield Blues Band" 
bristles with uncommon conviction and passion. Like most memorable blues 
albums, it is most noteworthy for its earthy, sensual quality: Butterfield and 
company don't just play the blues, they feel it. Indeed, the title of the 
deliciously languid track "Blues With A Feeling" sums up the album's 
emotionally rich spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield's raw singing and wailing harmonica give the album a large part of 
its definition. But it is then-22-year-old Mike Bloomfield's sizzling lead 
guitar that kicks many of these songs into unforgettable motion. The stomping 
"Look Over Yonders Wall" and the band's version of "Shake Your Money-Maker" 
derive much of their frenetic energy from Bloomfield's dexterous, 
tension-filled slide playing. Chipping in on rhythm guitar was another 
soon-to-be-well-known ax-man of his day, Elvin Bishop; the immovable foundation 
was provided by two former members of Howlin' Wolf's band, bassist Jerome 
Arnold and drummer Sam Lay. 
</P>
<P>
 (The same band -- the same year that this album was released -- became the 
first electric outfit with which Bob Dylan ever played publicly, during a 
Newport Folk Festival appearance that outraged folk purists and changed the 
course of American popular music). JON MATSUMOTO

AT THE BARS; WHERE FANS CAN LET THEIR WORLD CUP RUNNETH OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 World Cup is upon us. But if, like most people, you don't have the extra cash 
for tickets, you're probably going to watch events unfold on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 But if sitting at home taking in the spectacle of it all doesn't appeal to 
you, there is an alternative to being surrounded by your same four walls, stuck 
in front of the glowing tube. 
</P>
<P>
 For a little color, try one of the local pubs. Twenty-four countries are 
participating in the World Cup, and there's just about as much diversity in the 
venues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox and Firkin, for example, at 3601 Jamboree Road in Newport Beach, has 
six TV sets, all hooked up to World Cup. Manager Scott Drapkin insists that 
"you can't sit in the Fox and Firkin without being able to see a World Cup 
game." Here you'll find the usual British imports, and they've even laid on a 
special Football (that's soccer to us) Ale. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Rose and Crown pubs also have a British theme. The Anaheim pub is at 
20 S. Anaheim Blvd., and the San Clemente site is at 647 Camino de las Mares. 
Both of them have a great soccer following, not only for the British teams, but 
also for other European teams.  
</P>
<P>
 If it's Gemutlichkeit (some German warmth) you're after, try the Phoenix Club 
at 1340 S. Sanderson Ave. in Anaheim. The World Cup games, especially those 
including the German team, will be featured on its big-screen TV. Not only are 
the Germans one of the World Cup favorites, but they also, rather conveniently, 
make great beer.  
</P>
<P>
 The Irish team is viewed as an underdog in the upcoming games, and Irish fans 
will, no doubt, be flocking to the Harp Inn, 130 E. 17th St. in Costa Mesa. It 
will be open for all the games, even the morning ones, when it will serve 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, Carpi's Pizza, 320, Unit R, E. Katella Ave. in Orange, seems 
an unlikely venue for watching World Cup soccer. It's small, but there's no 
lack of enthusiasm. Rudy Carpi, who hails from Argentina, will be watching the 
games along with other Argentine fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do this because I'm fanatical about soccer," said Carpi, who will show all 
daytime and evening games, as well as serving food.  
</P>
<P>
 At Las Palmas in Santa Ana, other fans of South American teams will find all 
the games broadcast. Las Palmas boasts a large Colombian as well as Mexican 
following, and fans of these teams often gather here to watch the games. Owner 
Raul Muniz, a Uruguayan and a big soccer fan he traveled to Italy to watch 
Uruguay play in the last World Cup), provides a full menu of Mexican food. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these locations serves food, and you can get anything from bangers to 
burritos to bratwurst. They also give you something that most fans who have 
laid out the big bucks don't get: instant replay.

WANNA DANCE?: ATLANTIS ON THE LIDO IS STARTING TO MAKE WAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Lido Marina Village in Newport Beach is seeing more than its share of 
action lately, and it's not all coming from the docked boats in adjacent 
Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Trendy locals are converging on the quaint village, not only to hang out at 
two new coffeehouses, but also to party at the nightclub Atlantis. Situated on 
the third floor of a nondescript building on the edge of the village, Atlantis 
is an attractive club that, since opening late last year, has barely explored 
its potential, let alone reached the legendary status its name seeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A doorman cards patrons, only letting those 21 and older enter the building 
and head up the elevator. The lift runs smoothly most of the time, but on 
busier evenings it seems to move slowly, so exercise patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tasteful attire is the code here, it's simply a matter of taste. 
Spelled out are no sneakers, T-shirts or, on Fridays and Saturdays, casual 
shorts. Nor is anything resembling grunge welcomed, though acid-washed jeans 
apparently are OK. Owner James Raven prefers to let the flannel and combat boot 
crew hit the neighboring Warehouse restaurant, home of Visions nightclub. A 
dressier, more corporate-looking crowd is courted here, even if those people 
are less likely to party late on the weeknights.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides its panoramic view of the bay, Atlantis' strength lies in its slick 
interior. There's plenty of white Formica, mirrors and chrome. In line with 
lore, which says that the lost island sank into the ocean, Atlantis the 
nightclub creates an illusion of being under water: The ceiling is brushed to 
simulate a water surface, the walls are adorned with painted seaweed, fish, 
sunken Greek statues and pillars, and the panels around the bar feature 
mermaids and more fish. Plus, live fish can be found in four tanks around the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding live wires here depends on the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Call Thursdays the night of the reluctant dancers. At least the patrons who 
dared to venture out on the floor on a couple of recent Thursdays couldn't be 
described as having the fever to groove, let alone much ability. Even the heavy 
bass thump of an Ace of Base tune didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no fault of deejay Dave Aude. Though his choice of vintage disco, new 
wave and current pop hits is typical, he delivers an enjoyable set to dance to. 
And the night's special host, Robert (Bonzo) Painter, has proven his power at 
the Warehouse, BBGs, Louie Louie's and Bacchus as a promoter every summer since 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekends are a different story. The locals in white pumps and with 
pumped-up credit cards are here still, but the mood is decidedly more upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
 From the speakers blare blocks of flashbacks from the '70s and '80s, as well 
as popular dance tunes. On Fridays, deejays Priest (John Winters) and Steve 
Beltran alternate weekly. DJ Maxwell House is at the helm Saturday, the hottest 
night for Atlantis. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the small dance floor are two pool tables that have more pull than the 
deejays some evenings. If the tables seem weird at first, don't assume it's 
just the gray felt tops and faux marble legs -- they're actually shorter than 
standard-issue tables. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't cut through the crowd lined around the large bar, head to the 
very back where there's a tiny corner bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy Hour starts late here -- when the club opens at 9. On Thursdays, 
domestic beer, wine and wells are $1 until 10 p.m., then the price is $2 until 
11. On Fridays, those drinks are $2 between 9 and 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At all other times, bottled brews are $3.50 for domestic, $4 for imports; 
nonalcoholic O'Douls beer is $3.50. Wells sell for $4.25 to $5.75; a glass of 
wine, $3.50 to $6; and sodas, $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
 With no kitchen, Raven thoughtfully allows local restaurants to deliver to the 
club -- from sushi to pizza. Inquire at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggae comes to Atlantis Sundays, starting July 3, with the jammin' sounds of 
Riddem Stout. And the Atlantis week will extend even more starting July 12 with 
pool tournaments every Tuesday.

COMEDY; FOUR SCORE . . . OR SO COMICS AT BREA IMPROV HOPE, ANYWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Hartmann is betting that four lesser-known comedians doing their best 
stuff will be as big a draw as one big-name headliner. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional manager for the local Improvs knows he's taking a chance, but 
he's willing to bet that the format will be a boon to audiences and comics 
alike for the next three weeks at the Brea Improv. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of came out of a quest for something a little more than the 
traditional three-man show," Hartmann said, referring to nights that feature 
opening, middle and headline acts. "A number of comics conceived it to make it 
a lot more fast-paced with higher energy. A lot of times there are ups and 
downs in shows, so (the comics) thought they could combine their talents. This 
helps them grow as performers. Each has 20 minutes that can destroy." 
</P>
<P>
 Performing are John Bowman, Todd Glass, Tommy Koenig and Lynn Shore. Glass 
opens the evening and sets the stage for the rest of the show. The first 10 
minutes are devoted to each comic doing a couple minutes of stand-up, Hartmann 
said, to introduce themselves to the audience. After that, the revue becomes a 
mix of sketches the performers have written together, stand-up material and 
musical parodies -- all aided by the venue's upgraded lighting and video 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run, it lets us pull in a lot of comedians who can't carry a show 
but have minutes that kill," Hartmann said. "This opens up a new field for 
those comics. This is the first time we're committing a whole show to it." 
</P>
<P>
 For the initial offering, Hartmann has pulled together a cast that exceeds 
that criteria. All are veterans, and Koenig, Bowman and Glass have headlined at 
various Improvs. 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig's strength lies in his musical talents and ability to play myriad 
characters (male and female, age problem), including all four Beatles 
simultaneously. He also appeared in Mel Brooks' movie "Robin Hood: Men in 
Tights" and has been on several TV shows, including a guest-star role on "Miami 
Vice." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman, a frantic comic who recently appeared on the "The Tonight Show," also 
boast stints in theater, television and films. 
</P>
<P>
 The freewheeling Glass, a veteran of "The Dennis Miller Show" and "Comic Strip 
Live," likes to mug his way through a set, which includes a fine bit on his 
father's smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Shore's forte is impressions, and his TV credits include A&E's "Evening at the 
Improv," MTV's "Half Hour Comedy Hour" and Fox's "Comic Strip Live." Where and 
When 
</P>
<P>
 What: Four-comedian revue. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Through July 10, except Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Brea Improv, 945 E. Birch St., Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the Lambert Road exit from the Orange (57) Freeway and go 
west. Turn left onto State College Boulevard and right onto Birch Street. The 
Improv is in the Brea Marketplace, across from the Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $7 to $10. 
</P>

Edition staff.

<P>
 Southern California's largest swath of open, mostly undeveloped land is not a 
park, and most of its backcountry acreage remains off-limits to the public -- 
trespassing more than just discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp Pendleton, the Marine Corps base just south of Orange County, has enough 
hill and canyon country to make mountain bikers' mouths water. 
</P>
<P>
 Their chance comes Sunday, with the Mountain Bike Warehouse All-American 
Mountain Bike Classic, which benefits the San Diego USO. This is the second 
offering of the event, but last year it was held near Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Three courses will be offered, all starting at Lake O'Neil in Oceanside. After 
the rides, participants will be offered refreshments and live entertainment in 
a picnic setting at the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Experienced riders can test themselves with the 23-mile "Fire Cracker Blast," 
over what is described by organizers as "grueling terrain." The 15-mile 
"Patriot Tour" is designed for intermediates, while the seven-mile "Apple Pie 
Ride" is for novice riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Rides will be staggered in waves of about 10 riders. The 23-mile ride starts 
at 7:30 a.m., the 15-mile event at 8 a.m., and the seven-mile ride at 8:30 a.m. 
The event is not a race. 
</P>
<P>
 Rest stations with water, fruit, snack bars, first aid and mechanical 
assistance will be along each course. Organizers require participants to wear 
helmets (a limited number will be available for loan) and recommend that riders 
inspect their bikes before the ride. Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: Mountain Bike Warehouse All-American Mountain Bike Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Sunday, June 26, first ride at 7:30 a.m. (arrive early to register). 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Lake O'Neil, Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (5) Freeway south and exit at Camp Pendleton, 
just north of Oceanside. Enter through the main gate and proceed straight along 
Vandergrift Road about eight miles, until you see the sign for Lake O'Neil or 
Santa Margarita Road, and turn left. Then make the first right into the park 
(signs for the ride will be posted). 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $25 for adults and $18 for riders under 18 years old (including 
T-shirt). 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (714) 548-4897.

UNITED IN DIVERSITY; IRANIAN FESTIVAL DIRECTOR FINDS A CREATIVE OUTLET FOR 
MEMORIES OF INTOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken covers children's events for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By looking back, Homa Ehsan believes she can help children see a brighter 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a resident of Orange, Ehsan says she vividly recalls the torment she 
suffered in her native Iran when, as a schoolgirl, she was taunted by 
classmates after her family converted from the Muslim to the Bahai faith. She 
knew persecution as an adult, too. In fact, she says her work as a well-known 
journalist and her anti-revolutionary views exposed her to such emotional and 
physical pain that she fled the country in January 1979, just prior to the 
takeover by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 10 years, Ehsan has found a positive outlet for these memories in 
the arts, acting as producer, director and writer of a yearly pageant for young 
people. She presents her 11th annual Iranian Children and Young Adults' 
Festival Sunday at 6 p.m. at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. The 2 1/2-hour program 
features the premiere of "Shangool O'Mangool," an operetta by Ehsan and Iranian 
composer Reza Behzadi of Santa Monica, as well as original music, dance and 
poetry selections. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance, presented by 20 performers age 5 to 19 in the Farsi language 
with periodic English narration, is accessible to viewers from all cultures, 
Ehsan said. The program will also include information in Farsi and English.  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking by phone from the Iranian radio station she operates in Orange, Ehsan 
explained that, as she has with her past shows, she created "Shangool 
O'Mangool" by intertwining an old Iranian folk tale with her own messages. The 
story line follows a mother, Bobozi (the Farsi word for goat) as she searches 
for her children, who have been stolen by an evil wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobozi is kind, hard-working, teaching everything about life to her 
children," explained Ehsan. In her search, the character "confronts different 
animals with different attitudes, which represent society with its different 
kinds of people." Cats are self-absorbed aristocrats only interested in 
obtaining good seats for the fight between Bobozi and the wolf, while rabbits 
are the workers ready to help find the children in any way they can. Auntie 
Bear, the protagonist who saves the day, represents the importance of unity in 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the operetta has a serious message, Ehsan says it won't detract from 
children's enjoyment of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are double meanings," she explained. "The children will find things 
funny or frightening -- you know, those up and down feelings that they have -- 
while adults will understand the seriousness." 
</P>
<P>
 She does hope children retain one message: the same one she says she has tried 
to teach in each of 150 children's works she has created since she began her 
journalistic career at age 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 8 (because of her family's religious conversion), I lost my security of 
childhood and became a stranger in my own homeland," Ehsan said. "I know what 
it is like to be a child who is discriminated against, what it means when 
others think you are nasty or different. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole message is that with unity, even little ones can create a big power 
to fight the strongest powers. It doesn't matter if you are a rabbit or a bear. 
You have your own beauty, and your own job to do, and you have to respect the 
beauty and the work of others." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States could be a prime example, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once upon a time, America was called a melting pot. But today it is more like 
a garden of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should people melt (and) be alike? A garden is more beautiful . . . and 
this lesson, that you can unite in diversity, is the best export America can 
send out to the world."

SURFING / ROCKIN' FIG & DAVE: STROLL THROUGH HUNTINGTON'S WALK OF FAME BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rick Fignetti and David Reyes, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the upcoming August induction of the first six people to Surfing's Walk 
of Fame at Huntington Beach, Rockin' Fig and I focused on our ballots, 
assembled to offer a convenient who's who. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaiian legend Duke Kahanamoku -- the surfer, actor and Olympic swimmer most 
credited with bringing the sport to the Mainland -- is an automatic inductee. 
Members of the surfing media and surf industry will vote on the five other 
categories: surf pioneers, surfing champions, top women, local heroes and those 
who pushed the surfing culture.  
</P>
<P>
 The winners, who will be named in late July or early August, will be honored 
with a two-foot-square granite slab on the Walk, at Main Street and Pacific 
Coast Highway, sponsored by Huntington Beach and Jack's Surf Shop. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pioneer division, some big kahunas are among the 39 nominees, including 
Phil Edwards, Mike Doyle, Robert August, Greg Noll and the late Eddie Aikau. 
</P>
<P>
 Figgy, I was having trouble with the surf culture category. Who had the 
biggest impact, the Beach Boys, Jan and Dean or Dick Dale? 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever you think is the most important . I thought you were gonna pick your 
buddy Bruce Brown because you met him up at the SIMA (Surf Industry 
Manufacturers Assn.) gig. His movie, "The Endless Summer," did get surfing out 
to everybody. It's a tough category.  
</P>
<P>
 I know. So help me. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to pick Nancy Katin because she was big out here on the West Coast.  
</P>
<P>
 You got a point there. Katin Surf Trunks are still going strong. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown could be the guy, too. Unless you want to take Annette Funicello 
from "Beach Blanket Bingo"!  
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I saw those actors listed. I mean come on, Sandra Dee ("Gidget"), 
Frankie Avalon, Don Stroud (from the "Beach Blanket" boondoggles) as well as 
Jan-Michael Vincent, William Katt and Gary Busey ("Big Wednesday")? I couldn't 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 How about pioneers, Fig? 
</P>
<P>
 Dunno. I'd almost go for Eddie Aikau. I've got a lot of respect for that guy 
-- you know, surfing the Waimea Bay when it's real big. And he was like a true 
ocean man all the way around. He passed away after leaving an outrigger. They 
had really rough seas, and the boat started falling apart. He said to the 
others, "I'm going to get help." He paddled off on his surfboard, and that's 
the last they ever saw of him. But again, there's a ton of heroes all the way 
across in each category.  
</P>
<P>
 For the female selection, I favor Joyce Hoffman. She won a lot of contests in 
the '60s, opening the sport to women and giving them credibility. Margo Oberg 
(nee Godfrey) was one of the first women to shred with heavy maneuvers.  
</P>
<P>
 In men's champions, I'm leaning toward Tom Curren just because he's won the 
Op, the Katin and the world championship. You know what I mean? Although Mark 
Richards from Australia would probably be a close runner-up with four world 
titles in a row.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, I like David Nuuihiwa, winner of the U.S. Championship in 1970. In the 
early days, he was Mister Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a name to be reckoned with. Not only did David set the tone for radical 
surfing, he brought in the fishes -- ultra short, round-edged surfboards. In 
fact, Nuuihiwa used to fight off Corky Carroll in the championships, although 
Corky won in '66, '67 and '69.  
</P>
<P>
 They're both from the late '60s and '70s, when surfing was more free-style 
expression. By the beginning of the '80s, it got back to heavy contest format. 
There's PT (Peter Townend -- first world champion in 1976 and co-founder of the 
current world tour surf championships); you might wanna vote for him. He was 
the first world surf champ.  
</P>
<P>
 What about local heroes, among the smallest categories with 18 nominees? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I saw Chuck Dent's name and the Greek's (Bob Bolen) and Bud Llamas.  
</P>
<P>
 Uhhhh, Figgy, didn't you attend Huntington Beach High School? 
</P>
<P>
 Yup.  
</P>
<P>
 And haven't you been living in Huntington Beach for more than 10 years? 
</P>
<P>
 Yup.  
</P>
<P>
 Figgy, you could be a write-in candidate! 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Donation: Jimmy Olmes, FreeStyle USA vice president, recently presented actor 
Ted Danson, president of the Santa Monica-based American Ocean's Campaign, with 
a $55,000 donation. Olme's, SIMA vice president, ran a campaign in which the 
company donated a portion of sales of a friendship bracelet. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddies: Cardiff pro surfer Rob Machado got the royal treatment after winning 
the Marui Pro surfing contest in Japan recently. Machado and 1992 world 
champion Kelly Slater of Florida have become major buds. When it was announced 
that Machado won the final, Slater grabbed him as he was coming out of the 
water and hoisted him onto his shoulders. It was Machado's first major pro 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Season: Summer's here! Big south swells, warmer water and, hopefully, a chance 
to lose all these early-morning clouds. Get it while you can. By August, expect 
quadruple crowds at local beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Contests: San Clemente's Shane Beschen won the Body Glove contest in Oceanside 
on Sunday. In second place was Cardiff's Rob Machado, followed by Hawaii's 
Kalani Robb and Florida's Todd Holland. A nice, south swell brought three- to 
five-foot surf for the contest, which was the sixth stop on the U.S. Bud Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Scholastic Surfing Assn. Championships will be Monday through 
July 1 at Lower Trestles. About 500 of the nation's top surfers, bodyboarders, 
high school and college teams will compete.

KIDS ON FILM: MACAULAY CULKIN'S AT HOME IN 'GETTING EVEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Getting Even With Dad," a straight-arrow 11-year-old (Macaulay Culkin) 
whose mother has died gets dropped off in San Francisco with his father, an 
ex-con (Ted Danson) who has ignored him. The boy tries to foil his dad's final 
heist and fix him up with a female police investigator. (Rated PG.)  
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who was hoping that by now Macaulay Culkin would have outgrown the 
"Home Alone" character can forget it.  
</P>
<P>
 He may be 13, but he's still cute. He still outsmarts every bad guy, parent 
and cop he runs into. (This time it's documented: His character tests in the 
"95th percentile.") And the kids still think it's pretty funny.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's so good for the part of the little kid who thinks up all these things 
and puts out all those traps and stuff," said Katie Knutson, 10, who came to 
the show with her friend Renee Bohles, 9. She said they came because "we 
thought it was going to be like 'Home Alone.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Though the relative lack of pratfalls and bricks to the head puts this film in 
the kinder, gentler league, there was still enough slapstick to keep the kids 
happy.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was great," said Todd Loewen, 9. "This one has a lot more action 
than 'Home Alone 2,' and 'Home Alone' I'd say is about the same." 
</P>
<P>
 In this movie, the boy, Tim, hides the loot stolen by his father and partners 
in crime, then blackmails his father into pretending he likes having him around 
for a week and into taking him to all of San Francisco's amusements. Because 
the partners don't trust him, they tag along, becoming targets for the boy's 
devious mind.  
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Danson warms to his father role and starts passing on to his 
son the wisdom he's learned -- how to pick up girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee said her favorite part came when the dad starts to fall for a woman they 
meet on the street, not knowing she is a police officer.  
</P>
<P>
 "The little boy keeps on asking her out again and again and again. I liked 
that part," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also liked a miniature golfing scene, when a con, thinking a victory will 
win back their loot, throws a childish tantrum.  
</P>
<P>
 Todd's favorite part was when Tim manages to outsmart and lose a policeman who 
is following him on the subway.  
</P>
<P>
 Todd had been to San Francisco and also enjoyed seeing familiar sights. (There 
is also a brief scene of exotic dancing, a pedophile joke and a gay joke.) 
</P>
<P>
 The kids agreed Tim was justified in getting even with his dad, who treats him 
badly, acts as if he doesn't want him around and never answered the letters his 
son sent to him in prison. One of his techniques is the ever-popular sarcastic 
put down:  
</P>
<P>
 Dad: "How'd you get so smart?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tim: "I don't know. It certainly doesn't run in the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, 
</P>
<P>
 Dad: "I know you'd never rat on your own flesh and blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim: "Just try me." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Tim is not only smarter but also more responsible and a much nicer 
person than his father. He waters plants. He replaces worn-out toothbrushes. 
Maybe he was adopted.  
</P>
<P>
 As might be suspected, there are heartwarming, tear-jerking moments at the 
end. When the characters shed a few tears, so did Renee. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, she said, she's looking forward to Culkin's next movie, "The Page 
Master."  
</P>
<P>
 Surely by then he will have outgrown "Home Alone."

VIDEOS; SOME CLASSIC WEREWOLVES THAT LEAD THE PACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith regularly covers film for the Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fangs, howls and bad hair days only Lyle Lovett and Phyllis Diller understand. 
Full moons that won't go away, schizophrenia big-time and a hunger that even 
the latest haute cuisine can't satisfy. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a werewolf for you. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been one of Hollywood's favorite pets for decades, a monster that keeps 
turning up, just like his buddy, Dracula. Last year, Francis Ford Coppola 
yanked the Count out of his coffin one more time for the disastrous "Bram 
Stoker's Dracula," and now Mike Nichols, of all people, lures the wolfman out 
of the lair for "Wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 But the director responsible for "Carnal Knowledge" has perfect casting going 
for him. Jack Nicholson, the closest thing the movies have to a full-blooded 
wolf, plays the guy who can't say no to a bloody romp under the lunar light. 
This so-called "thinking man's" take on the tale may even fire a well-aimed 
silver bullet at "Speed," the most recent box office bankroller. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Wolf" satisfies, it does so in great part because we've lived with the 
story forever. Movie studios big and small have turned it into modern mythology 
over the years, providing literally dozens of slants on the curse of 
lycanthropy. If the itch reaches beyond Nicholson and co-star Michelle 
Pfeiffer, try scratching it with these videos: 
</P>
<P>
 The first werewolf picture came out in 1913 (the silent "The Werewolf," which 
isn't on video), but most of us think of Lon Chaney Jr. and "The Wolf Man" 
(1941) as the starting point. It's still considered one of the best horror 
films ever, standing out during a time when monster movies were often 
generously budgeted, even prestigious projects that attracted some of the 
industry's finest actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney may have had limitations -- he's not asked to do much more than look 
depressed over his condition, then growl ominously after his shag stops 
growing, which he does very well -- but he's backed by a cast that includes 
Claude Rains as his unsuspecting father. The flick has zip and great '40s 
special effects. Besides, the ferocious musical score is nearly as terrifying 
as Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
 It led to a sequel, which in some ways is even more fun than the first. 
"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" (1943) features Chaney again, this time 
hoping Dr. Frankenstein will cure his ills. The doctor is out golfing, but the 
monster is in. Needless to say, these two get on each others' nerves, and 
setting up house in the castle isn't easy. Much snarling from both. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Bela Lugosi plays the monster, a role he ridiculed after Boris 
Karloff achieved fame in the original "Frankenstein." Lugosi's career had 
already slid by then, and the character was no longer beneath him. He's more 
nimble than Karloff, which is good; Wolfie is a speedy guy. 
</P>
<P>
 A second sequel, "House of Frankenstein" (sorry, not on video), came out in 
1944, and it led to yet another sequel, "House of Dracula" in 1945. Yep, Chaney 
shows up for the fourth time, showing that you can make a cottage industry out 
of some brutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the sequels just kept getting worse. This one, about a 
scientist (Onslow Stevens) who tries to cure various monsters including the 
wolfman, is quirky but too slow. Only worthwhile for those who won't rest until 
they've seen all of Chaney's flicks. 
</P>
<P>
 A more intentionally amusing take is "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" 
(1948). Chaney (who else?) appears as a nice werewolf, trying to convince 
Abbott and Costello that they're in danger. Dracula (Lugosi) wants to put 
Costello's brain in Frankenstein's body, maybe so he can hit the stand-up 
circuit. Anyway, there's a lot of motion and typical pratfalling from A and C. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Was a Teen-age Werewolf" (1957) is most noteworthy for introducing Michael 
Landon to the drive-in crowd. The movie, another of those cultish, camp 
favorites, tries to meld teen-age Angst with '50s sci-fi horror. Mediocre 
special effects, but a slavering Landon shows just where Little Joe's hot 
temper came from. 
</P>
<P>
 A more modern (and intriguing) spin on the werewolf legend is "Wolfen" (1981), 
starring Albert Finney as a New York detective assigned to a series of violent 
murders. The twist is that a gang of wolf-like things are doing the damage. 
Michael Wadleigh's direction is taut, and Finney adds more than a little class 
to the experience. It's an eerie, smart thriller. 
</P>
<P>
 "An American Werewolf in London" (also 1981, a decent year for lycanthropy) is 
more sarcastic, combining terror with hip comedy. David Naughton plays the guy 
who gets bit during his travels, then begins the usual nocturnal metamorphoses. 
Set against cool London, his prowlings take on a giddy quality. It's a 
werewolf-as-tourist kind of thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The first "The Howling" also came out in 1981, and it's easily the best in the 
series. Strong effects and a new-look werewolf (more rangy, closer to a wild 
wolf) enhanced this effective thriller. It's also funny: There's a cult of 
beasts living in a woodsy retreat, and they approach lycanthropy as if it's a 
New Age religion. You can skip the numerous sequels; they're werewolf dung.

CHICKEN THAT SINGS, A DINER TO CLEAN THE PLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Celebrity-owned restaurants are a tradition in Southern California, thanks to 
an abundance of actors, sports figures and entertainers in permanent residence. 
Add two recent Orange County openings to the list -- Kenny Rogers Roasters and 
Blyleven's Dugout Diner. One is part of a growing nationwide chain of 
rotisserie chicken houses. The other is a homey, one-of-a-kind neighborhood 
hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't count on running into legendary country singing star Kenny Rogers in his 
Fountain Valley chicken shop, but plan on getting an eyeful of the man anyway. 
Kenny Rogers Roasters is plastered with pictures of the singer (a part owner), 
plus copies of his gold records and other Rogers memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotisserie chicken is a hot item in the food industry at the moment because 
the masses have come to realize it contains less fat, sodium and calories than 
traditional fried chicken. The result: a rotisserie explosion, from KFC to your 
local supermarket. Kenny Rogers Roasters has several things going for it: a 
courtly manner, 64 gorgeous chickens twirling languidly on spits over an oak 
fire, and a line of fresh-faced servers (in black and red caps and colorful 
striped shirts) waiting to take your order. 
</P>
<P>
 Service is wonderful, considering that the restaurant's fare is priced to 
compete in the fast-food market. Someone opens the front door as you approach 
it. When you have picked a table and set your tray on it, the empty tray is 
immediately bussed away and you're offered sauces, condiments or anything you 
may have overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 The slogan is, "It's the wood that makes it good," and that is not in dispute. 
The oak gives this chicken a smoky, country-style taste, though not as intense 
as, say, the hickory-smoked chicken at a Richard Jones BBQ or in one of Fred 
Burrell's pit barbecues. Neither is the skin ultra-crisp -- the style KFCs are 
promoting -- but rather on the soft side, similar to the popular rotisserie 
chicken at Claim Jumper. This chicken is a nice, middle-of-the-road rotisserie 
model, and good value for your money. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the restaurant needs to improve its side dishes. Among a half dozen or so 
tasted, only the firm, red-skinned parsley potatoes and tart cinnamon apples 
make a positive impression. The mashed potatoes are gluey, and their brown 
gravy topping is unspeakable. The macaroni and cheese is thick, starchy and an 
unappetizingly pallid shade of yellow. A cold salad of tomato, cucumber and 
onion is a good idea that fails in execution. By the time it reaches the table, 
it is runny and soggy. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll vouch for the surprisingly good chicken vegetable soup, perfumed subtly 
with fresh dill, and the roasted chicken pita pocket, filled with chicken, 
shredded lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, onions and Kenny's Secret Sauce, a flavored 
mayonnaise. But the best bet is still the bird. A plump whole chicken is $7.99 
without side dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Rogers Roasters is inexpensive. A quarter chicken is $2.99 to $4.69, a 
half chicken is $4.99 to $5.99. * KENNY ROGERS ROASTERS

</P>
<P>
 Blyleven's Dugout Diner is owned by blazing Bert Blyleven, a big right-hander 
who won 287 games pitching for, among others, Minnesota, Cleveland and the 
Angels in a long major league career. 
</P>
<P>
 Blyleven owns this baseball-themed diner along with partner Norman Foster, and 
there is a good chance you will to see him in the flesh if you come early 
enough in the morning. We did. Look for a rugged, auburn-bearded guy wearing a 
flowered shirt. The man looks remarkably like a 20th Century incarnation of van 
Gogh (with both ears, of course). 
</P>
<P>
 This is a cute, kid-friendly place in mostly residential Villa Park, and it 
projects an infectious enthusiasm. The tables are glass-topped showcases of 
Angels memorabilia, and there are bat racks, major league team caps and news 
clips about Blyleven's career throughout the restaurant. You order off a menu 
designed to resemble a baseball, drink your juice out of plastic tumblers that 
won't break when you bounce them off the floor. Few people know the diner genre 
better than major leaguers. These guys eat half their meals on the road, in 
cities like Pittsburgh, Boston, Seattle and San Francisco. With all that 
experience, you expect Blyleven to know his diner stuff, and, largely, he does. 
Breakfast foods are dependable, other dishes spottier. You can rely, for 
instance, on the terrific huevos rancheros. They come with a delicious salsa 
and good, squeaky fresh tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Pancakes are airy and tasty, though Blyleven should know better than to serve 
these good cakes with a blah commercial table syrup that comes in a pull-open 
packet. There's also what the restaurant calls a sandwich of grilled sausage, 
fried egg and cheese, which makes a satisfying start when eaten on sourdough 
bread. Egg dishes come with freshly grated, crunchy, golden hash browned 
potatoes. They are almost good enough to make a Red Sox fan smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally there are burgers, made with one-third of a pound of fresh beef. 
Just see that they don't overcook yours, as they did mine. You can get a 
steamed hot dog with sauerkraut, a good Pirates steak sandwich with grilled 
onion, bell peppers and Swiss (like the one made famous at Three Rivers 
Stadium). Pass on the Cleveland Bratwurst, though, a bland veal sausage, and 
Carlton's teriyaki chicken, which has a sticky sweet pineapple glaze. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is dessert you want, there is good cheesecake from the Cheesecake 
Factory, plus good homemade brownies and carrot cake from a private baker. 
"Minor leaguers" -- kids under 8 -- can content themselves with things like 
grilled cheese and peanut butter sandwiches from a kids' menu with nothing over 
two dollars. With a few small improvements, Blyleven could throw a complete 
game. Oh heck, give the man a "W" anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Blyleven's Dugout Diner is inexpensive. Breakfasts are $2.75 to $4.95. Lunch 
and dinner is $2.50 to $6.45. * BLYLEVEN'S DUGOUT DINER

LOST IN O.C.: GETTING OFF THE COUCH AND BACK DOWN TO EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Washburn, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I think I finally figured out why those otherwise thoroughly professional kids 
who toady up to Barney the Dinosaur on his show dance so jerkily. They've 
probably been so busy being Hollywood child actors that they never learned how 
to actually jump around and play. So, to simulate the effect, I believe the 
producers glue the kids' feet to boards and then have burly off-camera 
stagehands wiggle them up and down. 
</P>
<P>
 I get a chance to think about stuff like this because very often the first 
thing I do when I wake up is stumble to the living room and turn on the TV. I 
want to find out what's going on in my world. As often as not I find what's 
going on is: Jim sits and watches "Captain Blood" for the nth time. 
</P>
<P>
 I think I reached my limit a couple of months ago, though. Somewhat more 
bleary than usual, I'd switched the set on, and, staring back at me, inches 
away, was a plastic talking diaper. "I think it's time you and I had a little 
talk," he said, his mouth located in prime soak-zone. "Do you think this is any 
way to live? Why not get your sense of the world from the world itself? Get 
outside and pay some attention, chump, or I'm gonna gitcha! Yeah, look out, 
I'm-a gonna gitcha!!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then he started singing the Supremes' "I'm Gonna Make You Love Me," dancing 
maniacally and coming closer and closer ! 
</P>
<P>
 OK, what this future fragrant landfill was actually saying was the usual 
commercial blather about its wondrous properties, something along the lines of, 
"Mothers, did you know that my exclusive patented layers wick away so much 
moisture that your baby will look like a dehydrated prune?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the message I was hearing was that a change was in order, and not just a 
change of diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 So I've been spending more time outdoors. And you know, that diaper was right. 
It balances out all the doom and unreality of the electronically connected 
world to go out and get some sunlight (however fatal) and some dirt under your 
fingernails, to catch on to the news that, at the most basic and important 
level, the world still works.  
</P>
<P>
 I've enjoyed bits of gardening in the past. Like so many novices of the '70s, 
I got my introduction with that hardy youth-oriented crop that grew well in all 
conditions except under the shadow of a police helicopter.  
</P>
<P>
 Often working seven-day weeks in recent years, I've let my gardening decline 
pretty much to mowing. Even then, I couldn't really call it mowing the lawn so 
much as I was just cutting the weeds to a uniform height. It really didn't look 
bad, from down the block a ways.  
</P>
<P>
 But starting a couple of months back, I guess with the catnip I planted over 
the grave of my cat, Smokehouse, I started a small garden. It's not much: 
spaghetti squash, tomatoes, garlic, epasote and other herbs. It's certainly not 
enough to achieve subsistence, unless I start nipping the catnip too. But it 
does help make me feel more connected.  
</P>
<P>
 All we essentially are is dirt that gets up and walks around. Whether we get 
it from plants or animals, our molecules all come our way via the combination 
of dirt, water and sunlight, and you feel a little more complete having a 
causative hand in that process.  
</P>
<P>
 I like a box of Screaming Yellow Zonkers as much as the next guy, but the way 
we get most of our food is ridiculous compared to the way we could, should and 
historically have obtained it.  
</P>
<P>
 Buy something at the market and it probably started at some big 
diversity-crushing agribusiness factory farm, growing in a fog of chemicals on 
land that is being quickly depleted, using ruinous amounts of water and 
petrochemicals, harvested by machines or people made to feel like machines. 
Then it's trucked along with more petrochemicals, road-wear, smog and traffic 
jams to a processing plant where the really scary stuff happens, and then 
trucked again to market, where next to nothing of the amount you pay makes it 
back into the pockets of the person who worked the crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Compare that to the process of chucking a few seeds in the ground, watering 
them, fertilizing with compost that otherwise would be adding to the landfill 
problem, doing a bit of work in the open air, and then having a boodle of 
spaghetti squash that you don't know what the hell to do with.  
</P>
<P>
 I've been thinking a lot about this gardening business lately and was loaned a 
book, "The Gift of Good Land," by Wendell Berry, which has stirred that 
thinking. He's a beautiful writer; his essays on agriculture can actually make 
you care about the size of potatoes. He makes a strong case for subsistence 
farming, not just for ecological and moral reasons but for cultural ones -- for 
what farming can mean to a family and community. Much of the alienation we feel 
today, he and others propose, comes from our near total alienation from the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy for me to see the enchantment of farming because I don't do it for a 
living, and I wouldn't be sitting here writing this on a computer, nor you 
sitting where you are reading it, were we only subsistence farmers. There are 
countries where ground-to-mouth survival is still a constant after thousands of 
years, and I don't need that much constancy in my life, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 The farming that looks good to me is the Mediterranean type I've seen in 
Italy, where it seems taken for granted that families raise a fair amount of 
their own food. That seems a good goal to me, though I could do without the 
rabbits. In northern Italy, one family showed me and my friends their rabbit 
hutch and asked us which ones we liked. I thought it was a bunny beauty 
contest; the winners turned up on our plates later. 
</P>
<P>
 One good reason to know your food personally was brought home to me just the 
night before writing this. I was having dinner in a South County restaurant 
with a friend, and before he even got to the main course his tongue and 
extremities started to itch and swell up. Then he got a rash all over that was 
so painful he had to go to the emergency room, which added some $500 to the 
cost of his meal. The doctors guessed the incident was caused by chemicals used 
on his lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
 When you start caring about one patch of your yard it's hard not to take an 
interest in the rest of it. Since I still work a seven-day week sometimes, the 
only time I had recently to mow my lawn was at night. One of my neighbors 
walked over, bemused. All I could think to say was, "You know, I'll bet one of 
the real drags about being a vampire is they have to mow their lawns at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I think one of my jobs in life is to keep my neighbors bemused. They 
sure seem to think so. They're bemused that I've stopped using a power mower, 
instead pushing a manual "acoustic" lawn mower; bemused that I'll hunker down 
for hours in the yard now, weeding by hand instead of using chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Let them laugh. Even now, the vines of my spaghetti squash are creeping, 
creeping into their yards.

3-HOUR TOUR: CREATURES FINE, FEATHERED AND (AT TIMES) SCALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON , Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly

<TEXT>
<P>
 In summer, the streets of Anaheim are flooded with visitors, very few of whom, 
it seems, ever venture west of Brookhurst Street. The vast, sleepy expanse that 
stretches through the cities of Stanton, Los Alamitos and finally Long Beach is 
notable for strawberry farms, golf courses and even one major racetrack -- Los 
Alamitos. Here's an unusual way to pass an afternoon without getting on your 
hands and knees to pick berries or betting on a horse. But you'd better be a 
lover of all creatures, great and small. 
</P>
<P>
 11 a.m. to noon: Magnolia Bird Farm is a sprawling maze of aviaries, exotic 
birds, unusual cages and colorfully illustrated books. It is the complete shop 
for bird lovers: The minute you hit the front door, you will be bowled over by 
screeching, cawing, whistling and chirping. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop has belonged to the Miser family for nearly 40 years. Owner Frank 
Miser still buys pigeons for a dollar, sells them for two, and has a huge 
inventory of finches, budgerigars, cockatiels, cockatoos and whatever else you 
can think of. On the low end are zebra finches for $8.50 a pair; multicolored 
macaws, straight from some South American rain forest, can be as much as $1,500 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, you'll see people cosseting their potential new pets. On one visit, 
Greg and Donna Washington, of West Los Angeles, were cradling an African gray 
called Crackers, deciding whether to make him a new roommate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is simply the best bird farm around," said Greg, who is glad to make the 
drive from L.A. Later, the three of us toured the upstairs aviaries -- where 
canaries and chicks are bred -- and the zoo-like cages outside the main 
building, where a variety of birds are displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 1 p.m.: A shop called Papa Joe Webb's began life as a dog and cat 
grooming store, but soon after, Joe and Jan Webb, the couple who run this 
store, had a better idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Papa Joe Webb's Captive Bred Reptiles and Rodents is one of Orange 
County's true oddities. The store specializes in all sizes of mice, rats, 
lizards and snakes, many of which, the proprietors claim, make wonderful pets. 
Up to 100 varieties of snakes (all nonpoisonous) pass through the portals of 
this shop -- anything from simple garden snakes to enormous Burmese pythons, 
truly majestic creatures that are a dozen feet long. Jan has named her two 
beautifully hued Eastern indigos Cleopatra and Marc Antony. They are suitable 
for breeding and sell for $1,200 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask to see Squirt, a 25-pound Savannah monitor. Even hold the lizard in your 
arms if you wish (head supported, like a newborn). For the novice, there are 
books and audiovisual materials relating to snakes and reptiles. And you'd do 
well to heed the advice of an expert, Joe Webb, who says, with a chuckle: 
"Never handle a rabbit or a small rodent before you handle a snake. If you 
smell like food to a snake, you are food, even if you are 10 feet tall and 
weigh 600 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2: Assuming you're not the type to lose your appetite over the sight of a 
25-pound lizard, there is a wonderful, inexpensive and exotic restaurant in 
which to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 El Pollo Ricky No. 2 serves the cuisine of Peru and belongs to Ricky Benites, 
owner of the original restaurant in Santa Ana. The specialty here is pollo a la 
brasa -- crisp-skinned rotisserie chicken. Peruvians eat chicken obsessively, 
smearing it up with a spicy, green herbal puree called ahi. Peruvians do not 
eat rice and beans but, rather, potato dishes with their chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 The potato is Peru's contribution to the world diet. (Europeans, in fact, did 
not have or eat potatoes until well after the days of the conquistadors.) That 
means you'll try unusual native Peruvian dishes such as papa relleno and papa a 
la Huancaina.  
</P>
<P>
 The first is a fried, stuffed potato croquette with a chopped olives and 
ground-meat filling, the second boiled potatoes blanketed with a warm, mildly 
pungent cheese sauce. Wash everything down with an Inca Cola, a yellow Peruvian 
soft drink with an indescribable flavor. For dessert, there is lucuma ice 
cream, a burnished-orange confection made with a tropical fruit.  
</P>
<P>

 Sixty-two Ventura County teen-agers, most from public schools, are spending 
this week at the resort-like campus of the exclusive Thacher School in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of enjoying the school's tennis courts, horse stables and mountain 
trails, the students are hard at work crunching numbers, attending lectures and 
participating in workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 They are learning the art of making money -- enough money, in fact, that they 
may one day afford to send their own children to a preparatory school such as 
Thacher, where tuition alone runs about $11,000 per year.

 Called California Business Week, the six-day camp, sponsored by a local 
nonprofit foundation, aims to give young people from around the county a head 
start in understanding the ins and outs of the world of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched last year, the business camp costs each student only $25 because 
local companies pick up the rest of the $250-per-person tab. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the reasonable price, spending the first week of summer vacation in 
classrooms and lecture halls may seem an unlikely choice for high school 
students. But many of the teen-agers said they think the camp will help them 
achieve their future goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be rich," said 17-year-old Tyler Lakotich, a Newbury Park High 
School senior. "I am going to be rich, and I figured I might as well learn the 
easy way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The business camp schedule for Tyler and the other students is, however, 
anything but easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast each day is at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 And except for breaks for lunch and dinner, the teen-agers are on the go from 
8 a.m. to 8 p.m., attending talks by Ventura County business people, from 
corporation executives to small business owners, on topics such as "The 
American Economic System" and "Profit: The Motivation." 
</P>
<P>
 In between lectures and workshops, the students divide into teams to plan the 
financial strategy of make-believe companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Each company is run by a team of two to three students, who compete against 
two other student-run businesses that manufacture the same product. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day of camp Sunday, the teen-agers picked the products they 
wanted to produce. And because they knew that they would not actually 
manufacture the goods, they let their imaginations run free. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One group decided to manufacture fog-resistant glass. Other students chose to 
make X-ray glasses that could be adjusted to allow the wearer to look through 
human beings or just through their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 As with many real-life companies, however, the students at Business Week are 
less concerned with what they make than how much money they earn. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a day, each team of students makes financial decisions for their company 
for a certain, undefined period of time: How much will their firm spend to 
manufacture their product? How much will they pay to market it? And at what 
price will they sell it? 
</P>
<P>
 In the evenings, a volunteer plugs the teams' financial figures into a 
computer program. And the computer spits out data showing how the students' 
various decisions would have impacted a real company's performance, including 
the bottom line: Would the firm's income have gone up or down? 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the make-believe companies, business camp teacher Norm Kalisher 
said, is to show students how one financial decision impacts another, how 
marketing affects sales, for example, and how pricing decisions are reflected 
in net income. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to juggle all the variables," said Kalisher, a Port Hueneme 
bicycle shop owner who is one of nine volunteer staff at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the students are unlikely to use the information they are learning at 
the business camp until they are out of college and far enough along in their 
careers to have managerial responsibility, Kalisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he said, the teen-agers benefit from learning how tough it can 
be to make a profit in the world of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to use it right away," Kalisher said. "You're not going to 
take a 16-year-old and put them in charge of marketing budgets." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that "they have an idea that when they go into a grocery 
store and buy a gallon milk for $1.99, the store makes half a penny on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Giving teen-agers the opportunity to learn about running a business from 
people like Kalisher, who spend their lives at such work, is one purpose of the 
business camp, said Ken Gerhardt, a retired engineer who helped found the 
Ventura-based California Business Week Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, many of the teen-agers said one of the camp's highlights is 
the speeches by county business people about their personal ups and downs in 
running companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students said the talks are showing them the real-life risks involved in 
making a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here to see if I wanted to go into business," said 15-year-old Dustin 
Reed, who will be a junior in the fall at Ventura High School. "It's actually 
making me more indecisive. They'll tell us they were bankrupt and a million 
dollars in debt and now they're millionaires. I don't know if I want to go down 
that road."

SANTA PAULA'S DARE PROJECT IS IN JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Paula's DARE program, which annually teaches 500 schoolchildren how to 
avoid drugs, is in jeopardy because the police chief says he needs more 
officers on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't continue to have an officer in the schools without putting officers 
on the street," said Chief Walter Adair, who complained that unfilled vacancies 
and long-term disabilities have left his small department shorthanded. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which would be cut off in the fall, could be saved if the City 
Council next month allows Adair to use funds raised by Proposition 172 to add 
several officers. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, the current DARE officer, Jim Ward, would be transferred to street 
patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what happens, Adair said, he doesn't intend to shut down the 
anti-drug program permanently and would try to reinstate it in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the community would be very upset if we had to discontinue the 
program," Adair said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, teachers and parents said they will fight to keep the program, which 
they believe is especially important in a town burdened with drug and gang 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an intervention we can't afford to lose," said Terry Hill, a fifth-grade 
teacher at Blanchard School. "Of course, I want the streets to be safe, but on 
the other hand, I want the kids to be safe, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which has been in Santa Paula schools for five years, targets 
fifth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward visits each classroom once a week for a semester and talks to students 
about drugs and gangs. Like any other subject, there are lectures, discussions, 
homework and tests. At the end of the semester, the children write essays and 
participate in an emotional graduation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, who is on vacation, could not be reached for comment. In a brief 
interview a week ago, Ward said he hoped that the program will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty Allen, president of the Parent Faculty Club at Thelma Bedell School, 
said she was upset to hear that Drug Abuse Resistance Education may not be 
offered next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's daughter has just finished the program and was very enthusiastic about 
it, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave her the knowledge to help her make an informed decision when, God 
forbid, the time comes when someone offers her drugs," Allen said. "I know it 
will make her stop and think." 
</P>
<P>
 Adair said that although the program is successful, the Police Department's 
priority is law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first obligation is to provide public safety through law enforcement, and 
that happens on the street," Adair said. "The other crime prevention efforts 
and community programs are wonderful, but they're secondary to our primary 
mission, which is to enforce the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Adair said he is down to 26 sworn officers -- counting himself -- in a 
department designated to have 30. Three officers are on long-term disability 
and one vacancy has not been filled. And several of the working officers are 
job-hunting at other police departments, Adair said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police chief declined to say exactly how many officers he will ask the 
City Council for in a few weeks, but plans to give several options. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of running the DARE program is about $72,000 annually, which goes 
toward Ward's salary and classroom materials. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Ventura County cities, DARE programs are sometimes sponsored by 
corporations. Adair said he does not plan to ask Santa Paula residents to help 
save the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community gets hit up a lot for donations, and DARE is a substantial 
commitment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program is canceled, Santa Paula would join Oxnard and Port Hueneme as 
cities in Ventura County without a DARE class.

SCHOOLS CHIEF FIRES HIS ELECTION OPPONENT; EDUCATION: PRINCIPAL ACCUSES CHARLES 
WEIS OF POLITICAL PAY-BACK AND SAYS HE WILL SUE FOR DAMAGES OR JOB 
REINSTATEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County schools Supt. Charles Weis has decided not to renew the 
contract of Principal Dan Flynn, essentially firing his rival in this month's 
election and prompting Flynn to accuse him of executing a political pay-back. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis confirmed Wednesday that he has decided not to offer Flynn another 
$62,000 annual contract because of poor job performance. The current one 
expires June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with his decision to exercise his constitutional right 
and run for elective office," Weis said. "I think if you get a chance to look 
at his personnel file, you'll understand." 
</P>
<P>
 But Flynn, 42, said he had been fired improperly and will file a lawsuit for 
damages or to get his job back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it's political retribution 100% and has nothing at all to do with 
my performance," he said. "I can't imagine that this could happen without a 
face-to-face meeting (with Weis) where I could present my side of the story." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he had received satisfactory or superior ratings his entire 18-year 
educational career until this week's evaluation by Phillip Gore, director of 
the county's five schools for juvenile delinquents and other troubled students. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn has worked for Ventura County since 1991, running the three Juvenile 
Court schools. He said he received satisfactory ratings in all categories in 
five previous evaluations. His ratings this week were unsatisfactory in every 
category, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to get involved in the political process," Flynn said. "I 
didn't realize this was a repercussion of it. . . . During the election, I had 
to tell it like it is. I was free from any recrimination, or so I thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn noted that Assistant County Supt. Stephen Kingsford only last week wrote 
him a letter of recommendation. The letter credits Flynn with implementing a 
year-round schedule, updating juvenile school policies and bringing the latest 
technology into classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan Flynn is dedicated to providing high-quality leadership to our staff and 
high-quality education programs to our children and I can recommend Dan without 
reservation," the letter concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis and Gore said they could not discuss shortcomings noted in Flynn's 
evaluation because personnel matters are confidential unless an employee 
distributes the document himself. Flynn said he would release current and past 
evaluations, but after meeting with attorneys, he provided only the cover 
sheets for reviews covering the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the semiannual reviews showed that his performance was consistently 
satisfactory. That changed with the one he received this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis narrowly defeated Flynn in the June 7 election, as both spent heavily to 
win a superintendent of schools post that had not been contested for more than 
100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The county teachers union refused to endorse in the race. Teachers reached 
Wednesday said they generally support Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it was a pay-back, yeah," said Bill Bateman, an English teacher at 
one of the schools Flynn runs. "I've lost a lot of respect for upper management 
because of the recent election." 
</P>
<P>
 Bateman said Flynn has been an aggressive advocate for McBride Juvenile Court 
School, beefing up computer and library programs and fighting to keep state 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of funds moved out of court schools into other 
programs," he said. "We're the cash cow. Until Dan got here, we produced it but 
the money went somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bateman said he thinks that Flynn is well liked by most teachers, although 
some may harbor grudges because of numerous transfers Flynn carried out last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Keegan, president of the county teachers union, said Flynn has a solid 
reputation with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, there were few complaints from the employees about Dan," 
Keegan said. "In my contact with the court school teachers, they were satisfied 
with their relations with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said he was surprised by Keegan's comment, but would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Flynn, his problems with administrators were not evident in his 
January evaluation, but began to build with Gore after Flynn said he would 
challenge Weis in the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could feel the tension between he and I since I declared my candidacy in 
the second week of March," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said Gore was not happy when he used leave time he had accumulated to 
run his campaign full-time. The county's guide for candidates recommends that 
county employees seeking public office take such a leave, Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the race, Flynn criticized a variety of county programs, including some 
of those directed by Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 But never, until the Monday evening meeting with his supervisor, had Gore 
notified him of any problems with his performance as a principal who oversees a 
staff of 20, Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still kind of in shock and sitting here wondering what I'm going to be 
doing next Friday," he said, "and how I'm going to take care of my family." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Flynn said he began sending out resumes two weeks ago after a 
post-election meeting with Weis left him with a feeling that "my time was up." 
</P>
<P>
 "I went into that meeting with high expectations of working together and 
offering my assistance, and left saddened and dismayed, looking for 
employment," Flynn said. "I gathered from that conversation that it was time 
for me to find employment elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Weis said he never told Flynn anything that would lead him to conclude that 
his days were numbered. 
</P>
<P>
 "He talked about how he felt about himself," Weis said. "He felt very badly 
about how he had behaved during the campaign and about the misinformation he 
had spread to the public. I asked him if he knew that the things he had said 
were not true. And he said he did. . . . I mostly listened." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore conceded that it may appear that Flynn's dismissal is related to 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, because of the timing, one might draw that conclusion," he said. 
"But there is no connection at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Weis said Flynn is being dismissed now because his contract expires next week. 
And he said the district would not be severing its relationship with Flynn if 
his problems had not been serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping that most people realize that we don't take a non-renewal 
lightly," Weis said. "If he wants to talk about his (personnel) file, we'll be 
happy to talk about it if he'll release it."

YOUNG INMATE WINS VIDEO CONTEST BUT NOT PRIZE; CYA: WENDY CREIGLOW'S 
'FLATLINES' IMPRESSED USC JUDGES. SHE COULD ATTEND THE PRESTIGIOUS FILM SCHOOL 
-- IF SHE WEREN'T LOCKED UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The prizewinning video's message is blunt: Drugs kill. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize is impressive: a five-week scholarship at USC's film school. 
</P>
<P>
 And the winner is miffed: A California Youth Authority inmate, she can't 
attend USC because she is serving time for grand theft auto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flatlines," the anti-drug video written by 16-year-old Wendy Creiglow at the 
CYA's Ventura School, bested nearly 100 other student videos in May to became a 
finalist in the Teens Making a Difference contest run by KCET-TV in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, it wowed the USC faculty judges, who chose it as their favorite 
for the grand prize. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no way that Wendy Creiglow can leave, CYA officials said, because 
she must stay locked up at least until March. 
</P>
<P>
 And USC officials said they finally decided to award the scholarship to Orange 
County student Josh Goldstein, who helped produce the runner-up video, an 
AIDS-awareness clip. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, none of the Ventura School inmates who worked on the winning video -- 
young women serving time for car theft, armed robbery and drug crimes -- will 
even be allowed to attend the awards ceremony at Dodgers Stadium on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Wendy is permitted to travel to KCET's studios Friday for a televised 
panel discussion with the hosts of "Life and Times," school officials said, she 
will be flanked by two CYA guards. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET is pleading with USC faculty to award Wendy the $4,500 scholarship after 
her release. 
</P>
<P>
 But USC officials said they do not know if they can wait that long to put the 
San Diego County teen-ager through the intensive filmmaking class at the 
university's prestigious School of Cinema-Television. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been able to discuss it with all the people who are involved," 
said Duke Underwood, who runs the summer production workshop for teen-age 
filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy said that if there is any way she can go to USC, "I'd love it." 
</P>
<P>
 "For one thing, it's something for me to do with my life," she said. "I love 
learning about new things." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wendy has not met the parole board's requirements, Ventura School Supt. 
Vivian Crawford said. Even if she had, pre-parole planning takes 60 to 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are excited about this," Crawford said. "But I have heard nothing from 
anyone who's been involved with her that says she's ready for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy, who says she is a recovering alcoholic and drug abuser, took the idea 
for "Flatlines" from an anti-drug poster she drew for another class. The poster 
equated lines of cocaine with the flat readout on a machine monitoring an 
overdose victim's pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 60 seconds long, the video expands on the idea and packs a graphic punch. 
</P>
<P>
 While a voice-over warns that one line leads to another, images flash in quick 
succession: a young woman snorting a line of cocaine, the red lines of a report 
card F, the hard lines of a gun barrel, the chalk outlines of a body at a 
murder scene and the flat line of a corpse's absent pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drugs kill," the narrator intones, and then comes the kicker: garish yellow 
words reading, "A MESSAGE FROM WARDS OF THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC teacher Pablo Frasconi said he and the other two faculty judges believe 
that the video is extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was quite above the others in the program," said Frasconi, 
adding that the judges had no idea that "Flatlines" was made by juvenile 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The director . . . had a very strong vision of how to tie the work together, 
and also it was very strong in the area of visual language," he said. "It's too 
bad that she can't attend the workshop because it's clear that there's a lot of 
talent there that can be tapped and I guess could help them get out of the 
(crime) cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 The young Ventura School video makers -- about 15 worked on the clip -- said 
they just hope that it reaches the right people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like watching it 'cause it's me," said Tami Jefferson, 20, of Watts, 
who pretends to snort a line of baking soda, plays dead and provides the 
voice-over. "But I think it'll turn a lot of heads and get a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commercials I've seen on drugs and violence didn't get my attention, 
because if they did, I wouldn't be here," added Jefferson, who is serving time 
for armed robbery. "I just want my 5-year-old son to see it. . . . I don't want 
him to be like I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Taylor, 17, serving time for a strong-arm robbery, produced the 
soundtrack, wringing electronic gunshots and queasy, threatening chords out of 
a synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She also was the only inmate willing to lie on the floor so that classmates 
could draw the body outlines of the staged murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 That scene should grab young viewers "because it's scary," said Mapuana 
Pulotu, 20. While serving time for a Riverside robbery, she said, she managed 
the technical aspects of Wendy's video and three others submitted by 
inmate-students in the CYA video class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked hard on everything, but this was the best one," Pulotu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Gardner, who runs the class, said he too hopes that teen-agers who might 
ignore conventional anti-drug messages will heed one from young women who have 
been there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the kids with experience in all those areas, especially drugs and 
violence, so they know it better than anyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Wendy Creiglow's iffy prize, Gardner said he can only wait and see, and 
be glad that an entry from his class won. "It's the best thing that's happened 
to my students since I've been here," he said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COLLEGE DISTRICT OKS TENTATIVE BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees of the Ventura County Community College District have adopted a 
tentative budget for the coming fiscal year, despite concerns of some board 
members that the document fails to adequately address possible state budget 
cuts and declining enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 The $61.6-million tentative budget includes a $3-million shortfall in 
revenues, which would be made up with the district's cash reserves until more 
state funds become available, Vice Chancellor Jeff Marsee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials warn that if more money is not forthcoming from Sacramento, 
part-time teaching positions and course sections could be slashed before 
classes begin this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsee said the district already has cut 11 teaching positions and 43 
non-instructional jobs since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But Trustee Timothy D. Hirschberg said the proposed budget is "too rosy" 
because staff members assume the state will come up with at least another $1 
million in funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the meeting, the board voted 3 to 2 to approve 17 part-time 
positions at a cost of about $60,000. It is compensation for extra work to be 
performed mostly by existing employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Karen Boone and Gregory Cole opposed the proposal. JEFF McDONALD

 As he picked through the graveyard of textbooks, Loman Carter, 43, found just 
what he'd been hoping for: a hefty light-blue volume with "Accounting" written 
on the spine. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, like thousands of others, lay stacked Wednesday on a wooden slat in 
an asphalt parking lot behind the offices of the Simi Valley Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered obsolete by Ventura County's largest district, the accounting text, 
first published by McGraw-Hill in 1968, is no longer in print and no longer 
used in high school. It is, however, still used in Carter's night-school 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is doing me a big favor," said the disabled aerospace mechanic, adding 
that the same accounting text would have cost him $72 through a book dealer. 
"It really would have stretched my finances to buy this." 
</P>
<P>
 The giveaway, held for the seventh year in a row, represents the annual 
purging of texts from classroom and library shelves to make way for newer 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
 Each academic subject taught in Simi Valley schools gets a transfusion of new 
texts about every eight years. Robin McGowan, the district's textbook clerk, 
said new books on earth, life and physical science were purchased this year. 
Last year's texts will be kept for reference, while the older volumes are 
packed up and sent to the district warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 To the hundreds of parents, teachers and children who showed up at the Cochran 
Street warehouse as early as 7:15 a.m. Wednesday, the age and tattered 
condition of many books didn't seem to matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The only requirement for taking a book was that it first be stamped "discard" 
or "obsolete" by a district employee. Books that were not picked up Tuesday 
were to be sent to a rubbish company for recycling, McGowan said. 
</P>
<P>
 With her two daughters in tow, Simi Valley resident Mary Bodel was scooping up 
a copy of nearly every textbook and library book in sight. Within a few hours, 
she had completely filled the bed of her blue pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodel said she planned to use the books as she teaches her 7- and 9-year-old 
daughters at home next year. The books "are going to supplement the curriculum 
I've already ordered," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodel said she recognized that some of the science books may not contain 
information on the latest technology -- such as lessons on recombinant DNA 
included in newer biology texts. But in other areas, such as history or math, 
she said the age of the book shouldn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This information isn't going to change. It happened long enough ago," she 
said, holding up a 1965 book on the Louisiana Purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure a math problem is a math problem and American history is American 
history." JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY TO PUSH FOR PUBLIC ACCESS 
STATION

<P>
 As they negotiate a new franchise agreement with local cable companies, 
Thousand Oaks officials will push for a public access educational channel to 
offer televised teaching to residents of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is negotiating new contracts with Ventura County Cablevision and 
Falcon Cable, and council members said they will pressure the companies to 
donate air time for the proposed educational station. 
</P>
<P>
 They will also ask for cash donations to build a new public production studio 
equipped with state-of-the-art video cameras and editing tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Local teachers and television producers applauded the council's decision to 
pursue educational programming, which would supplement the existing 
public-access station, Channel 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you that 36% of high school seniors will get better scores on 
their college entrance exams, but I can tell you that, historically, where arts 
and education have flourished, so have residents and businesses," said Al 
Miller, Moorpark College communications professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Run by Ventura County Cablevision, the existing public access station now logs 
about 145 hours of programming a month, ranging from Bible lessons to yoga 
classes to Navy news. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the channel covers several cities from Calabasas to Ojai, about half 
the locally produced programming comes from Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 With such high interest, local producers say they feel sure that they could 
fill a second channel with educational shows, especially if teachers taped 
lectures or presented special self-help seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be a valuable public resource," resident Harry Evry said. "It 
could clearly open new worlds of entertainment and communication." STEPHANIE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE COULD BE DISBANDED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's once influential budget subcommittee that advises the Board 
of Supervisors on how to spend the county's money has outlived its usefulness 
and should be disbanded, board members say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a place where you could debate and discuss before things became public 
-- and that's certainly not the case anymore," Supervisor Maggie Kildee, who 
heads the panel, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, state law has opened the panel to the public and the press and, 
Kildee said, eliminated the candor and informal discussions that made the 
meetings valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee, which included two supervisors and 10 county department 
heads, developed such ideas as the four-day workweek and early retirement 
programs. Now agency heads often present the same information they will later 
bring to board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be something of a redundant effort, doing the same thing we're 
doing at the full board," Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kildee called for a vote next week on whether to disband the subcommittee.

 James F. Cowan, the former Ventura County superintendent of schools, has been 
selected grand marshal of the 1994 Ventura County Fair parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan, a 62-year-old Ventura resident, was chosen by the fair's board of 
directors for his contributions to the county and his support of youth 
involvement in the fair, said spokeswoman Teri Raley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very honored and pleased that they would select me to do that," Cowan 
said Wednesday. "I'm really excited and looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan graduated from Ventura High School and Ventura College and went on to 
earn degrees from Whittier College and a doctorate in education from USC. 
</P>
<P>
 He has served as a teacher, administrator and coach for 38 years, including 24 
years as the county's superintendent of schools. In that role, Cowan worked 
closely with fair officials to ensure youth involvement, Raley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Fair parade will begin at 10 a.m. Saturday, Aug. 20. The 
parade will travel down Main Street from Catalina Street west to the San 
Buenaventura Mission. TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: UNITED WAY PICKED TO HELP ALLOCATE FUNDS

 Accused of bias and political machinations, an AIDS advocacy panel has 
recommended turning the final say on allocating $300,000 in federal grants over 
to a neutral United Way of Ventura committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very important to the consortium process that it appear to be as fair 
as it could possibly be," said Edie Brown, who heads the Ventura County HIV 
Care Consortium."There was an appearance of bias, and we want to be sure it 
didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS Care, a local nonprofit agency that had received federal funds for the 
past three years, raised the bias allegations after getting no money in this 
year's grant awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency argued that the head of the decision-making panel, Patrick Mayers, 
had a conflict of interest because he quit his job at AIDS Care angrily and now 
works for the county's Public Health Services Agency. The county department 
received $159,000 from the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-member appeals panel, made up of consortium members, voted Tuesday to 
recommend turning the matter over to United Way of Ventura. That agency would 
draw up a new allocation committee with no members affiliated with any AIDS 
organizations. The recommendation is expected to be approved by the full 
consortium. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS Care officials said they were pleased with the compromise. "It's a 
victory in the sense that a completely new, impartial panel will look at all 
the applications for funds," Executive Director Doug Green said. PHYLLIS W.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; UFW PLANS PROTEST AT DOLE CHIEF'S OFFICE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Farm Workers plan to protest the "illegal firings and racist 
comments" of Ocean View Produce, an Oxnard subsidiary of Dole Fresh Fruit Co., 
outside the company chairman's Los Angeles offices today. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of farm workers and union supporters, including UFW President Arturo 
Rodriguez, are expected to picket the Westwood offices of Dole Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer David H. Murdock around noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters intend to demand that the union be allowed to negotiate with 
the agribusiness giant on behalf of more than 600 Ocean View Produce workers, 
as well as other Dole employees in the Coachella Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez and one of two workers allegedly fired by Ocean View Produce for 
union activities plan to enter Murdock's office and present him with 5,000 
postcards from people threatening a boycott of Dole fruits and vegetables, said 
Irv Hershenbaum, UFW second vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first action in Ventura County since the early 1990s, the UFW led an 
election in May to represent the Ocean View Produce workers, who voted 275 to 
231 in favor of union representation. Eighty-seven ballots were contested by 
Dole, however, which claimed that the voters did not appear on a list of 
workers or were labor contractor employees who had no right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Agricultural Labor Relations Board, which conducted the election, is 
examining the results to determine who really won. The board issued a complaint 
June 6 against Ocean View Produce for allegedly illegally firing the two farm 
workers and disciplining others involved in union organizing activities. The 
UFW is seeking a Superior Court order to have the workers reinstated pending 
resolution of the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the union alleges that an Ocean View agent told workers that 
"Mexicans are ignorant fools and animals," and that the company threatened a 
UFW worker with violence. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; SYMPHONY CANCELS FOURTH OF JULY SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The brassy sounds of Sousa, which have filled Ojai's Libbey Bowl on the Fourth 
of July for more than a decade, will be silenced this year because the Ventura 
County Symphony can no longer afford to stage the holiday concert, symphony 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening concert has lost money for the past five years due to dropping 
attendance, lack of sponsorship and competition from other events, symphony 
association Executive Director Karine Beesley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just can't afford it," she said. "And we're not happy about it. It's a 
tradition we're sad we're losing." 
</P>
<P>
 The symphony could have played Ojai this year had it raised its $17 admission 
fee to about $30, Beesley said. But given the decline in attendance, symphony 
officials anticipated that the increase would not work. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely 1,000 people attended last year's concert, which was down several 
hundred from previous years. Beesley attributed the decline to the recession 
and competition from other Fourth of July activities, including concerts held 
before the fireworks display at Nordhoff High School's football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our symphony is feeling the pinch," she said. "We have not seen the 
recession turn around for us. I'm hoping someone in the Ojai area sees this and 
says, 'Wow, we don't want to lose this,' and will offer sponsorship" for next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai City Manager Andrew Belknap was surprised to learn that the symphony was 
not returning to Libbey Bowl. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA CLARA RIVER; NEWHALL PLANS SPUR ECOLOGICAL 
CONCERNS

<P>
 A new community with more than 20,000 residences and businesses on farmland 
just east of the Ventura County line could begin to develop before the end of 
the century under a plan by Newhall Land & Farming Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, submitted for approval to Los Angeles County, calls for 
development to occur over 25 years beginning about 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-square-mile community west of Magic Mountain would extend to the 
Ventura County line and include 22,330 residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Ranch, as the new community would be known, would include five 
residential villages with shopping centers, several schools, parks, an 
extensive trail system and more than 5,400 acres of open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans also include a 200-acre business park, several commercial retail 
centers and a 215-acre golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to creating a social community that provides the human 
services and an environmental setting for an enjoyable place to raise a family, 
live and work," Newhall Land official Jim Harter said. 
</P>
<P>
 But area wildlife officials fear that Newhall Ranch could encroach upon 
significant ecological areas, including the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned that their plans . . . could destroy a lot of what is valuable 
about the river," said Cat Brown, a biologist with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen the whole development proposal, but I have seen their permit 
request," she said. "They've definitely done a lot of good planning and have 
acknowledged the river's value (but) my feeling is they haven't done enough 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said one of the main concerns that Fish and Wildlife officials would 
have is the impact on the unarmored three-spined stickleback, an endangered 
fish that lives in the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the project's plans call for using boulders and other materials to 
make the river's banks harder and stronger, which in turn could threaten both 
the stickleback and the least Bell's vireo, an endangered songbird that nests 
in the brush near the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on the configuration of their project, but if they intend to 
harden the banks of the river, that will squeeze the vireo out entirely," Brown 
said. TRACY WILSON

CITY WON'T RAISE TAXES FOR LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE SERVICES; THOUSAND OAKS: 
PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR SAYS HE WOULD LIKELY CUT BACK ON WATERING AND STOP 
REPLACING DRIED-UP PLANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks will still boast shaded streets and plush lawns, but the 
landscaping may start looking shabbier this summer as city gardeners cope with 
budget cuts by trimming services. 
</P>
<P>
 When a majority of City Council members Tuesday refused to raise landscape 
maintenance taxes by $10 a year, Public Works Director Donald Nelson said he 
would likely cut back on watering and stop replacing dried-up plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson also warned that he may have to end the city's traditional practice of 
planting sturdy shrubs, perky flowers or grass along the perimeters of housing 
tracts. 
</P>
<P>
 But he promised to juggle resources to protect as much as possible the city's 
hefty botanical inventory -- 10.5 million square feet of landscaping, enough to 
cover The Oaks mall and parking lot 240 times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone's going to drive down the street and say 'Oh my God,' " 
Nelson said. "We're going to protect the investment we have as much as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 11,000 parcels, primarily newer tracts in Westlake Village, belong 
to the landscape maintenance assessment district. Gardening on city property 
outside the district is paid for through Thousand Oaks' general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After much haggling with council members in recent months, Nelson on Tuesday 
asked for an 8% hike in landscape taxes within the district to cover surging 
water and electricity costs. The increase would have bumped up the annual levy 
to $139.01 a parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 Denying the fee hike would "result in insufficient monies available to 
maintain landscaping at current standards," Nelson wrote in a report to the 
council. He noted that the public works department has lost 10 landscape 
employees in the past two years, and said watering schedules have been pared to 
a bare minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Frank Schillo said he would be willing to tolerate a little 
less tending to avoid raising assessments. "People can't bear more taxes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Elois Zeanah and Jaime Zukowski joined Schillo, a candidate for 
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, in shooting down the tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Their votes overrode the concerns of Mayor Alex Fiore and Councilwoman Judy 
Lazar, who argued that cutbacks could prove expensive, both in terms of dollars 
and civic pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing unwatered, untended landscaping would cost a lot more than keeping 
it in shape in the first place, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "While an 8% increase is not something I'm dying to see, (rejecting it) would 
seriously impact the level of landscaping in this community, which is one of 
the things we're proud of," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Tuesday night debate, several council members criticized the whole 
concept of a landscape assessment district, which bills only certain property 
owners for the upkeep of city lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically, the residents who live closest to the greenbelts pay for 
landscaping because they enjoy the most benefit. Every property owner within 
the assessment district pays the same annual fee, whether they own one-sixth of 
an acre or a huge undeveloped tract. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be some inequities in the tax system here," resident Ed 
Greenwood complained, urging the city to reform the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Because everyone in the city derives some benefit from the tidy medians and 
blooming plants, council members said they would look at imposing a citywide 
tax to take care of all gardening bills. The new fee could be levied on a 
sliding scale, they said, with payments based on lot sizes or proximity to 
expensive landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Council members also directed city staff to consider revising the policy of 
annexing undeveloped parcels to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city routinely accepts responsibility for gardening along the 
edges of future housing tracts, staff does not bill property owners until 
houses are built and sold. Thus, the city tends half a million square feet of 
landscaping in the Lang Ranch and Rancho Conejo tracts without receiving a 
penny of revenue, Nelson said. 
</P>

 "I don't understand how you can plan to do more landscaping when you know you 
won't have the money," resident Lowell Burk told the council. "I really don't 
understand."

 City staff will look into the issue, Nelson said, and present the council with 
reform options next year.

CASTRO LEADS SPLASH PAST DETROIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Splash is unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
 It has the Continental Indoor Soccer League's most potent offense and its most 
stingy defense. 
</P>
<P>
 It has won almost as many games in the season's first two weeks as the 
franchise won all last season. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of smiles in the Splash locker room following its 10-3 
victory Wednesday over Detroit (0-4) in front of 3,235 at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's most improved team matched Dallas with its fifth victory without 
a loss, getting three goals from Rod Castro and two apiece from Dale Ervine and 
Ralph Black. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash won only six games last year as Los Angeles United. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a whole other team," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 And this team had the good fortune to play four of its first five games at 
home. Now comes the team's first road swing -- four games against Monterrey, 
Houston, San Jose and Portland -- that will be its stiffest challenge to date. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash (5-0) has a two-game lead in the Western Division over second-place 
San Diego and Portland (both 3-2), the final opponent on the upcoming trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a nice cushion," Castro said. "The pressure isn't on us to win 
every single one of those games. It's easier to play without the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go back to last year with the United when we were always losing. We were 
always putting pressure on ourselves to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine, who also had two assists and took over the league lead with his 11th 
goal, said the early going has gone well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting away with things we won't get away with against more 
experienced teams," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach George Fernandez had an answer for that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe you make your own luck," he said. "If you work hard and try your 
best, good things will happen, both individually and team wise. So far, we've 
worked hard on defense and capitalized on offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents have averaged only four goals, and the Splash has averaged 9.8 -- 
both lead the league. 
</P>
<P>
 And the team is approaching the season with serious championship hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That has been told to the players since Day 1," Ervine said. "You have to win 
on the road. We must let teams know that we're going to give the same effort as 
we give in this arena." 
</P>
<P>
 As it did Sunday, when it took a four-goal lead, blew it, and then won in a 
shootout against Detroit, the Splash took another big lead. It scored the 
game's first four goals and led, 5-1, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the goal scorers were Castro and Ervine, who have scored in each of the 
Splash's five games. Sam George, Armando Valdivia and Paul Ratcliffe also 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got the head start," Fernandez said. "No doubt, we'll get better."

 Holland said he is seeking a replacement for Brazier to join a staff that also 
includes Bob Hawking and George Tuttle. "We're probably three or four weeks 
away from hiring anyone," Holland said.

<P>
 Some of the nation's top swimmers will gather for four days of competition 
starting today at the 25th Swim Meet of Champions at the Marguerite Aquatics 
Complex in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, hosted by the Mission Viejo Nadadores, features Placentia's Janet 
Evans, two-time Olympic medal winner and world-record holder, Olympians Jeff 
Rouse and Angie Wester-Krieg, Stanford breaststroker Kristine Quance and local 
prep sensation Derya Buyukuncu.

<P>
 Nadadores Coach Bill Rose said this meet kicks off the summer's senior meets, 
which lead to the World Championships in Rome in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of top swimmers compete in this meet because it allows them to see 
where they are in their training and how well they'll do against other top 
competitors," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminaries start at 9 a.m with finals scheduled for 5 p.m. today through 
Saturday and 4 p.m. Sunday. Full session tickets are $20 for adults and $5 for 
children. Day passes are $7 for adults and $2 for children. ERIK HAMILTON

 Jeff Byrd, who set the Orange County single-season rushing record in 1992 
while at Rancho Alamitos High, has transferred from Columbia to Stanford. Byrd, 
who twice won the Orange County rushing title, will walk on this season at 
Stanford, where he will be a sophomore. Because Columbia does not offer 
athletic scholarships, Byrd will not have to sit out a year to become eligible 
under NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd, who has added 15 pounds to his high school playing weight of 155, will 
rejoin former Rancho Alamitos teammate Leon Vickers, who was a part-time 
starter at linebacker for the Cardinal last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could come out of the backfield on passing downs," Rancho Alamitos Coach 
Doug Case said. "He could do a lot for them."

GRIFFEY GOES BABE RUTH JUST ONE BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By now the scene must seem so familiar, so predictable. After all, it's been 
played out almost nightly at stadiums around the American League this season. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. standing at home plate. Here comes a pitch. 
It might even be a good one, one another hitter might flail at. But Griffey 
doesn't, sending it over the fence for yet another home run. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened again Wednesday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 After four homerless days, one of his longest droughts this season, Griffey 
slammed No. 31, becoming the first to hit that many before the end of June. 
Babe Ruth had hit 30 twice -- in 1928 and 1930 -- but never 31 before July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 At this rate, Griffey will hit 70 by season's end. That assumes there's not a 
prolonged strike to disrupt his relentless march to top Roger Maris' major 
league record of 61 in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to hit the ball," Griffey said after Seattle's 12-3 victory 
over the Angels. "I'm just letting things come. If it (homers) happens, it 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are more impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things he's doing right now are amazing," said first baseman Mike 
Blowers, who homered and drove in four runs. "Personally, I think it's great. 
He's the best player in the game right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Seattle Manager Lou Piniella: "I never saw Babe Ruth hit, but we're 
possibly seeing another one in the making. Let's just enjoy it one day at a 
time and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starter Brian Anderson, a rookie, had the dubious distinction of giving 
up Griffey's 404-foot, sixth-inning homer, which landed deep in the visitor's 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what, it wouldn't have been bad to be part of history like that 
if we had won the game," Anderson said. "But losing this game kind of chaps 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two games, the Angels had walked Griffey intentionally and heard 
the wrath of their fans, who booed long and loud. They struck him out, forced 
him to fly out and watched him rap out singles and doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the sixth inning Wednesday, the Angels handled Griffey about as well as 
possible. It was only the third time this season that he had gone more than 
three games without a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 His last homer came Friday off Kansas City's David Cone, tying Ruth's record 
of 30 homers by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Royals and Angels somehow managed to quiet Griffey until there was one 
out in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey dug into the batter's box with the Mariners trailing, 3-1, and 
Anderson working on a three-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 It was left-hander versus left-hander, and until that point, it had been a 
draw. Anderson got Griffey to pop up for the final out in a 1-2-3 first inning. 
In the fourth, Griffey countered with a run-scoring double over the first-base 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
 As with all his at-bats in this three-game series, there was a keen sense of 
anticipation from the crowd as Griffey waited for the first pitch in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22,305 fans didn't have to wait long to see the result of this 
confrontation. Anderson threw and Griffey swung. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball arched high into the night sky, carrying far over the gate to the 
Mariner bullpen in right field. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey circled the bases to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kid can beat you with so many different facets, but people come to see 
him hit," Piniella said.

ANN CONWAY: R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; FOR JEHAN SADAT, THE WORK CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ann Conway 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jehan Sadat brought her message of community service to 900 supporters of the 
Red Cross on Tuesday when she spoke at the organization's second annual Clara 
Barton Spectrum Awards luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking her place beside the American and Red Cross flags -- "they call it the 
Red Crescent in my country," she noted -- the widow of slain Egyptian President 
Anwar Sadat told luncheon guests at the Hyatt Regency Irvine that her mission 
was to carry on her husband's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He worked for peace, dignity and justice," said Sadat, who is a professor at 
the University of Maryland. "And I have always been honored to be part of 
efforts that care for our fellow human beings, no matter their beliefs or where 
they live." 
</P>
<P>
 When Anwar Sadat became the president of Egypt, Jehan said she asked herself: 
"What am I going to do? There are two ways to go, one much easier than the 
other. I could (only) be first lady, take care of myself, attend parties . . . 
meet official obligations. That would be easy for me to do. But I wanted to do 
something for my country." 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to help institute a law that protected divorced Egyptian women 
against historical discrimination. "They call it Jehan's Law." Because of it, 
divorced women with children get to remain in the family home. "I wanted to 
keep the harmony of the family," said Sadat, a mother of four and a grandmother 
of 10. "I love the strong ties of family." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadat's social activism has also included the establishment of a 
rehabilitation center for the treatment of disabled veterans and children, and 
the founding of the Arab African Women's League. 
</P>
<P>
 "My religion (Islam) teaches that God comes to the aid of those who come to 
the aid of their fellow man," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After her talk, the following women were presented with the Clara Barton 
Spectrum Awards: 
</P>
<P>
 * Paula Burton of Villa Park, the Education Award. Concerned about student 
apathy toward the pledge of allegiance, Burton, a teacher, helped write a 
teaching manual about the pledge, including historical documents and student 
work sheets. She also established Celebration U.S.A., a nonprofit organization 
dedicated to honoring American history. 
</P>
<P>
 * Charlotte Clarke of Fountain Valley, Environment Award. A biology teacher, 
Clarke has helped establish a local park and helped save the Hellman Ranch, a 
wetlands area in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mary Piccione, Laguna Beach, Health Care Award. As executive director of the 
UCI Medical Center, Piccione has helped establish its Birthing Center and 
UCLA/UCI Liver Transplant Program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mary Muth, Santa Ana, Humanitarian Award. Muth is co-founder of Las Amigas 
de San Jose, a fund-raising organization that helps support St. Joseph's 
Hospital. In 1974, she co-founded Catholic Charities Auxiliary. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving special awards were Adriana Brenes-Rios of La Habra, who received 
the Youth Award; the San Clemente-Capistrano Branch of the American Assn. of 
University Women, the Group Award, and Barbara Quayle of Huntington Beach, the 
Elizabeth Dole Glass Ceiling Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on the sidelines -- beaming -- were luncheon co-chairwomen Priscilla 
Sellman and Diane Lawson. "There are so many outstanding women in this county 
who have not been recognized," said Lawson, who wore a bright red suit. "Today, 
it's their turn." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Superstar" party: Following the opening of "Jesus Christ Superstar" in 
Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa on 
Tuesday night, arts supporters filed into South Coast Plaza to gawk at 
"Broadway at the Center," a two-story photographic exhibit depicting eight 
years of musical theater at the center. Tommy Tune, Liza Minnelli, Sarah 
Brightman, Richard Chamberlain, Chita Rivera, Joel Grey -- all are pictured 
around Jewel Court. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past eight years, the center has presented more than 50 touring 
Broadway musicals. Next up: "The Phantom of the Opera," which opens July 22. 
Mark your calendar for the "Phantom" gala on July 23, which includes a 
post-performance gala dinner held on the center's back lot. Tickets ranging 
from $165 to $1,000 are available. Call (714) 556-2121, ext. 251. Shari Esayian 
is chairwoman.

 Short takes: The White House has announced that it is responsible for creating 
7,000 jobs. That's a good start, says comic Argus Hamilton, but people can't 
make a career out of jury duty. 
</P>

 A Tulsa hotel, for ages regarded as the town's best-known house of

"The more things change . . . "

 Fitness magazine says most women start diets because they no longer can 
squeeze into their clothes. Next biggest reason, comedy writer Bob Mills 
reports, is a new law in 14 states that requires them to display a "Wide Load" 
sign on their denims. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a new virtual reality game out that allows shoppers to wander through 
3-D mall stores, buy merchandise and drop it into simulated shopping bags. 
Comedy writer Paul Steinberg says it's amazingly realistic: "You spend the 
first hour circling a 3-D parking lot looking for a parking space." 
</P>
<P>
 A small plane loaded with about 40 bales of marijuana crashed and burned in 
the North Carolina mountains. The fire, reports comedy writer Tony Peyser, 
caused a Grateful Dead concert to break out. 
</P>
<P>
 R.J. Reynolds has taken out ads asking that after tobacco, the government 
might want to ban other things, such as coffee. Kids who start out with decaf 
soon move on to cappuccino and in no time are hooked on double espressos, 
Peyser says. Even more frightening, research shows, this ultimately leads to 
wearing berets and attending poetry readings. 
</P>
<P>
 Comic Marti Schauer says she received her degree in psychology and human 
sexuality from Cal State Northridge in 1986. When asked how she's presently 
applying that degree, Schauer explains that she's "in therapy -- and celibate."

 A woman buys a parrot, takes it home and asks it: "Polly want a cracker?" The 
parrot responds with a string of vulgar language and epithets. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman grabbed the parrot, said "Don't ever use that language with me 
again" and puts it in the freezer. After an hour or so, she pulls it out and 
asks the parrot if it has learned its lesson and will be good. 
</P>
<P>
 The parrot replies that it won't ever use foul language again. Then it adds, 
"But I do have one question: What did the chicken do? "

 The basic lacing system, called the crossing style technique, doesn't always 
address such common foot peculiarities as a heel spur, bunion, wide forefoot, 
high instep, narrow heel and foot or having one foot shaped slightly different 
than the other. Perhaps one of the following four techniques described in 
Better Homes and Gardens will help you get the fit you need: 
</P>
<P>
 * For a high instep: Cross-lace through the bottom eyelets. Don't cross again 
until you're at the top eyelets, where you cross-lace and tie. 
</P>
<P>
 * For a wide forefoot: Cross-lace through the bottom eyelets. Don't cross at 
the next two eyelets -- the widest part of the shoe. Higher up, use the 
standard crossing style technique. 
</P>
<P>
 * For heel slipping: Use the crossing style technique until you come to the 
top two eyelets. Lace from the second to the top eyelets on the same side, 
which creates a small loop on each side. Run each lace's free end through the 
loop on the opposite side, then tie the ends in the normal fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 * For a narrow foot: Use the loop-lace technique for extra support at adjacent 
eyelets in the midfoot area. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunick warns that these techniques are for "fine-tuning, not for replacing a 
bad fit." 
</P>
<P>
 To help you get a good fit, pick up a free pamphlet, "How to Choose Footwear," 
at any of the Athlete's Foot stores in Mission Viejo Mall, Westminster Mall, 
Buena Park Mall and Fashion Island Newport Beach, or write to the Athlete's 
Foot WearTest Center, 450 S. Brainard St., Merner Field House, Naperville, IL

HE SAID/SHE SAID: GET COMFY: THE SEASON STRETCHES BEFORE US LIKE A LONG 
SUMMER'S DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT and ANN CONWAY

<P>
 I t's now officially summertime, and the livin' is officially easy. The coming 
of the summer solstice means that we can put away the blue pin - stripes for a 
few precious weeks, quit reading brooding Gothic novels on Saturdays and put on 
our best dressing-down duds and relax in depth.  
</P>
<P>
 OK, so the June gloom is still hovering -- all those unseasonable-looking gray 
skies. Buck up. Try a few of these summer favorites on for size, and remember 
that beach weather is only days away.  
</P>
<P>
 HE: If there's such a thing as a perfect summer day for me, it's this: early 
morning golf followed by a big champagne brunch followed by a nap followed by 
an evening chili party (featuring peach ice cream) followed by a Monty Python 
film festival. Anything beyond that and you'll die from pure sensory overload, 
believe me. 
</P>
<P>
 I see you wincing. You're thinking, "How can he go through most of a day 
wearing those hideous golf clothes -- the green pants with the little blue 
whales and the bubble gum pink shirt?" Not this linkster, m'dove. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk into your friendly neighborhood pro shop this summer, and you'll find 
some of the best-designed sporting clothes around: muted colors and patterns, 
fine color coordination, drama without excessive flash. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, though, you'd want to change for chili and Monty Python. Those 
activities require a wet suit. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: OK, I'll play the perfect-summer-day game. For me, it's up early for a 
three-mile walk on the beach (I climb out of a crystal-pink cotton gown and 
into a mint-pink jogging suit) and then home for a shower. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's out to breakfast (where I wear a black shorts and top combo, 
dramatic shades, straw hat with black scarf) and a little shopping. Later, some 
reading on the beach (my favorite bathing suit this season is the ladder-back 
number by Calvin Klein. I bought it in black and purple). 
</P>
<P>
 For evening: a sip of something cool at a bistro with a view (where I can be 
casual in pants and top or dress to-the-teeth in black linen and pumps). 
Afterward, an aperitif and the chance to dance. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: No nap? Geez, I feel so old . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but the perfect summer blues banisher is the single most marvelous garment 
in the world: the aloha shirt. It's the one piece of clothing that says "I am 
not thinking about mortgages or my boss or the kids' braces or cholesterol or 
nuclear winter or existential Angst or why the Angels trade away all their good 
guys. No, I'm wallowing shamelessly in a pretty world filled with ballpark hot 
dogs, cold Beck's, World Cup fever, sailing, cruising up to San Luis Obispo 
with the top down and women in ladder-back bathing suits." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, that's a lot for a shirt to say, but your basic aloha shirt is a lotta 
shirt. Breezy, light, so comfortable it ought to be illegal, it's the perfect 
excuse to wear the world's brightest colors on your bod. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me tell you, your day starts out right when you open your closet and see a 
line of aloha shirts stretching to the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: As if our readers didn't know that you worship those flower splattered 
numbers! All right. They're you.  
</P>
<P>
 But my very favorite summer look on a guy is a pair of light khaki slacks worn 
with a gauzy white shirt that is open at the neck. Please, no chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer fashion prop I can't live without? The little top. Crop tops look 
hip with pants, shorts and skirts (all you need is a rippling midriff). And 
wrap tops -- Moschino has made some for the season -- can spruce up a pair of 
faded jeans like nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of my favorites toppers this season: a Calvin Klein transparent black silk 
shirt that looks great with a blazer and a longish crop top (thank goodness) 
with a basket weave hem by Tahari. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I'll go for that white gauzy shirt business, but you've gotta watch that 
color in the summer. Too much white can make you look like a Kentucky colonel 
on Derby day.  
</P>
<P>
 A particular sin: white dress shoes. Especially white patent leather dress 
shoes. Sorry, guys, they still look silly. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-white suit can also be a trap. I wanted one very badly a few years ago 
-- it even had a double-breasted vest, which I figured would make me look like 
I owned a hotel in Barbados -- but I passed.  
</P>
<P>
 Good thing, too. Bright white makes a light-complexioned guy like me look 
cadaverous, and just try to get through a day without smudging some part of the 
suit. You can't even sit on an outdoor bench. The cleaning bill alone would 
have sent me to debtor's prison. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I found a wrap dress at Jaeger in South Coast Plaza last week that is 
going to become my summer staple. It's a black and white floral with flutter 
sleeves that is at once feminine and comfortable. I see myself cruising the 
Greek Islands in it . . . oops. There I go with the Fantasy Thing again.  
</P>
<P>
 All right, I plan to wear it to a good friend's baby shower later this month. 
And if I'm lucky, out dancing some hot summer night. Cha-cha-cha.

 For 14 years, l.a. Eyeworks' signature black-and-white ads have featured 
bespectacled celebrity pals of owners Barbara McReynolds and Gai Gherardi. But 
behind that image is a history of activism -- such as their latest 
collaboration with Aileen Getty, an artist living with AIDS. She stars in the 
current campaign seen in magazines and on bus shelters throughout Orange 
County. Along with her ex-mother-in-law, Elizabeth Taylor, Getty has dedicated 
her life to raising awareness of and funds for AIDS. (Getty was formerly 
married to Taylor's son, Christopher Wilding.) "The ad is about a dialogue with 
our customers . . . and a greater visibility for Aileen," says Gherardi. She 
and McReynolds surprised Getty by giving $10 from each sale of the "Luck" 
clip-on specs ($210) Getty dons in the ad to the Aileen Getty House for Women 
With AIDS. Know Thy Source

 Not into supporting product testing on animals? Don't like the thought of 
animal-derived ingredients in your cosmetics or personal-care goods? You can 
refer to several guides now out, such as "Personal Care for People Who Care" 
from the National Anti-Vivisection Society ($4.95). The nonprofit, 
Chicago-based group identifies companies and suppliers that are cruelty-free 
and those that are not. Among the 600-plus companies listed is Earth Science 
Inc. of Yorba Linda. Its skin and beauty lines are sold in health and natural 
food markets worldwide. "There's a growing number of shoppers concerned with 
the companies behind the products they buy," says Earth Science co-owner Mike 
Rutledge. "Part of our business is supporting a wide range of animal-rights 
groups and environmental groups in the country." Time Again for Indulgence

 The '90s trend to shun extravagance for minimalist simplicity is apparently 
not for everyone. Not surprisingly, women in O.C are among those making jeweled 
watches a hot accessory right now, according to Cartier manager Arlene Dungca 
of the South Coast Plaza boutique. With that in mind, Cartier introduced a 
jeweled version of its popular Diablo watch, first introduced in 1991. Its four 
cabochon-trimmed hinges and winding stem distinguish it from others, as does 
the band, available in satin or leather. "What a more beautiful way to wear 
jewelry than on your wrist," says Dungca. "It's functional and elegant at the 
same time." Pricey, too. In three sizes, the diamond-encrusted Diablo is 
$16,700 for the mini-model, $23,500 for the small face and $27,500 for a large 
style -- that also fits men. ROSE APODACA JONES

SCREEN STYLE: FASHION; THE LOOK OF THE OLD WEST -- KIND OF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Movie: "Wyatt Earp." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Saga of legendary Western lawman Wyatt Earp (Kevin Costner). 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Colleen Atwood, whose credits include "Edward 
Scissorhands," "The Silence of the Lambs," "Lorenzo's Oil," "Philadelphia" and 
the forthcoming "Ed Wood." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: If you've had it with dusty black coats, dusty black hats and dusty 
black boots, give this Western a chance. All of the above appear, but there are 
also moments of fringed and fur-trimmed Victorian splendor, thanks to the women 
in Earp's life -- his wives, his mother and his brother's wives -- who wear 
antique dresses as well as new ones made with old fringes, buttons and ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he hardly qualified as a peacock, the real Earp and his peacekeeper 
brothers did seriously consider their appearance, Atwood says. To distinguish 
themselves from the unruly cowboys they encountered, the Earps always dressed 
in black, with the occasional white shirt and a string bow tie. 
</P>
<P>
 You Shouldn't Miss: Even under a layer of dust, gambler Doc Holliday (Dennis 
Quaid) and his lady friend, Hungarian prostitute Big Nose Kate (Isabella 
Rossellini), make a garish and gaudy fun couple. She cavorts in an array of 
ornate silk dresses, one of them beaded with jet, and a 
not-your-ordinary-prairie-girl mink cape. 
</P>
<P>
 Doc's clothes are full of baroque energy -- cobalt-blue eyeglasses, 
wide-brimmed Spanish hat, velvet jackets and a fur-collared coat. Never mind 
that the real Doc was a rather ordinary dresser, Atwood admits. The fancy 
clothes are meant to convey "that he had a nickel in the bank once and the soul 
of a gambler." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: The black onyx crucifix Doc wears is an affectation borrowed from 
another Western hero, Wild Bill Hickok, who always wore a necklace with a 
cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "This was a huge, but great challenge," Atwood says. "After a year 
when 'The Piano' comes out, which is so strict (in keeping with the period), 
you have to make a choice. Do you do costumes with a basis in history and try 
to stick to it, or do you bend it? We had a strong historical basis, but we 
bent it sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: The research libraries at Western Costume in Los Angeles, the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and Angels and Bermans costume house in 
London; books on the history of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Most of the principals' costumes were custom-made in various 
workrooms. The antique pieces were rented or purchased from Cosprop, Angels and 
Bermans in London and about 60 other sources. BETTY GOODWIN

BOOK REVIEW; THE STORIED DECLINE OF BRITISH ARISTOCRACY; ASPECTS OF ARISTOCRACY 
BY DAVID CANNADINE ; YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS; $30, 320 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After David Cannadine's "The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy," a 
vintage work on the subject, his essays in this new book come more or less as 
bin-ends. The title is exact: They develop in detail a wide miscellany of 
subjects encompassed but not necessarily explored in the first book. 
</P>
<P>
 They range from a thorough account of the debts of the Dukes of Devonshire to 
the elaborate and purposeful ceremonials devised by the viceroy, Lord Curzon, 
in India. They include a seriocomic history of the explosive Baron Strickland 
of Sizergh, who managed -- serially and sometimes simultaneously -- to be a 
member of the House of Commons, a peer in the House of Lords, a political 
leader in Malta, and a colonial governor in the Leeward Islands and Tasmania. 
They include a sunny portrait of a family of gentry, a faintly rancorous list 
of the scandals attending Winston Churchill's aristocratic relatives, and a 
sketchy account, whose rancor is not in the least faint, of Vita Sackville-West 
and Harold Nicolson. 
</P>
<P>
 The rancor comes from generally laudable exasperation. Cannadine is not 
exactly an iconoclast; the British aristocracy has long stopped producing icons 
of either the grand or villainous sort. What has enveloped it, over the past 
half-century, is a mushy, in part trans-Atlantic, sentimentality: the romance 
of country houses and a gracious way of life.  
</P>
<P>
 Cannadine, who writes in lively, dispassionate and fascinating detail about 
the shifting structures of power and wealth in an aristocracy that took longer 
than any other to decline, is attached to his subject, diverted by it, fair to 
it. But he can't stand the mush. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually he is cool and only mildly ironic. But his war against the reverential 
sometimes carries him too far. His essay about Churchill's relatives, the 
Marlboroughs and others, aims to place Winston in the context of an 
aristocratic tradition that has more to do with the rakehell antics of the 
Regency bucks than the tactful shabby tweediness of their successors. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one reason, he notes, that so much of the British upper class so 
passionately distrusted him up until the war. Fair enough. But in detailing the 
scandals and implying that Churchill himself was not free of them, Cannadine 
uses altogether too many "it was rumored" and "it was widely whispered." He can 
sound like the Daily Mail -- or the Times of London quoting the Daily Mail. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Vita and Harold, Cannadine is irked by their stylish legend and, 
particularly, by their son and biographer, Sir Nigel Nicolson, whom he calls 
the family "publicist, editor, apologist." They were snobs and mediocrities, he 
argues. 
</P>
<P>
 True, in part, and in part patently untrue. Nicolson's diaries and sketches 
may lack grandeur, but they do not lack greatness. Boswell was once 
underestimated in the same way Cannadine underestimates Nicolson: both were 
silly, snobbish and had no dignity. And both wrote of their worlds with 
unquenchable life.  
</P>
<P>
 Insisting that Nicolson's homosexuality is a relatively minor issue, Cannadine 
writes that his first book was a study of Verlaine, "the French poet and 
degenerate." Yes . . . as in Faulkner, the American novelist and lush, and 
Flaubert, the French writer and syphilitic, and. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from these two essays and one or two that are rather humdrum, 
Cannadine's bin-ends include some splendid items.  
</P>
<P>
 Lord Curzon's meticulous organization of the Durbar honoring the coronation of 
Edward VII included his choice of the books to be placed in the bookcases of 
each of the visiting dignitaries and his order to delete from "Onward Christian 
Soldiers" the stanza with the line about "Crowns and Thrones may perish." The 
point of the grandeur was to make the Indian notables realize what a great 
thing it was to be part of the Empire. "Just as oratory was verbal advocacy, 
ritual was visual advocacy," this early imperial spin-master wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Baron Strickland, half-Maltese and half-British by origin and 
about 200% British by conviction, would make a first-rate movie if Sir Alec 
Guinness were still available for such things.  
</P>
<P>
 Strickland was never quite accepted by either side; his vigorous pro-empire 
stance alienated the Maltese and embarrassed London. He had the sense, though, 
to marry into a powerful aristocratic family; his career was a succession of 
posts won by string-pulling (and obsessively devoted work) and lost by 
quarreling (and obsessively devoted work). 
</P>
<P>
 Cannadine has the art to assemble a suggestive portrait out of straightforward 
sentences and scholarly facts.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the best essays in the book seems simply to be a chronological account, 
yet it has the savor of evocation. It describes the rise of the Cozen-Hardy 
family from an 18th-Century Norfolk farm to the ownership of breweries and 
thousands of acres to several generations of lawyers, judges, editors and a 
barony; and then fading, in one case into a bed-and-breakfast establishment.  
</P>
<P>
 Scrupulous, gentle, civic-minded and connected by marriage to the leading 
families in the county -- among them, the mustard Colmans -- they represented 
what for most of this century many of the English would think of as England at 
her best.

POP BEAT: THREE OF O.C.'S BEST BLUESMEN BRING IT ON HOME; JAMES HARMAN GETS 
COMFY, WALTER TROUT MAKES HIS STATESIDE RECORDING DEBUT, AND ROBERT LUCAS 
COVERS FAMILIAR GROUND IN A STRIKING WAY.

<P>
 In a stroke of coincidence, the Big Three of the Orange County blues scene all 
have new releases out. James Harman's revamped lineup has helped him craft one 
of his most charming and invigorating albums; the sizzling Walter Trout Band 
finally has a chance to let American fans know what Europeans already 
understand, and Robert Lucas continues to stake out his turf as a top-notch 
traditionalist. Ratings range from * (born under a bad sign) to **** 
(hallelujah, we love it so). Three stars denote a solid recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 James Harman Band 
</P>
<P>
 "Cards on the Table" 
</P>
<P>
 Black Top  
</P>
<P>
 Harman always has been at home in virtually every corner of the blues and 
rhythm & blues traditions. On this album, his best since "Extra Napkins" in 
1988, he sounds as if he has entered a special zone of comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 As a singer, he slips with creamy ease and absolute authenticity into the 
mainly humorous roles he has written for himself. The players riding along with 
him seem to be enjoying the journey, too. Despite recent lineup changes, the 
Harman Band strikes the note of natural, unforced enjoyment that is its 
leader's hallmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Huntington Beach-based Harman and Jeff Turmes, his versatile 
right-hand man since the "Extra Napkins" lineup scattered in the late 1980s, 
are drummer Michael Cherry, who lays sound foundations without fuss or unneeded 
exertion, and guitarist Robby Eason, who may be the most musically mature 
18-year-old in the blues universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Eason struts clean, stinging, Albert Collins-like leads during "Temporary 
Blues," conversing as an equal with an experienced and accomplished guest 
guitarist, Texas blues veteran Anson Funderburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Eason chugs along with clipped Chuck Berry-inspired licks in "Run, Run 
Tonight" and coyly meanders through "Last Clean Shirt." He does sound stiff 
during his solo on "Crazy by Degrees," a heavy shuffle a la Stevie Ray Vaughan, 
proving that there is room for development. Given the taste, tonal presence and 
versatility he displays elsewhere on this album, he is off to a promising 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Harman and band never do is strain for effect. They establish an 
assured, naturally flowing groove from the start with the sultry, swampy vamp 
"Night Ridin' Baby." The performance never boils over but simmers, embodying a 
cool, confident, expectant sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's My Thang" is a hilarious, funky, horn-driven R&B workout in which 
Harman gives free rein to his genius for comic role-playing. He simultaneously 
inhabits and winks at the song's character -- a frazzled fellow who has put his 
trust in advertising that inflames his expectations with promises of ultimate 
satisfaction. Harman further explores his soul and R&B influences with "Black 
Under Black," a smooth and zesty number that wouldn't have sounded out of place 
on Van Morrison's album "His Band and Street Choir." 
</P>
<P>
 The bittersweet soul ballad "I'll Call You" and the concluding dirge "Walk the 
Streets (Cold and Lonely)" give Harman a chance to emote sincerely. He brings a 
depth of feeling to both performances -- again while maintaining that sense of 
unforced mastery. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly, though, the Harman Band is out to have a good time. In "Don't Spoil My 
View," they remind people who have a perhaps too-religious or too-intellectual 
regard for the blues that the milieu matters as well as the music. Confronting 
fanatics who want to analyze every influence, every nuance of what he does, a 
comically peeved Harman looks down from the bandstand and asks them to back off 
a bit: While they study his harmonica technique from close range, they're 
blocking his view of the pretty women who just want to dance to what he's 
laying down: 
</P>
<P>
 You want to talk about Muddy Waters, Little Walter and Lightning Slim.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, we need to see these girls dance; you're too wrapped up to notice them.  
</P>
<P>
 With "Cards on the Table," the Harman Band glides along, taking in a wide 
vista of styles and subjects. The players clearly are enjoying the view and the 
moment, and their enjoyment is infectious. Harman has found a lineup worth 
putting in the field for a good, long stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 The James Harman Band plays July 2 at 9:30 p.m. at Jack's Sugar Shack, 8751 W. 
Pico Blvd., Los Angeles. (310) 271-7887.  
</P>
<P>
 *** 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Trout Band 
</P>
<P>
 "Tellin' Stories" 
</P>
<P>
 Silvertone  
</P>
<P>
 "Tellin' Stories" (due for release Tuesday) is Trout's belated U.S. recording 
debut. It follows four European releases, and while it isn't his strongest 
album, it should establish the blues-rocker from Huntington Beach as a leading 
contender in the guitar-hero sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to Trout blaze his way across this 74-minute marathon course is the 
blues equivalent of watching that wired-to-blow L.A. city bus skidding and 
careening through the movie "Speed." In the film, the bus will explode if it 
slows to less than 50 mph; Trout, as ever, plays as if dire consequences would 
ensue should he pause during his torrent of notes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a guitar style that should come with an advisory -- "Don't try this at 
home, or on record, or on stage" -- because playing as wired and prolific as 
this almost invariably flies out of control, or falls into wearisome 
repetition. But Trout, who did his apprenticeship with those venerable blues 
institutions Canned Heat and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, has a way of making 
an excessive style work. 
</P>
<P>
 His volcanic eruptions are channeled cannily; if the notes gush like a molten 
flow, they nevertheless are molded into coherent shapes set off by Trout's 
constant attention to tonal variation. Would Trout be more listenable if he 
reined himself in from time to time? Maybe, but it's like asking whether a bull 
would be a more effective creature if he didn't have that habit of charging 
every red cape he sees. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, it's obvious that Trout's high-voltage style is not a matter of 
calculation so much as the outward expression of an ingrained musical nature 
that's a tad larger than life. Let Trout be Trout, and he can joust well enough 
to be pegged as a possible heir to the still-vacant flashy-ax throne last 
occupied by Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tellin' Stories" is a bit overstuffed: The album easily could have done 
without its concluding 11-minute slow blues workout (well, it's Walter's 
version of slow). 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is the mix, which leaves many tracks sounding flat and 
cluttered, as if all the musical elements had been squeezed into a restricted 
space rather than left to stretch out and breath. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Trout's songwriting isn't up to the level he established on his best 
album, "Prisoner of a Dream" (1991). But these songs mainly avoid blues formula 
and hone in on moments of emotional crisis. Trout insists that wrong turns in 
life have consequences and that finding the right path is no easy matter. If 
his lyrics here are plain-spoken to a fault, at least it is in the service of 
ideas that have substance. And his above-average vocals never stint on passion. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a good ear for melodic hooks -- he is one of those blues-based artists 
who conceivably could write a hit song. The best number here is "Please Don't 
Go," an epic ballad that works in plenty of pop content as Trout explores the 
welter of feelings unleashed upon a loved one's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Trout always has done well with tense and stormy drama -- and maybe goes 
overboard on "Tellin' Stories" with repeated songs in that vein. "Somebody's 
Cryin' " is the best of this record's stormy bunch. In a nice production touch, 
some spacey, off-kilter guitar and vocal effects are worked in, evoking the 
confusion the narrator feels as he confronts a lover who only weeps and can't 
articulate the source of her anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 Variety has been one of Trout's strengths, and while "Tellin' Stories" omits 
the simple, folk-song balladry that has provided a nice change of pace on past 
albums, there are such departures as the sweet soul ballad "I Need to Belong," 
and "Time for Movin' On," a solid acoustic blues that brings a bit of 
much-needed sparseness and serves as a breather. 
</P>
<P>
 A Stones-influenced rocker, "Head Hung Down" goes for "Exile on Main 
Street"-style dirty grit. Despite a bad pun for a title, the churning, 
funk-inflected "On the Rise" does indeed raise its depiction of sexual sparks 
in a barroom to a higher plane of emotional intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 In sum, "Tellin' Stories" is, like Trout's previous albums, a display of hot 
guitar playing and lots of it, tempered by a consciousness of what's important 
in our emotional lives and a sense of what's involved in crafting a good song. 
While it's not the most delicious catch in his net, there certainly is no need 
to toss it back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Walter Trout Band plays Friday through Sunday at Perqs, 117 Main St., 
Huntington Beach. (714) 960-9996.

 *** Robert Lucas 
</P>
<P>
 "Layaway" 
</P>
<P>
 AudioQuest  
</P>
<P>
 With his strong 1992 album "Built for Comfort," Lucas graduated from 
young-contender status to world-class mastery of traditional blues. "Layaway" 
keeps up the good work and again states his case for wider recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 While staying within the bounds of the confirmed traditionalist, Lucas manages 
to cover a good deal of stylistic ground, giving him a range of opportunities 
to display his striking all-around ability as a singer, guitarist, harmonica 
player and songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 The album opens with "If You Don't Want Me," a funky, horn-embellished workout 
that has some early Ray Charles in it. And that's just the start of a 
refreshing journey that stops in the Mississippi Delta for solo-acoustic slide 
guitar blues in the Robert Johnson vein, and also moves up Chicago way for 
straight electric blues employing an excellent full-house of a band that 
includes organ, piano, horns, and two or three supporting guitarists in 
addition to Lucas, a mean slide player. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a jumping, swinging number, "High Priced Baby," that's full of 
finger-wagging fun, and a concluding reprise of the opening track that brings 
it all back home by incorporating both the rural Delta influence and the 
insinuating urban grooves. 
</P>
<P>
 In each mode, Lucas and partners play with a loose, down-home flair that you'd 
expect from juke-joint pros -- never fussy, but never sloppy. Each player gets 
his due during "Long Train Coming," a slow instrumental that stays entertaining 
over the course of 9 1/2 minutes due to the strength and contrasting musical 
temperaments of the various soloists. 
</P>
<P>
 If you took away the harmonicas Lucas puts to coy, playful use, and forbade 
him to touch a guitar, you'd still be left with a bluesman who could forge 
ahead just on the strength of his singing. He has a big, burlap sack of a voice 
-- deep, rough and earthy -- that sounds as if it were piped in from 1935. He 
has the taste to emphasize intimacy with it, rather than trying to overpower a 
song. 
</P>
<P>
 He pays tribute to Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters with "300 Pounds of Joy" and 
"Baby Please Don't Go," throwing in enough twists to keep the oldies lively. 
Otherwise, the material is original. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the songs are in the familiar woman-done-me-wrong mode. But Lucas, who 
often has applied his own modern songwriter's perspective to traditional forms, 
gives his lyrics a contemporary edge by posing drug abuse as an underlying 
reason for the unreliability of his would-be lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cinderella Blues," a solo-acoustic song about a crack-addled woman, is the 
most memorable composition here, and it's the one song in which Lucas takes a 
few liberties with handed-down tradition. His guitar accompaniment is straight 
out of the rural blues handbook, but above it rides an airy folk-pop melody 
delivered partly in a falsetto voice. It sounds like Donovan-goes-to-the-Delta, 
a departure from expected blues form that lends an element of surprise to go 
with the familiar satisfactions found elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Lucas' fourth album for AudioQuest Music, the San Clemente company 
whose main business is selling audiophile stereo cables. As before, the 
presentation is as classy as the performance. Once more, Lucas and his 
supporting cast were recorded live without overdubs in a studio, using analog 
tape rather than digital recorders, and the music comes across with such 
clarity, depth and presence that you'd swear you were on the bandstand with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The album package again offers exceptional artwork and photography. Fans of 
pre-'60s blues may be busy filling out their collections with the rich trove of 
reissued classics that the CD revolution has put on the market, but they won't 
be disappointed if they take this one home, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lucas is on tour . So far, there are no local dates.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: TED HAWKINS, "THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS" DGC RECORDS  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Sam Cooke had wound up sitting on a milk crate on the sidewalk singing for 
quarters, he'd probably have sounded like Ted Hawkins. That, indeed, is the 
manner in which Hawkins, nearing 60, has spent most of his "professional" life, 
singing to passersby on the Venice boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 His has been a life far different and darker than Cooke's, or even most modern 
gangsta rappers. He claims to be the unwanted son of a prostitute. He's spent 
much of his life in prison (including Mississippi's notorious Parchman Farm) or 
mental institutions for a variety of nonviolent offenses. And, in the era of 
MTV, he wound up on the sidewalk with no more technology than just his voice 
and a guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how DGC exec Tong Berg heard Hawkins, and, unlike so many people in the 
recording industry, Berg clearly has ears. He signed Hawkins and produced "The 
Next Hundred Years," an album of strange and wonderful beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins has had moments of acceptance before. His first nightclub performances 
were wildly received opening slots for Jonathan Richman in 1986 at Huntington 
Beach's still sorely missed Safari Sam's. The year after that, he traveled to 
England, where he was recently celebrated as the best soul singer since Cooke. 
He recorded two fine, recently reissued albums for Rounder, with some 
heartbreakingly sad songs and others that ranged in theme from the U.S. 
Constitution to the perplexities of oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Those albums had largely presented Hawkins as he appeared on the street, where 
Berg takes chances with that simple purity. He gives most of the numbers 
inventive arrangements, but they are wonderfully sensitive ones. The opening 
cut, "Strange Conversation," sounds like a cross between the Stax house band 
and Van Morrison's "Astral Weeks" and is the perfect medium for Hawkins' moody 
lyric of love's shifting ways. Other tracks feature pedal steel and cellos, but 
always placed in the service of Hawkin's unschooled voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Cooke, there is a smooth huskiness to his voice, but with more sadness 
coloring it, and a disquieting nakedness of emotion. Unlike the far-ranging 
subjects of Hawkins' earlier songs, most here deal with love or the lack of it, 
though "Big Things," with its theme of a man trying to live up to his 
opportunity, clearly refers to Hawkins' newfound recording career. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes the most of it, pouring a stunning amount of emotion into his own 
songs, the Webb Pierce country standard "There Stands the Glass," Jesse 
Winchester's "Biloxi" and John Fogerty's "Long as I Can See the Light." JIM 
WASHBURN

WORLD CUP / USA 1994; WORLD CUP JOURNAL; INCREDULOUS U.S. FANS SAVOR INCREDIBLE 
UPSET

<P>
 It was the most incredible of victories, a whipping of odds so large that the 
only question before the game was not whether the United States would lose, but 
how badly. 
</P>
<P>
 And then the minutes of the second half began to tick away and the fans began 
to realize that the impossible might actually happen -- that the United States 
might win a World Cup soccer game for the first time since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 Better still, euphorically still, that victory might come against the vaunted 
Colombians, one of the favorites to take it all. And then it happened, so 
sweetly, so joyously for the American fans who journeyed to the Rose Bowl on 
Wednesday afternoon. The last of the seconds peeled off the clock and the U.S. 
soccer team took its rightful place as having pulled off one of the great 
upsets in the history of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 And the crowd of 93,194 went wild, savoring the moment when, perhaps, U.S. 
soccer had come of age. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 2-1 game ended, hundreds of fans descended upon the field, throwing 
red, white and blue streamers, dancing beneath the scoreboard and chanting: 
"Ole! Ole! Ole! U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!" After 30 minutes of celebration, security 
police began to usher out the ecstatic throngs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff David, a 21-year-old UCLA student wearing a red, white and blue top hat, 
was hopping up and down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a total basketball fan, but this blows away the Knicks and the NBA. This 
was better than the U.S. at Lake Placid," he exclaimed, referring to the 1980 
hockey victory over the Soviet Union. "I couldn't be any happier. I could die 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Marlene Erskine, 52, went to Wednesday's game clutching four cloves of garlic 
for good luck. And the garlic must have worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the thrill of a lifetime -- it's unbelievable," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinny Acona was simply stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 Acona, 23, his face painted red, white and blue, had not a clue that the 
United States would even come close. He had come to see the game more because 
he enjoys the sport, rather than believing that the U.S. was going to win. But 
then, as things began to turn in the American team's favor, he chanted "U.S.A! 
U.S.A!" And by the end of the game, he was beaming. 
</P>
<P>
 " '94 is the year of the underdog!" he proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, there was little for the Colombian fans to do but face the 
reality that the team, the pride of their nation, was all but out of the 
running for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," said Juan Gomez, a Colombia native who lives in Atlanta. "The 
Colombians are not playing as well as they used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Carola Montenegro, a Colombian native who owns a Glendale glass and mirror 
shop, had come to the game with 15 relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a lousy game. Colombians had such enthusiasm that their team should 
win, but the players had such big heads, big egos -- now look what we have," 
she said, throwing her hands in frustration. "I think they will kill these 
players when they return home." 
</P>
<P>
 The day for the Colombians was one that began on a bleak note and only got 
worse. A death threat against one of their players and his family was 
telephoned to the Marriott Hotel in Fullerton where the team was staying. The 
threat, directed against midfielder Gabriel Gomez and his family, caused team 
coach Francisco Maturana and his aides to pull Gomez from the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very hard to say who is making these threats," Gomez told a Colombian 
television network. "I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me my family and their families have been threatened if I play," 
Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Colombian team spokesman said the threat was aimed at both Gomez and 
Maturana. "The caller said that if Maturana played Gomez, both he and Gomez 
would suffer the consequences, and their families in Colombia would be in grave 
danger," said the spokesman, Antonio Correa. 
</P>
<P>
 The somberness of the tone carried to the soccer field as the U.S. team, 
playing well above its expected level, took the lead and kept it. Once ahead, 
the chants from the U.S. fans only got louder as the game went on and it became 
apparent that it would take a miracle for the Colombians to get back into it. 
</P>
<P>
 As though to irk the Colombian fans in the aftermath of the game, U.S. fans 
donned blue wigs in a victory dance, a parody on the Colombians who had worn 
yellow wigs to look like the wild-haired, popular Colombia player, Carlos 
Valderrama. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Benham, a 29-year-old Denver computer programmer wearing a startlingly 
blue wig, predicted that Wednesday's victory would launch the sport's 
popularity in a nation dominated by baseball, basketball and football. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was everything America needed -- it's the start of an avalanche for 
soccer," Benham said. "Soccer is going to happen in America now." 
</P>
<P>
 A contingent of about 50 people flew in from Kearny, N.J., to see three 
players from their region -- John Harkes, Tony Meola and Tab Ramos. Tom 
McKeown, 27, of Kearny banged a snare drum and led chants throughout the 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We flew across from the East Coast to the West Coast to see these boys," he 
said. "We're going to win the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 In Pasadena's Old Town, jubilant fans paraded through the streets and 
motorists honked their horns in postgame celebrations. And from the "35er Bar" 
came the chant, "U.S.A., U.S.A." 
</P>

 G ooooooood golly! 
</P>
<P>
 Edgard Ariza's goal was simply to get to the Rose Bowl in time for the World 
Cup match between the United States and Colombia as he walked through Old Town 
Pasadena on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a shout from a Colorado Boulevard pool hall made him stop in his 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gooooooaalll!" was the cry. 
</P>
<P>
 To soccer fans, that is the drawn-out, trademark yell of a Spanish-language 
sportscaster whose excitement becomes contagious when a goal is scored on 
international soccer broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ariza, a 35-year-old engineering draftsman from Las Vegas, stuck his head 
inside Q's Billiard Club. He was surprised to see that a contest was under way 
to determine whether U.S. or Colombian fans could yell it out the best. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. supporter Jorge Sepulveda -- a 27-year-old benefits eligibility worker 
from Sylmar -- had stars and stripes painted on his face and an American flag 
draped over his shoulders. He took a deep breath and bellowed a five-second 
"Gooooooaalll!"  
</P>
<P>
 Colombia backer Miguel Mercado, 28, a teacher from Los Angeles, let loose with 
a six-second shout. Paco Chavez, 46, a real estate agent from Montebello 
supporting the U.S. team, screamed out a four-second yell that sounded like 
"G-g-g-g-gooooaalll!"  
</P>
<P>
 A dozen contestants from the two countries were lined up. So Ariza joined 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 None could match the long-winded "Goooooolll!" of Univision play-by-play 
announcer Andres Cantor, who memorializes soccer gols (as the word is spelled 
in Spanish) on about 75 games a year. In fact, for a time it sounded like the 
winners might be Q Club waitresses Nina Booth, 22, and Lisa McDonald, 21. They 
turned the word into a 14-second scream. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was Ariza's turn, he combined the G-word with the names of his two 
favorite Colombian players -- Carlos Valderrama and Freddy Rincon. And for good 
measure he tossed in his (inaccurate, as it turned out) prediction of a 4-1 
Colombian win. When he finished 15 seconds later, the crowd of about 50 
onlookers went wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Ariza won two tickets to a World Cup second round match on July 3. He got in 
the last word, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thhaaaaaannnnnks!" he shouted. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sure, World Cup fans can patiently endure the hassles with traffic, parking, 
long lines and sweltering heat. But soccer aficionados were flabbergasted when 
guards confiscated their snacks and water bottle caps, throwing away seemingly 
benign goodies -- like apples -- after a security pat down. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the games began, World Cup officials released a list of do's and 
don'ts. For fear of mischief-makers, alcohol, poles and umbrellas were banned 
from the Rose Bowl. Firecrackers, flares and smoke bombs were also definite 
no-nos, World Cup officials declared. 
</P>
<P>
 At security checkpoints, zealous guards took apples, potato chips and pretzels 
from families with small children. An apple, World Cup spokeswoman Sue 
Carpenter said, could readily become a projectile. "But pretzels? Can I get 
back to you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter never called back. 
</P>
<P>
 Confiscating a bag of pretzels on Wednesday, security guard Dianna Valdez 
said: "You can throw a pretzel and you can hurt someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Cannon showed up clutching several large water bottles, only to be told 
that he must remove all the caps before he was allowed in the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand this -- my friends came to the last game and they told 
them they could take in bottles," said Cannon, a chief executive officer of a 
sales promotion agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Purple-bereted security guard Donnell Warren, 27, explained that water 
bottles, too, could be used as a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you throw the water bottles with caps, it could have water and really hurt 
people. We take anything that could be used as a weapon," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports fans can buy water bottles -- with the caps -- inside the stadium, 
Warren said. But they were prohibited from bringing them inside. "I don't make 
the rules, I just enforce them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Merchandise at the souvenir stands moves as fast as a punctured soccer ball, 
vendors say. Most fans come to gawk at the prices. A sweat shirt with Mexico 
emblazoned across the chest costs $165. A lightweight jacket with leather 
sleeves is $575. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want $60 for a long-sleeve T-shirt? $575 for a jacket?" said Erica 
Cohen, 33, her eyes turning into large green saucers. "I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, a Westchester resident, had shelled out $40 for her ticket six months 
ago. She would have been tempted by an inexpensive trinket, something that 
would later remind her of the famous game but nothing seemed to fall into that 
category. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a business," she sighed. "but still everybody should be able to buy a 
little piece of the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors, who declined to give their names, said that they had been told that 
they would sell about $25,000 in merchandise each day. Instead, some said they 
were selling less than half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, soccer fans demanded two items: sunglasses and blond wigs to 
resemble the frizzy, Phyllis Diller-like hair of a popular Colombian player, 
Carlos Valderrama. But most declined to fork over $99 for the official World 
Cup sunglasses. And none of the vendors carried any wigs.

MUSEUM TO SELL DA VINCI WORK; ART: THE 72-PAGE ILLUSTRATED SCIENTIFIC NOTEBOOK 
MAY BRING AS MUCH AS $10 MILLION TO ITS OWNER, THE UCLA/ARMAND HAMMER MUSEUM OF 
ART. ACTION IS REPORTEDLY BEING TAKEN AS A HEDGE AGAINST A LOOMING LAWSUIT. 
</P>

<P>
 The UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center plans to sell one of 
its most valuable assets, an illustrated scientific manuscript by Italian 
Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci. 
</P>
<P>
 Surpassed in value only by the art museum's "Hospital at St.-Remy" by Vincent 
van Gogh, the Leonardo notebook is expected to sell for as much as $10 million, 
according Christie's, the New York auction house that will sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 The 72-page work was handwritten by the artist-scientist and includes 360 
drawings and diagrams; it had been generally known as the Codex Leicester but 
was dubbed the Codex Hammer in 1980 when the late oil tycoon purchased it from 
the heirs of the first Earl of Leicester for a record $5.6 million. It will be 
offered for sale Nov. 11 in an auction to be announced today at Christie's Park 
Avenue offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is being sold as a hedge against a potentially devastating lawsuit, 
according to the June issue of the monthly Art Newspaper. The story quotes 
UCLA/Hammer Museum Director Henry Hopkins as saying the Codex is among works in 
the Hammer collection being held in escrow as a guarantee against any financial 
obligation that might result from a lawsuit filed in 1990 on behalf of Joan 
Weiss, the niece and sole heir to the fortune of Hammer's wife, Frances, who 
died in 1989. Reached on Wednesday, Hopkins did not deny the report but 
declined to comment further on how the money would be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss is claiming half interest in Hammer's art collection and in all other 
property acquired by Hammer during the couple's 33-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer parlayed Occidental Petroleum Corp. into the nation's seventh-largest 
oil company with the help of loans from his wife, who was the widow of a 
wealthy Chicago businessman. Frances Hammer signed several documents stating 
that she had no interest in the artworks, but the Weiss suit alleges that 
Hammer and his attorneys deceived Frances Hammer about her ownership rights and 
deprived her of her fair share of community property. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is scheduled to go to court July 11, according to Arthur Groman, 
Hammer's longtime friend and attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the sale, a Christie's press release says "The Armand Hammer 
Museum's former board of directors made the decision to sell the Codex Hammer 
in order to honor legal agreements between the Hammer Museum and UCLA as a 
result of their recent merger."  
</P>
<P>
 The museum specializes in art, including Hammer's collections and special 
exhibitions. The Leonardo manuscript was selected for sale because it is more 
significant as a scientific document than as a work of art, according to 
Hopkins. "While the Codex Hammer is an exceedingly important and rare document, 
the sale of this manuscript would least impact the core aesthetic identity of 
the Armand Hammer collections," Hopkins said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 31, the university assumed management of the 3-year-old museum, which 
was conceived by Hammer, the late chairman of Occidental and financed by the 
company. The operating agreement stipulates that works in the collection may be 
placed in escrow and sold to establish a reserve fund to pay legal costs, 
discharge financial obligations and fund cash flow deficits from the bond 
portfolio. It also specifically states that the Codex may be sold or encumbered 
at any time.

DDT IN YARDS BLAMED ON NEARBY PLANT; ENVIRONMENT: THE EPA ORDERS THE OPERATORS 
OF THE LONG-CLOSED CHEMICAL FACTORY IN TORRANCE TO DISPOSE OF THE CONTAMINATED 
SOIL. THE FIRM QUESTIONS THE DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 DDT found in two back yards near Torrance this spring appears to have 
originated from a nearby chemical factory that once was a major producer of the 
pesticide and is now a federal Superfund site, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has ordered Montrose Chemical Corp. of California, 
operators of the long-closed DDT manufacturing plant, to arrange for disposal 
of hundreds of tons of DDT-laced soil excavated from the yards, at an estimated 
cost of $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe we now have enough proof to say this was Montrose's and then force 
them to clean it up," said EPA official John Blevins, speaking to reporters 
behind two homes where a federal cleanup project uncovered DDT chunks the size 
of bowling balls. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency issued an administrative order late Tuesday requiring Montrose to 
dispose of 67 bins -- or more than 1,000 tons -- of tainted soil. That soil, 
now stored in Long Beach, must be incinerated. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney representing Montrose disagreed with the EPA's assertion that a 
link has been found, saying it appears to be based on circumstantial evidence. 
Montrose had earlier declined to pay for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 However, "their new information is enough for us to take a look at it again," 
said Karl Lytz of the law firm Latham & Watkins. He said he expects to confer 
with federal officials about the order. 
</P>
<P>
 The DDT discovery has prompted the temporary relocation of 30 neighborhood 
families to hotels at federal expense, and Blevins said it is possible that 
Montrose could eventually be held responsible for those costs as well as the 
expense of excavating the back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't made any decisions yet," said Blevins, an EPA section chief 
overseeing the Montrose site. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials once expressed pessimism that they would ever pinpoint the 
source of the DDT. Their accounting of how the new evidence was assembled 
offers a glimpse of how the agency employs chemical tests in hopes of tracking 
producers of industrial waste. 
</P>
<P>
 A key breakthrough came, officials said, with the detection of a second 
chemical in the back-yard soil, a telltale substance called BHC, or 
beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, that is a byproduct in the making of the pesticide 
lindane. Stauffer Chemical Co. operated a lindane production plant at the 
Montrose site in the late 1950s and early 1960s, according to the EPA order. 
</P>
<P>
 Another apparent link was the discovery that white crystalline material dug 
from the yards was 96% DDT. Such high-potency material is what is referred to 
as "technical" or industrial-grade DDT, say EPA officials, who add that 
Montrose was the only company in California manufacturing technical-grade DDT. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Wednesday that they still have not firmly established how the 
DDT traveled from Montrose to the back yards. But that investigation is 
continuing, and the agency hopes to "close that loop" within the next few 
weeks, said John Lyons, assistant counsel at the EPA regional office in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose produced DDT from 1947 to 1982 at its factory on Normandie Avenue in 
the Harbor Gateway area of Los Angeles, about three-tenths of a mile from the 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 When the once-popular pesticide was banned for most U.S. uses in 1972, the 
company's fortunes sank and the factory closed in 1982. The paved-over 13-acre 
site is now on the federal Superfund list of the nation's 1,200 most hazardous 
toxic waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Many neighbors had paid little heed to Montrose until last winter, when tests 
discerned mysteriously high levels of DDT in the two yards north of West 204th 
Street in an unincorporated Los Angeles County area near the intersection of 
the Harbor and San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal cleanup begun in April intensified when workers found buried white 
chunks measuring about 760,000 parts per million of DDT -- drastically higher 
than the 100 parts per million level that the EPA considers safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents who have complained of nausea, dizziness and other ailments 
began suspecting that the cause could be the DDT or other chemicals from 
another nearby toxic waste site. 
</P>
<P>
 They grew more fearful when the EPA determined that the back-yard DDT is mixed 
with fill that could extend farther east along West 204th Street. The agency 
has promised to study whether some families should be moved permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Two key factors in that decision could be how far the DDT-tainted soil extends 
and the cost of cleanup. To date, the EPA has spent more than $500,000 to clean 
up DDT in only two back yards. Meanwhile, the 30 families are expected to 
remain in hotels and other temporary housing for several months until the 
federal investigation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA will discuss the DDT cleanup and other neighborhood concerns at a 
public meeting at 6 tonight at Van Deene Elementary School, 826 Javelin St., 
near Vermont Avenue.

RAIDERS AGREE TO COLISEUM PACT, OFFICIALS REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Two members of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission said Wednesday 
that the Raiders have agreed to play in the Coliseum this fall under a one-year 
contract that would allow time to make plans for building luxury boxes and 
improving Exposition Park in later years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand an agreement has been reached, and we will move forward on a 
state-of-the-art stadium," said County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, a longtime 
member of the commission.  
</P>
<P>
 A second commissioner, who asked not to be identified, also said an agreement 
has been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the commission president, Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, chairwoman of the 
County Board of Supervisors, said that although she is "very optimistic," no 
agreement has yet been formally signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan said Burke should get the credit for working 
out a deal to keep the Raiders; he declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Final negotiations were under way Wednesday night, and a definitive 
announcement was expected as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oakland -- which has been negotiating for a one-year return of the Raiders 
if earthquake repairs at the Coliseum are not finished by September -- Alameda 
County Supervisor Don Perata said Wednesday that he had been informed that the 
managing general partner of the Raiders, Al Davis, would hold a news conference 
today to announce that the team is staying in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Perata said he had been told that Davis would reserve the right to 
move on after the year is up if no progress has been made on upgrading the 
Coliseum and improving its surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders did not return telephone calls Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said that the offer approved by the commission Tuesday would put the 
Raiders' Coliseum rent this year into a special fund to finance parking and 
other work on Exposition Park, as well as the luxury boxes the team has long 
wanted.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; $25,000 
REWARDS OFFERED IN VENICE-AREA KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has posted $25,000 rewards for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of suspects in each of three gang-related 
killings in the Venice area. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Jan. 1 and June 6, nine such killings took place in Mar Vista and 
Venice's Oakwood neighborhood.Los Angeles police have solved six cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "These murders have caused an otherwise peaceful and beautiful community to 
live in fear of walking the streets or allowing children to play outside," 
Venice-area Councilwoman Ruth Galanter stated in her motion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department ties the killings to the Westside's 
bloodiest gang war in a decade. The 10-month-long conflict involves black and 
Latino gangs in Venice and Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Galanter, police need help in apprehending the suspects in the 
fatal shootings of Paul Medina on Feb. 14, Manuel Hernandez on April 10 and 
Harold McDaniel on April 24.  
</P>
<P>
 Medina's body was discovered in his van parked in an Oakwood alley. He had 
been shot in the head. Hernandez was shot at the Mar Vista housing project 
outside his apartment in the early morning. Two weeks later, McDaniel was 
killed in his car on Lincoln Boulevard.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
PANEL OKS SWEEPS OF QUAKE 'GHOST TOWNS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to eliminate dangerous earthquake ghost towns, a Los Angeles City 
Council committee this week authorized police sweeps of vacant quake-damaged 
buildings, to be followed by boarding up and patrolling by private security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The get-tough strategy would begin with a blitz by city building inspectors to 
identify which buildings are public safety hazards.The approach was developed 
by a task force of city department heads, who have identified 13 neighborhoods 
in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and the Mid-City areas where clusters of 
vacant buildings have become havens for squatters, vandals, scavengers and drug 
users. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of the so-called ghost towns, each with about 10 vacant 
apartment buildings or condominium projects, have left neighboring homeowners 
and merchants fearful that blight and crime will spread -- and in some cases is 
spreading -- to adjacent communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vandals are coming into our units even though they are boarded up," Pam 
Nelson, one of 20 townhouse owners at the El Dorado Townhomes in Sylmar, told 
the committee. She said only eight owners are willing to rebuild their units 
there. "We're stuck and we need security and we can't afford security." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force has about $240 million in local and federal emergency funds. It 
has outlined a 120-day schedule for clearing out, securing and demolishing 
buildings in the ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the costs of sealing up the buildings might be passed on to property 
owners, particularly if federal money is not secured. But to encourage 
reconstruction where possible, funds also would be set aside for rebuilding 
loans to those who cannot secure loans elsewhere.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWYERS REPORT GAY BIAS 
AT FIRMS IN L.A. COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Employment bias against gay and lesbian lawyers is widespread in Los Angeles 
County, with nearly 40% of attorneys reporting that they have seen or 
experienced such discrimination "in a professional setting," according to a 
county Bar Assn. report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Discrimination based on sexual orientation turns up at every stage of 
employment, including recruitment and hiring, work environments, assignments, 
promotions, salaries and benefits, the 50-page report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Bar Assn. surveys of law firms and agencies that hire attorneys, the 
report is the first comprehensive study of how bias against gays and lesbians 
affects the legal profession in the county, Bar officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state law and rules governing conduct by attorneys prohibit job 
discrimination based on sexual orientation, more than half the lawyers said 
they believe that their work environment is less hospitable to gay attorneys 
than to heterosexual attorneys, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roughly one in seven attorneys reported that his or her employer engaged in 
some form of anti-gay discrimination in the recruitment and hiring of 
attorneys," the report said, adding that "reports of frank and open anti-gay 
hostility -- sometimes reported by the discriminating attorneys themselves -- 
were common." 
</P>
<P>
 County Bar Assn. President Gerald Chaleff said the bias described in the 
report, "ranging from open hostility toward lesbian and gay attorneys to simple 
insensitivity toward them, reflects conditions in society generally. As a 
result, the study provides valuable insights for everyone in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The report said there appears to be a glass ceiling for homosexual attorneys. 
Among lawyers with less than 10 years experience, heterosexuals are almost 
three times more likely than homosexuals to be partners in a law firm, the 
surveys found. 
</P>
<P>
 And among lawyers with more than 10 years experience, 41% of the heterosexuals 
earn more than $125,000 a year, but only 27% of the gay and lesbian attorneys 
with the same experience earn that much, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 In large part, the bias directed toward gay attorneys "is rooted in 
ignorance," the report said, adding: "It appears never to occur to many 
heterosexual attorneys that a job applicant, subordinate, colleague or other 
attorney could be gay or have gay relatives and friends."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: REPORTER ORDERED TO 
HAND OVER TAPES LINKED TO MENENDEZ CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking to see if old interviews will unearth new clues in the Menendez murder 
case, prosecutors have taken the unusual step of ordering a free-lance writer 
to bring various audiotapes to a court hearing Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rand, who is writing a book on the case, was served this week with a 
subpoena directing him to produce any interviews he taped with Lyle or Erik 
Menendez, the Beverly Hills brothers charged with murder in the Aug. 20, 1989, 
shotgun slayings of their wealthy parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The subpoena also orders Rand to turn over interviews he taped with Donovan 
Goodreau, a friend of the brothers who testified at their first trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Rand said he has only one taped interview with either of the brothers. It was 
with Erik Menendez in 1989. He said he has two taped interviews with Goodreau, 
from 1990 and 1992. All three tapes, Rand said, were made while he was working 
on magazine articles or his book on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 It is uncommon for prosecutors to go to court to seek a journalist's source 
material. "He says he has evidence relevant to this case," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
David P. Conn, lead prosecutor in the Menendez case, said Thursday of Rand. "We 
want him to identify the exact nature of the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Rand's attorney, Anthony Glassman, said the writer would claim the protection 
of the California shield law, which gives a journalist the right to keep 
material from authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The subpoena adds one more item to a laundry list of issues Van Nuys Superior 
Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg is due to decide Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge had been scheduled to fix the date for the Menendez brothers' 
retrial, to rule whether the brothers would be tried together or apart, to pick 
between one jury or two if they are tried together and, finally, to decide 
whether the retrial will be held in Van Nuys or another county courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle and Erik Menendez remain in County Jail held without bail. Their first 
trial ended in January when separate juries deadlocked trying to decide between 
murder and manslaughter charges. ALAN ABRAHAMSON

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; VOTING 
EXTENDED ON CITY'S CONTRACT OFFER TO POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles police union extended voting on the city's contract offer 
until Friday in an effort to increase officer participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballots will be available during the day Friday at the Police Protective 
League headquarters at 600 E. 8th Street for officers who were not able to 
attend the 11 ratification sessions scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday and 
today.So far, roughly a third of the 7,000 LAPD officers have cast ballots, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the voting will be announced by the union Monday. The City 
Council is scheduled to consider the $50-million contract offer next Wednesday. 
The deal -- worked out behind the scenes by Mayor Richard Riordan, Councilman 
Richard Alatorre and others -- calls for a 7% pay raise over the next 18 
months, a 2% bonus for patrol officers and $1,500 in cash payments for all 
officers.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
$550,000 SETTLEMENT URGED IN RADIATION OVERDOSE DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County officials have recommended a $550,000 settlement in a wrongful death 
lawsuit brought by the family of a 25-year-old cancer patient who died of an 
overdose of radiation used in treating her. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Cabrera, the mother of two children, was diagnosed in the spring of 
1987 as having a treatable form of Hodgkin's disease.Doctors chose to attack 
the cancer with radiation therapy, and Cabrera underwent a number of treatments 
at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center through March, 1988.  
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, she began showing a number of serious side effects. Within a year 
after the treatments ended, she was paralyzed from the waist down. Further 
complications developed through 1992. By 1993, she had adult respiratory 
distress syndrome, which led to her death on May 11, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 It was later determined that the complications were the result of overdoses of 
radiation, according to an analysis by the county Claims Board. The machine 
that beamed the radiation at her cancer cells was closer to her body than the 
doctor ordered, and the higher doses of radiation eventually caused her spinal 
cord to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors must approve the settlement amount.

YWCA VOWS NOT TO GIVE UP HOT LINE RECORDS; COUNSELING: THE AGENCY CITES THE 
SIMPSON CASE IN REFUSING TO SURRENDER CONFIDENTIAL MATERIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With the O.J. Simpson case focusing new attention on domestic violence, 
national leaders of the YWCA on Wednesday denounced Massachusetts court rulings 
that they contend could destroy the effectiveness of counseling hot lines for 
battered women and rape victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The YWCA officials, in Los Angeles for their national convention, pledged to 
defy court orders that a Massachusetts Y hot line surrender confidential 
records of counseling sessions with the alleged victim in a rape case. That 
YWCA is being fined $500 a day for its refusal to hand over the files, with the 
fines now totaling $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The YWCA of the U.S.A. will not be intimidated by threats from a legal system 
that does not honor or respect the tragedy of violence that befalls thousands 
of women and girls every year. And certainly we know that was a part of the 
history, the tragic history, of the life of Nicole Brown Simpson," YWCA 
national President Ann Stallard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallard was referring to the relatively light sentence that O.J. Simpson 
received in 1989 for beating his then-wife. He received no jail time and was 
allowed to undergo counseling over the telephone. He is now charged with 
killing her and a friend of hers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the YWCA, the nation's oldest women's organization, said 
confidentiality is crucial if counselors are to help abused women emotionally 
heal and to give them courage to bring criminal charges against attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a question of protecting women's privacy and upholding their civil 
rights," YWCA national Executive Director Prema Mathai-Davis said at a news 
conference at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 In Massachusetts, a defense attorney in a Springfield, Mass., rape trial said 
state law allows a judge to scrutinize confidential material in private and 
then decide which portions, if any, can be used as evidence. The public 
defender, Andrew Klyman, stressed that his office was "not trying to 
intimidate, embarrass or harass, or anything in that nature. We are doing this 
so that we represent our client to the best of our abilities within the limits 
of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Klyman, who heads the public defender's office in Springfield, said it was 
ridiculous for the YWCA to link the Simpson murder case to the controversy over 
the files he wants as possible proof of his client's innocence. "Of course, 
domestic violence is a very important issue. I'm not denigrating that at all. 
But this is mixing apples and oranges." 
</P>
<P>
 In an emergency motion, the YWCA of Western Massachusetts on Wednesday asked a 
judge on that state's Supreme Judicial Court to eliminate the fines and to 
overturn the lower court's order for the hot line records. But Justice John 
Greaney denied the Y's request, according to its attorney, Wendy Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the fines mount daily as the YWCA faces a lengthy wait for a full 
appeals hearing. National YWCA leaders are expected to announce a strategy 
today to possibly raise funds for the fines. 
</P>
<P>
 California law generally grants therapists and properly trained rape hot line 
counselors confidentiality when their clients are accusers in a sex assault 
case. But experts explained Wednesday that such confidentiality is not 
guaranteed, and that California judges can decide that the accused's need for 
evidence outweighs damage to the victim's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 But such breaches of confidentiality are rare, experts said. "That's a real 
high hurdle to clear," Steve Schwendimann, an official in the state Office of 
Criminal Justice Planning's domestic violence and sexual assault section, said 
of protections for secrecy. As in Massachusetts, a California judge must first 
review files in private and release only relevant portions. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Giggans, executive director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults 
Against Women, agreed that California courts almost always uphold 
confidentiality of hot line and counseling sessions. But she said the rules on 
evidence "make you feel vulnerable if you get some judge or defense attorney 
who really pushes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Massachusetts case, Luis Figueroa, 18, is charged with the rape of a 
24-year-woman in Springfield last December. Figueroa claims that he had a prior 
relationship with the woman, but she denies that. The public defender's office 
asked a local judge to review the hot line records to help determine the 
woman's credibility.

ROYAL VISIT GIVES SHOW OF RESPECT; COMMUNITIES: TOURS REFLECT THE STRIDES LOS 
ANGELES IMMIGRANTS HAVE MADE IN BUILDING CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS. MANY SEE IT AS 
A COMING-OF-AGE PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Japanese Emperor Hirohito visited here in 1975, he dined with 500 
notables at the Music Center, but he did not travel down 1st Street to visit 
Little Tokyo. This week, however, his son, Akihito, has gone out of his way to 
pay his respects to the Japanese American community. 
</P>
<P>
 Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko have called on the many institutions the 
community has built in the two decades since Hirohito visited -- a massive 
cultural center and theater complex, a nationally prominent history museum, and 
a retirement home complete with an elaborate Japanese garden. 
</P>
<P>
 At each stop, they have expressed understanding of the hardships and 
appreciation of the achievements of immigrants from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Japanese Americans say they consider this visit a kind of coming-of-age 
party for a community that has struggled for more than a century for acceptance 
in America -- and for respect from Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a stamp of approval . . . a total acceptance and recognition of 
what we've achieved up to now," said Bruce Kaji, a real estate developer and 
founding president of the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo. 
"It's a tremendous opportunity for Japanese to see what Japanese Americans have 
had to suffer, how we've overcome and how we've succeeded."  
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Americans say they have often felt that Japanese nationals looked 
down on them for their peasant origins and for their relative ignorance of 
Japanese culture. They watched their mom-and-pop stores squeezed out of Little 
Tokyo by big Japanese corporations.  
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, they have learned to work with Japanese companies to 
raise money for community institutions. And the success of Japanese Americans 
in mainstream American institutions, from universities to law firms to 
Congress, has helped gain the respect of Japanese nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit of the royal couple to the community before departing Wednesday for 
San Francisco meant different things to different generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety-two-year-old Fujie Goto, who grew up in Hawaii and worked as a maid and 
laundress much of her life, was moved to tears when she shook the hands of the 
royal couple at her retirement home in Boyle Heights. "Aren't they sweet? . . . 
To think that people like that can talk so nice to you," Goto said. 
</P>
<P>
 But most young Japanese Americans have little interest in Japan and simply 
consider the emperor and empress foreign dignitaries, said Michael Okamura, a 
fourth-generation Californian. Nonetheless, Okamura, a 32-year-old banker, said 
he appreciated the chance to meet them at the history museum: "It was great to 
have that connection again after so many generations." 
</P>
<P>
 At the museum, the emperor and empress viewed the wicker baskets in which 
emigrants from Japan packed their clothes at the turn of the century. They saw 
the bullwhips and short-handled hoes that marked the harsh lives of the 
plantation workers, and photos of "picture brides" sent to meet husbands in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 They viewed a model of the U.S. internment camp at Manzanar where thousands of 
Japanese Americans were incarcerated without due process during World War II, 
and the computers with which families can look up the internment history of 
their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 They lingered at each exhibit, seeming reluctant to be led away by their 
guide. Afterward, they talked with museum trustees, including Francis Sogi, a 
partner with the law firm Kelley Drye & Warren, and with Henry Ota, a lawyer 
and partner in Pillsbury Madison & Sutro. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For first- and second-generation Japanese Americans, most of them older than 
the emperor, his visit brought back memories of the values of their parents. 
Asked about those values, some issei and nisei began murmuring in Japanese the 
Imperial Rescript on Education -- a list of moral imperatives issued by 
Akihito's grandfather, Emperor Meiji, in 1890 and memorized by Japanese 
children on both sides of the Pacific for decades afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 To Americans, this pledge of allegiance to Confucian values -- and the emperor 
-- was seen as a prescription for emperor worship and imperialist fanaticism, 
and it was abolished by the occupying forces after Japan's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 But to older Japanese Americans, most of its exhortations seem exemplary: Be 
dutiful to your parents, true to your friends, study hard, cultivate the arts 
and work for the public good. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost that," said Yoshiko Sakurai, 76, a second-generation Japanese 
American. "Countries don't have moral education anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Hitoshi Sameshima, 73, said the visit of the emperor has reminded him that it 
was only recently that he has come to understand what his parents were trying 
to teach him about the essential Japanese values of gaman, giri and on -- 
perseverance, duty and obligation.  
</P>
<P>
 The younger generation seems to have rejected these values in favor of 
outspoken demands for their rights, he said. It all came home to him recently 
when his daughter was pulled over by police while he was riding with her in her 
car. To his amazement, she argued with the police officer, refused to sign the 
ticket, and later fought the citation in court -- successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, oh my God, in my generation you'd sign the ticket right away," 
Sameshima said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it is a good thing the younger generation is more assertive, but he is 
still a bit nostalgic for some of the old values. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our parents brought all that over and tried to instill it in us," he said. 
"But as the generations move on it fades away."

LONG BEACH RECOUNT TAKES COUNCIL SEAT FROM LATINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recount in the Long Beach City Council election has given an apparent loser, 
Mike Donelon, a one-vote victory over one of the first two Latino candidates 
ever chosen for the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonia Reyes Uranga was ahead by seven votes entering the recount. But after 
the city clerk's office counted the ballots by hand, Donelon was ahead, 2,932 
to 2,931. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in shock, floored really," said Donelon, a contractor. "Never in our 
wildest dreams did we expect to turn the election around." 
</P>
<P>
 If Uranga's lead had held, she would have joined Jenny Oropeza as the first 
Latinos elected to the nine-member council. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the people who say 'My vote doesn't count,' well, this shoots that theory 
all to hell," Donelon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal said some uncounted ballots were found stuck to 
the bottom of the box for the last precinct opened Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga, a community activist and former president of the Long Beach Children's 
Museum, was not available for comment. However, earlier this week she called 
Donelon's request for a recount reasonable. "It's close enough to where I would 
probably want to if I were in his shoes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Clerk Bill Joder said the new results are scheduled to be 
certified Tuesday by the City Council. Under election rules, he said, Uranga 
cannot ask the city for another tally but could pursue legal action to have a 
judge double-check questionable ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 After the council certified the election last week, declaring Uranga the 
victor by a margin of 2,926 to 2,919, Donelon asked for a recount by hand. The 
votes originally were tallied by machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelon said at the time he was not optimistic about the outcome, but his 
supporters urged him to seek a recount. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga and Donelon were vying for the 7th District council seat vacated by 
Councilman Ray Grabinski to run for mayor. The district covers areas of central 
and west Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski lost to Beverly O'Neill, former president of Long Beach City 
College, in the campaign for mayor.

L.A. SCHOOLS SEEK TO USE $30 MILLION FOR QUAKE REPAIRS; EDUCATION: THE MONEY 
WAS EARMARKED FOR FIVE SPECIAL HIGH SCHOOLS, BUT OFFICIALS TELL THE STATE THEY 
FACE A CRISIS. THE DISTRICT MUST ACT BY JUNE 30. 
</P>

<P>
 In an effort to break what they see as a stalemate between the state and 
federal governments, Los Angeles Unified School District officials are asking 
the state to shift $30 million earmarked for five special high schools to 
fixing earthquake-damaged campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 If the request is granted, money for the five new academy schools could be 
replaced only by passage of a school construction bond measure in November. 
District officials said, however, that they were not yet prepared to submit 
plans for the academy schools and that the $30 million could help spur the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency into funding quake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although these programs are very valuable and innovative and great for kids, 
they're down the road apiece and here we are with a crisis," said Bill Rivera, 
the district's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems sensible to use the $30 million to unclog the pipeline to repair the 
buildings and classrooms that are sitting here unusable. We are willing to take 
a gamble that we will get the money back when we are closer to completion on 
these projects." 
</P>
<P>
 The $30 million would be used to pay the state's share of the district's 
earthquake repairs, which could top $300 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials deny that repair projects are being stalled. They say that 
release of the $30 million will not affect the speed with which money or 
projects are approved for the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're mutually exclusive," said Morrie Goodman, the FEMA spokesman 
in Washington. "The $30 million just has nothing to do with the release of 
(federal) money." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials say they were led to believe that their big-ticket 
repair projects were not being approved because FEMA was still negotiating with 
the state over how to split earthquake costs. FEMA is paying 90% of the repair 
costs, and discussions are under way over how much the state and local agencies 
will have to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate at the state level was made more contentious by the failure of a 
bond measure earlier this month that would have allocated money for both school 
construction and earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The district faces a June 30 deadline for using the $30 million. After that 
date, the money will revert to the State Allocation Board, which will probably 
decide whether it can be used for earthquake repairs at a meeting July 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Career Development Partnership Academy Project, which was highly 
touted by the district when proposed, was designed for students interested in 
careers in medicine and science, business and entertainment. The schools, to be 
located Downtown and in Van Nuys, Hollywood, Compton and Southeast Los Angeles, 
are designed as partnerships involving the district, city, state and private 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Van Nuys Medical Academy, for example, would work and take courses 
at Valley Presbyterian Hospital, which is next to property that the district 
owns. 
</P>
<P>
 Dom Shambra, the district's director of planning and development who oversees 
the academy projects, said that he could not get the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency to commit to two of the academy projects and that the 
earthquake stalled the district's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little more difficult to put together than we expected," Shambra 
said. "It was moving along, but because of circumstances we couldn't control . 
. . an earthquake . . . it was a matter of choice. Do we keep a program and 
fight to hold onto the money or do we use the money for earthquake repairs?" 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials acknowledged that they are gambling on the money being 
replaced by the passage of a bond measure in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Shambra said he had intended to ask the State Allocation Board for a 
three-month extension for the academy schools but then decided that the 
earthquake repairs took priority. "We just thought we needed to jump-start the 
FEMA projects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson, who made the request for the $30-million reallocation in a 
letter to Wright, also sent a letter to FEMA Director James Witt explaining the 
rationale for the shift in state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should my funding request to the state be approved -- and I see no reason why 
it can't since it is our money -- I would hope that in the next few days FEMA 
would be able to announce approval of a number of major school reconstruction 
projects," Thompson said in his letter. "People don't see anything happening to 
repair of buildings. Damaged structures remain standing, stark reminders of the 
tragedy, surrounded by chain-link fences and yellow tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Similar scenes in school after school underscore the lack of action," 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has received about $70 million from FEMA and has spent $17 
million on building repairs, safety and structural inspections and the 
replacement of lost or damaged textbooks, supplies and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 About 160 campuses suffered damage in the Jan. 17 earthquake. Many had fallen 
ceiling tiles and cracked walls, and an entire Granada Hills elementary school 
was rendered unusable.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; DEFECTS IN SOCIAL SERVICE PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A case in Orange County that has come to symbolize the darkest horrors of 
homeless children has ended in the conviction of a couple on child-neglect 
charges in the death of their infant son. The 4-month-old was bitten 110 times 
by a starving pet rat and was found dead last August in a station wagon in 
which the family lived. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deadlocked on the question of involuntary manslaughter, but the 
child-neglect conviction means that the parents face up to six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal responsibility aside, this case is a sickening reminder of the all 
too common danger of homeless youngsters falling through the cracks of the 
social service system. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony revealed that the parents were well aware of the pet rat's history 
of biting people and yet left it alone in the station wagon with the infant. 
There was other testimony about spoiled food left inside the vehicle, as well 
as soiled clothing, dirty diapers and remains of gnats, flies and roaches. 
</P>
<P>
 So concerned were those who knew the family that Orange County social service 
workers were asked to investigate repeatedly and each time decided there was 
insufficient evidence that the child was in danger. Shortly before the baby's 
death, the grandparents reported the problems, but social service workers, 
authorities said later, were unable to find the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Without hanging responsibility for this tragedy on anyone in the system, we 
nevertheless must wonder about the big picture, whether the holes in the county 
safety net simply are too big. There is something terribly wrong in this 
picture. Despite the best efforts of those who were alarmed by the conditions 
under which the homeless family lived, there still apparently was no way to 
intervene effectively and prevent a terrible result. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, infants in desperate need of removal from perilous conditions 
must get help sooner. If such families carry on without the help they need, it 
is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the system really isn't working for 
those who most need its protection.

SUPER-GAUDY 'SUPERSTAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A quarter of a century after its bow as a recorded "rock opera" and 23 years 
after its Broadway debut, Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Jesus Christ Superstar" has 
become a coat of many colors, particularly in this touring anniversary 
production at the Orange County Performing Arts Center through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber was 20 when he wrote the score, and it remains the freshest and most 
original of his works; it shows the composer flexing his youthful musical 
muscles. And it has the inventive, anachronistic and satirical lyrics of Tim 
Rice, with whom Webber never should have split. Without Rice, he has become the 
Barry Manilow of theater music writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Centered on the last seven days in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, the libretto 
is simplistic -- not a rock opera in the true sense, as was "Hair," but more a 
rock oratorio with tableaux. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's how this flashy, gaudy production is presented. The songs are 
belted mostly face out to the audience in a staging framed by an overabundant 
light show. Garbed in eclectic, colorful costumes, the cast is kept jumping in 
director Tony Christopher's athletic, creative contemporary choreography. All 
of it nearly overpowers the piece itself. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an odd feeling that one has seen something like this before, the 
biblical legend swathed in erotic imagery, as though Cecil B. DeMille had lived 
to direct music videos with his obligatory hint of semi-nudity, overflowing 
belle poitrines , glistening muscle and massive movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Christopher, DeMille might have put his Roman guards in Stonewall 
leather, his Soul Sisters in diaphanous drapery to lure Judas, and he would 
have chuckled as he ordered King Herod to moon the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the unfortunate moment with Jesus and the disciples at the table, 
shifting for a brief second into the positions of Da Vinci's "Last Supper." 
Just like the Laguna Pageant of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 The moments that work best are when the light show is on least, when the stage 
is bare and the focus is on performance. During those unpretentious vignettes, 
the excitement of vibrant vocal performance takes over: Ted Neeley's 
often-electric Jesus singing "Gethsemane," Carl Anderson's tortured Judas doing 
"Damned for All Time" (Neeley and Anderson are veterans of both the Broadway 
and film productions) and Syreeta Wright, of Stevie Wonder fame, innocent and 
pure as Mary Magdalene regretting "I Don't Know How to Love Him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 James O'Neill is a powerful and empathetic Pontius Pilate, very touching when 
beseeching Jesus in "Trial Before Pilate," and there's a vocal Mutt and Jeff 
quality to Danny Zolli's squeaky Annas and David Bedella's basso Caiaphas that 
defines their ludicrous pomposity. Coming from the heavy-footed Laurent Giroux, 
the giddy high camp of "King Herod's Song" is less giddy than usual, but the 
rest of the supporting cast is in step with the MTV-flavored staging.

MIKE DOWNEY: WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; THEY TOLD US -- WE DIDN'T 
LISTEN

<P>
 I suppose Alexi Lalas of the United States of America said it best, when he 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 "AYYYYYYYYYY!" 
</P>
<P>
 Which is U.S.-ese for: "Who says we can't play this game?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bogus team 2, Bogota team 1! 
</P>
<P>
 South America, take that away. Pardon my jingoism, but what happened Wednesday 
at the Rose Bowl was the sporting equivalent of cave people discovering fire. 
Colombia, the up-and-comer of the subcontinent, the team that Pele called the 
"best in South America," the team that Bolivia's coach called "the best team in 
the world," was conquered in a game of soccer by . . . us ??? 
</P>
<P>
 Lead-footed, dead-headed, soccer-backward us? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, us. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great day for U.S. soccer," said the first man to encounter Lalas after the 
game.  
</P>
<P>
 Whereupon Alexi screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 A primeval scream. An all-out, eee-aaa, from-the-diaphragm, "One Million Years 
B.C.," "2001: A Space Odyssey," this-is-how-the-world-begins kind of scream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, that feels good!" Lalas said. "That feels good!" 
</P>
<P>
 Moments before, the orange-goateed, dust-mop-tressed, 25-year-old, rock-group 
guitarist could be seen prancing across the Pasadena pasture wearing an 
American flag as a cowl. Nearby was his teammate, ponytailed Tony Meola, keeper 
of the goal, who had thwarted practically everything the increasingly desperate 
Colombians kicked in his direction. Meola was dragging a flag behind him the 
way Superman drags a cape.  
</P>
<P>
 Three cheers for the red, white and blue.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Sorber, American midfielder: "People said it couldn't be done, and we did 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Caligiuri, American defender: "We united soccer in the United States. We 
made people believe in us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Stewart, American forward: "This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I almost 
started crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the stolid little Air Force brat Stewart was at that particular 
moment truthfully speaking of the goal he scored -- the game-breaker, as things 
turned out -- his words were suitable for the entire occasion. For this was a 
triumph of considerable consequence in American sport, a real eye-opener that 
would have a "permanent impact" on the Republic's standing in the world's most 
popular pastime, to use U.S. soccer federation bigwig Alan Rothenberg's 
description.  
</P>
<P>
 Lalas had a few of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible. It's historical. I think we were the only ones who thought 
it was possible," Lalas said. "We knew that we had to stifle them, frustrate 
them, then look for the counterattack, which is basically what happened. It's 
an indescribable feeling to be a part of such a historical day.  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess this proves it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any country can beat any country." 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, this is really, really, really bad news down Colombia way, where there 
is no joy in Bogotaville tonight. The Colombians are 0-2 and hanging on by 
their toenails. Their overnight stardom and growing reputation as soccer's Team 
of Tomorrow has been summarily trashed. The same players who recently went 28 
games without a defeat now are laboring for a coach so exasperated that he says 
Colombia couldn't have done any worse "if we had tried on purpose." Ay, caramba 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Could this be the same team that gave Argentina a 5-0 drubbing only a few 
months ago? The same players to whom Colombia's president, Cesar Gaviria, 
personally presented the country's highest civilian medal of honor, the Boyaca 
Cross? The same bunch that had elevated so many expectations in Colombia that 
the coach, Francisco Maturana, shook his head before the tournament and said, 
loosely translated: "We're screwed. Now we've got to be champions of the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 They won't be. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia couldn't even compete with the United States, except maybe for the 
prize for worst haircuts. Everything turned out so cockeyed that they even 
started knocking the ball into the other team's net. By the time Maturana was 
asked whether he considered substituting for Carlos Valderrama, the guy with 
the tumbleweed on his head, the coach more or less said, no, what he really 
needed was a substitute for everybody carrying a Colombian passport.  
</P>
<P>
 He too felt like screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Different kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any country can beat any country." The new battle cry of World Cup '94.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; THE DAY U.S. SOCCER GREW UP; AMERICANS 
STUN COLOMBIA, 2-1, FACE 2ND ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 No one thought they could do it. Few believed they would have even been there, 
on the same field with one of the best soccer teams in world, had the team not 
qualified automatically as World Cup host. If they were going to win, few would 
have guessed they could have done it this emphatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. soccer team is used to it, waiting at the back of the line and 
hearing the laughter from the front waft back. Always waiting, ever promising 
and frequently embarrassed, the earnest American men who represent their 
soccer-speck of a country had barnstormed a skeptical world predicting 
something would happen, something they all would see. 
</P>
<P>
 And something did happen Wednesday, something so improbable and so unexpected 
that even the hysterically screaming fans bobbing up and down in the Rose Bowl 
stands checked and rechecked the scoreboard to make sure the numbers didn't go 
away: U.S. 2, Colombia 1, and take that everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have struggled for years and today we showed we can play with any team in 
the world," midfielder John Harkes said. "We knew we could do it, we could see 
it in their eyes after we scored the first goal." 
</P>
<P>
 That first goal came in the 35th minute on an own goal by Colombian defender 
Andres Escobar. Forward Ernie Stewart, the forgotten man in the 1-1 tie with 
Switzerland, scored the eventual game-winner in the 52nd minute when he took a 
chip shot from midfielder Tab Ramos and tapped the ball into a unguarded net. 
</P>
<P>
 Long after all the flag-bedecked celebrations on the field and sweaty embraces 
in the locker room, the U.S. players began to assess what they had done. The 
win, coupled with the tie in last Saturday's opening game, gives the United 
States four points and a strong likelihood of advancing past the first round 
for the first time since being invited to take part in the inaugural World Cup 
in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an indescribable feeling to be part of such an historic day," exulted 
U.S. defender Alexi Lalas, his orange mane and long goatee drenched in sweat. 
"It's incredible, it's historical, it's very cool." 
</P>
<P>
 After being laughed out of the 1990 World Cup with the derisive label of 
"college boys," the American team came into this tournament with all the 
scrutiny traditionally leveled on hosts. Their tentative point earned in the 
first game did not lead many to project a victory against Colombia, a team 
experts considered to be one of the strongest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 That made the U.S. team's dominance of the South Americans all the more 
remarkable. It was the United States, not Colombia, that held the ball at 
midfield and exploited defensive mistakes. It was the U.S. defense that shut 
down a clutch of the world's most dangerous forwards. And it was U.S. players 
who performed with confidence while Colombia, under incredible pressure at 
home, found its players reduced to bickering and pouting. 
</P>
<P>
 The only change Coach Bora Milutinovic made at the start of the game was to 
replace right back Cle Kooiman with veteran Fernando Clavijo. The seldom-used 
Clavijo was inserted for his speed but also for his knowledge of the South 
American style; Clavijo was born in Uruguay and, next to Milutinovic, is the 
most knowledgeable about the tendencies of the Colombians. 
</P>
<P>
 While the U.S. defense quashed the Colombian attack -- which stubbornly probed 
the middle of the field and repeatedly ran into Lalas, Marcelo Balboa and 
Thomas Dooley -- the U.S. offense found itself flying freely into the attacking 
third of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team created scores of dangerous chances in the opening minutes with 
wingers Ramos and Harkes free to support the forwards, Stewart and Eric 
Wynalda. Wynalda let go with a sharp left-footed shot from an impossible angle 
that went just wide of the goal to launch the scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. defense had only moments before fended off Colombia's best chance of 
the first half. Herman Gaviria's shot hit the chest of Mike Sorber and bounced 
off the post. It rebounded to Anthony de Avila, whose shot bounced off Sorber 
again and was cleared by Clavijo. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 35th minute, Sorber launched the U.S. scoring run. Sorber pushed the 
ball to Harkes who raced up the left side and veered in toward the goal. He 
spotted Stewart crashing in on his right. So did Colombian goalkeeper Oscar 
Cordoba, who moved to his left to cover Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar slid in to knock the ball away and inadvertently kicked it into his 
own net. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. took that lead into the locker room at halftime, where, on a 
chalkboard, Milutinovic had written the Latin dictum, "Carpe Diem," seize the 
day. With unexpected poise and confidence the players came out in the second 
half and continued to press and work hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian Coach Francisco Maturana had seen enough and took out star forwards 
Faustino Asprilla and da Avila. Carlos Valderrama -- the heart of the team -- 
was ineffective and spent most of his time complaining to the referee or to his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia finally scored, on a goal by Adolfo Valencia in the 90th minute, but 
it was not enough and it didn't stop the U.S. players, so maligned and so 
underestimated, from skipping about the field with American flags draped around 
their shoulder like shawls against the oncoming night. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted to keep going, they didn't want to leave the field that had 
brought them such joy. And they wanted the world to see they had done it, that 
they had seized the day.

JIM MURRAY: JACKIE'S PRIORITIES OF THE HIGHEST ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jackie Robinson's name stands for the flag, brotherhood, equality, democracy, 
tolerance, Americanism -- everything good about America.  
</P>
<P>
 That's because he symbolizes the righting of an ancient wrong. Quicker than 
you could say Jack Robinson, Jim Crow was gone from our national sport.  
</P>
<P>
 It seems hard to believe now but for more than half a century, black men were 
barred from participating in a game and a country that should have been as 
democratic as the Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, it wasn't written anywhere. It was just observed everywhere. It was the 
worst kind of law: the unwritten law. The written kind you can deal with. You 
challenge it, change it. The unwritten law is as hard to lay a glove on as a 
feather in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not only baseball's shame, it was the nation's. Some other sports had 
few blacks. But other sports got their recruits out of college. Baseball 
didn't. There had been black athletes in college football -- Fritz Pollard, 
Brice Taylor, to name a couple of the more famous. And, in fact, Jackie 
Robinson himself. Robinson not only played college football, at UCLA, but pro 
football, with the L.A. Wolves.  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the Wolves were minor league football. But still pro football. And 
in those days, Jackie Robinson couldn't play in any league in organized 
baseball, not even the Sally. And baseball didn't have the excuse that it 
needed its raw material from college. It was the rare big league ballplayer who 
had been to college. The scouts didn't want him there.  
</P>
<P>
 The so-called color line was held in place by silent acquiescence, not only by 
a whole sport but a whole country. It didn't need bravery to break it, it just 
needed a conscience. It was removed by the stroke of a pen, not armed 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 It was quite obvious that Branch Rickey didn't pick Robinson solely for his 
athletic prowess, he picked him for his brains as well. Baseball may very well 
have been Robinson's third-best sport. But that was good enough. Because Jackie 
Robinson might have been the best American athlete ever.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackie was no Joan of Arc, Uncle Tom or martyr to the cause. He didn't swallow 
his pride, only his temper. He knew he was surrogate for a whole movement. He 
knew the way to respect was at the plate and in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 He excelled. He led the league in hitting his third year. He led it in stolen 
bases. He made the Brooklyn Dodgers instant champions. He was a born winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics don't begin to summarize his worth to a team. He led the 
Dodgers to the World Series six times in the 10 years he played for them. 
Robinson was never an "I went two for four, too bad about the team" guy. He saw 
to it the team had a good night too.  
</P>
<P>
 The public loved him. He played the kind of daring, exciting, take-a-chance 
baseball that hadn't been seen in a long time. The game had been given over to 
the three-run homer, a stand-around-and-wait-for-the-big-inning bore. 
</P>
<P>
 He was perfect for the role history had set for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his ability to hit the curveball, get the jump on the pitcher, turn 
the double play or turn somebody's triple into an out, Robinson had one other 
thing going for him -- Rachel.  
</P>
<P>
 The marriage of Jackie and Rachel Robinson was not only a love story, it was a 
lesson in commitment. From their meeting at UCLA in the '40s to the day death 
separated them, the Robinsons were Jackie's second team and the goal was 
equality. Jackie never compromised in his demands -- and neither did Mrs. 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jackie died, of the complications of diabetes -- too young at 52 -- in 
1972, Rachel Robinson, in her grief, knew that the country had lost more than 
an ex-ballplayer. It had lost a leader. Jackie needed more years to complete 
his work.  
</P>
<P>
 So Rachel Robinson decided to give them to him. She formed the Jackie Robinson 
Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to carrying on the work of her 
late husband in bringing his fellow African-Americans into the American 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie was never one to just sit and complain," says his widow, who has never 
remarried. "He went out and did something about it. He was as impatient with 
his own people for shirking responsibilities as he was with the power structure 
for not giving them any." 
</P>
<P>
 He fought for opportunities, not advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 His career had become a rallying point for the liberal establishment. Before 
Robinson showed what could be done, no one had considered integrating lunch 
counters, drinking fountains and the front of buses. Robinson provided not only 
a new frontier, he pioneered it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie was always a team player," Rachel Robinson was recalling the other 
day. "He showed up early for games, he made studies of pitchers. He was always 
available for interviews because he considered it an important part of the 
game. He signed autographs. He preached education because he knew it was more 
than a diploma on the wall, it was a key to a better life." 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Jackie knew that in order to steal second -- in order to score -- 
first you had to get to first base. He tried to assist as many youngsters as 
possible to get to first. By going to college. He induced his own company, 
Chock Full o' Nuts coffee, to contribute and later cued in other corporate 
sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
 His foundation does the same thing today. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to think baseball would have been integrated sooner or later. Bigotry 
could not have held America hostage forever. But Robinson's contributions were 
crucial. If he had failed, on or off the field, the change might have been 
infinitely delayed, increasing the national shame. 
</P>
<P>
 It grieves Rachel Robinson that there are players today with no knowledge of 
the role played by her husband in making the good life available to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie wouldn't care about that. His only goal was winning, not getting 
credit. And the Jackie Robinson Foundation is winning. More than 500 minority 
scholars have been sent through college to date -- 124 this year. The program 
has a 92% graduation rate. And that's graduation in engineering, economics, 
chemistry, nursing, neural sciences and business administration, not advanced 
shotputting. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 18, at the Riviera Country Club, the first Jackie Robinson 
Invitational Golf Classic and awards dinner will be held. It will be chaired by 
Lod Cook, and Billy Casper will play a hole with each foursome. The money 
collected will be used to finance scholarships at 52 colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Jackie Robinson is trying to help the home team. Only this time it's 
not the Dodgers, it's the U.S. of A. Jackie would want it to finish first again 
in the real world series.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; IN SHOCK VALUE, 
THIS ONE RANKS NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Disbelief, astonishment and incredulity. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the reactions the United States' remarkable victory over Colombia 
will generate around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 It's always that way with World Cup upsets, and this one has to rank as the 
most significant. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened at the Rose Bowl on Wednesday in front of 93,194 fans is without 
question the most important upset in the 64-year history of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Some will argue that another U.S. victory, the 1950 defeat of England in Belo 
Horizonte, Brazil, was bigger. Not so. It was a fine achievement but it did 
nothing to further the sport in the United States and no one outside the soccer 
community knew about it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next morning's Times, for example, the match report consisted of one 
37-word paragraph. Consider that and then look at the coverage in this 
morning's newspaper. Case closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are those who will insist North Korea's 1-0 victory over Italy in 
the 1966 tournament in England deserves top billing. Pak Doo Ik's memorable 
goal made his name a popular soccer trivia question answer, but North Korea has 
hardly become an international soccer fixture, so that upset can only rank 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 In its early years, the World Cup was far less popular. Travel was difficult 
and expensive and only the teams that could afford to enter or that considered 
themselves likely to win took part. 
</P>
<P>
 That limited the chance of major upsets, but some did occur. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1938, for instance, Cuba came to the World Cup in France as a substitute 
for Mexico, which had withdrawn, and tied Romania, 3-3, in Toulouse and then 
went one better by winning the replay, 2-1. It lost its next game, 8-0, to 
Sweden and has never qualified since. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the tournament upsets, however, have occurred in the past dozen years 
since the field was expanded from 16 teams to 24 in 1982 to allow the emerging 
soccer nations of Africa and Asia berths. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, there was a memorable upset in the 1974 World Cup in West 
Germany. Because of political changes, the game is impossible to repeat, but 
East Germany's 1-0 victory over West Germany, the eventual champion, goes into 
the record books as an upset. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening game of the 1982 World Cup in Spain provided an early shock when 
Belgium scored a 1-0 victory over defending champion Argentina, which featured 
Mario Kempes, the top goal-scorer of the 1978 tournament, and Diego Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not the biggest surprise of the tournament, however. That occurred in 
Gijon, where Algeria stunned West Germany, the reigning European champion, 2-1. 
The Germans were the 3-to-1 favorites to win the tournament while the 
Algerians, playing in their first World Cup game, were 1,000-to-1 outsiders. 
The upset ranks fourth in terms of magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't believe it," said Jupp Derwall, West Germany's coach. "It's 
beyond my understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, the 1986 tournament brought a surprise result when Morocco 
defeated Portugal, 3-1, in Guadalajara, although the game had little meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy in 1990, Argentina again had the dubious pleasure of coming in as 
defending champion only to be upset in the opening game. This time, Cameroon 
did the honors, scoring a 1-0 victory in Milan on a goal by Francois 
Omam-Biyick. 
</P>
<P>
 The Africans scored two more upsets, beating Romania, 2-1, and Colombia, 2-1, 
before falling to England in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two more upsets in Italia '90 that tie directly to Wednesday's game 
at the Rose Bowl. Costa Rica beat Scotland, 1-0, and Sweden, 2-1, both in 
Genoa. Costa Rica's coach was Bora Milutinovic, the "miracle worker" who has 
proved once again that his nickname is deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 One footnote: After the United States' 1-0 triumph over England in 1950, the 
team's coach, Bill Jeffrey, had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all we wanted to do. This is all that is needed to make the game go in 
the States." 
</P>
<P>
 He was wrong, then. But today the same statement might be true. Greatest

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; IT WAS A TIME WHEN WORDS WEREN'T NEEDED; 
REACTION: THE DEAFENING SOUND OF SILENCE SUMS UP THE DEVASTATION FELT IN 
SOCCER-CRAZED COLOMBIA.

<P>
 Perhaps it was the silence that was most telling. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned, mouths ajar, arms crossed and slumped in chairs, Colombians watched 
in utter disbelief as their national team, their team of hopes and heroes, lost 
to the United States, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the World Cup upset, they didn't even bother to shout at their 
television sets. They just stared. 
</P>
<P>
 "All our dreams came tumbling down," said Margarita Saenz, 33, who was 
watching the game with friends in a home in Bogota's colonial La Candelaria 
neighborhood. "It's as if we didn't have the right to even one fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 Colombians had anticipated Wednesday's match at the Rose Bowl with full 
confidence, convinced they would win and knowing they had to. To understand how 
hard the fall was, one must understand how important the sport is in this 
soccer-crazy country. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup eclipsed Colombia's presidential election last weekend, which 
received a fraction of the coverage and attention given soccer. The winning 
candidate used Carlos Valderrama in his television advertising. In the middle 
of a huge political scandal rocking Colombia's government this week, President 
Cesar Gaviria took off for Los Angeles to see his team. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses and stores rearranged their schedules to accommodate the matches. 
Taxi drivers stopped working to tune in to live broadcasts of every game -- not 
just Colombia's performances. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed as though Colombians were investing their national well-being and 
their aspirations for the future in the World Cup. This was one event that a 
country usually forced to deal with brutal drug wars and the world's highest 
homicide rate could celebrate and relish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had all our hopes on the team," said Iliana Pineros, a shopkeeper. "The 
defeat is a national trauma." She was watching the game with her 8-year-old 
nephew, Michel, who was dressed in a miniature team jersey with Adolfo 
Valencia's No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's loss, which virtually eliminates Colombia from the tournament, was 
especially painful because expectations had been so high. And because 
Colombians, never in a million years, expected to lose to "the gringos." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had been Argentina or Brazil or Italy, that would have been one thing," 
said Alfonso Barrios, a security guard who handles the bomb-sniffing dogs 
stationed outside shopping malls and hotels in the Zona Rosa. "The United 
States is a team without history, without resonance. We all knew we were going 
to win this one." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Candelaria, a picturesque neighborhood of pitched cobblestone roads and 
red-tile roofs, a group of friends gathered in a courtyard of a private home to 
watch the game. Like Colombians everywhere, they were aware that the only 
option was to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team has to win," a member of the group, Carlos Rios, said before play 
started. "If they don't, they won't be able to come back. They'll have to look 
for work in a factory over there (in Los Angeles)." 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian television reported that the family of team member Gabriel Jaime 
Gomez was threatened with death if he played. He was consequently benched, and 
some fans here said they thought the threats might have unsettled the whole 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian government earlier in the week banned the sale and public 
consumption of alcohol and prohibited citizens from carrying guns before, 
during and after all of Colombia's matches. The measure was aimed at cutting 
down on murders and traffic deaths that routinely occur after Colombia's games 
-- especially after the victories. 
</P>
<P>
 For a couple of hours after Wednesday's loss, Bogota remained enveloped in its 
shocked silence. But as midnight approached -- and the dry laws lifted -- the 
streets of Zona Rosa and other parts of Bogota's well-to-do northern 
neighborhoods filled with noisy celebrants wrapped in the Colombian flag and 
wearing the ever-present Valderrama wigs. They pushed through the streets in 
caravans, car horns and radios blaring, as though they actually had something 
to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "1998!" they shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 Times special correspondent Steven Ambrus in Bogota contributed to this story.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; COLOMBIA FALLS OFF PERCH; GROUP A: AFTER 
DEATH THREAT SIDELINES GOMEZ, POOR PLAY TURNS FAVORITE'S SHOWING INTO A 
"DISASTER." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "This country has suffered a lot. Soccer helps relieve the pain."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Colombian Coach Francisco Maturana, on the eve of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain for Maturana and his players began before Wednesday's collapse of the 
pre-tournament favorites in a shocking 2-1 loss to the United States. Modern 
technology delivered the unsettling news -- via fax machine -- to the Colombian 
team hotel in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a death threat. It was a warning that the Colombian home of midfielder 
Gabriel Jamie Gomez would be blown up. Because of the threat, Gomez, a starter 
against Romania on Saturday, didn't play against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Colombian television stations reported that Maturana thought about 
resigning or did resign for about 10 minutes before FIFA officials talked him 
into staying. "No, not at all. That's totally untrue," Maturana said at a 
postgame news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup '94 chairman Alan Rothenberg said he was unaware of the threats. 
Rose Bowl venue press officer Sue Carpenter said there was no increase in 
security for the United States-Colombia game, which had already been assigned 
mid-level security status. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout the game, there were two and sometimes three uniformed 
policemen in the area between the crowd and the plexiglass shield behind 
Colombia's bench. There was security by the U.S. bench, of course, but there 
were no police behind the plexiglass shield until the final few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly there was adequate reason for concern. The murder rate in Colombia 
is about eight times higher than the United States and kidnaping and death 
threats are a concern for the famous and wealthy. Last year, kidnapers snatched 
the 4-year-old son of defender Luis Herrera but were captured and the boy was 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very hard to say who is making these threats," Gomez told a Colombian 
television network. "I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez, 34, might have watched his final World Cup game from the bench since it 
is unclear whether he will play against Switzerland on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be the end of my career," he said. "It's very painful what has 
happened to me. To be left off the team because of a death threat is something 
very sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Maturana looked sad rather than angry, almost bewildered by the 
turn of events. He simply couldn't understand how his team failed to perform 
even in an adequate manner despite the on-going controversy.  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it's very clear our participation has been a disaster," Maturana 
said. "This is not what people expected of us. We want people to know we're not 
happy. We have let everybody down. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was the burden of being the favorites. I don't think we could have 
tried, even on purpose, to play as bad as we played." 
</P>
<P>
 After a sluggish first half, Maturana resorted to a drastic measure, making 
two substitutions. One of the players put on the bench was star forward 
Faustino Asprilla. He dodged a question about the lackluster performance by 
midfielder Carlos Valderrama, the team captain. But Maturana made it clear he 
was pleased with no one.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lamentably, we can only make two substitutions," Maturana said. "The ideal 
substitution would have been to make 11 substitutions." 
</P>
<P>
 He will coach on Saturday against Switzerland at Pontiac, Mich. Then the tough 
part is ahead for Maturana and his players -- returning home to Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one here can ever understand the kind of pressure they're under at home," 
U.S. assistant coach Steve Sampson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Which is why Maturana and his players almost dreaded the high expectations 
created after a 5-0 victory over Argentina in September. 
</P>
<P>
 This cautious mind set became clear recently when Maturana said: "I never ask 
for my check until I am finished with my meal."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; IT'S A DAY FOR DEFENSE, A DAY FOR DESTINY; 
GROUP A: WHETHER BY IMPULSE OR DESIGN, CLAVIJO PLAYS, KOOIMAN SITS AND 
COLOMBIA'S ASPRILLA IS NEUTRALIZED IN 2-1 U.S. VICTORY.

<P>
 When these moments of wonder occur, when the World Cup is shaken by an event 
it either can't explain or can't understand, a higher being is usually assigned 
all the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 So in 1986, we have the Hand of God -- Diego Maradona's smirking rationale for 
the goal he scored by balling up his fist and punching the ball, illegally, but 
without penalty, past the English goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, thanks to two American goals scored against Colombia on Wednesday, 
one of them scored by a Colombian, we have the Act of God. 
</P>
<P>
 That had to be the reason for the United States' 2-1 victory over must-win, 
can't-lose Colombia, right? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Bowl witnessed a miracle on this day, didn't it, Alexi Lalas? 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the referee blew the final whistle, Lalas stopped 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "A miracle?" Lalas roared, fixing his eyes on the offending questioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell no. A miracle is a baby surviving a plane crash or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hallway amid the pushing, shoving media in what is known ever so 
politely as "the mixed zone," teammate Cle Kooiman saw things somewhat 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Kooiman, usually a starting outside defender for the United States, had been 
benched by Coach Bora Milutinovic in favor of Fernando Clavijo, 37, who was 
assigned to mark the fleetest feet on the Colombian roster, the ones belonging 
to goal machine Faustino Asprilla. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, it made no sense. 
</P>
<P>
 There goes crazy Bora again, acting on one of those wild, impulsive, 
don't-ask-why whims of his. 
</P>
<P>
 So Clavijo, with occasional double-team help from Lalas, frustrated Asprilla 
so thoroughly that Colombia Coach Francisco Maturana pulled him at halftime. 
And Clavijo saved the day by clearing out a loose ball during a dangerous 
first-half flurry around the American net. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bora called it," Kooiman said, shaking his head in amazement. "The man's a 
miracle worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew exactly what to do. I don't start, he puts Fernando in there because 
he's very quick. He did everything he could to put the best team out on the 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 From the U.S. bench, Kooiman watched one of the greatest upsets in the history 
of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 What was he going to do in the aftermath? 
</P>
<P>
 Complain? 
</P>
<P>
 "Fernando came in and did a great job," Kooiman said. "It was Bora's call, and 
if he can keep doing it, more power to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a team guy. Today, I'm just happy to be here, to be on the team. I sat on 
the bench, but right now, I feel like I played an entire game. I got chills out 
there. Near the end, I felt like crying." 
</P>
<P>
 For the maligned American back line, this was vindication and validation of 
the grandest order. The pregame consensus held that there was no way for the 
U.S. defense to stop the Asprilla Express and Carlos Valderrama. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas was too slow. Kooiman was too jittery. Paul Caligiuri was too small. 
</P>
<P>
 Clavijo, who hadn't played in months, was too old, too rusty. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this defensive unit has held Switzerland and Colombia to two goals in 180 
World Cup minutes. Wednesday, it was seconds away from a shutout, Adolfo 
Valencia breaking through in the 90th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 A miracle? 
</P>
<P>
 "No one understands Latin American football better than Bora," U.S. assistant 
coach Steve Sampson said. "He knows about the pride of the Colombians, how they 
always play within their system, even if they're down, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "You saw it today. They never kicked a long ball and tried to run under it. 
They kept the ball in the center of the field, moving it downfield with five-, 
10-yard passes." 
</P>
<P>
 And that played right into the Americans' defensive strengths, such as they 
are. So they dropped six, seven and sometimes eight defenders, clogged the 
middle and watched in amazement as Colombian heads began to hang as attack 
after attack was blunted. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Americans were startled to see Maturana remove Asprilla for the 
second half, but not the American closest to Asprilla in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't do anything," Clavijo said. "He should be ashamed of himself. Not 
only didn't he play well, he didn't even try."

<P>
 A miracle? Maybe many, many years from now, by the time Lalas gets through 
with twisting the tale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be 80," Lalas said, "and some punk reporter will come up to me and say, 
'Hey, didn't you play in that great game back in '94?' 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'll say, 'Sure, kid' and I'll embellish everything. I'll tell him I 
dribbled through half the team and won the game by myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas laughed. No need to get defensive now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," he said, "it'll probably sound a whole lot better 100 years from now."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; IT'S A ROMANIAN HOLIDAY FOR SWITZERLAND; 
GROUP A: SWISS CELEBRATE A 4-1 VICTORY, THEIR FIRST CUP TRIUMPH IN 40 YEARS.

 What Hex? What Hagi? What heat? 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday afternoon, Switzerland overcame all obstacles as it blew Romania's 
cover and the lid off the Silverdome, scoring three second-half goals en route 
to a 4-1 victory before 61,428. 
</P>
<P>
 The win sent angst-ridden Swiss fans screaming into the streets of Pontiac and 
Zurich, this time not having to wave their red flags in surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland, with its back against the Matterhorn in Group A, dominated play 
after intermission to secure its first World Cup victory since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 That triumph, exactly 40 years ago today, was a 4-1 victory over Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking its share of criticism at home in the wake of its 1-1 tie with 
the United States, Switzerland came out kicking against Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half was hard fought, a dead-heat. A 1-1 tie. The second half was 
all Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
 The deciding goal came in the 53rd minute, after Alain Sutter's corner kick 
from the right side disappeared into a maze of players in front of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Television replays revealed the ball then struck the hand of a Swiss player, 
an infraction, but the play went unnoticed by the referee. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball was slapped forward into an open space to the left of goal, allowing 
striker Stephane Chapuisat to sneak a sliding shot to the right of Romanian 
goalkeeper, Bogdan Stelea. 
</P>
<P>
 What controversy the hand ball might have caused in a close contest proved 
moot in the 66th minute, when Swiss midfielder Ciriaco Sforza took off on a 
brilliant, open-field run down the right sideline. He then split two defenders 
with a pass to himself, and crossed the ball left to a streaking Adrian Knup, 
who easily converted for a goal to make it 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 For good measure, the Swiss added another gift goal in the 72nd minute. 
Georges Bregy was credited with a grazing header, though it appeared a Romanian 
might actually have touched the ball last. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swiss used the remainder of the game to take curtain calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutter, who scored Switzerland's first goal, asked that he and his flowing 
golden locks be removed from the game. Wish granted, he limped gallantly out of 
the stadium on a sore ankle, slapping hands with fans along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happy for the Swiss people," Switzerland Coach Roy Hodgson, an 
Englishman, said. "After a 40-year wait, they have a chance to celebrate a 
Swiss victory in the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgson now fears expectations will soar. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an old Swedish saying, that no tree grows to heaven," Hodgson said. 
"But that's not true in the sports worlds. In the sporting world, trees are 
expected to grow to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, the branches of Tree Switzerland stretched skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 With one first-round game remaining, against Columbia, Hodgson believes his 
team's chances for advancement are secured. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he disagreed with those who criticized his first-game tactic of 
employing only one striker, the Swiss returned to a two-forward attack with 
Chapuisat and Knup, with obvious results. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the Romanians? They were tournament darlings after upsetting 
Colombia in their opener but turned ugly under the dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania was hit with three yellow cards for hard fouls, and another player, 
Ion Vladoiu, was ejected with a second-half red card for his cleating of Swiss 
midfielder Christophe Ohrel. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, it was the Romanians who cried foul, complaining about World Cup 
scheduling and weather conditions. By most accounts, the heat and humidity in 
no way approached the sauna conditions that existed last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Romania wilted like, well, warm romaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Gheorghe Hagi, the team's star playmaker, gave it his all . . . for a half. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored his team's lone goal in the 36th minute but was largely a non-factor 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played well in the first half," Hagi said. "But in the second half, because 
of a lack of oxygen, my body could not keep up. My legs were cramping up. 
Everybody that plays here will face this." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland included. 
</P>
<P>
 Anghel Iordanescu, the Romanian coach, complained his team was at a jet-lag 
disadvantage, having played its opener in Los Angeles, while Switzerland played 
its first two games at the same venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he was going to make lineup changes for Romania's upcoming game 
against the United States, Iordanescu worked in a not-so-subtle dig. "We'll 
have to turn our watches back three hours, go back to L.A., then take into 
consideration the health of my players," he said. "Then I will make my final 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 It might well be.

1994 LOS ANGELES TIMES; ALL-VENTURA BASEBALL TEAM; PLAYER & PITCHER OF THE 
YEAR; FOR WINNERS ONLY; RAY CLINTON: NEWBURY PARK HIGH SENIOR WAS TOUGH TO BEAT 
-- EVEN WHEN HE WASN'T AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME. 
</P>

<P>
 Two games symbolize Newbury Park High right-hander Ray Clinton this season. 
One in which he was in total command. One in which he was constantly in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 But both were Panther victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, The Times' Ventura County pitcher of the year, downed Camarillo, 5-1, 
with a masterful two-hitter March 25. The other game was a no-decision against 
Simi Valley on April 29. It was a game that Newbury Park needed to win if it 
was to hang on for the Marmonte League title. Clinton allowed seven runs in the 
first three innings, but he escaped jams the rest of the eight innings he 
pitched, giving his teammates a chance to win, which they did in the 10th, 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't pretty from a pitching standpoint," Newbury Park Coach Gary 
Fabricius said, "but both he and (Simi Valley starter Kary) Kozlowski were in 
and out of trouble the whole time. It showed what kind of competitors they 
were." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's 10 victories were the most in the county and a Newbury Park record. 
He finished 10-3 with a 1.41 earned-run average. During one stretch early in 
the year, Clinton seemed to find a way to win even when he wasn't the starting 
pitcher. He entered a game against Channel Islands with the score tied and 
earned a victory.  
</P>
<P>
 And in two other games he was called on to protect leads for Keith Smith, but 
he blew them and collected the victories himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Posting the school record for wins was among the goals Clinton set during the 
off-season. He realized he must lower his ERA from last year's 4.60 to do so.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton (6-foot-1, 165 pounds) set another goal for the team: a Southern 
Section title. The team came up short, though, losing in the second round of 
the Division I playoffs. But Clinton won his only playoff start, a four-hit 
shutout against Hoover in the first round. 1st-Team All-Stars Invited to Times' 
Awards Ceremony

 Players selected to the All-Valley and All-Ventura County baseball and 
softball teams are invited to a Times' awards brunch Sunday at 9 a.m. at the 
Warner Center Marriott in Woodland Hills. The guest speaker is Rich Hill, 
baseball coach at University of San Francisco who formerly coached at Cal 
Lutheran.

1994 LOS ANGELES TIMES; ALL-VENTURA BASEBALL TEAM; COACH OF THE YEAR; TURNABOUT 
IS THE RIO MESA WAY; RICH DURAN: HE GUIDED SPARTANS IN VAULT FROM WORST TO 
FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You wouldn't think Rio Mesa High Coach Richard Duran could be rattled by one 
last-place finish. This, after all, is a guy who has been around. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran, The Times' 1994 Ventura County coach of the year, played seven years of 
professional baseball, including two in Mexico and one in Japan, before coming 
back to coach at his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning, Duran has led the Spartans to five league titles in eight 
seasons. But the low point of Duran's coaching career was a last-place finish 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran quickly made amends, leading the Spartans to a Channel League title and 
into the Southern Section Division II semifinals. Rio Mesa finished 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Consistency is Duran's trademark, which makes it all the more understandable 
why a last-place finish would be intolerable. But Duran is not the type to fume 
at his players over their failures in 1993. He realized the team was young, and 
building toward a promising 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Coach Ted Robison, who has been by Duran's side all eight years at 
Rio Mesa, said Duran's professional experience is one of the reasons he 
operates with such a steady hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very consistent," Robison said. "Every year, whether we finish first or 
last, he's consistent in his approach to coaching and his approach to the 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Duran, 36, played at Cal Lutheran after graduating from Rio Mesa and was 
signed by the Milwaukee Brewers after they scouted him at the National Baseball 
Congress championships in Wichita, Kan., in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 A first baseman, Duran played four seasons in the Brewer organization, but his 
career stalled at triple-A. It seems Duran was stuck behind Cecil Cooper, a 
five-time all-star with the Brewers, so he signed with the Ciudad Juarez 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciudad Juarez won the Mexican League World Series in 1982, and Duran won the 
Mexican League batting title with a .377 average in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my greatest experience in baseball," Duran said of playing in Mexico. 
"I thoroughly enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1984, Duran was "ready to experience something new," he said, so he 
signed with the Kintetsu Buffaloes in Japan. Duran returned from Japan after 
the death of his father, and brought a broader appreciation for baseball with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think baseball is basically the same wherever you go," he said. "I just 
think there are different emphases. Here in the States, the emphases are power 
and speed. In Japan, they emphasize the fundamentals. They are tremendous 
bunters and fielders, maybe not making the great Ken Griffey play, but always 
making the routine play and taking tremendous pride in that." 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning to Rio Mesa, Duran has sent several players on to college or 
professional careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are Seattle Mariners' pitcher Bobby Ayala, Dmitri Young (a 
first-round pick of the St Louis Cardinals), Cardinal minor-league pitcher 
Derron Spiller and Mike Mitchell, a UCLA first baseman who signed this month 
with the New York Yankees. 1st-Team All-Stars Invited to Times' Awards Ceremony

1994 LOS ANGELES TIMES; ALL-VENTURA SOFTBALL TEAM; COACH OF THE YEAR; SHE 
STRAIGHTENED OUT THE CURVES; SUZANNE MANLET: ADVERSITY ONLY SPICED A SEASON TO 
REMEMBER.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Life threw more than a few curves at Simi Valley High softball Coach Suzanne 
Manlet this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Manlet, the consummate competitor and The Times' Ventura County coach of 
the year, handled each one with the same style and determination that has made 
her a winner for 14 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the Pioneers didn't repeat as Southern Section Division I champions. In 
fact, they didn't even make it past the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But what a memorable season. Because of the January earthquake, players were 
forced to take classes at a rival high school for two months and endure a month 
of 8 a.m. practices in the winter chill. Manlet struggled to keep the state's 
top-ranked Pioneers focused despite player injuries, her father's 
life-threatening illness and her own life-saving surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unfortunate that all those things happened," Manlet said. "(But a 
record of) 24-3 I'm very happy with. The kids had a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake was the first disaster to test the Pioneers. Some buildings at 
Simi Valley High were damaged in the shaker and students were forced to attend 
classes at nearby Royal during repairs. Simi Valley students attended from 
12:15 p.m. until 4:50 p.m, which necessitated early morning practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries also hounded the Pioneers. Starters Sara Griffin, Tracy Hansen, 
Jessica Cunningham and Lisa DeStefano each missed at least one game because of 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half of the season, Manlet's father was hospitalized for a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 While Al Manlet's life hung in the balance, his daughter visited him daily, 
never missing a practice or a game -- until March 24, the day she herself was 
forced to undergo surgery to remove a cancerous growth. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the day Simi Valley was competing in the second round of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Without their leader the Pioneers were defeated by Lompoc, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I let them down," Manlet said. "And they felt like they let me 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Manlet has returned home and Suzanne Manlet says she is feeling fine. In a 
difficult season, most players came to realize that sometimes things don't work 
out the way you want -- and, at the same time, they do.

1994 LOS ANGELES TIMES; ALL-VENTURA SOFTBALL TEAM; PLAYER & PITCHER OF THE 
YEAR; MARMONTE MARVELS; KRISTI FOX: ONLY SARA GRIFFIN PITCHED BETTER THAN 
SOPHOMORE WHO EMERGED FROM NEWBURY PARK BENCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 From where Newbury Park High's Kristi Fox sat at the beginning of the year, 
postseason accolades were the furthest thing from her mind. She was, after all, 
sitting on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as the Panthers endured a slow start and a coaching change six games into 
the season, Fox finally earned a starting position. And by year's end, she was 
the go-to girl who helped the Panthers finish second in the Marmonte League at 
10-4 and 21-8 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only a sophomore, Fox, the Times' Ventura County player of the year, 
was an unlikely reserve. In 1992, she had pitched the the Newbury Park Bobby 
Sox all stars to a national title. Certainly, this Panther needed to be on the 
prowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Once she was given the chance, she quickly proved herself and became the 
team's most productive player, according to Coach Mike Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan had replaced Wally Thornhill, who resigned six games into the season 
amid speculation that disgruntled parents forced him out. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a real easy kid to work with," Morgan said. "She's got a real strong 
work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fox lost her first two starts against Simi Valley and Camarillo, she 
rebounded to win 10 of her next 11 and finish 10-4 with a 0.47 earned-run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, who uses a mix of drops, changes and curves, threw six one-hitters, 
struck out 118 in 105 1/3 innings and allowed only 33 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 She also played four games at third base, two at first, one in right field and 
one in left. Although she would like to pitch exclusively, she is happy just to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always have more fun when I get to play," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox led the team with a .346 batting average with three doubles, six runs 
batted in and eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, 16, probably could play any position for any team in the county. But it's 
her dominating drop ball that distinguishes her from the rest of the pack in 
the fiercely competitive Marmonte League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to pitch all the games, but if it means playing only half the time, 
I'd rather play a position," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox shared pitching starts with senior Carolina Bernal, but pitched every 
inning of the Panthers' three playoff games. Fox threw a no-hitter, her second 
of the year, and struck out five against Righetti in the first round and 
recorded her ninth shutout of the season with a four-hitter in a 2-0 victory 
over Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 Uneasy about accepting praise, Fox credits her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe a lot to my catcher and my infield because I throw a lot of drops and 
there's a lot of ground balls," she said. "So, I don't think the stats show 
everything." 1st-Team All-Stars Invited to Times' Awards Ceremony

DORETTI ENDS HIS BANNER CAREER AT LOS ALAMITOS; PREPS: RETIRING ATHLETIC

 Pride filled Frank Doretti recently as he stood near half court and surveyed 
the numerous championship banners adorning the gym walls at Los Alamitos High. 
</P>
<P>
 They are different in size, shape and color, yet represent a central theme: 
success. And at the core of all these accomplishments is Doretti, the Griffins' 
longtime, seemingly tireless athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 The affable, silver-haired Doretti has been the hub of Los Alamitos athletics 
for more than 25 years -- or almost before there was anything at the school 
worth mentioning. Considering this, some might mistake that wide smile Doretti 
often flashes as gratuitous boasting. 
</P>
<P>
 His expression, however, means otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the appearance of a person content; pleased with the accomplishments of 
a career spent developing young people and proud to have had the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Many display the look, Doretti is among the few deserving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank's name is synonymous with Los Alamitos athletics," said football Coach 
John Barnes, who will succeed Doretti in the fall. "When certain guys have been 
around long enough and done enough good things like him, you always remember 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 After 34 years of readying facilities, roaming sidelines and deftly juggling 
the quirkiest challenges -- even spot landscaping -- that pop up continually in 
high school sports, Doretti, 56, hung up his clipboard and whistle for the 
final time at Los Alamitos on Tuesday. And while the lifelong Orange County 
resident is ready for some relaxation, he will remain on the go despite taking 
things more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Doretti's next challenge begins today when he and his wife, Burma, take off 
for Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 He is among a growing number of coaches who coach American football abroad 
during the summer. He will lead a team in the town of Kouvola, located 
northeast of Helsinki, until Sept. 3. From there they will travel to Munich, 
Germany, to speak with a group trying to organize a football team. 
</P>
<P>
 They return home for a brief stop Sept. 23 before loading up the motor home 
and hitting the road. They have children and grandchildren throughout the 
country and, for a change, the time to spend with them. 
</P>
<P>
 When Griffin athletes return to school in the fall, they will not be in 
Doretti's charge for the first time in more than two decades. Moreover, Los 
Alamitos no longer will have the leadership of a guy who was there before its 
doors opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just starting to set in that I won't be back," Doretti said. "I've been 
real lucky to work with a great group of coaches who have been together for a 
long time, and some fine young (people). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to get a little nostalgic already. I know it's going to hit me 
hard later on." 
</P>
<P>
 Doretti was among the school's inaugural faculty in 1968. He arrived on campus 
with a passion for working with youngsters, boundless energy and a knack for 
being organized -- traits that continued through the final day of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the school's first football coach, leading the Griffins from 1968-73. 
It was a job for which he was well prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Doretti was a standout at Anaheim High and started at center and linebacker 
for California in 1958-59. He played in the 1959 Rose Bowl, in which Iowa 
defeated Cal, 38-12. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Cal in 1960, Doretti coached football at Servite 
(1960-62), Anaheim (1963) and Kennedy (1964-67). By 1968, he was ready for a 
new challenge. Building the Los Alamitos program was the right fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was exciting," Doretti said. "(The teachers and coaches) were all young 
and enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
 But things did not just slide into place. Actually, Doretti seemed to need a 
bigger shoe horn every minute during those early days. 
</P>
<P>
 That first group was composed of 10th graders, many of whom had little or no 
football knowledge. They were eager -- but far from ready. Doretti and his 
staff had to start from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 "My experience really helped because we had to go back to Square 1," Doretti 
said. "We had to teach everybody how to do everything from putting on pads to 
tying shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the yardwork . 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins' facilities were not completed the first year, so the football 
team practiced at the nearby Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center. Only one 
problem: The practice "field" was devoid of grass, but had large rocks in 
abundance. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches, players and parents banded together to clear the area. One of 
Doretti's assistants watered the ground each day for an hour before practice to 
try and limit the dust-bowl effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "That field was something," Doretti said. "You just wouldn't believe the 
dust." 
</P>
<P>
 Doretti became the Griffins' second athletic director in 1972. He resigned as 
head coach of the football team in 1973 to concentrate on his administrative 
duties, but remained as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Results indicate Doretti has worn both hats well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins' defensive coordinator, Doretti is a big reason Los Alamitos has 
won three consecutive Southern Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "How he prepares his defense is just amazing," Barnes said. "We are always 
just perfect on defense. He never leaves a stone unturned." 
</P>
<P>
 This approach works in his other position, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos was honored June 15 with The Times Orange County All-Sports Award 
for being the dominant large school in athletics this year. Doretti's 
organization and dedication, many said, was a key to the success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always prided myself on being organized," Doretti said. "I just did a 
little bit each day so that I didn't slight either job." 
</P>
<P>
 The new athletic director hopes he has half as successful a run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him to leave all his papers for me," said Barnes. "He always had 
everything ready. He made it look so easy."

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; IT WASN'T PRETTY, BUT IT WAS COMPELLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let this be said about the 1994 NBA finals: 
</P>
<P>
 It may have been the wrong teams and it certainly was the wrong time. They may 
have been playing a style the league thought it had left in the prehistoric 
'50s. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like raising a pit bull as a pet. You know it's homely and you have to 
be careful when you're patting its head, but after a while, you find out you're 
getting attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Rockets and New York Knicks went at each other so long and so 
hard, they had to pry them apart to crown a champion. In the end, it was the 
Rockets. The Knicks may have had limitless heart, soul, guts, spleen and 
whatever, but this is still basketball and they still keep score in points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing," said Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich. "I've been around a long 
time, but I don't remember seeing a series where it was so tight. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go back to the Celtic-Laker days, there were blowouts, there were 
15-point wins. This one was nip-and-tuck all the way. I'm sure I've lost a 
couple of years off my life, like Pat (Riley) has." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley could have lost a decade after coaching the Knicks through the longest 
postseason on record, 25 games of a possible 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team in the finals scored 100 points, an NBA first. As a matter of 
fact, neither scored 95 but the games were taut as violin strings. In Games 2 
through 5, the lead changed hands in the fourth quarter. In Game 6, the Knicks 
never got the lead in the last quarter, but John Starks was shooting for the 
championship in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 7, Starks went two for 18 and shot them out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game comes down to making or missing," said Riley, the yard boss in this 
quarry. "You either make or you miss. Some games we did. Tonight, we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 It was compelling, it was agonizing, it was ponderous as a glacier's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also all but overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the World Cup and the New York Rangers winning the Stanley Cup and the 
O.J. Simpson case, the Knicks were wondering if they were going to have to buy 
space to get into their hometown papers. 
</P>
<P>
 The night they won Game 5, the police were chasing Simpson all over the 
freeway system and most of the press corps in Madison Square Garden watched the 
pursuit on the TVs provided for replays. Several of NBC's biggest affiliates 
preempted the game. The ratings were already down 30% from last year but after 
that they looked like they'd been run over by a bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Knick players were up to their old tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks and Anthony Mason blew off Tuesday's media session before Game 7 and 
were fined $10,000 apiece by the league office. The organization was fined 
another $20,000 for letting the players hide. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically or not, the Knicks were throwing another of their famous parties 
for the press corps that night, at the NASA Space Center. Their first was a 
Western-style hoedown. Their team slogan should be The Knicks Are Your Friends 
(Even If We Won't Talk To You). OK, they can't turn their tenacity on and off. 
Their performance in Game 7 was wonderful. It was everything a basketball team 
could be, without making any shots. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, Starks, Patrick Ewing and Charles Oakley, their top three 
scorers, were a combined four for 16. Somehow, the Knicks were still within 
45-43. 
</P>
<P>
 After three quarters, they were nine for 29. Somehow, the Knicks were still 
within 63-60. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks, a gamer's gamer, kept putting them up and they kept clanking off and 
what was there to say but goodby? 
</P>
<P>
 "John almost single-handedly won it for us in Game 6," said Riley. "You live 
with your players. You go up with them and you go down with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be remiss in telling our players they played as hard as they 
could as long as they could. They took it to the ultimate game. There's no 
solace in the words that I can give them right now, but I don't think I've ever 
been prouder of a team in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 On the floor, Commissioner David Stern was going on about the heart, desire, 
determination, etc., shown by both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," said Stern, preparing to present the Rockets their trophy, "there can 
only be one champion." 
</P>
<P>
 Yelled someone in the press room: "If that many!"

BURKE'S JUST UP TO HIS NECK IN WATER POLO; ALAMO CUP: FORMER SAN CLEMENTE STAR 
PLAYS IN AND PROMOTES THE INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT AT CORONA DEL MAR HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Burke could have stepped right off the beach, with his deep tan, casual 
clothes and the well-scrubbed look of a serious surfer, but today there is 
something amiss. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a nasty gash on his left eyelid -- a fresh wound, the type you usually 
see at ringside, not at the pier. "It happens to me all the time," says Burke, 
who surfs often but spends most of his time playing for the U.S. national water 
polo team. 
</P>
<P>
 This time it was an elbow thrown by a Cuban player in practice Wednesday. 
Tonight it could be a punch in the face or a kick in the stomach. Burke usually 
guards the two-meter man -- loosely, water polo's answer to a basketball center 
-- where the battles can be the most punishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the two-meter men are great people out of the pool but when you're 
in the pool they're your worst enemy," Burke said. "There are elbows thrown, 
knees to the kidney. People don't realize what goes on under the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least one of my ribs is bruised at all times." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting tonight, Burke will be mixing it up with some of the best in the 
world at the Alamo Cup, the annual international tournament, at Corona del Mar 
High School. The United States, which won the first two Alamo Cup titles, will 
play Mexico at 8 tonight, then Japan and Cuba Friday, before the playoffs for 
medals Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, a San Clemente High and Long Beach State graduate, is in the unique 
position of playing in and promoting the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Water Polo is based in Indianapolis and its executive director, Bruce 
Wigo, works in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., so working with local sponsors on 
promotional material has been difficult for the organization. This year, 
however, Burke was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had no experience in the field, he took to the job quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "With some people you might need to hold their hands," said Eileen Sexton, 
U.S. Water Polo's director of media relations. "But Mike just really took off 
and did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, Burke has worked about 25 hours a week, meeting with sponsors 
and putting together a poster and the tournament program. It is the perfect 
flexible employment, allowing him to fit the two daily practice sessions -- 
about five hours total -- into his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pool, Burke, 25, has made steady progress through the U.S. system. A 
high school All-American, he helped San Clemente finish second in the Southern 
Section Division 3-A playoffs when he was a senior in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In four seasons at Long Beach State, Burke scored 206 goals, second on the 
school's all-time list. He was a four-time All-Big West Conference selection 
and a three-time All-American.  
</P>
<P>
 While still at Long Beach, he played for the U.S. junior national team that 
finished fourth at the 1989 World Championships, the best result in the team's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 It was valuable experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did an outstanding job of shutting down some two-meter men who are now 
playing for other national teams," said Ricardo Azevedo, who coached the U.S. 
junior team and is now the assistant coach for the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
 After that tournament, Burke and a few teammates were asked to practice with 
the national team. One, Chris Humbert, played in the 1992 Summer Olympics in 
Barcelona, but there were too many veterans on the team for Burke to break in. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last year, he helped the U.S. team place fourth at the FINA World Cup in 
Greece. He likely has helped his chances for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta by 
improving his swimming enough to to play two-meter man on offense. He's also 
developed a good outside shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very good utility player for us," Azevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if he could just find a good cut man for that eyelid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those minor cuts where you could get stitches," Burke said, "or 
you can stay awake for 12 hours until it heals." 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo Cup Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Ricardo Azevedo, the U.S. team's assistant coach, said the Alamo Cup field is 
the tournament's strongest yet. "We'd like it to be an even tougher 
tournament," Azevedo said. "We want the American public to see the type of 
teams we have to play every day when we go to Europe." Hungary finished second 
to Italy at the 1993 FINA World Cup and European Championships. Australia beat 
the U.S. team for the bronze at the FINA Cup, winning the Australians' first 
international water polo medal. Cuba, the 1991 Pan American Games champion, is 
still dangerous. Canada, Mexico, Japan and the U.S. B team round out the 
eight-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule: 
</P>
<P>
 Today 
</P>
<P>
 4:15 p.m. -- Australia vs. Canada; 5:30 -- Hungary vs. U.S. B; 6:45 -- Cuba

'GRUESOME' GAME NOT THE TICKET FOR OLAJUWON'S VISITING PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With people all over Houston scrounging for tickets to Wednesday night's Game 
7 of the NBA finals, two people with an inside track on prime seats decided 
they would rather watch on television. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out NBA basketball is too gruesome a sight for Salaam and Abike 
Olajuwon, the parents of Nigeria-born Rocket center Hakeem Olajuwon who are 
making their annual summer visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The two, who never have seen their son play professionally in person, declined 
his offer of tickets to the deciding game against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents tonight are going to watch the game on TV," Olajuwon said 
Wednesday. "They're not used to the contact, the running up and down. When they 
saw the game, they said, 'You have to really work for your money. We see how 
hard you work going up and down the court.' "

WALL STREET FRETS OVER PRICE CUTS BY STATE'S HMOS; HEALTH CARE: TWO O.C.-BASED 
PROVIDERS TAKE BIG HITS ON STOCK MARKET AS INVESTORS WORRY THAT REDUCED RATES 
MEAN LESS PROFIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California health care companies are pursuing reforms aggressively, but Wall 
Street isn't so sure it likes what's happening, industry analysts and 
executives at two giant Orange County HMOs said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock prices for health maintenance organizations, particularly in California, 
rebounded a bit Wednesday from the beating that Wall Street dished out Tuesday 
as traders worried that a price war might break out and earnings might suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors became alarmed after news broke that a San Francisco Bay Area 
consortium of large employers won rate reductions of 5% to 10% from 17 HMOs, 
including FHP International Corp. in Fountain Valley and PacifiCare Health 
Systems Inc. in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 "HMOs are still a good investment in the long term," said Kenneth S. 
Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York. "But they 
are increasingly competing on price, and price competition increases the risk 
that earnings could drop. Wall Street is worried about price competition 
getting out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 He said reduced rates could become the standard that all employers will seek. 
An overall 10% decrease in rates across the state, he said, would not only 
affect earnings but also would send hospitals toward bankruptcy as health care 
companies pull back even more on their use of hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 But others see pressures throughout the health care industry to lower prices 
before Washington steps in with long-discussed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors, drug companies and other providers and suppliers will have to lower 
fees and cut their own costs, said Mary O'Connell, an analyst in the San 
Francisco office of New York's Louis Nicoud Associates. In addition, she said, 
HMOs and other providers and suppliers still have plenty of fat to cut from 
their overhead and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 HMOs, in fact, already are changing the economics of the health care industry, 
said executives at FHP and PacifiCare. 
</P>
<P>
 With HMOs covering 35% of the California market, physicians and other 
providers are coming to the managed-care companies to get business, FHP's 
co-president Westcott W. Price III said. "But to do so," he said, "they have to 
be in partnership with HMOs to hold down costs, and that has to benefit the 
residents of the state." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, doctors who have resisted changes in billing approaches are 
beginning to accept new methods devised by HMOs to save money and force 
physicians to look for ways to lower their own costs, said Richard Lipeles, a 
PacifiCare executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being price competitive is nothing new to managed-care companies," Lipeles 
said. That is the very attraction of HMOs and the reason the industry has 
grown, O'Connell pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell said Wall Street has long been particularly harsh to California 
HMOs, partly because the industry here has been so competitive. The stock 
prices of HMOs in the state had lagged behind others in the nation but have 
been catching up since December, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's setback should be temporary, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The selloff began after word spread about the deal won by the Bay Area 
Business Group on Health, which was formed by Bank of America, Pacific Telesis, 
Safeway Inc. and other large statewide employers. The group negotiated rate 
reductions for 300,000 employees, their families and retirees. Besides FHP and 
PacifiCare, other HMOs that approved reduced rates included Kaiser Permanente 
of Northern California and Health Net in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare took the biggest stock hit as its price fell $5.625 a share. It 
gained back 87.5 cents Wednesday to close at $51.375 on the Nasdaq market. 
FHP's stock fell 75 cents on Tuesday but rose 62.5 cents the next day to close 
at $24.625 a share on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net's parent company, Health Systems International Inc., lost $3.50 
Tuesday but picked up $2 on Wednesday to close at $30 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Kaiser is a nonprofit company. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, neither FHP nor PacifiCare is a major player in the Bay Area 
Business group. PacifiCare members in the group account for less than 2% of the 
company's total membership, and FHP has only 5,200 members in the group out of 
1.7 million systemwide.

IMPACT OF THE WEAK DOLLAR / THE CONSUMERS' VIEW; IMPORT IMPACT: ZILCH; 
RETAILERS, ANALYSTS EXPECT STABLE PRICES

 Afraid a falling dollar will mean higher prices for imported consumer goods 
such as televisions, clothing and cars? 
</P>
<P>
 Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers and economists say the day-to-day fluctuation in foreign exchange 
rates -- the price in dollars for the foreign currency needed to buy goods from 
abroad -- has virtually no effect on prices in the short term and is only a 
minor factor in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the reasons are increased manufacturing of products in the country in 
which they are sold, competitive pressures against price hikes and the long 
lead time between orders and sales. Also, possible currency changes are among 
the factors retailers consider before they set prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't go around the store marking up the prices all the time" when the 
dollar falls, said Robert August, a sales associate at the Pier 1 Imports store 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchandising and pricing decisions are made months before products appear on 
store shelves, August said. Besides, the store's most popular items include 
furniture and clothing from China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines -- 
countries whose currencies are closely linked to the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar has fallen in value very sharply against the Japanese yen, but as 
far as consumers are concerned, that's not particularly bad news," said Robert 
Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the dollar hit a post-World War II low against the Japanese yen, 
falling below 100 before closing at 100.35. The greenback climbed slightly on 
Wednesday, closing at 100.95 yen. 
</P>
<P>
 When the dollar falls against foreign currencies, it takes more dollars to buy 
goods from other countries. That's supposed to make imports more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 But, said Brusca, "it's not written in stone that this will affect prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the heavy attention paid to America's trade deficit with Japan, 
Japanese products account for only about 12% of American imports, Brusca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, Japanese manufacturers have not raised prices when the yen rose, 
he said. "When the dollar dropped from 220 yen to 150 yen, it didn't do 
anything in terms of raising prices, so why should dropping from 120 yen to 100 
do anything?" 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese producers are loath to raise prices, even if it means cutting into 
their profits. Some prices of Japanese imported cars have risen, but not in 
proportion to the rise in the yen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manufacturers don't want to pass on that cost to us. They'd rather keep their 
market share," said Chris Herr, general manager of Adray's Discount Department 
Store in Los Angeles, which specializes in electronics equipment such as 
televisions, VCRs and computers. Although Japanese brands such as Sony, RCA and 
Hitachi are market leaders, Herr said more and more electronics products are 
coming from Mexico, Korea and Taiwan, countries where the dollar is stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese manufacturers can shift production to sites in America when costs at 
home become too expensive for Americans to afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toyota has been manufacturing more and more cars in the U.S. specifically to 
hedge against changes in the exchange rate," said Toyota dealer Kent Hagen. 
"The action that took place Tuesday or within the last week or two has no 
impact on our day-to-day business." 
</P>
<P>
 Factors such as the U.S. regulatory environment and the cost of meeting new 
automobile standards have a much greater impact on the ultimate price of a car 
than the exchange rate, Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for clothing in department stores have exchange rate fluctuations built 
in, so prices don't rise once they are on store racks, said Nordstrom 
spokeswoman Kelly Tormey. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of the goods that we carry are purchased from U.S. 
vendors," Tormey said. "If there was some sort of price impact, it would have 
been absorbed by the vendor by the time the goods get to us." Not a Total Loser 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to gains against the Canadian dollar over the past year, the U.S. 
dollar is up overall on a trade-weighted basis against currencies of the 
nation's five major trading partners. 03,17,12,09 Percent change vs. dollar

GE OUSTS KIDDER CHIEF, INSTALLS ITS OWN EXECS; BROKERAGES: THE TROUBLED WALL 
STREET FIRM'S PARENT MOVES TO SALVAGE ITS REPUTATION IN THE WAKE OF SCANDALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving decisively to stem a collapse in the reputation and morale of Kidder, 
Peabody & Co., General Electric Co. on Wednesday ousted the troubled Wall 
Street brokerage's chief executive and installed two top-level GE executives at 
the unit's helm. 
</P>
<P>
 Out as Kidder's chairman and CEO is Michael A. Carpenter, a close associate of 
GE Chairman John F. Welch, who installed Carpenter at Kidder shortly after its 
acquisition by GE in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 GE, which bought Kidder for more than $600 million and has since pumped 
another $700 million in capital into the firm, made the change as the brokerage 
continues to reel from a scandal over phantom trades on its government 
securities desk and from questions about the health of its multibillion-dollar 
portfolio of complex mortgage-backed securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Those problems -- and the attendant bad publicity -- have provoked some Kidder 
customers to transfer their accounts to rival firms. Competitors also exploited 
Kidder's weaknesses by trading against it and spreading damaging rumors, Welch 
said in a meeting with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was clear that every day the continuing barrage of stories was going to 
have an effect," he said. "It was clear that unless something was done, it was 
going to cost us some money. There was an impression that there were more 
storms coming, there was a run on it, and it was going to get worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
 But Welch again denied persistent Wall Street speculation that the giant 
industrial and financial services company would like to unload Kidder. The 
management change, he insisted, is intended "to lay to rest any perceived 
issues about Kidder's financial strength or our corporate support for the 
firm." 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the British-born Carpenter, formerly an executive at the 
highly regarded GE Capital Corp., had resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 His duties will be assumed on an interim basis by Dennis D. Dammermann, 48, 
GE's senior vice president and chief financial officer. GE also appointed Denis 
J. Nayden, 40, as Kidder's president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nayden, who gives up his post as executive vice president of GE Capital, is to 
move into Kidder's top spot in three to five months, when Dammermann will 
return to the parent company in his old capacity. Dammermann will retain his 
existing titles at GE. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch was blunt in addressing Kidder employees Wednesday morning over the 
firm's public address system: "We're going to draw a line in the sand, dammit, 
and go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 GE said Kidder expects to be "modestly profitable" in June but will lose $25 
million to $30 million, after taxes, in the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York Stock Exchange trading, GE closed down 37.5 cents at $45.75 as 
Wall Street sought to make sense of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really clear that the parent is totally committed to an ongoing Kidder 
Peabody," said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at NatWest Securities Corp. 
"Kidder will get all the attention, all the support, all the liquidity it 
needs. GE's got its top guys in there." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all Wall Street observers were entirely convinced that Welch intends 
to hold on to Kidder indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his strategy still is that when things get better, to sell Kidder," 
said Perrin Long, head of equity research at First of Michigan Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerage firm's most recent woes date back to April, when it was 
discovered that Joseph Jett, Kidder's chief government bond trader, allegedly 
falsified bond trades to create $350 million in bogus profits. The maneuvers -- 
which Jett allegedly undertook to boost his own performance-based pay -- forced 
GE to take a $210-million charge against earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, questions arose over the value of Kidder's portfolio of exotic 
"collateralized mortgage obligations" -- securities, backed by mortgage loans, 
whose market valuations crashed when interest rates broke sharply upward this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch and Dammermann said Wednesday that the brokerage firm holds about $10 
billion in so-called CMOs, down from $16 billion at the end of March. According 
to Dammermann, the bulk of the remaining holdings are liquid and safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Straining to avoid blaming Carpenter for the problems, Welch said the longtime 
GE executive was forced to leave not because of any disappointment with his 
handling of the Jett and mortgage securities matters but because of their 
combined impact on the public's perception of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either one of them alone he could have withstood," Welch said. "What he 
couldn't withstand was both of them." 
</P>
<P>
 While Kidder overall has been profitable for GE -- it earned $439 million last 
year -- the brokerage firm has in some ways been an albatross to GE. Within 
months of the 1986 acquisition, the firm found itself at the center of the Ivan 
Boesky insider-trading scandal; its mergers chief, Martin A. Siegel, pleaded 
guilty to selling confidential information to Boesky and eventually served time 
in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had better return on other investments," Welch said, "but this one 
isn't a disaster." 
</P>

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: ALL ROADS LEAD TO NEW-MEDIA CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To evoke a catty chorus of multimedia meows, just ask the East Coast 
intelligentsia or West Coast pop culture artistes to predict where tomorrow's 
new-media capital will be. 
</P>
<P>
 In between bites of kappa maki and deal making, Angelenos will insist that 
their fingers are firmly pressed on the jugular of pop culture and that all 
multimedia superhighways inevitably lead to Hollywood. The New Yorkers argue 
that information is the key and that the multimedia future looks just like 
publishing. Really. In San Francisco, folks just point south of Market Street 
to the Neo-Bohemians in Multimedia Gulch. And up in Seattle, the latte crowd 
gently put down their cups and smugly whisper their multimedia mantra: Bill . . 
. Bill . . . Bill.  
</P>
<P>
 A few seconds later in the conversation, of course, New York will be 
contemptuously dismissed as a technological tar pit where paper-based 
publishers honestly think that CD-ROMs represent the state of the multimedia 
art. San Francisco's South of Market crowd will be dissed as a gaggle of really 
bright techno-geeks who don't understand the first or second thing about 
business, while the techno-geeks will tell you that Hollywood dresses real 
pretty for folks who think that C++ is their teen-ager's grade point average.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the Pacific Northwest's Evil Empire, people take turns fearing 
Microsoft's Bill Gates as the John D. Rockefeller of the Information Age or 
despising him as Software's Jabba the Hut. 
</P>
<P>
 These regional rivalries are taken very seriously. When a leading CD-ROM 
publisher like Voyager moves from Santa Monica to Manhattan or when AT&T's 
multimedia maven, Bob Kavner, leaves Ma Bell's bosom for the I.M. Pei-ified 
glitter of Michael Ovitz's Creative Artists Agency, people get nervous. 
Everyone wants to be in the Athens, Rome or Florence of multimedia. Everyone 
wants to be at The Center. 
</P>
<P>
 What's so ironic about these media rivalries, however, is that the pop 
culturecrats who proclaim their region as the place to be are precisely the 
same people who talk about how multimedia networking is making location 
irrelevant. By rights, a geography-independent medium like the Internet -- 
rather than mere physical co-location -- should have greater influence on media 
creativity and collaboration. If you believe what these moguls are saying, 
tomorrow's Multimedia Capital should be more virtual than physical. An Internet 
-- not Hollywood or Manhattan or Redmond -- should be the white-hot center of 
multimedia innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason why so many pundits predict the convergence of regional 
media sensibilities as the technologies themselves converge. The center will be 
where sensibility and technology profitably converge. (A few wags have thus 
dubbed the promised convergence of Silicon Valley and Hollywood as 
"Silliwood.") The end result will be a vast multimedia Ubernetwork with an MIT 
Media Lab node here, a Microsoft hub there, all lashed together by fibers and 
frequencies courtesy of AT&T, TCI and PacTel. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as if in reactionary response to the potential of virtual 
tele-convergence, regionalism seems more important than ever. When it comes to 
making new media, virtuality isn't evolving yet into an adequate substitute for 
physical presence. Academic surveys of regional economies by Harvard's Michael 
Porter and Berkeley's AnnaLee Saxenian stressing the importance of local 
networking and informal information exchange seem more relevant than obsolete. 
Regional rivalries will be on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the idea that a Hollywood or New York is well positioned to capture 
new-media markets because of their entertainment and information assets is as 
simplistic as believing the Pacific Northwest could dominate the printing 
industry because it's close to all those trees, or that Minneapolis will become 
the creative capital of book publishing because B. Dalton is based there. 
Regional economic diversification is as much the result of alchemy as strategic 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, one of the hottest and most popular network products to emerge in 
recent years is Mosaic, an immensely powerful tool for navigating and 
participating in the Internet. Mosaic doesn't come from either coast -- it 
comes from the University of Illinois. If you think about it, that actually 
makes sense, because there's absolutely nothing to do in Champaign. 
</P>
<P>
 One could make an excellent case that tomorrow's most interesting network 
navigation tools won't come from the dense hotbeds of Silicon Valley or MIT but 
from regional outposts that have a greater need and urgency to reach out and 
tap a network's potential. Remember, cable television began where the Big Three 
networks couldn't reach. It's necessity -- not abundance -- that is the mother 
of invention. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is, when it comes to regional rivalries, strengths can be weaknesses 
and weaknesses can be strengths. Microsoft's great strength -- the popularity 
of its Windows interface -- may ultimately prove to be a huge weakness as it's 
ported to the consumer marketplace. Conversely, New York publishing's abysmal 
technological illiteracy may ultimately prove advantageous because, if an 
editor can understand the new-media product, then anyone can. 
</P>
<P>
 Which begs the question: Are these new media really about the technologies of 
information and entertainment? Or are they really about creating new forms of 
interaction and involvement? That's what these regional rivalries have this 
decade to determine. Where you are still matters as much as what you think.

INSURANCE POOL TOLD TO COVER QUAKES, FIRES; DISASTER AID: GARAMENDI ORDERS 
HIGH-RISK FUND TO OFFER POLICIES STATEWIDE. MOVE IS MEANT TO AVERT AVAILABILITY 
CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to block a potential meltdown of the California homeowners 
insurance market, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi on Wednesday ordered 
the state's high-risk insurance pool to extend its residential earthquake and 
fire insurance statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's action, which he called "strictly a stopgap, short-term measure," 
means that all homeowners will be able to buy at least bare-bones residential 
coverage even in areas considered at high risk for earthquakes. The coverage 
comes from the California Fair Plan, the industry-financed insurer of last 
resort that, until now, has mainly insured properties in the inner city and 
brush-fire areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The move appears to defuse -- at least temporarily -- the threat that a 
squeeze in availability of homeowners insurance will disrupt real estate sales 
and hurt California's economic recovery. The squeeze came when several large 
insurers, including 20th Century Insurance Co. and Farmers Insurance Group, 
abruptly stopped writing new homeowners and earthquake policies after suffering 
huge losses from the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's order, which takes effect July 1 and lasts for nine months, grants 
the Fair Plan a 100% hike in its earthquake insurance rates and a 20% hike in 
its fire rates. The new earthquake rates of $2.50 per $1,000 of coverage are 
slightly higher than the current state average. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi also called on Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature to impose a 
temporary moratorium prohibiting insurers from refusing to renew homeowners and 
earthquake coverage. The rate hikes and proposed moratorium are intended to 
keep insurance from flooding into the Fair Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie M. Berte, Gov. Wilson's insurance adviser, said of Garamendi's order: 
"It's fine to the extent that it solves an immediate availability crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers, however, warned that the action does nothing to reduce companies' 
exposure to devastating earthquake losses and could make the problem even 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Fair Plan simply passes on its losses to California insurers 
according to their market share, Garamendi's action "offers nothing but an 
unlimited and automatic assessment on the companies for whatever deficits may 
occur," Bill Sirola, spokesman for State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garamendi has broad authority over the Fair Plan, it is a private 
fund that has no link to the state treasury. It was created after the Watts 
riots of 1965 as a means of providing insurance in urban areas that traditional 
insurers considered too risky. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Fair Plan coverage has been extended to rural places at high 
risk for wildfire, such as the canyons of Malibu. Garamendi's order now extends 
coverage statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The residential policies -- available from all California insurance agents -- 
offer stripped-down fire insurance coverage, without coverage for liability, 
burglary or other risks. In order to obtain full coverage, consumers often 
supplement their Fair Plan policies with "wraparound" coverage from other 
insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fair Plan has docked member insurers for $210 million in the last nine 
months -- $150 million to cover losses from last fall's wildfires in Southern 
California and an additional $60 million related to the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart M. Wilkinson, general manager of Fair Plan, said Wednesday that the 
fund may have to levy an additional assessment, as earthquake losses are 
expected to reach $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 California's three largest insurers -- State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance 
Co., Allstate Insurance Co. and Farmers Insurance Group -- all are calling for 
repeal of the state law that forces companies selling homeowners insurance to 
also offer earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 earthquake, which is expected to cost insurers more than $6 
billion, the industry has reached the consensus that it is practically 
impossible to predict earthquake losses and therefore impossible to set a 
reasonable price for the coverage -- even if regulators would let companies 
charge that price. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, Berte and insurance officials agree that a long-term solution must 
come from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry favors the Natural Disaster Protection Act, now before Congress, 
which would create a nationwide catastrophic insurance pool that would cover 
everything from earthquakes to hurricanes to ice storms. Garamendi doesn't like 
aspects of that legislation but favors a similar approach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of a national solution, State Farm, Allstate and Farmers -- 
with some disagreement over details -- favor a statewide earthquake insurance 
program that would draw on a specified amount of industry capital -- say, $1 
billion. If losses from an earthquake exceeded the capital, the program would 
sell bonds to raise more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Insurance Commissioner William Ahern said such a plan couldn't work 
because it is doubtful that the program could sell enough bonds to cover a huge 
catastrophe.

IMPACT OF THE WEAK DOLLAR / THE TRAVELERS' VIEW; DOLLAR DESERTS TOURISTS; 
AMERICANS ABROAD FEEL THE PINCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddled with dollars worth less than when they started their trips abroad, 
American tourists around the globe grumbled and tightened their belts -- but 
also expressed hope that their money would soon recover its lost value. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tourists in Europe and Japan said they were giving up fancy meals for 
McDonald's, cabs for subways and guided tours for guidebooks. A few were 
canceling side trips out of the capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The shock was greatest in Japan, where the dollar hit a post-World War II low 
of 99.5 Japanese yen on Tuesday and recovered only slightly Wednesday. 
Generally, financial markets worldwide settled down following their tumble 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dramatically expensive . . . breathtaking," said Lynmar Brock Jr., 60, a 
tourist in Tokyo from Newtown Square, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Horrendous," added his wife, Claudie. "For breakfast this morning we spent 
$30. And that only buys toast and juice." 
</P>
<P>
 Economists had been predicting a strong dollar for this summer, based on 
expected growth in the U.S. and European economies. The economies indeed grew, 
but other factors intervened, such as inflation fears in the United States, the 
U.S. trade conflict with Japan and concern that Germany would halt its slow 
drop in interest rates. So the dollar fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism industry leaders said Wednesday that it was too soon to tell whether 
the depreciation of the dollar will have a dramatic impact on Americans' 
travel. Most long-distance vacations are planned and paid for far in advance, 
and a spot check of hotels in Paris and Rome showed no trend toward 
cancellations by Americans. Travel agents in Southern California agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People haven't shown any concern about it," said Nina DeCampos, manager of 
the Carlson Travel Network office in Woodland Hills. In fact, she said, two 
couples walked into the office Wednesday afternoon to make final payments on 
their European vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the client has become accustomed to the dollar not being real 
strong," said Ada Brown, who owns Seaside Travel in Long Beach. Economic 
conditions -- not the value of the dollar -- play a greater role in consumers' 
travel plans, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepaid tours and low air fares have also taken some of the sting out of the 
declining dollar, travel agent Kathy Traynor said. Round-trip tickets to 
Europe, for example, are less than $600 through airline ticket wholesalers, and 
hotels are still offering discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can do Europe almost more cheaply than you can do a United States tour 
package," said Traynor, who manages the Associated Travel office in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many American travelers already overseas have taken the dollar's dive 
in stride. If you're shelling out a couple of grand for a European trip, what's 
a couple of hundred more, they reason. That's what vacations -- and credit 
cards -- are for. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, where the dollar has dropped only about 3% against the pound in the 
past week, Lewis and Dorothy Ross of Tampa, Fla., paused outside Harrods 
department store in the chic Knightsbridge shopping district. "I wish the 
dollar would rise and not sink," Lewis said, "but . . . we'll think about the 
cost when we get home." 
</P>
<P>
 But Christie Rothenberger and her friend Kelly Thomas, younger tourists from 
Texas, were holding back on spending. 
</P>

 "We wanted to go to English pubs and eat traditional English food, which is 
expensive enough in London anyway, but with the exchange rate being so bad 
we've had to stick to fast food," Rothenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at some European money exchange houses were matter-of-fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had these oscillations before," said a Rome money changer. "It simply 
means the dollar will stay down, probably for the rest of the week, then 
recuperate. This is not a big slump but a minor drop." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Americans who managed to change money before the dollar fell felt like 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside a cafe near Paris' Madeleine church, Rancho Santa Fe liquor importer 
Sidney Frank said he and his wife had just paid $35 for two coffees, a pair of 
croissants and an Evian water. But the 74-year-old was sitting pretty in his 
plaid jacket and bow tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luckily, I bought enough D-marks to last for 18 months a few months ago," 
Frank said. "If I bought them today, it would have cost me at least $1.5 
million more." He had also laid in a year's supply of French brandy. 
</P>
<P>
 A weak dollar helps American exports and makes imports more expensive. 
Foreigners find it cheaper to buy dollars, so travel to the United States is 
less expensive for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The rising value of the German mark was good news, for example, to Hans 
Becker, a German tourist amid the World Cup hubbub in Pasadena who was planning 
to exchange currency Thursday morning.  
</P>
<P>
 "This trip was expensive," he said. "I will take any help I can get."  
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, one of those celebrating the dollar's decline was Gerd Lindenau, 
director of the German branch of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank heavens," Lindenau said with a laugh. "I guess I'm the only positive 
thing around. But a weak dollar spurs tourism to the United States. The trend 
in tourism out of Germany to the U.S. has been double-digit growth for the last 
five years, and we see a much greater potential in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange rate changes, however, cut against Lindenau's personal interests 
as an American who earns dollars and lives in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah, personally I'm a poor man, but we take it on the chin," he said. "The 
fluctuation is almost daily, and in three months or a year it will be a 
different story. I can remember a 4.20-mark dollar in the early '60s and a 
1.42-mark dollar 22 months ago." On Wednesday, the dollar bought 1.605 marks in 
Germany, up from 1.594 marks a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, however, many Americans could not afford to take the news so well. 
</P>
<P>
 After paying $20 for a ham and cheese sandwich, 30-year-old NASA engineer Doug 
Govan of Cocoa Beach, Fla., decided against a trip out of Tokyo to Kyoto. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was caught a little off guard. I was expecting 110 yen for the dollar or 
better. When I got off at the airport, it was 98 yen," Govan said. At his 
hotel, he was able to get 100 yen per dollar for traveler's checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a learning experience," Govan said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA biochemistry student Khoi Le, who arrived in Japan last April for a 
semester-abroad program at Meiji Gakuin in Yokohama, said he is eating more 
often at McDonald's to save money. But even burgers are twice as expensive as 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to stay on the high-carbohydrate (diet)," he said. "More bang for the 
buck."

PUC'S VOTE WILL HELP INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS; REGULATION: ACTION LIKELY TO 
PROVIDE INVESTMENT CAPITAL IN FUTURE. MAJOR UTILITIES OPPOSED THE MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Guaranteeing a future for California's independent electricity producers, the 
state Public Utilities Commission voted Wednesday to stick to the terms of a 
power-buying auction that had been hotly disputed by the state's big utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The independents -- many of which generate electricity from wind, solar, 
biomass and geothermal facilities -- still face uncertain long-term prospects 
as the PUC shifts the electric-power industry to competition. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, the PUC vote to proceed with the auction will likely free up the 
investment capital that many independent producers say they need to survive 
into the next decades, whether the electricity business is deregulated or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our members hope to be signing contracts in the very near future," said Jan 
Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Sacramento-based Independent Energy 
Producers Assn. "This will result in about $1.5 billion in new investment and 
5,000 new jobs in the near term. It's a very clear signal that California is 
back in business." 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of Wednesday's decision was whether the PUC would stand by the 
results of what most likely will be the last mandated auction of electricity 
generated from renewable energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The utilities being forced to buy electricity from the independent producers 
complain that the purchases lock them into inflexible deals that may prove 
uneconomic over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 A legacy of the state's commitment to diverse, environmentally benign energy 
sources following the 1970s oil shocks, the auction -- conducted last December 
-- was the second such purchase by the state's big investor-owned utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the commissioners voted to confirm the auction results and 
proceed with awarding power contracts to the independent producers. The PUC 
ordered only slight modifications to the auction process, which began five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Disagreements over the way some producers calculated payments will be resolved 
by imposing a payment cap, but no other terms of the contracts will be 
affected. The commission withdrew an earlier proposal to defer part of the 
utilities' obligation to buy electricity from the independents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be very unfair for us to go back and somehow revise the ground 
rules," said Commissioner Norman D. Shumway, echoing a general concern of the 
commission. Continued holdup of the bid awards "would destroy any credibility 
we might have as a commission," Shumway said. 
</P>
<P>
 The process has been stalled since December, with the utilities arguing that 
the procedure was skewed in favor of the independents. Southern California 
Edison Co. further argued that it was being forced to buy electricity that it 
does not yet need. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction was held up again in April, when the commission announced its 
proposal to deregulate the electric power industry. The commissioners wanted to 
ponder whether the entire auction should be shelved until the PUC could flesh 
out its ambitious deregulation plan. 
</P>
<P>
 One big fear was that the power contracts could become high-cost albatrosses 
-- like many of those that resulted from the first mandated contracts in 1983 
-- if power prices fell dramatically under some form of deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk could be significant; Edison alone estimates that Wednesday's 
decision will oblige it to buy $16 billion worth of power over the next three 
decades.

 Cap Cities Will Stay in New York: Capital Cities/ABC Inc. said it has struck a 
$26-million agreement with city and state officials to keep the television 
company's headquarters in New York City for the next 15 years.Under the 
agreement, Cap Cities will spend more than $150 million to convert its 
television production facilities to digital and high-definition technologies. 
ABC said it employs 3,700 people in its New York broadcast operations and will 
add 185 workers in the city over the next two years. Similar to deals struck 
between local government and other networks, the ABC deal gives the company $12 
million in sales tax abatements on equipment purchases and $14 million in 
energy savings over 15 years.

 Bells Ask to Offer Long-Distance Wireless: Seven regional Bells, including 
U.S. West Inc., asked for relief from rules that restrict them from providing 
wireless long-distance services, the company said.In a filing with U.S. 
District Judge Harold Greene, the Baby Bells asked for a waiver to the 1982 
consent decree that broke up AT&T and created the Bells but restricted them 
from manufacturing and providing long-distance services. The request follows a 
recommendation last week by the Justice Department that the regional companies 
be allowed to provide wireless long-distance services. However, that ruling 
came with a number of restrictions, which the Bells say will hurt them in 
competing with other wireless services companies.

From Times Staff and Wire Reports Sues Over Rival Drug: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The company alleges in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Delaware that an 
Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. drug that stimulates production of red blood cells 
infringes a Genetics patent. In dispute is homogenous erythropoietin, known as 
EPO, which Genetics said has annual worldwide sales of $1 billion. Ortho, a 
unit of New Brunswick, N.J.-based Johnson & Johnson, sells an EPO drug called 
Procrit. Genetics said the patent in question was issued to the company Monday. 
Genetics is majority-owned by American Home Products Corp., based in Madison, 
N.J. Genetics, which said it discovered how to refine and purify EPO produced 
in animal cells, earns $20 million a year in royalties on EPO products made and 
sold in Europe and Japan. Procrit is made by Amgen Inc. and is sold by Ortho in 
the United States.

DOLLAR CLIMBS, PULLING STOCKS, BONDS WITH IT

 The battered dollar rebounded slightly Wednesday against the Japanese yen, 
bringing at least temporary relief to stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday's brief drop below the psychologically key 100-yen level, the 
dollar finished Wednesday at 100.95 yen in New York, up from Tuesday's postwar 
closing low of 100.35. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments Wednesday by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who said the United 
States and other industrial nations are ready to act if necessary in response 
to the recent plunge in the dollar, caused speculators to pull back from 
another attack on the dollar, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Major governments "probably have more than one ace up their sleeve," said 
Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The steadier dollar helped the stock market snap a three-session string of 
losses. The Dow industrials added 16.80 points to 3,724.77, after falling more 
than 100 points over the prior three sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, advancing issues outpaced declines on the New York Stock 
Exchange by about 3 to 2, though volume eased to 251.1 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were also aided by a strong bond rally. Interest rates slid as grain 
and gold prices plunged again, dampening inflation worries. The Commodity 
Research Bureau index of major commodities slumped 3.42 points to 230.87. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold lost $4.80 to $389.50 an ounce, after jumping $5.40 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, traders were surprised by better-than-expected demand at the Treasury's 
auction of $11 billion in five-year notes. The high yield on the notes was 
6.77%, down from 6.78% at the May auction. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the benchmark 30-year T-bond, which hit 7.49% on Tuesday, dropped 
to 7.40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Many traders said the dollar's relative stability was key for stock and bond 
markets Wednesday, because a continuing plunge in the dollar would have raised 
fears that foreign investors would bail out of U.S. securities, especially 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar is doing better, so bonds are doing better," said Neil DeSarno, 
head U.S. bond trader at S.G. Warburg & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar inched higher against the German mark as well, to 1.605 marks from 
1.594 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite reassuring comments about the economy and the dollar from Bentsen 
and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, many Wall Streeters say they 
aren't convinced that the dollar's rebound is sustainable. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the ballooning U.S. trade deficit and attractive short-term 
interest rates in Europe, global investors may continue to view 
dollar-denominated securities with relative disdain, some experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Wong, head of foreign exchange trading at Bank of Boston, said the 
market, which had been expecting Bentsen to signal "an actual intervention" and 
was presented with "words instead of deeds," may be prepared to sell the 
currency further. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the market will do now is force the dollar to a level where the central 
banks will have to come in, whether it is at 100 yen or 99 yen or 98," Wong 
said. "It will be a continuous test of the Group of Seven governments' 
resolve." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Streeters say any further decline in the dollar could lead to renewed 
selloffs in stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mild recoveries in downtrodden European markets helped put American 
investors in a buying mood. London's FTSE-100 index gained 20.2 points to 
2,960.4 points, while Frankfurt's DAX average inched up 11.15 points to 
1,994.42. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tokyo's Nikkei index sank 231.84 points to 20,581.32, and Mexico City's 
Bolsa index was off 0.06 point at 2,257.63. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the United States, industrial stocks led the market higher. PPG 
Industries jumped 7/8 to 39, Great Lakes Chemical surged 2 3/8 to 57 3/8, Clark 
Equipment rose 1 1/4 to 62 1/2, Eaton added 1 1/8 to 54 and Chrysler was up 3/4 
to 47 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks also rebounded. IBM rose 1 to 62, Texas Instruments leaped 
2 1/4 to 76 1/2, Intel jumped 1 5/8 to 59 5/8 and Computer Sciences shot up 1 
5/8 to 43 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, Zenith Laboratories tumbled 1 3/4 to 14 1/8. It said it 
received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration on testing 
procedures at a plant in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the drug group, Amgen fell 2 3/8 to 42 7/8 after Genetics Institute 
filed a patent lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson over the anti-anemia drug 
licensed to J&J by Amgen. But Amgen says it sees no impact on its patent 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Southland racetrack owner Hollywood Park gained 7/8 to 21 3/4. It said its 
new Inglewood card club casino will open Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Electric lost 1/4 to 45 7/8 after the company said the chief 
executive of its Kidder Peabody brokerage unit, Michael A. Carpenter, had 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sheffield Medical Technologies, a medical development company, climbed 1 
3/16 to 5 3/4 on news that it acquired a worldwide license to an HIV-AIDS 
vaccine technology under development. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Paging fell 1 5/8 to 6 5/8 after saying late Tuesday that its 
operating income and cash flow over the next few quarters may be lower than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Silicon Graphics spurted 2 3/4 to 21 3/4 after the company and AT&T 
announced a joint venture to sell "video servers" that will deliver TV 
programs, movies and music through communications systems.

SILICON GRAPHICS, AT&T JOIN IN TV VENTURE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Silicon Graphics Inc. announced Wednesday that it is combining forces with 
AT&T Corp. in an interactive-TV joint venture, giving it a boost toward 
creating an industry standard for the next generation of television. 
</P>
<P>
 No financial terms were disclosed for the venture, called Interactive Digital 
Solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement gives Silicon Graphics a better chance of having its technology 
become the model for interactive television, which will allow customers to 
select what they watch on TV from menus. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture could help Silicon Graphics develop such technology for regional 
telephone companies and cable television before Oracle Systems Corp. or 
Microsoft Corp. does. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine anybody having landed a plum as big as this one," said 
veteran technology analyst Laura Conigliaro, who tracks Silicon Graphics for 
Prudential Securities Research. "This is enormous." 
</P>
<P>
 Silicon Graphics shares rose $2.75, or 14%, to $21.75 on the news. AT&T rose 
12.5 cents to $55.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts are less enthusiastic. The Baby Bells will be the major delivery 
systems in interactive TV, one lane of the information superhighway. Any move 
by AT&T to create an industry standard could raise eyebrows among the regional 
Bell operating companies, which are wary of being dependent on AT&T technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not clear to me that AT&T and Silicon Graphics will be able to put this 
together," said Michael Balhoff, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker.

RECORDS SEIZED AT FIRMS WITH PRIMEDEX TIES; HEALTH CARE: AUTHORITIES SEARCH 
INVESTMENT COMPANIES IN BROADENING FRAUD PROBE.

<P>
 Authorities broadened their investigations Wednesday into Primedex Health 
Systems, a controversial health care company operating mainly in California, by 
seizing records on the East and West coasts at firms with ties to the 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, Primedex was one of the biggest workers' compensation medical 
operations in Southern California.But the company pulled out of that business 
last year, under pressure of the fraud investigations by the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office and the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 It continues to run a chain of diagnostic imaging centers in California under 
the name RadNet Management. The chain's division headquarters in Los Angeles 
and medical offices around the state were included in Wednesday's searches. 
</P>
<P>
 Search warrants were also executed at Primedex's Newark, N.J., headquarters, 
at the offices of its accounting firm and at an array of investment firms in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the investment firms searched was First Jersey Securities, which is 
headed by financier Robert E. Brennan, who also owns the controlling interest 
in Primedex. He is defending himself in court against civil fraud charges filed 
by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which accuses Brennan and First 
Jersey of bilking droves of customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news release Wednesday, Primedex said the search warrants had "nothing to 
do with our current operations." The company also said it "continues to believe 
that its operations are in compliance with applicable law and is unaware of any 
criminal activities of the company, its subsidiaries or any of its employees."

 Singapore Airlines ordered new wide-body jets valued at up to $10.3 billion 
from Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie on Wednesday, giving another potential 
lift to California's struggling aircraft parts industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The carrier placed firm orders for 11 Boeing 747s and options for an 
additional 11, while the package with Airbus, a European consortium, covers 
firm orders for 10 A340s and options for 20 more jets. The planes will be 
delivered between 1996 and 2003. The orders include spare engines and other 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
 While the orders are not expected to trigger immediate gains in production or 
jobs among the hundreds of airplane subcontractors in California, they are 
another sign that the commercial aircraft industry is rebounding from a 
4-year-old slump -- and that further big layoffs at the parts makers might be 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 About 320 California firms supply components for the 747 alone, according to 
Seattle-based Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
 The order is "generally good news," said Tony Cantafio, spokesman for Northrop 
Grumman Corp., whose Hawthorne plant makes 747 fuselages and cargo and 
passenger doors. "Although it will have no immediate impact, it would help 
sustain employment" later this decade, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true at Zevco Inc., a small Laguna Hills maker of hydraulic valves 
for the 747, A340 and other aircraft, said Henning R. Otto, vice president for 
marketing. Zevco, which employs 22 people, does not plan substantial hiring 
anytime soon, but the order "certainly makes you feel more comfortable as you 
plan ahead," Otto said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted with any order of that size," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Singapore Airlines deal follows Saudi Arabia's $6-billion order earlier 
this year for jets from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, whose Douglas Aircraft 
unit builds its planes in Long Beach. China also is reportedly considering a 
$5-billion order for new aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore Airlines does not operate McDonnell Douglas jets, and the St. 
Louis-based company was not formally invited to bid for this latest order. 
</P>
<P>
 The big order indicates that Singapore Airlines, which flies to 70 cities in 
40 countries, plans to increase both its geographical reach and the frequency 
of its service, analysts said. The carrier is already considered one of the 
industry's financially stronger airlines.

 Lockheed Indicted on Influence Charge: Lockheed Corp. and two of its former 
executives were charged by a federal grand jury in Atlanta with violating the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta announced. 
The indictment alleges that Calabasas-based Lockheed paid a consultant more 
than $1 million to use her influence with Egyptian officials to help Lockheed 
sell three C-130 Hercules airplanes to Egypt for $79 million in 1989.Lockheed, 
whose aircraft manufacturing group is based in Marietta, Ga., said it 
"emphatically denies the allegations" and plans to "vigorously defend itself 
against the charges." The individuals indicted are Allen R. Love, former 
Marietta-based director of Middle East and North Africa sales, and Suleiman A. 
Nassar, former regional vice president in Switzerland for Lockheed Corp. 
International, the office said. Efforts to reach the two for comment were 
unsuccessful.

 IDB Expects New Auditor Soon: The Culver City telecommunications company said 
that by the end of the month it probably will hire a replacement for Deloitte & 
Touche, which quit in a dispute with IDB over the company's accounting 
practices. Separately, an IDB executive confirmed that President Edward Cheramy 
was two months tardy in reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission 
that he sold 300,000 shares in March. The executive called Cheramy's action "an 
honest mistake" that occurred when he changed brokerage firms after moving his 
personal residence from Los Angeles to Jackson Hole, Wyo.

MEXICO RESTRICTS WORK ON CHRYSLER PLANT; NAFTA: MOVE IS SEEN AS AN ATTEMPT TO 
COUNTER ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS OF CRITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In an apparent attempt to show they are serious about enforcing environmental 
regulations, Mexican authorities have halted some construction at the site of 
Chrysler's Ram pickup truck plant, scheduled to open south of Saltillo early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in charge of environmental protection said Wednesday that the 
government took the action because the company failed to conduct environmental 
impact studies or obtain building permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The studies are indispensable to protecting the environment and to avoiding 
possible damages that could be irreparable," a statement from the attorney 
general for environmental protection said. 
</P>
<P>
 The action against Chrysler appears to be designed to counter concerns by 
critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement that U.S. and Canadian 
manufacturers will flee to Mexico to escape pollution controls in their home 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has made similar announcements in the past, and critics noted 
that previous work stoppages have been temporary and that punishments for 
violations have not been severe. 
</P>
<P>
 The multimillion-dollar Chrysler project includes an electric power substation 
and a natural gas pipeline that would cross the mid-sized city of Saltillo. The 
assembly plant, which would have a capacity of 110,000 trucks a year, is 200 
miles southwest of Laredo, Tex. It is scheduled to produce pickups mainly for 
export to the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler de Mexico spokesman Leopoldo Silva said construction of the factory 
continues, but he confirmed that work on the substation and pipeline have been 
halted. He said a paperwork mix-up was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as the documentation is checked and verified, we should be able to 
open immediately," he said. "We have done the studies." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican environmental law calls for studies of any construction that could 
cause "ecological disequilibriums" and specifically requires reports to federal 
authorities on natural gas pipelines, electric transmission installations and 
automotive plants. 
</P>
<P>
 NAFTA will gradually eliminate barriers to trade among the United States, 
Mexico and Canada. It was strongly opposed by U.S. labor unions, including the 
United Auto Workers. 
</P>
<P>
 As NAFTA opponents argued that U.S. companies would use the agreement to move 
production to Mexico to take advantage of lax environmental controls, Mexico 
strengthened its anti-pollution laws and beefed up enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a lot of criticism lately about Mexico's follow-up to NAFTA," 
said Geoff Land, border coordinator for the Border Ecology Project in Bisbee, 
Ariz. "If this means that Mexico is taking a closer look at companies setting 
up there that could have a negative environmental impact, that's good." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he also noted that "every few weeks or months, an incident like this 
brings up the question of whether Mexico is finally getting serious about 
environmental enforcement."

10,000 STRIKE CATERPILLAR IN 3 STATES; LABOR: COMPANY MOVES TO REPLACE UAW 
MEMBERS IN COLORADO, ILLINOIS AND PENNSYLVANIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 10,000 members of the United Auto Workers union stayed off the job 
at Caterpillar Inc. on Wednesday in the first full day of a nationwide strike 
against the heavy-equipment maker. 
</P>
<P>
 The company began accepting applications for new workers as union members 
walked out of Caterpillar plants in three states. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are fed up with the way the company is treating them," said Walt 
Koprowski, chairman of the bargaining committee for UAW Local 2096 in Pontiac, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 The union said nearly all its 14,000 members are out on strike at Caterpillar 
plants in Illinois, Colorado and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor dispute has been bitter and longstanding, and unionized workers have 
been working without a contract at the company for the past two years. They 
went back to work without a contract after a five-month strike in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar and union officials reported no trouble at the struck plants, 
where company security guards filmed the striking workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company has their guards out there along with their own security guards. 
They film us, but our members are handling themselves very well," Koprowski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 UAW spokesman Roger Kerson disputed management claims that 26% of the Peoria, 
Ill.-area workers crossed picket lines Tuesday. "Take whatever the company 
tells you, divide by 10 and you might be close," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerson said no new talks are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peoria-based Caterpillar, which is the world's largest maker of earth-moving 
equipment, also said it received more than 100 applications in the mail from 
prospective employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are taking applications today (Wednesday)," spokesman Keith Butterfield 
said, adding that the company has received a good response to advertisements it 
placed for permanent workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield said a growing number of UAW workers are crossing picket lines 
systemwide. He said the number is "significantly" higher than the 1,100 who 
reported to work during the first shift at Peoria-area plants Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield would not say how significantly production has been hurt, but he 
said the company is confident it can meet customer needs. The walkout is the 
first nationwide strike at Caterpillar since UAW members returned to work in 
April, 1992, following a 163-day work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike was supposed to begin at 11 p.m. EDT Tuesday. But several thousand 
UAW members at the Illinois plants left their jobs Monday evening after the 
breakdown of federally mediated talks between the union and the company earlier 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout caps months of rising tensions between Caterpillar and its UAW 
members, who compose about 28% of the company's worldwide work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last fall, union members have staged nine short unfair-labor-practice 
strikes at Caterpillar plants from Pennsylvania to Illinois. The most recent 
one started June 7 at the Aurora, Ill., plant when, the UAW claims, four union 
members were illegally suspended for displaying signs that read, "Cat treats 
workers like dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Labor Relations Board has filed 92 labor-practice complaints 
against Caterpillar.

 Instead of using a special carrying case, I pack my computer in a large book 
bag. A book bag or workout bag is a more discreet way of carrying an expensive 
piece of equipment around in public.Also, it fits better under an airplane 
seat. It is unwise to stow a sensitive laptop in an overhead bin, where it 
might shift in flight and -- heaven forbid -- hit someone in the head as he or 
she opens the bin. 
</P>
<P>
 I put components like the detachable track-ball mouse, extra power unit and a 
small modem into drawstring "stuff sacks" purchased from camping outfitters. I 
pop the computer itself into a larger stuff sack, pack my manuals around the 
unit to absorb the shocks from jarring, and put diskettes into a Velcro wallet. 
Finally, I make sure that the book bag, diskette wallet and the computer are 
labeled with my name and destination phone number.

 * The Bolsa index steadied Wednesday, easing by a fraction of a point, even 
though the peso hit its lowest level of the year against the dollar. Analysts 
said the Mexican market basically tracked the U.S. market, which also steadied 
after three days of losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * The peso closed at 3.38 to the dollar compared to 3.37 on Tuesday. At the 
start of the year, a dollar bought 3.11 pesos. The currency's ongoing weakness 
reflects concerns about the August presidential election and rising terrorist 
attacks against the government. As foreign and domestic investors alike trim 
Mexican security holdings, the peso could fall further.

 Russian Central Bank Report Forecasts 18% Decline in GDP: The nation's economy 
will contract much more sharply this year than the government predicted if 
monetary conditions remain tight, the Central Bank of Russia said in a report. 
But easing credit in an effort to stimulate production would only lead to 
further inflation, the report says, because enterprises have not taken steps to 
adapt to the needs of the market and their products will not find buyers.The 
forecast says inflation-adjusted gross domestic product will fall 18% this year 
from 1993, sharper than the 8% to 10% drop projected by the government earlier 
this year and the 12% drop seen in 1993. The central bank said the main force 
behind the decline will be an expected 25% decline in industrial output this 
year. "The whole of 1994 could become one of industrial decline unprecedented 
in the whole history of Russian reforms," it said.

which are discussing funding for Hong Kong's new airport, could sign an accord 
as early as Friday, according to Chinese officials. The Sino-British Airport 
Committee, which must approve the funding agreement, will meet Friday morning 
to discuss financing of the $20-billion airport and railway link. Longstanding 
differences over debt financing remain a stumbling block, but not an 
insurmountable one, a Chinese official said.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; A BROKER CAN GET YOU A ROOM AT THE 
INN

 Conventions and events are the bane of the average business traveler who needs 
to get to a city quickly on short notice. Often they can appear to usurp every 
available hotel room for miles around. 
</P>
<P>
 The advance publicity surrounding World Cup '94, for example, made business 
travelers fearful they wouldn't be able to find rooms during June and July in 
game cities, many of which are major business travel destinations. As it turned 
out, hotel bookings have been less than expected, and most cities are 
wide-open, said Kathryn Cochran, spokeswoman for the Washington-based Hotel & 
Motel Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Los Angeles psychiatrist David Turken tried to attend the American 
Psychiatric Assn.'s annual meeting in Philadelphia. Though he had already 
purchased an airline ticket, he was not able to find a room. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were completely sold out," he said. "I could have gone, but I would have 
had to stay way out of town." After weighing the prospect of commuting in 
rush-hour traffic in a city he didn't know to attend early-morning breakfast 
meetings, he decided not to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Business travelers who encounter difficulty finding rooms during peak travel 
seasons do have some options. 
</P>
<P>
 One that is gaining in popularity, especially among small and medium-sized 
companies with limited travel budgets, is to use a discount room broker or 
"consolidator" to find space.  
</P>
<P>
 Discount brokers grew out of the overbuilt hotel market about three years ago, 
said Robert Diener, president of Dallas-based Hotel Reservations Network, one 
of the oldest and largest of the discount brokerage services. Because of the 
surplus of rooms, average occupancy rates were running in the mid-60% range, he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hotels, which need about 70% occupancy to break even, were looking for ways to 
book more rooms. Consolidators offered them a way to guarantee a certain number 
of room sales every year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Discounters buy blocks of rooms from hotels on an annual basis, then resell 
them to the public at prices far below the hotels' regular rates.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the discounters buy in large volumes, they are able to get the rooms 
much cheaper than an individual could. They also get a commission on each room 
they sell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels sell blocks to discounters because it helps guarantee income during 
off-peak times, Diener said. The consolidator, in turn, has rooms to sell 
during prime travel seasons or special events. 
</P>
<P>
 Discount hotel rates can be as much as 40% lower than corporate rates.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, a first-class room that normally books for $150 in New York City 
could cost as little as $69 through a discounter. A luxury room that runs 
between $200 and $300 starts at $109 through a broker, Diener said. Economy 
rooms that regularly run $90 a night start at $59. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of discount brokerage services, many specializing in 
certain cities or certain types of accommodations. San Diego, San Francisco, 
Chicago and Charleston, for example, have room brokers that specialize in those 
cities. Hotel Reservations Network offers rooms in 22 cities, including Los 
Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Washington, Boston, Orlando, 
Honolulu, London and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokers are not heavily advertised, and most people find them through 
specialty travel publications or word of mouth, Diener said. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the local chamber of commerce or convention and visitors bureau will 
know of booking services for an area. 
</P>
<P>
 When using a consolidator, always ask about the cancellation policy and make 
sure you understand when and how you can get a refund if your plans change. 
Most booking services, like many hotels, will not refund your money if you 
cancel your reservation within 24 or 48 hours. Also, use a credit card when 
making your reservation so that if you need to cancel, you can have the money 
credited to your account instead of waiting for a check.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bookings through consolidators have multiplied five- to tenfold in the past 
two years, Diener said. And one of the fastest-growing customer segments is the 
small to mid-sized company with a tight travel budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Large corporations can negotiate rates directly with hotels, Diener said. But 
small and mid-sized companies can't offer hotels the volume of business they 
would need to get a discount rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Another strategy for finding rooms in a tight market is to call the city's 
convention and visitors bureau. Some bureaus, such as the one in Phoenix, will 
actually help you book a room, said Gary Sherwin, spokesman for the Los Angeles 
Convention & Visitors Bureau. Though most don't act as booking agents, they can 
give you the names of hotels to try in nearby cities and offer transportation 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 You can often find a room in a suburb of the city you're traveling to, Sherwin 
said. "Usually it's just a few minutes away, but because it doesn't have the 
same name, people don't know to try it." 
</P>
<P>
 For the more adventurous, the bureau can also give out names of alternative 
lodging, such as hostels.  
</P>
<P>
 Though they are most popular with students, hostels sometimes attract European 
business travelers looking for an authentic regional experience, Sherwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers can also try corporate apartments. Though these are typically for 
longer-term stays, they occasionally stand in as hotel rooms when hotels are 
booked. 
</P>
<P>
 One last word of advice for travelers who think they are shut out of certain 
cities: Keep trying. 
</P>
<P>
 For most events, no city is ever completely booked, Sherwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very often, (the events) get so hyped up, people are afraid to come to the 
community," he said, "but it's not a sellout, despite what people are 
thinking."

RENO AIR FLIGHTS AT JOHN WAYNE DELAYED AT LEAST WEEK; AVIATION: FAA ASKS FOR 
MORE REVIEW TIME AFTER COMPETITOR OBJECTS TO LOW-FARE CARRIER'S PROPOSED 
CONTRACT WITH COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Reno Air, the discount airline that hopes to bring its low-fare service to 
John Wayne Airport, won't touch down in Orange County for at least another 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline had planned to take over up to six of American Airlines' flights 
from Orange County to San Jose as early as today.But questions from the Federal 
Aviation Administration and competitor United Airlines have delayed the launch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors approved Reno Air's plan in concept 
last week. At the request of the FAA, however, airport officials withdrew the 
final contract from the board's agenda this week and postponed discussion on it 
until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to start service as early as" Wednesday, said Sue Putnam, a 
spokeswoman for Reno Air. "We're still confident that the service will begin." 
</P>
<P>
 United objected to the terms of the proposed contract with the county. As a 
result, the FAA asked for more time to review the deal, said Steve Blanchard, 
an aide to Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 New airlines typically have to wait their turn for departure slots at John 
Wayne Airport, which has numerous limitations because of noise restrictions. 
The newcomers also generally receive only two slots. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement with the county, American Airlines would still have 
authority over the slots but would let Reno Air use them, said Courtney 
Wiercioch, spokeswoman for the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air's authority to fly out of John Wayne Airport would expire on Sept. 
30, when airport officials hope to have a new policy for granting access.

 Junk Bond Sale: Orange County home builder Presley Cos. is expected to go to 
Wall Street this week to sell $200 million in junk bonds through underwriter 
Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette in New York. The bonds were rated single-B-minus by 
Standard & Poor's Corp., the New York rating firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the offering will be used to retire high-interest-rate debt as 
part of the company's capital restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley, based in Newport Beach, builds homes in California, New Mexico and 
Arizona, though most of its business is in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recently completed quasi-reorganization in combination with this new 
financing should well position Presley to benefit from a gradually improving 
Southern California economy," S&P said in its report, but it also noted that 
the builder remains highly leveraged, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 
nearly 70%.

BALBOA FUN ZONE IS SOLD TO OPERATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Balboa Fun Zone, which has been for sale since being placed in 
receivership in 1992, has been sold to the park's operators -- two men who 
first worked for the small amusement park before they were teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started working here in 1951 as 12-year-olds, picking up paper and blowing 
up balloons," said Joe Tunstall, who has operated the park for several years 
with Bob Speth."Now, we own it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tunstall and Speth, both 56, have been operating the park's Ferris wheel, 
bumper cars and other attractions under a lease since 1985. The park went into 
receivership in March, 1992, after a Japanese buyer defaulted on a 
$10.1-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunstall declined to discuss the sales price, but the property had been 
offered for about $5 million. One real estate industry spokesman who is 
familiar with the property said the Fun Zone sold for "something near the 
$5-million asking price." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have no major changes planned at the small park that has been in 
operation for more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have a new kiddie ride but nothing major," Tunstall said. "We still 
want to cater to the parent and grandparent trade, the baby stroller crowd."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: BANK SALE FUNDS WILL GO TO SAVE TUSTIN UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 West Coast Bancorp, trying to salvage its struggling Sunwest Bank unit, said 
Wednesday that it has agreed to sell its majority interest in its healthy 
Sacramento bank subsidiary in a deal worth up to $7.5 million in cash and 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The holding company is expected to put nearly $4.5 million from the sale of 
its 94% stake in Sacramento First National Bank into Sunwest Bank, a Tustin 
bank operating under severe restrictions imposed by federal regulators.Sunwest, 
with $186.8 million in loans and other assets, lost $9.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 West Coast will sell Sacramento First, a three-branch operation with $120 
million in assets, to Business & Professional Bank in Woodland for $4 million 
in cash, $2.5 million worth of the buyer's stock and up to $1 million more in 
cash, depending on the performance of Sacramento First's loan portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 West Coast said it hopes to complete the transaction, which is subject to 
approval by state and federal regulators and by shareholders of both banks, by 
the end of the year.

 Foothold in Asia: Century 21 Real Estate Corp., the international real estate 
brokerage, has opened 30 offices in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding that foreign markets are increasingly receptive to U.S. home-selling 
techniques, Irvine-based Century 21 is stepping up its activity overseas, 
especially since the real estate downturn at home.With more than 6,000 
franchises, the company now has operations in 15 countries, having recently 
signed franchise agreements in Puerto Rico and Belgium, Luxembourg and the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, taking aggressive home-selling strategies to other countries can 
sometimes mean a culture clash. In Hong Kong, for instance, sellers don't 
usually put for-sale signs in their yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the real estate practices that we take for granted, such as yard 
signs and multiple listing services, are relatively new in many international 
markets," said Richard J. Loughlin, chief executive officer of Century 21.

 Winning Builders: Irvine Co. has selected several firms to build single-family 
homes in the company's Northwood 5 project near Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve builders were vying for the opportunity, but the developer tapped five 
with which to negotiate exclusively. The winners: Kaufman & Broad in Los 
Angeles, Costain Homes in Newport Beach, Standard Pacific Corp. in Costa Mesa, 
Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd. in Laguna Hills and Pardee Construction of 
Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were very pleased to have such depth and breadth of builder interest in 
this project, which suggests improving economic conditions and strong 
confidence about this location," which is in an unincorporated area of Orange 
County near Jeffrey Road, said Larry Thomas, spokesman for Irvine Co.

THEN, IN THE END; AS THE SCHOOL YEAR WINDS DOWN, STUDENTS FACE NEW CHALLENGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New black parking lots have given La Quinta High School a crisp look, just in 
time for the national education inspectors. Word is in that campus has passed 
with flying colors. Oh, that all 1,300 students here would. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the student store, overseen by popular Spanish teacher Larry James, the 
mood is jocular, the talk of graduation and summer jobs. In this teen-age 
community called high school, the place functions like the town general store. 
</P>
<P>
 During lunch and between classes, students drop in to buy sodas and snacks. 
James makes change and small talk. When he's coaching volleyball and advising 
student leaders, the talk can get more personal. He has been a confidante since 
I was a student here. 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, I divulged nothing to him before I graduated in 1977, barely 
surviving in his Spanish class. I spent more time that year aimlessly driving 
around in my friend's car smoking cigarettes, or making out with my boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditching school was my escape from grief and the responsibilities inherited as 
my mother's body slowly surrendered to cancer. Back then I just felt like a 
failure, even as senior class treasurer. James treated me no differently for my 
absences, and I used to thank him for giving me extra credit for painting a 
poster: Seniors are Numero Uno.  
</P>
<P>
 It's easier to see now why many students -- boys and girls -- have entrusted 
James with their triumphs and fears. He and his wife have taken some students 
into their home while parental battles were worked out. That has not changed, 
even as the student population in the past 17 years has shifted from mostly 
white to mostly Asian, from comfortably middle-class to 40% of the campus being 
enrolled in the subsidized lunch program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are kids," said James, who was briefly stranded after school one day 
after loaning his car to a student. "Culture and language are the only 
differences over the years. Interracial dating is on the rise, and we sell 
(Vietnamese) grass jelly drink in the student store now. But the kids' concerns 
are the same as they ever were: boyfriends, girlfriends and grades." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is more often what we hear about teen-agers, but high school life here 
is far more ordinary -- certainly less dramatic -- than crime reports and TB 
scares. And there is far more good news than bad at this modest campus. 
</P>
<P>
 A camera panning school life would reveal snapshots of both on some days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Class of '94 is noticeably more academic than others, and five students 
have tied for valedictorian. Only one gave the commencement speech at exercises 
for about 300 blue-robed seniors Monday because "otherwise," principal Mitch 
Thomas says with a laugh, "we'd be there all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Prom Queen Lynn Phu, the well-liked co-president of the Vietnamese Club, has 
been accepted at and will attend UC Davis in the fall. This is thanks to her 
grades and application essay citing her community service and quotations of 
author Pearl S. Buck. Some kids are takers. She is a giver. Charming and 
helpful, she hopes to become a schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanh Tang, student body vice president and son of restaurant owners, has 
reached his goal of earning a 4.0 grade point average as this semester ends and 
will major in business law at UCLA come September. He plans to share a nearby 
apartment with three other La Quinta classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 His dream of Harvard was abandoned because Massachusetts is so far from his 
family, and the cost is too high. But he has already earned a $1,500 
scholarship and has applied for more. 
</P>
<P>
 Amber McCammack, 18 on Father's Day, is trying to find a job, hopefully a 
full-time clerical position, until she can save enough to move into an 
apartment. Then, she says, she will reconsider college. 
</P>
<P>
 Pregnancy and childbirth in her junior year caused her grades to drop. A 
clarinet player, she wanted to attend Berklee College of Music in Boston, but 
audition tapes were due the first of November, and she missed the deadline due 
to marching and concert band demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "College is on the back burner until I know what's going to happen with work 
and the money situation," she says. "But I've got a real hope to be something 
in music. It's been in my life since I was born." 
</P>
<P>
 She has spent her senior year attending adult-education classes to pick up 
office skills and recently took a typing test for an employment agency looking 
for a law office clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were seeking someone who types at least 40 words per minute, and I stunk 
on the test," she said one day after school. "Normally I can type 47 to 50 
words per minute, but I did 39 -- I guess because I was nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 She hasn't heard back. 
</P>
<P>
 Her grades are pretty good, and she is getting along well with family and her 
boyfriend, who got kicked out of La Quinta for swearing at a teacher and then 
didn't get enrolled at a continuation school. He plays in a rock band but, 
Amber says, he will start looking for a job when he is 18. She sees him almost 
daily after school. 
</P>
<P>
 Two things are weighing most on her mind now, flattening her voice to a dull 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dunno," she explains. "Once I turn 18 my mom's (medical) insurance doesn't 
cover me anymore, so I'm kinda screwed there. I worry about that a lot. It's 
been on my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Was there anything else making her blue? She sighs heavily and gives it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was supposed to get the pictures of the baby last month, and I didn't, so 
I'm kind of pissed. Every three months (the adoptive mother) sends them, but 
she hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask her how old her daughter is, and she asks for the date, then does the math 
in her head quickly. "She's one year, two months and seven days. I last saw 
pictures of her in February. She's got my blue eyes, and she's getting curly 
hair, which her father is pretty happy about. It's got red in it. She looks a 
lot older than she is." 
</P>
<P>
 Amber knows that to see the child in person is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, when she turns 18 and it's legal to look for her, I will. It's 
funny. I can be in the worst mood, and I come home and the pictures are sitting 
there, and I am the happiest person in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 She is excited about graduating and detects a strong case of "senioritis" on 
campus as the school year closes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how school works: As freshman you are scum; you are nobody, you are 
nothing. As sophomores you move a step up the ladder: You still don't know much 
but you're learning. Then you are juniors; they know everything, they're always 
on the ball. And seniors -- all they can think of is graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "But my junior year I was more worried about having my baby. Wouldn't you know 
it? My peak year." She giggles. "Oh, well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Students such as Eric Sizelove seem to have lived several years' worth of 
turbulence this semester. The promising water polo player we met a few stories 
ago was kicked out of La Quinta on March 23 for knocking out a fellow student 
with two punches, ruining what coaches expected to be a successful swim team 
season, possibly even a CIF bid. 
</P>
<P>
 His dream had been to work out an athletic scholarship and attend a four-year 
school, maybe Cal State Long Beach. But his dismissal, he says, has ruined all 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 He feels sorry for himself, puts the rap on the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went from going somewhere to going nowhere. I blame La Quinta, because La 
Quinta knew that was going to happen."  
</P>
<P>
 When pushed, he concedes: "I should have backed away. You know how it is; it 
was a stupid mistake on my part. If I would've known what would happen. . . 
(but) I wasn't concerned about that. The guy made me mad, and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 A bright student who excels, Eric has the potential to be somebody. But his 
father dying young and his mother ailing now have left him angry at everyone, 
says his mother, Elaine Sizelove, 41, starting to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't dealt with me dying," she says with difficulty. "He's mad at me for 
that, but we never talk about it. He says, 'Mom, you used to be able to change 
the oil on a Harley (motorcycle) yourself. Now you can't do anything.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Eric has struggled through school with a learning disability. Recognizing the 
strikes against him, principal Thomas, teachers and coaches kept a tight rein 
on him. When he would start to slip, they would grab his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was with particular sadness that they sent him away after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 He was allowed to attend the Garden Grove Unified School District's Lake 
Continuation School, where all he met were students he deemed losers. So he 
resumed hanging with the gang members from his neighborhood, near Westminster 
Avenue and Edwards Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding he needed a fresh scene, Eric drove each Tuesday to adult education 
classes in Riverside, where he earned his final credits toward a high school 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
 But in May he was arrested on a felony charge after a fight in which police 
pulled up to find him clutching a Club car security device. Gang members showed 
up and broke his car windows outside a florist, he said, and he chased them. 
The charges were dismissed, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also been arrested again, this time for carrying a concealed weapon -- 
a sickle -- in his car. The "grim reaper thing" belonged to a friend, he said, 
along with a toy gun also found beneath his spare tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he sorts out his problems, he is restless and spending considerable time 
in his room, where the walls are covered with his pencil drawings and graffiti. 
Sports trophies cover a dresser top. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news: Eric says he sees now that he is bound for prison or a path of 
failures if he does not change course. He is a bundle of contradicting remarks, 
though, from one conversation to the next. I tell him I will call before this 
story runs to make sure he is not behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 He laughs a little, but he knows I am only half-kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 For now he and his mother are getting along, they both say, talking tough but 
honest with each other, painful as it is for both. 
</P>
<P>
 "He punches walls in his bedroom, and I say, 'It's your bedroom but my home.' 
It's hard to watch your kid take his lumps, but you have to," his mother says. 
"But he's trying now. It's cool." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so scared of going to jail," he says, "but if something happens now that 
I'm driving around Orange County now, I'm gonna have to take care of it, and if 
I get caught and go to jail, I do. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm changing my life," he says, saying goodby for now as yet another 
friend pages him on his beeper. "If I want to do this, I can do this."

</P>
<P>
 By last week, the La Quinta campus was pumping with passion about two big news 
events: the baseball team's ride to glory and a new TB scare. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Debi French, who relapsed into a highly drug-resistant strain of 
tuberculosis late last year, had part of her lung removed in late May to stop 
the disease after first-line medications failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her case attracted a horde of reporters to the school. The attention had 
students outraged -- not over the disease, but over media coverage. They found 
it for the most part sensational and misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're tired of being 'TB High,' " said civics teacher Doug Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
 All 1,300 students were tested this month for TB. Preliminary screenings 
showed that 97 additional students and nine staff members have tested positive 
for the bacteria that can later cause the disease (there is a 10% chance of 
contracting it in the lifetime of a person testing positive). 
</P>
<P>
 But there are only 17 active cases detected since the problem emerged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of understandably unnerved parents called or visited the principal's 
office, where they were mostly calmed with the assurance that officials were 
doing all they could. Parents were told what the students by now had learned: 
TB is difficult to contract and easy to treat. 
</P>
<P>
 Those on campus who tested positive for TB have been interviewed by the county 
health department and the Centers for Disease Control to track all the people 
with whom they have had the close contact necessary to transmit the virus. 
Follow-up work will stretch well into summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than distance the students, the notoriety has spawned a 
circle-the-wagons mentality on campus, with students bound together against 
what they think are ill-informed media and other outsiders. They seem to spare 
me this wrath because I haven't covered the daily new stories.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's drawn us all closer, not apart," says senior Deanna Del Monte, 17. 
</P>
<P>
 At an assembly June 10, Debi French, who has not returned to class, was 
presented with a signed ball by the CIF-winning baseball team. She took briefly 
to a microphone for a few tearful words to her schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'I'm sorry this happened, and I put you through this,' " Deanna recalls her 
saying. "Everybody was crying and hugging each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The administration served cookies and punch that day as a morale booster, and 
it further created a We Survived the Scare bonding. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 10 a.m. history class last week, the students seemed knowledgeable about 
TB. They seemed to accept the testing interruptions and extensive questioning 
about their associations with people. But they have suffered most, they say, 
from the subsequent stigma. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids who tested positive are still negative for (active) TB, and you 
don't get that feeling from the newspaper," said Amber Jones, 15. "But even so, 
my best friend's father didn't want to be near me. He made my best friend wash 
all of my clothes that she had at her house." 
</P>
<P>
 At a CIF baseball game at La Quinta, the parent of an opposing team player 
wore a surgical mask in the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked by their bus that day," Deanna says with amazement, "and the players 
were, you know, being guys (translation: flirting). And they said, 'Do you go 
to this school?' And I said, 'Would it matter?' " So they knew, and they were 
saying . . . 'TB' " 
</P>
<P>
 Getting summer jobs is a major worry for La Quinta students, who say they have 
been asked by some prospective employers for proof that they have tested 
negative for TB. 
</P>
<P>
 "They treat you," Amber says, "like they treat people who have AIDS. Now we 
know what that feels like." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the principal and others are concerned about any impact the 
TB situation may have on enrollment come September, when parents will be 
allowed for the first time to decide which district school their child attends. 
But since the first case of TB among La Quinta students was detected, 
enrollment has actually risen slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are otherwise calm about the outbreak -- the nation's largest at a 
school -- and understand that most cases can be treated if addressed early and 
diligently. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Attention is far more intensely focused on this week's graduation and a future 
outside the home of the La Quinta Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
 A sea of royal blue gowns and caps fill 357 folding chairs seating La Quinta 
High School's Class of '94. Most of the seniors are wearing sunglasses; others 
squint into the bright sunlight beating down on the grass football field of 
Bolsa Grande High School, the closest campus with a stadium big enough for 
Monday's graduation ceremonies. American flags flutter beside the rows of 
students. Coincidental to this momentous occasion, a pink inflated King Kong 
floats in the air above a car dealership across the eastbound Garden Grove 
Freeway that flanks the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Both light-hearted and brimming with profundity, the commencement speakers 
quote Henry David Thoreau, poet Robert Frost, the Revs. Jesse Jackson and 
Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, former New York Mayor Ed Koch and U2 lead 
singer Bono. 
</P>
<P>
 Introductions are made by a girl-boy team of Naheed Simjee and school 
newspaper editor Chris Dutton, both of whom refer to the year's major news 
events -- on and off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through floods, fires, riots," Chris recalls, " . . . or what 
about the earthquake that shook school second period?" He reassures his 
classmates that if they made it through the TB spotlight, "we can make it 
through the times ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Phu, the aspiring teacher bound for UC Davis, soon takes the podium, 
urging the people with whom she has spent four pivotal years to always have a 
dream to chase. She reminds them that they have lived harmoniously inside their 
campus community in a way many neighborhoods have not yet managed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest lesson I've ever learned in school came not from a textbook but 
from all of you," Phu tells her classmates. "You've taught me to understand, 
accept and appreciate each other's differences. La Quinta itself is a 
multicultural society, one that is still in its infant years but has already 
proven to have the potential of becoming a model for the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my belief that every generation that rises in this world brings with it 
a new culture that is irreplaceable. . . . No matter how much has been said 
that history repeats itself, I can promise you that there will never be another 
Class of 1994, especially the one that you and I know."

MEET HER ELEGANCY, QUEEN OF HER CLOSETS; COLLECTOR: DONA EVANS OF SANTA ANA HAS 
SAVED ALMOST EVERYTHING SHE HAS WORN SINCE 1953, INCLUDING HATS, GLOVES, SHOES 
AND JEWELRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dona Evans opens a faded gold hatbox and pulls out a billowy creation covered 
in ostrich feathers that has been preserved in tissue paper for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a time capsule, the hatbox and its contents recall the days when a woman 
was not considered fully dressed unless she was wearing a hat and gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans remembers the era well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '50s, while still just a teen-ager, she developed a love for glamour 
and began to cultivate an extensive wardrobe. Although her claim to royalty was 
limited to a stint as Miss Chevrolet and Miss Yo-Yo for Duncan Yo-Yos, she 
often dressed like a queen in flamboyant hats and gloves that matched her 
outfits to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then I never walked out the door without a hat and gloves," Evans says. 
"You didn't feel totally dressed without them." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans found a way to preserve this age of elegance that all but vanished in 
the mid-'60s: The 58-year-old Santa Ana resident has saved almost everything 
she has worn since 1953, including a few bustiers and bras. 
</P>
<P>
 She has stacks of hats -- at least 50 by her rough estimate -- in their 
original boxes. She snaps open an old suitcase stuffed with gloves of every 
length and color, at least 200 pairs in all. 
</P>
<P>
 She would rival Imelda Marcos with her immense shoe collection, which has 
taken over her linen closet. In four decades she has worn out and discarded 
only two pairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans has held onto all of these things for one reason: 
</P>
<P>
 "I always hoped they'd come back in style," she says. "And they are starting 
to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Her collection would be the envy of museums, vintage clothing buyers and 
anyone who loves fashion, except that Evans has never bothered to show them 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until one of her friends began encouraging her to come out of the closet 
has she begun to unveil her treasures. She says she is thinking of forming a 
club with others who share a love of vintage clothing and hopes to loan her 
items to a museum for an exhibit. What she has could fill a small gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 There are picture hats with ostrich plumes dyed deep shades of fuchsia, royal 
blue or purple, and others with silk organza cabbage roses covering their wide 
brims. There's a turquoise garden party hat with a square-shaped brim decked 
with silk roses -- a real head-turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the purses she has saved over the years: funky footlong envelope styles 
in metallic '50s colors like pink and turquoise; hard plastic handbags, some 
with mother-of-pearl and metallic confetti inlays, and a tiny brass bag that 
looks like a miniature bird cage. 
</P>
<P>
 She has boxes filled with costume jewelry, including complete "suite" sets of 
matching earrings, necklaces, bracelets and brooches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted things to match," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She has unusual pieces such as a single leaf-shaped earring of thin gold-toned 
metal and faux pearls that curls over the top of her head like a miniature hat, 
or a leafy pair of black-and-white sequined clip-ons that extend above the 
earlobe instead of below it -- designed to be worn with a swept-up hairdo. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her '50s-era shoes look new, such as the clear plastic mules with 
colored rhinestones or the pumps covered in a floral-printed black and ruby 
silk. 
</P>
<P>
 Vintage dresses, most of them fitted sheaths and a few of them originals 
designed by Mr. Blackwell and left over from Evans' modeling days, still hang 
in her closet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still drag them out and wear them because they keep coming back in style," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the baggies filled with old gloves: a bright orange short pair and an 
above-the-elbow avocado pair from the '60s, as well as assorted gloves in 
almost every shade of blue, from robin's egg to royal. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans' collection was born out of an appreciation for elegance, a word that 
turns up often in her vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child she played dress-up with her mother's hats, handbags and clothes. 
She loved watching old movies like "Gone With the Wind" that showed actresses 
in beautiful ball gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'I would love to get into those,' " she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans grew up in the exclusive areas of San Diego, but she says her family was 
never wealthy like many of their neighbors. In high school she remembers 
envying the girls with huge wardrobes. She says her father was conservative; he 
thought that having a different outfit for each day of the week was sufficient 
for a girl. Evans thought otherwise. She can still remember the name of a 
classmate who had "endless cashmere sweaters." 
</P>
<P>
 How she was able to acquire her inventory is a tale of hard work, 
determination and a passion for fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 While going to school she started earning money to buy clothes. She sold 
flowers, washed dishes, knit and sewed clothes for people and worked part time 
for the phone company. She spent the money on accessories like hats, handbags 
and her beloved cashmere sweaters that she could not make on her sewing 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 With an eye for quality, she would put a cashmere sweater on layaway and pay 
it off in monthly installments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sold telephone stock to buy a white fox fur stole," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 A receipt for a blue feathered hat found tucked in a hatbox reveals that Evans 
never scrimped on her wardrobe. The price of the hat, purchased at Bullock's in 
Santa Ana in 1956, was $62.40 -- no small sum in those days, especially for a 
working girl. Yet Evans quickly points out that many of her hats cost more than 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans always wore the clothes well. Although she complains of having "football 
shoulders," her 5-foot-6 frame with its hourglass shape was tailor-made for 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen she modeled for a tony store in San Diego called the Fashion 
Quarter. Models were expected to supply their gloves and shoes, which only 
added to Evans' inventory. Through her modeling work she was able to acquire 
gems like her Blackwell originals. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans' blond good looks led to her reign as Miss Chevrolet. She wore bathing 
suits and strapless gowns she made and posed by shiny Chevys at promotional 
events from 1957 to 1960. She also drove around in a Cadillac in one of her big 
picture hats as a promotion for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Miss Chevrolet title led to a brief gig as Miss Yo-Yo; she was the 
glamorous blonde handing out prizes at yo-yo contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Now an enrolled agent/income tax expert, Evans still adds to her wardrobe. She 
frequents Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, looking for one-of-a-kind merchandise. 
She saves the new items too. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she misses the glamour of the past. She complains that people don't 
"dress" anymore. Even Hollywood actresses look "trashy." Few women, she says, 
have the elegance of Princess Diana ("she almost always wears a hat") or the 
late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elegance is being lost," she says, "and I don't think it should be."

PUTTING US BACK ON THE PATH TO VIRTUE; WHERE HAVE ALL OUR VALUES GONE? MAYBE NO 
ONE CAN ANSWER THAT, BUT SOME ARE DEVOTING THEMSELVES TO REBUILDING OUR 
NATIONAL CHARACTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ROURKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Society is taking a nose-dive. Sixty-two percent of Americans said they 
thought so in a recent Gallup poll. That number is up from 46% just 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Reversing the decline of common decency has become a national cause of late, 
attracting some of the country's most powerful people. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Sen. Pete Domenici, actor Tom Selleck and others have proposed 
a National Character Counts Week, involving school programs to instill students 
with a sense of honesty, responsibility and respect, for October. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Michael Huffington is 
campaigning on a platform of virtue. He wants citizens to volunteer for 
community service work, and he says that if elected, he will push for broader 
tax breaks for charitable donations. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Character Counts Coalition, formed last year by the Josephson 
Institute for Ethics in Marina del Rey, is working to teach core values to 
children. Members include Big Brothers/Big Sisters, the Urban League and the 
4-H Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, others with less clout are putting their own simpler, 
smaller-scale ideas to work. For all of them, building character is like 
building muscles: The old-fashioned way still works best. 
</P>
<P>
 The program getting the most attention comes in book form: "The Book of 
Virtues, a Treasury of Great Moral Stories." It is a collection of vintage 
myths, fairy tales, poems and political speeches that illustrate aspects of an 
excellent character. The Bible story of David and Goliath, for example, 
personifies courage, and two famous speeches exemplify perseverance -- Abraham 
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream." The 
author, William Bennett, intends grown-ups to read the stories to children, 
teaching them such virtues as loyalty, hard work, compassion and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 That the book has spent 26 weeks on the bestseller list, with baby boomers as 
its best customers, doesn't surprise Bennett, who served as Secretary of 
Education under President Ronald Reagan and head of the George Bush 
Administration's office of drug control policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think the country's going to hell," he says, ticking off a list of 
complaints: "Crime, family disintegration, social breakdown, sleaziness, 
general trashy behavior." Although he and his "The Book of Virtues" have 
touched a nerve, critics say the book is a platform for future political 
ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bennett's a Johnny-come-lately to all of this, who just puts a political 
twist on it," says Ben Bycel, executive director of the Los Angeles Ethics 
Council. "Others have been working on value training for five or 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the book's emphasis on a hot topic is calling new attention to 
nonpolitical character-building programs put into practice long before Bennett 
put his into words. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody graduates from San Marcos High School, near Santa Barbara, until 
clocking at least 60 hours of community service. Principal Bob Ferguson 
compares it to the outdated tradition of Saturday morning chores. "Children are 
getting away from accepting responsibilities," he says. "Community service can 
help there." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's 1,600 students may choose from among the options posted on a 
bulletin board by various community groups. The teen-agers have helped build a 
park and clean up beaches. One boy coached a school football team this year. 
"The kids called him coach, his self-esteem improved, his grades went up," 
Ferguson says. Now the teen-ager wants to be a coach for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson believes in teaching everyday ethics. Cleaning up your act is like 
cleaning the garage, he says. "Keep it simple. Too many plans are grandiose. 
'Where do I begin? I'll begin in this corner.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. James O'Donohoe agrees. To help his students learn responsibility, 
the longtime college professor of ethics enforces a basic rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "No late papers. If they're due March 25, that's when students hand them in. 
If not, I don't accept them," he says. "We have to have a return to 
discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donohoe, of Boston College, also lectures on medical and sexual ethics to 
people in the business world, and is about to launch an ethics-counseling 
program to be used by U.S. Navy chaplains. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bennett, he favors a return to the fundamental virtues, an idea advocated 
by both Aristotle in the 1st Century and Thomas Aquinas in the Middle Ages. The 
basic plan is to build a society based on justice -- Aquinas added another 
ingredient, love -- emphasize individual character-building and put the good of 
the group ahead of individual desires. It is an honor system that depends on 
steady practice. And it is the opposite of the "me first" attitude that has 
prevailed for much of the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood has been in favor of individualism and 'what's good for our side,' " 
O'Donohoe says. "It's destroying us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donohoe and most other leaders in the trend back to virtue training believe 
the classroom is the most important launching pad. "The key problem is that we 
stopped teaching ethics in any formal way," he says. "It became identified with 
religion and you don't teach religion in public schools. But the separation of 
church and state doesn't have to mean the separation of virtue and society." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who didn't learn moral standards in school, it's not too late. Los 
Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Goul regularly teaches grown-ups the 
importance of honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "A rape victim I was defending lied on the stand, but only I knew about it," 
he says. "During the break I called her aside, talked to her, then called her 
back to the stand as my own witness. I asked her if she'd told the truth. She 
said 'no.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her public confession may have cost them the case. "Jurors are less likely to 
trust someone who lies about one thing on the stand," Goul says. "The verdict 
came back with a hung jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he would do it again. As he sees it, one lie leads to another. "What 
the country faces, each of us faces day to day. We form the moral fiber of the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Turner is determined to restore another fading practice, social 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 As president of his family's $900-million Dollar General retail business based 
in Nashville, Tenn., he offers a back-to-school deal for adults -- free 
literacy training. In the four years since the company started the program, 
27,000 adults have passed through it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We serve a low-income clientele and found an appalling level of cultural 
illiteracy among them," Turner says. "We adopted literacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to revive the spirit of social responsibility, he recently donated $4 
million to the Divinity School at Vanderbilt University, his alma mater. The 
money is earmarked for a moral leadership program. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Joseph Houff is overseeing the curriculum, which will train students to 
serve the public good through business, education and other fields. "People's 
values are formed early, but they can change," Houff says. "We want to help 
people think more clearly about the ethical good."

DANCING ON A LITERARY EDGE; CAROLE MASO ISN'T A BIG NAME -- YET. BUT SHE'S 
ENTHRALLING READERS WITH A LYRICAL RESHAPING OF THE LANGUAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLOTTE INNES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before Carole Maso begins to read, it is impossible not to pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
 She wears a dazzling pink-and-gold shawl, a diaphanous blue-and-yellow dress, 
brilliant red lipstick on her sensuous mouth. Her pale hair shines almost 
silver. 
</P>
<P>
 When she reads, all becomes clear. She is the living embodiment of her prose 
-- a two-hour explosion of verbal heat, light and color. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a very visceral experience," says a slightly stunned Matthew Krout, 
a recent UCLA graduate, as he waits in line to buy Maso's book after the 
reading, one of the Lannan Foundation's Readings and Conversations series 
hosted by KCRW's Michael Silverblatt at the Pacific Design Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I have to be in shape for this," says Lisi Rona, a Los Angeles 
poet. "She's very fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the excited reactions Maso has been getting on her 10-city tour to 
promote her latest novel, "The American Woman in a Chinese Hat," and to read 
from "Bay of Angels," a work in progress. Her readings have also inspired love 
letters and post-reading propositions, Maso says. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Maso may not have the name recognition of Danielle Steel -- she says 
she'd hate that kind of fame -- but among literati, she is on the cutting edge. 
Critics say she epitomizes all that is great about American literature today -- 
and all that is wrong with major American publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 They ignore her.

<P>
 This is nothing new, of course. Raymond Carver struggled in obscurity for 
years before being hailed as a master of the minimalist form -- although he is 
perhaps more widely known as the inspiration behind the film "Short Cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Maso may well be the next Carver. Published by small literary presses, she is 
gaining a reputation for reshaping language and form in unique, beautiful, 
experimental yet totally readable ways. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, she received a $50,000 fellowship from the Los Angeles-based Lannan 
Foundation, which honors "writers of distinctive literary merit who demonstrate 
potential for outstanding future work." Her novels "Ghost Dance," "The Art 
Lover," "AVA" and now "The American Woman in the Chinese Hat" have received 
lavish praise from reviewers and writers in every genre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moving and wonderful, and highly readable," says Stephen Koch, author of the 
nonfiction book "Double Lives" and chairman of the graduate writing division of 
the School of the Arts at Columbia University in New York, which recently hired 
Maso as a faculty member. He added that she's a dynamic teacher. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Despite such plaudits, Maso is not widely known. But many writers say "The 
American Woman in the Chinese Hat" may introduce her work to a much wider 
readership, including the very loyal audience of gay and bisexual readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Maso's earlier works contained gay characters, this is her first 
novel to focus on the erotic life of a bisexual woman. The strong turnout for 
her other Los Angeles reading -- in the Lesbian Writers Series sponsored by A 
Different Light in West Hollywood -- was proof of an audience hungry for good, 
literary explorations of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the south of France, "The American Woman" concerns a beautiful writer, 
Catherine, recovering from her breakup with her lesbian lover of many years and 
the death of her older brother from AIDS. She numbs her pain with one brief 
erotic encounter after another, mostly with women, until she meets a man, 
Lucien, whom she senses to be her match in beauty, pain and emptiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so it seems. For this book works on many levels. Most importantly, Maso 
tracks with horrifying authenticity the downward spiral of Catherine's 
depression, pulling you in, like Carver, with prose that is terse, musical and 
hypnotic. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Maso calls "The American Woman" her most accessible and her 
most autobiographical book yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel this was mirroring a very dark and bleak time in my life, and that I 
had no other way to get by, except to try to speak about this," she says in the 
same clear, lilting voice that wraps seductively around the mind at readings. 
</P>
<P>
 She started writing the novel in France in 1988 on a $20,000 National 
Endowment for the Arts grant. But depression made it increasingly difficult for 
her to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was she grieving the death from AIDS of a close friend, Gary Falk -- 
the model for characters in "The Art Lover" and "The American Woman" -- she was 
also, like her heroine, breaking up with her longtime companion, Helen Lang, a 
financial analyst for the Legal Aid Society in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was monogamy: Lang was for it; Maso wasn't. The two, who met at 
Vassar, have since reunited, and Maso says their relationship is now a central 
stable element in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like her heroine, she's sexually attracted to men, but she prefers women and 
identifies herself as a lesbian. Only once did she briefly consider a 
conventional heterosexual marriage-and-children route, until the man she was 
seeing told her that he wasn't sure he could handle the fact that she was the 
better writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since then, I've never been seduced toward that kind of life," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line on every decision is, "Will it help my work?" she says. "My 
work keeps me well, keeps me whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many great writers, from Virginia Woolf to Ernest Hemingway, Maso suffers 
from an inherited manic depression. When she feels well, there's a kind of 
electrical charge "surging through the brain. It's a mysterious thing, which 
you have to harness, of course, but it is there, and it is what I work off." 
</P>
<P>
 The downside of the illness challenges her to write about the barely 
describable experiences of madness and death. In France, even at her worst, she 
forced herself daily to jot things down in her notebook, to record how it felt. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes what emerges is very joyous, like "AVA," stylistically her most 
daring book, about a woman who has lived life to the hilt and is now dying. The 
book recounts her thoughts on the last day of her life -- disconnected, 
repetitive, randomly forming into patterns and then drifting away, as thoughts 
do. Maso wrote it after she had recovered from her experience in France. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're at a place of that much darkness, the light is blinding when you 
come back," Maso says. 
</P>
<P>
 Happiness and despair have alternated throughout her 38 years. Growing up in 
Wyckoff, N.J., the oldest of five children, Maso was always considered gifted 
by her parents, and they gave her the sense that she could "do anything. It was 
the greatest thing I got from them," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She also inherited a love of music from her father, a labor organizer who gave 
up the touring life of a jazz musician to help take care of the family. Maso 
wrote all her novels to music -- "AVA" to Bach fugues, "The American Woman" to 
French popular songs. As many have noted, it is musical rhythm that gives 
Maso's work its unique quality. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, there have been the years of unwanted but life-sustaining 
jobs, such as waitressing, that bought Maso time to write. She hit bottom on 
the way home in New York one night when a mugger threw down her bag of tips in 
disgust because it wasn't "real money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What left her most bitter, though, were editors who told her repeatedly to 
rewrite her work in a traditional narrative format. One wanted her to take 
everything out of her first book, "Ghost Dance," except the mother-daughter 
relationship -- deleting about three-quarters of the book. "Mother-daughter was 
hot" that year, she says wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews and essays, and in her role as fiction editor for the highly 
regarded Kenyon Review, Maso has blasted everyone involved in mainstream 
publishing -- from corporations in it only for the money to "whorish" writers 
who contour their styles to match the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Maso's wrath is rooted in truth, others say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the homogenizing tendency of retail American culture," says Art 
Winslow, literary co-editor at the Nation. "Writers today are faced with a 
choice: Do they want to produce commercial material, or do they want to produce 
what their head is driving them to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Maso's starving-in-the-garret years are over, at least temporarily. The 
Lannan money enabled Maso and Lang to buy a house -- a 150-year-old, three 
bedroom Colonial on 3 1/2 acres near Hudson, N.Y. It's a far cry from the tiny 
Greenwich Village apartment they share with their cats, Fauve and Coco. 
</P>
<P>
 The money also brought new creative freedom, Maso says. And that's evident in 
the ecstatic style of her novel in progress, "Bay of Angels," which focuses on 
Aunt Sophie, a character from "AVA," just before she's shot at the Nazi death 
camp at Treblinka. Another bleak theme, to be sure, but the prose glows and 
pulses with life in what sounds like a cross between poetry and the Bible's 
Book of Revelations. 
</P>
<P>
 Maso considers her talent a gift from somewhere outside her control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very humble in the face of this thing that I do," she says. "That's 
what it's about for me. It's not about money. It's not about any kind of 
notoriety. And that's so nice -- to be free."

THE GOOD-HUMOR MAN; TODD OLDHAM CAN BE SERIOUS -- SERIOUS ABOUT DESIGNING FUN, 
CHEERFUL (SOME SAY QUIRKY ) CLOTHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GERSTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "I love it," shrieks Ricki Lake, preening before a full-length mirror in a 
simple, tailored black pantsuit. "So, what do you think? Does my butt look 
big?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You look great," soothes designer Todd Oldham, who is getting Lake ready for 
the "Daytime Emmy Awards." He nips in the waistline an inch and piles the 
talk-show host's hair up in a sexy tumble of curls festooned with colorful 
rhinestone barrettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we don't want is to do some heap of beads like all the soap opera ladies 
wear," he coaches. "Because the suit is so elegant, you can go for it with the 
hair. I want them to look at you." 
</P>
<P>
 An understated black suit is hardly what we've come to associate with Oldham, 
whose witty, sexy, tongue-in-chic designs ("va-va-va-voom outfits that stop a 
room," observes boutique owner Madeleine Gallay) have made him one of Seventh 
Avenue's hippest and hottest designers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the bevy of stars who prefer his jolts of color to a boring sea of taupe 
and beige are Susan Sarandon, Rosie O'Donnell, Queen Latifah and Janet Jackson. 
Never mind that Oldham's clients tend to land on Mr. Blackwell's "Worst Dressed 
List." "Oh, please," the 32-year-old designer says, grinning. "No one takes 
that seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarandon even made the tabloids scream when she made a public appearance 
several years ago in an Oldham creation -- a loud, clingy cleavage-baring gown. 
The words Would You Be Caught Dead in This Outfit? accompanied her picture. 
Undaunted, the actress ordered a batch of Oldhams for the press tour touting 
her new film, "The Client," and brought chum Julia Roberts to the designer's 
recent fall show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Todd is more a 20th-Century artist than a designer," Gallay declares. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her customers purchased Oldham's $3,600 hand-beaded skirt with the Mona 
Lisa embroidered on one side and a Picasso portrait on the other, wore it once 
and converted it into throw pillows.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the razzmatazz gowns costing anywhere from $600 to $10,000 generate 
the most buzz, Oldham also designs understated, scrupulously fitted pieces. Ask 
him to name favorite items in his fall collection and he mentions the 
Ultrasuede and pin-striped pieces. "It was fun working with conservative 
stuff," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, most of what he did were well-made novelty pieces, but now he's 
doing more basics -- basics with his own special twist," says Joan Kaner, 
senior vice president and fashion director for Neiman Marcus. "It's helping him 
establish a good, solid base of customers who are building wardrobes, not just 
buying items." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, some people find his brand of clothing too wacky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Real-life wearability can sometimes be a problem with Todd," says a New York 
retail consultant who requested anonymity. "I mean, where does he expect you to 
wear some of these clothes? And if you're not 6 feet, with a body like Elle 
MacPherson, forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 Oldham agrees: "Our clothes aren't for everybody. Most people don't have the 
occasion to wear such extreme things. But people who have surreal lives, which 
most celebrities do to some extent, can wear my stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after Lake's fitting, Oldham is nestled on a marigold silk sofa, a 
patchwork pillow on his lap, in the corner of the SoHo loft that serves as his 
showroom. The walls are papered with a decoupage of pink-tinted newspaper. Red 
and orange ombre velvet curtains divide a large space scattered with racks of 
wildly colored clothes and rows of fanciful shoes and boots. 
</P>
<P>
 If the showroom looks nothing like the sleek, mirrored ateliers that line 
Seventh Avenue, neither does Oldham look like a typical fashion world darling. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the de rigueur white T, he sports a faded plaid cowboy shirt bought 
from his favorite purveyor, Goodwill Industries. A few of his bare toes, 
peeking out from sandals, are decorated with tattoo rings. Another piece of 
tattoo jewelry encircles his ankle. A thatch of sandy hair and boyish face with 
a crooked grin call to mind the teen-agers from "American Graffiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in a soft, unhurried cadence that hints at his Texas roots, Oldham 
talks of "not losing focus," particularly of the fact that today's clothes 
become tomorrow's dust rags. From most any other designer, such self-effacement 
would smack of pretentiousness. But not from Oldham, whom even industry cynics 
describe as sincere and sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody needs me to make anything," he says. "I'm very serious about my 
commitment to what I do, but I don't lose focus about its importance. I make 
cheerful clothes that hopefully will allow someone to express herself or just 
have fun, but that's really it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have customers who come back to us over and over because they like our 
sensibility and relate to it," he adds. "But if you buy something because 
there's security in the label, I'm sure a thousand bucks in therapy would 
probably do you better than a new black suit." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Oldham to describe his clothes and he quickly says, "luxurious," "goofy" 
and "comfortable." Ask him to describe himself and he looks perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't spend much time thinking about myself," he says. "I'm not a worrier. 
What's the point? And I'm not competitive in the slightest." 
</P>
<P>
 He's also a strict vegetarian who doesn't smoke or drink and would rather 
spend an evening at home with his dogs, Mike and Betty, than at some wingding 
with Calvin and Kelly. The things Oldham says he likes most about the fashion 
business are the "technical stuff," such as developing his own prints and 
beadings, and putting together his semiannual shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show is the only pure representation of my vision," Oldham says. "We look 
at the show as one big party. I'm happy we attract celebrities, but we also 
invite street kids and moms and children and drag queens." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His show in April was one of the New York fashion week's hottest tickets. 
Swarms of paparazzi and groupies converged on a tent pitched behind the 42nd 
Street library to catch a glimpse of Sarandon (who brought her 9-year-old 
daughter, Eva), Roberts, Ellen Barkin, Rita Wilson, Taylor Dayne and Jaye 
Davidson.  
</P>
<P>
 Before Stephanie Seymour, Naomi Campbell and transvestite model Billy Beyond 
sashayed onto the runway, they gathered backstage with Oldham and the other 
models for a pre-show rite of burning white sage. "It's a neutralizer that 
helps clear the air and causes you to focus," the designer explains.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Oldham insists that he's not ambitious, his workload suggests he must 
be telling a little white lie. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his eponymous collection, he also designs Times 7, a line of 
shirts and sportswear; a shoe collection; home sewing patterns for Vogue, and 
buttons. Last fall, he exhibited his oil paintings, including gold-leaf 
portraits of animals, at a SoHo gallery.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Oldham joined supermodel Cindy Crawford's "House of Style" on MTV as 
host of "Todd Time," a segment that offers offbeat tips on everything from 
updating a wardrobe on $1.98 to buying a swimsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty great, all the opportunities that have come my way, but I could 
also be really happy on a turnip farm," Oldham says. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest of four children, Oldham was born in Corpus Christi, Tex., to a 
close-knit, peripatetic family who traveled around the country and to Iran 
before returning to the Lone Star state in 1978. His grandmother taught him to 
sew when he was 9, and by age 14 he had made his sister a dress out of op 
art-printed pillowcases.  
</P>
<P>
 The day after high school graduation ("I loathed school and wished I had quit 
in ninth grade," he declares), Oldham went to Dallas, where he landed a job in 
the alterations department of a Polo/Ralph Lauren boutique. 
</P>
<P>
 "They fired me, but I'm eternally grateful for what I learned there," says 
Oldham, whose counterculture attitude (hair dyed pink) no doubt ruffled the 
Lauren crowd. "To be able to take apart Ralph Lauren's clothes and put them 
back together was all I needed to know about this industry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, he borrowed $100 from his parents, bought 40 yards of cotton jersey 
and created the first tiny collection that he sold to Neiman Marcus. Seven 
years later, Oldham and Tony Longoria, who the designer calls "my partner in 
business and life," moved to New York and started a line called Times 7. Oldham 
later entered into an agreement with Onward Kashiyama, a Japanese financing 
firm, to sell and distribute Times 7 and start up a signature line. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Onward Kashiyama remains involved with Times 7, but the rest of 
Oldham's business is family owned and operated. Mother Linda runs the Dallas 
factory, grandmother Millie oversees quality control, sister Robin heads 
customer relations, brother Brad manufactures belt buckles and buttons, and 
Longoria oversees sales and public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Oldham declines to discuss finances, except to say that he has 70 employees 
and sells to more than 200 stores worldwide. (An industry analyst puts the 
company in the $5 million to $10 million range.) He describes his company as 
free-form with "everyone doing a little bit of everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Oldham says he usually sketches designs each morning while watching reruns of 
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show." "I just have to hear the theme song and it puts me 
in a trance," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he plans to launch a fragrance next year and open two stores -- a 
SoHo boutique in September and a Los Angeles shop next spring (the location is 
undecided, but definitely not in Beverly Hills, he says) -- Oldham says he has 
no desire to build a fashion empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I've decided yet that I want to be a designer," he says. "I 
like it, but I look at everything I do as a project." 
</P>
<P>
 Oldham confesses that he is eager to branch out into films. He designed some 
costumes for Alfre Woodard in Spike Lee's "Crooklyn" and has been asked to whip 
up some outrageous creations for "To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie 
Newmar," a comedy about drag queens trekking cross-country starring Wesley 
Snipes and Patrick Swayze. He recently directed a "Todd Time" segment and will 
spend part of his summer vacation directing Billy Beyond in a music video.  
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm happy to work on these short projects, but ultimately I want 
to be involved with feature films. I think I'd make a good director," Oldham 
says. "I'm not wishy-washy. I definitely know what I want."

IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR LEGWORK; IF YOU'RE ACHING TO WHIP THOSE GAMS INTO SHAPE 
FOR SUMMER, WE'VE GOT SOME MOVES FOR YOU. BUT DON'T PANIC -- EXERCISE IS ONLY 
ONE PART OF THE PROGRAM. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sure, many women have spent the last 365 days working on their legs, but 
others have left it to the last minute. For them, the moment of truth comes 
with the first blast of beautiful weather. As they stand in a store encircled 
by a sorry pile of rejected short skirts, short-shorts and swimsuits, they seem 
doomed to the summer from hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not. If they still want a great pair of legs, they can start with lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 And, no, there isn't a magic menu involved. It's simply a matter of devoting 
some of their midday break to exercise, which is just one of many useful tips 
provided by Southern California experts who believe lower limbs can be toned 
and spruced in record time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hello, Exercise: Practical moves from fitness expert Martin Henry, owner of 
the eponymous West Hollywood studio, include taking a pair of athletic shoes to 
work and walking to lunch rather than riding.  
</P>
<P>
 And if you work in a high-rise building, think of the stairs as a window of 
opportunity. For maximum effect on legs, hips, buttocks and heart, climb them 
two at a time, or three if you have very long legs. A beginner might start with 
a 10-minute session, working toward a 30 to 35 minute routine. Consistency, not 
speed, is the goal. "It's better to go longer at a moderate speed than to go 
fast and start and stop, which doesn't have the same fat-burning capabilities," 
Henry says. 
</P>
<P>
 Regard the walk down as a cooling-off period, good for the heart and the rear, 
which you need to squeeze. When you get to the last step, turn around, drop one 
heel toward the floor to stretch calf and hamstring muscles, hold for 30 
seconds and repeat with the other foot. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, try the ballet dancer's plie. Stand with feet a little wider than 
your shoulders, angle them at 11 and 1 o'clock. Place hands on the abdominal 
muscles to help you stand straight. Inhale as you lower your body weight into 
your thighs without allowing the hips to go below the knees. Exhale as you lift 
up, pressing down with your heels and squeezing the inner and outer thigh 
muscles. Henry recommends three or four sets of eight to 12 repetitions every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 For the inner thighs ("an area women are particularly unhappy with"), he 
advises using a soft, pliable, four-square kick ball (available in sporting 
goods stores). Lie on your back, on a mat or carpet. Place feet approximately 
hip-distance apart, with toes facing forward. With the ball between your knees, 
inhale and squeeze the inner-thigh muscles. Exhale through the mouth, 
compressing the abdominal muscles toward the base of the spine. Slowly release 
the squeeze, open the legs slightly -- but don't let the ball fall out -- and 
start again. Do three or four sets of eight to 12 repetitions a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry says the exercises, included in his two-hour "Abs, Thighs and Bun 
Formula" video ($39.95 at the studio), will bring visible results in three to 
six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise, Diet and TLC: Ole Henriksen, the owner of the eponymous Los Angeles 
skin care salon, starts his skin-enhancing tips with a word about exercise: 
bicycling. A daily half-hour ride can improve legs in just two weeks, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is diet, especially one low in sodium, to reduce fluid retention, 
which might be most noticeable around the ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 Henriksen's salon offers a body "facial" ($90 for 1 1/2 hours) to increase 
circulation and polish the skin. He says women can do a home version using a 
scrub made by adding one heaping tablespoon of sea or table salt (sea salt is 
ideal) to an ounce of cold-pressed almond oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the mixture into the shower. Wash and towel dry your legs, massage the 
oil in firm, upward-outward motions (include the feet if possible) and rinse 
well. No moisturizer is needed after the treatment, which can be repeated every 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
 For additional toning, empty a tray of ice cubes into a bowl, cover with cold 
water, wait a minute or two, drop your feet and a face cloth into the water and 
slide the cloth up and down the entire leg until you feel a constricting, 
firming action. 
</P>
<P>
 Eucalyptus oil also increases circulation and brightens the skin, Henriksen 
says. Blend a small amount ("a little goes a long way") in the palms of your 
hands and apply in upward strokes once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 After legs are exfoliated and smooth -- thanks to the almond scrub -- they're 
ready for an instant tan (which also helps even out mottled skin). Henriksen's 
recommendation is Sothys, a creamy self-tanner from France ($25 for 4.2 ounces) 
that "slips on easily." He says one way to avoid streaking with any self-tanner 
is to apply it in long, firm, rapid strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies, including Neutrogena, claim their newer self-tanning products 
provide a more natural, even color. Yohini Appa, manager of Neutrogena's 
product efficacy, says the company has discovered that proper formulation 
prevents any "off colors." And streaking, "which just shows you have uneven 
coverage," can be prevented by using a spray.  
</P>
<P>
 Appa says that for best results, exfoliate legs first, spray on Neutrogena's 
Light or Deep Glow ($10.00 for 3.5 ounces), wait three to four hours and 
reapply if more color is desired. But a word of caution: Even tan legs need a 
minimum SPF 15 sunscreen. 
</P>
<P>
 But not even bronzed, smooth, firm legs can look great if they're attached to 
unattractive feet. At Vera's Retreat in Bel-Air, the lowest extremities are 
made soft and supple with a massage and hot paraffin treatment ($25). 
</P>
<P>
 Home treatments, suggested by Jessica Vartoughian, founder of Jessica's Nail 
Clinic in West Hollywood, range from daily applications of creams that contain 
natural oils, such as aloe vera, to a full-blown pedicure. (The salon version 
is $22.) 
</P>
<P>
 Start the pedicure by soaking feet in soapy, lukewarm water mixed with hot 
chamomile tea. Dry them, push back the cuticles with an orange stick, trim 
toenails with a clipper and file the edges, being careful to do both moves in a 
straight line. Put feet back in the water and brush the toes downward with a 
soft brush to exfoliate and stimulate circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturate a pumice stone with a cuticle cream and a hand or body cream. Rub the 
stone over any calluses and around the soles of the feet. Go over the 
callus-prone areas with an emery board, apply jojoba oil and repeat the jojoba 
on a daily basis to keep the skin soft. As a toner, and a refreshing finish to 
the pedicure, rub the soles with half a lemon.

 As for nail color, there is only one choice: "Tomato red," Vartoughian says. 
"It makes the feet look sensual and gives them a personality." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodby Unsightly Veins: Spider veins, which may be the result of genetics, 
birth control pills or pregnancy, can be removed by sclerotherapy.  
</P>
<P>
 Steven Weiss, a Beverly Hills dermatologist and assistant clinical professor 
at UCLA, says the procedure involves injecting various solutions, including 
saline, into the blood vessel, which causes irritation of the lining and leads 
to gradual fading. One or more treatments may be required. And there is a 
drawback to having it done in the summer: The spiders will look worse before 
they look better. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambulatory phlebectomy is the latest technology for treating varicose veins. 
The office procedure was introduced in the United States by Gabriel Goren, an 
Encino vascular surgeon who uses a local anesthetic ("just like a dentist") and 
makes 20 to 30 tiny openings, through which the veins "are teased out."  
</P>
<P>
 The incisions are closed with butterfly tape and the patient can drive home or 
return to work the same day. Swimming is permitted a week later, although the 
bruising won't disappear for 10 days to two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure, which is covered by insurance, costs $700 to $900 per leg.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: BOREDOM-BASHING FUN ON TAP FOR TEEN-AGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life.

<P>
 School is out and you're ready. Ready for nothing. Weeks, even months of it. 
Hangin' at the beach. Sleeping till noon. Partying with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all going great for a couple of days. Then Mom shows up at your bedroom 
door at 7 a.m., and she's holding a blow torch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clean up this mess or I will," she says. Then you ask for your allowance and 
assume that the convulsive laughter that follows is her way of saying no. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Dad has started scouring the Yellow Pages looking for just the 
right way for you to spend the rest of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps Teen Marine Boot Camp," he says. "That, or you can come with me to 
the factory and sort the bolts." 
</P>
<P>
 Broke and dejected, you think about heading for the beach until Mom cheerfully 
reminds you of the latest skin cancer projections for sun-worshiping 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer tan suddenly has the same attraction as nuclear winter. And 
sheep-dipping yourself in sun block is not a viable alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Before thoughts of a sizzling summer fizzle in your mind's eye, perk up; we 
have some ideas on how to avoid the blahs. We dispatched staff writer Jeff 
Meyers on a mission: Find things to do, places to go and fun, fun, fun for 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers succeeded beyond his expectations. "I couldn't believe the almost 
unlimited good-time opportunities for kids in the county," he said. "It's 
almost like living in Willie Wonka's Chocolate Factory." 
</P>
<P>
 Our centerpiece will serve as a summer survival guide for teen-agers, making 
boredom nearly impossible. Even if you can't summon the energy to get off the 
couch, we've got you covered with our advice for slackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents: If your teen-ager professes to be unable to find gainful employment, 
be suspicious. We've learned that summer jobs are available through agencies 
that specialize in finding work for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid, I made the obligatory applications at a couple of fast-food 
restaurants and supermarkets," Meyers said. "I never heard back. But these 
agencies make all the contacts for you and almost guarantee a job to anyone 
willing to work." 
</P>
<P>
 But will they come over and find a clean shirt at the bottom of that compost 
heap of a bedroom? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not, but Westlake resident, Lindsay Jackson -- the subject of this 
week's Fashion column -- might. She designs a line of clothing from old drapes 
and drapery remnants. Columnist Kathleen Williams, our arbiter of fashion, 
found Jackson at her east county condo creating tunics, vests, flowing pants 
and tank tops. The garments are sold in upscale boutiques here and elsewhere, 
out of the recycled fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 So there's one more idea for county teens. Peel apart, un-wad and generally 
separate the individual elements in your room. Get pinking shears, borrow Mom's 
old sewing machine and create a line of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe if you become a successful entrepreneur, Mom will let you do nothing 
next summer.

SIGHTS; SHOW CAPITALIZES ON ANIMAL INSTINCTS; THERE'S PLENTY OF CUDDLY 
CREATURES AND SINEWY BEASTS AMONG THE SCULPTURES, BUT NOT MUCH FROM THE 20TH 
CENTURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When faced with a generic, umbrella title like "Sculpture from Ventura County 
Collections," one has to fight off the temptation to make generic, umbrella 
assumptions. And you know what happens when you assume things. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the large sampling of sculpture now crowded into the Ventura County 
Museum of History and Art, the observer might leap to conclusions about the 
general profile of collectors in this area. For one, they're animal-lovers. 
Cuddly animals and sinewy beasts are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 We also find plenty of figurative pieces based on religious and mythological 
subjects, and artifacts from the Far East and Indonesia. Cowboys wrasslin' 
horses is another popular theme. 
</P>
<P>
 And another thing: Sculptors seem to shy away from anything abstract, 
conceptual or ironic. Apart from renowned German Kathe Kollwitz's "Farewell," a 
small bronze depicting a couple melting into an expressionistic embrace, the 
20th Century seems all but evicted from the room. 
</P>
<P>
 By its very nature, this show is a hodgepodge, a testament to the variety of 
interests among collectors in the area. One wishes, in a sense, that it could 
be even more diverse, reflecting a broader swath of what the term sculpture 
means in the late 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, one of the more appealing pieces in the show is a large wooden bird, 
with its form deconstructed and distorted, and rendered symbolic, by an 
anonymous African sculptor. We can trace the influence of this primitive art on 
the evolution of 20th-Century western art, from Cubism forward. It's the kind 
of abstract art notably missing from this lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the generally polite spread of the exhibition, Eduardo H. Xochitiotzin's 
"Los Jenetes" ("Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse") practically screams and 
leaps. A tangled mass of rusted welded steel, the piece makes for an almost 
threatening presence. 
</P>
<P>
 This is in stark contrast to the horse business of Frederic Remington's 
"Bronco Buster" or John Strickenberg's "The Sunfisher" -- all portraying 
agitated horses and cowboys playing hero. The tables turn with Sid Burns' 
"Spooked," in which an agitated airborne horse is about to land on a grim, 
scrunch-faced cowpoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing it all back home to Ventura County, we find a pint-size version, by 
C. Kubilos, of the Father Junipero Serra statue, which stands imperiously (and 
imperialistically?) in front of the Ventura City Hall. Serra, of course, is not 
a universally beloved symbol of California history, no more than this show is 
the final word on the art and texture of Ventura County art collecting. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as that's understood, this is an enjoyable light feast of a show. 
Especially if you love animals. SPEAKING OF CITY HALL 
</P>
<P>
 "A Touch of Ventura" is the name of the art exhibit upstairs at City Hall, and 
the group show boasts imagery of interest to fans of art and/or Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Of notable local color, Cynthia Bates' scene outside Pierano's Grocery is 
painted with a loose hand, and with attention to stark light and shadows raking 
their way across the composition. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast with the more conventional, identifiable scenes, Sally Miller's 
"Morning in Santa Paula" is an evocative creek-side image with spindly 
eucalyptus trees dividing the canvas. Nicole Erd's "Anacapa Island" is a dark, 
smudgy landscape choked in purple, like an oblique tribute to Monet's 
haystacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Newman stirs up wistful Americana in her watercolor "Piru Pump," with 
its lonely archival gas pump gathering dust in post-war Anytown, USA. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, life and art and collecting go on. Details 
</P>

NIGHT LIFE: TEXAS BLUES GUITARIST; WILL (SMOKEY) LOGG PLAYS A GREAT BOOGIE 
BEAT. HE'LL PERFORM WITH HIS BAND FOR BLUE MONDAY AT NICHOLBY'S IN VENTURA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Texas blues guitar road dog Will (Smokey) Logg does things his own way. On his 
own Gila Monster label, his first album was a record, his second was a cassette 
and the new one is a CD. What's next, an eight-track? Could be. Logg has been 
quoted as saying, "I don't care if everybody thinks I stink." Don't worry, he 
doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Logg is a fluid and rockin' blues guy who doesn't do any of those basic boring 
blues. The best ones off his newest release, "Crash 'N' Burn, are both Logg 
originals -- "Gold E Lox" about a bad blond and "Coral Snake Skin Knee Hi 
Boots," a song with a great boogie beat. You can hear these and others when 
Logg does the Blue Monday gig at Nicholby's in Ventura. Or you can catch him up 
the coast the next night at SOhO in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Logg is a Texan who moved to Chicago for a while, got the blues, then moved 
back to the Lone Star state. Logg's brother, Dan, is the sax-playing 
Flamethrower. Randy Joe Fullerton plays bass and Kevin Vet hits the drums. 
Between a lot of driving time, the group plays biker bars, churches, 
riverboats, rodeos, rattlesnake hunts, roadhouses or about anywhere with 
electricity. Logg talked things over recently from his Dallas home. 
</P>
<P>
 How long have you been doing this? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, a long time. I haven't had a day job for about 17 years, and the bass 
player and I have been together for 15 years. We've had the drummer for a year, 
and the sax player, my little brother, has been following us around for about 
five years. Our first album came out in 1984, something like that, on vinyl. I 
have two unplayed copies left. "Pell Mell Hell" came out in 1988. "Crash 'N' 
Burn" came out in 1993, something like that, on CD. We're going to record a 
live album in Vancouver in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you guys on that endless blues tour? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, we play as often as we can. I just play each gig and give all I've got. 
I mean, if you're paying the money, you're gonna hear the whole nine yards. We 
do a lot of Freddy King and a lot of Howlin' Wolf. We can play six or seven 
sets without repeating any songs. We probably have 15 or 20 originals. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell a typical road story. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, but there's a million of 'em. One night we played in Albuquerque and we 
partied till like 10 the next morning. We were supposed to play a rodeo in 
Odessa the next day. When we got there, I drove my '74 Chevy Van into the 
bullpen and all the bulls were as tall as my vehicle. They alternated sets by 
having us play between rides. So all these young cowboys would ride around, get 
thrown off and stomped on. We did that all day. All the little bull riders with 
these great big hats really liked us. They hated that cry-in-your-beer country 
(stuff) and were into Metallica and Stevie Ray Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
 Your bio has a lengthy list of bands you've opened for. Is there anyone left 
you guys would like to play with? 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the people I like would make us look real stupid if we opened for 
them. The only time we do an opening slot is when we can't get a gig by 
ourselves, or else if it's a real high-profile gig. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are there so many good guitar players from Texas? 
</P>
<P>
 I dunno, I guess it's because it's really boring here. It's dusty and flat 
with nothing to do except watch the tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you get the blues? 
</P>
<P>
 I just always liked the way it sounded. When I was growing up, I saw a lot of 
Freddy King. If I saw it, I ended up listening to it. Seeing it happen is 
totally different than listening to it on a record. That one-on-one thing makes 
all the difference. I also listened to a lot of Howlin' Wolf, although I never 
saw him. I don't like "Stormy Monday" or "The Thrill Is Gone," any of that 
trite blues. We're more like Freddy King meets Charles Bukowski at "High Noon." 
</P>
<P>
 What's the secret to survival on the road? 
</P>
<P>
 I dunno. When I'm onstage lost in a note and really groovin' and lost in the 
passage of a phrase, that's cool. The worst thing is dealing with the money at 
the end of the night. This stuff still goes on. I mean just last week we played 
in Montgomery, Ala., for 400 bucks and an unspecified percentage of the door. 
They charged six bucks a head at the door and 1,500 people were there. At the 
end of the night, they gave us an extra 25 bucks. Details

CENTERPIECE: THE SUMMER SCENE; HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING FOR TEENS, WITH 
EVERYTHING FROM FUN IN THE SUN, TO TIPS ON WHERE AND HOW TO FIND A JOB, TO 
ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 School's out in Ventura County and thousands of teen-agers are on the loose, 
many believing there is nothing to do and no job in sight. Wrong. After weeks 
of investigation, Ventura County Life has uncovered an abundance of cool 
hangouts and activities -- plus the straight dope on who's hiring and who's 
getting hired. For the slack-hearted, we've got Tips on Becoming a Successful 
Couch Potato. So keep this guide handy as you navigate through these lazy -- 
and hopefully not hazy -- days of summer. And don't forget the sun block. 
PLAYING 
</P>
<P>
 Beaches and Harbors: The eternal teen-age question of "what to do?" has a 
time-honored, simple solution in Ventura County: Head to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 You know the routine -- Zuma or Malibu if you live in the east county, the 
entire coastline for everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 If lying out is your preferred beach activity, you might want to prevent rigor 
mortis by renting in-line skates, three-wheelers and bikes by the hour at Beach 
Rentals, San Buenaventura State Beach (641-1932). Two hours of in-line skating 
costs about $8 and will jump-start your circulatory system. 
</P>
<P>
 For an easy-going water experience, kayaks and foot-powered boats may be 
rented at Ventura Harbor (642-7753). 
</P>
<P>
 Pool Halls, Bowling Alleys, Etc.: If your parents insist that pool halls and 
bowling alleys are socially unacceptable, tell them to get with it. These 
once-sleazy venues have spruced up, becoming safe havens for all but the 
athletically challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's proliferation of family pool halls means you don't have to go 
very far to find a table. For the price of a movie ticket, you and your friends 
can enjoy two or three hours of eight ball while subliminally learning 
geometry, physics and math. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Some pool parlors require adult supervision or parents' permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Skating rinks, miniature golf courses and batting cages are also guaranteed 
boredom fighters. Some even have special reduced rates for the summer and offer 
inexpensive instructional classes.

 Malls and Arcades: The three major malls in the county -- Buenaventura, The 
Oaks, Esplanade -- welcome teens, especially teens with their parents' credit 
cards, but beware: 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't come here and hang out in large groups," says Buenaventura security 
supervisor Rick White. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you shop till you drop, you might want to work on hand-eye coordination 
in the malls' video arcades. While Mortal Combat II and NBA Jam Tournament 
continue to be the hot new games, they'll be competing this summer with newly 
released Demolition Man and Aerosmith's Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Malls are open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday. Weekend hours: 
Buenaventura, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Esplanade, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday, 10 to 5 
Sunday; The Oaks, 10 to 7 Saturday, 11 to 6 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock Concerts: If you missed the Smithereens' concert Wednesday night at 
Ventura Theatre, it's going to be a long, dry summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerts by youth-oriented bands are few and far between. Ventura Theatre has 
none booked, but Dennis Miller will provide comic relief on July 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Looks like you'll have to gas up and drive to Los Angeles for Lollapalooza '94 
Sept. 4-5 at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Club Scene: You really have to try to be bored during Ventura County 
summers. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere near your 'hood there's a Boys & Girls Club offering nonstop 
activities at practically no cost. Ceramics and photography. Basketball and 
billiards. Softball and video games. Camping at Lake Casitas. A clown class 
taught by a former Ringling Bros. clown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (clubs) are the best place in the world for kids to come," says Monique 
Price, program director for the Ventura club, the Addison Youth Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Yearly dues range between $5 and $12. Some clubs even provide free lunch. 
"We're one of the best-kept secrets in Ventura County," says Chuck Muncie, 
executive director of the Port Hueneme club. 
</P>
<P>
 City parks and recreation departments also provide summertime programs for 
kids.

 Magic Mountain: An antidote for the summertime blahs, Six Flags Magic Mountain 
has long been a draw for teens seeking cardiac arrest on the latest thrill 
ride. This summer will not disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Batman the Ride is a gravity-defying, 50-m.p.h. spin around two giant 
loops, with nothing but air beneath your feet. Wimps and anyone under 54 inches 
tall will be asked to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 For two weeks beginning July 9, athletes can take part in the park's Sports 
Illustrated Sports Festival, billed as the world's largest traveling sports 
event. You'll be able to kick field goals, shoot baskets, rifle slap shots and 
chip golf balls. Showers are not included. 
</P>
<P>
 Save up your pennies: Admission to the park is $29, with parking another $6. 
Park hours are 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 10 a.m. to 
midnight Friday and Saturday. Information: 255-4111. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot Movies: By now, everybody has seen "The Flintstones," "Speed," and 
"Getting Even With Dad." Expect the laughs, the action and the special effects 
to continue the rest of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark these openings on your calendar: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Blown Away" (July 1) -- Jeff Bridges plays a Boston explosives expert 
pitted against terrorist Tommy Lee Jones in this suspense thriller. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Baby's Day Out" (July 1) -- John Hughes, who showed us the slapstick 
consequences of leaving an 8-year-old boy "Home Alone," has regressed to the 
diaper stage with a tale of a 6-month-old tot misplaced in a big city. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Shadow" (July 1) -- The radio hero of the '30s comes to life, with Alec 
Baldwin's suave billionaire Lamont Cranston finding what evil lurks in the 
hearts of men. 
</P>
<P>
 * "True Lies" (July 15) -- Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron, the team 
responsible for "Terminator," are back with more cinematic fireworks in this 
campy saga about a married man who moonlights as a master spy, unbeknown to his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Mask" (July 29) -- If you thought rubber-faced Jim Carrey was a hoot in 
"Ace Ventura," wait till you see him cavort in this FX-heavy comedy about a 
mild-mannered geek transformed into a super hero. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Airheads" (Aug. 3) -- Teen heartthrob Brendan Fraser is one of three 
dim-witted heavy-metal rockers who take a radio station hostage to get their 
demo on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Next Karate Kid" (Aug. 5) -- The fourth installment of the series comes 
with a twist: The kid is a girl. WORKING 
</P>
<P>
 Where to Find a Job: Bagging fries, busing tables, baby-sitting your 
neighbor's obnoxious kid -- tough jobs, but somebody has to do them, and you're 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting at the bottom is the curse of teen-hood. If you can't slide into a 
summer gig as vice president of Daddy's company, you'll have to settle for a 
menial job. Once you accept that fact of life, finding work isn't very 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a kid wants a job, it's pretty easy," says Ivan Carrasco at Youth 
Employment Services in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth Services has offices all over the county. The Job Training Policy 
Council in Oxnard finds work for low-income kids. Since regular employment 
agencies rarely deal with anyone under 18, contacting Youth Services and the 
Job Council usually pays off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-five percent of the time, you'll get a job," Carrasco says. 
</P>
<P>
 If a fun work environment is important to you, you might apply to Six Flags 
Magic Mountain. Probably the largest employer of teens in the area, Magic 
Mountain hires 3,000 workers in the summer, "the bulk of them young people," a 
spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
 You can run rides, stock merchandise, cook food, take tickets or get a foot in 
show business by working tech at stage shows. "We've got positions open in 
every area of the park," the spokesman says. "We're definitely in a big hiring 
mode. We've got excellent, excellent opportunities for teens." 
</P>
<P>
 Most summer jobs pay the minimum hourly wage of $4.25. At Six Flags, you can 
make as much as $5. Youth Employment Services sometimes finds $8-an-hour jobs.

 How to Get Hired: Once you reach the interview stage, you'll have to decide if 
$4.25 an hour is enough incentive to make you smile, comb your hair, wash 
behind your ears and wear anything but blue jeans. If you go for it: 
</P>
<P>
 "Dress appropriately," advises Joyce Waldron, director of Youth Employment 
Services in Ventura. "The right attitude always helps. And don't ever say 
you're not available." 
</P>
<P>
 Job hunting entails a lot of paperwork. For a teen-ager, it starts with a work 
permit. Required by the state if you're under 18, a work permit can be obtained 
at your high school. It has to be filled out and signed by you, your parents 
and your employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Start Your Own Business: If you value independence and freedom, working for 
yourself is the way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really nice and enjoyable," says Kevin Corse, who owned his own 
gardening business as a Buena High student in the mid-'70s. "It gives you an 
ego boost and you don't have anybody watching you." 
</P>
<P>
 Mowing lawns, washing cars and windows, baby-sitting, selling cookies, 
cleaning homes, clearing brush, hauling trash and impersonating a handyman are 
some of the jobs you can do yourself and generally make your own hours. But 
they demand responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be where you say you'll be," Corse says. 
</P>
<P>
 You also have to deliver the goods. Corse's gardening business was helped by 
word of mouth because "I did a good job for this woman and she told her friends 
and family and it went on from there," says Corse, who now owns a gas station 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to remember to pay your own taxes and make sure your employers pay 
Social Security on you or they'll never be able to accept a position with the 
federal government. SLACKING

 Music Television: MTV is offering plenty of excuses to stay home this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of "Real World" will no doubt be glued to their couches Friday night when 
a new cast kicks off the season premiere of the reality-based docu-soap, which 
is going into its third year chronicling Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from premiering established shows this summer, MTV is also running a 
variety of new shows and specials, from an MTV News investigation to a beach 
travelogue-talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Tim Burton, director of "Batman" and "Edward Scissorhands" -- films 
about freaks, nerds and weirdos -- will host a special entitled "Freaks, Nerds 
& Weirdos." 
</P>
<P>
 New and different this summer on MTV 
</P>
<P>
 * "Dead at 21" (10 p.m. Wednesdays) -- A new action-adventure series. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Real World III" (10 p.m.) -- Season premiere Friday night. Regular time 
slot: Thursdays at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Beach TV" (Monday through Friday, noon to 3 p.m.) -- Daisy Fuentes travels 
to beaches in California, Hawaii and Florida. 
</P>
<P>

drugs and violence. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * "Freaks, Nerds & Weirdos" (10 p.m., Aug. 16) -- Tim Burton special. 
</P>

 Required Reading: Dan Zevin's "Entry-Level Life" (Bantam, $8.95) -- Advice on 
faking it in the real world. Like getting a job: "Never wear a backward 
baseball cap to an interview unless applying for the job of umpire. . . . Just 
as important as what you say during an interview is what your body is saying 
about you, so be sure to conceal any tattoos that say: 'Work sucks, let's 
party.' "

 Strategies for Showing a Bad Report Card to Your Parents: If leaving the 
country is not an option, Ventura family counselor Jan Baker suggests trying to 
use humor on Mom and Dad, softening them up with a joke (a little 
self-deprecation is useful) before handing them the card and begging for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Start lighthearted but cut to the chase," Baker says. "You might as well be 
straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to "lose" the card or have it mutilated in the wash don't work, Baker 
says. "The grades will come out anyway. You might as well face it by being 
direct with your parents." THINKING 
</P>
<P>
 If you experience a moment of weakness and decide to exercise your brain on 
your vacation, you have several choices besides summer school. 
</P>
<P>
 Community colleges: Oxnard (986-5822) and Ventura (654-6459) offer numerous 
classes for teens, including courses on preparing for the SAT. Teen surfers 
will be interested in "The History of Surfing" at Oxnard College. Fees range 
from about $25 to $45.

 California Lutheran University is sponsoring three two-week youth theater 
workshops exploring acting, improvisation, voice and movement. First workshop 
begins July 5. Cost: $160. Information: contact Ken Gardner at 493-3375.

 Contrary to rumors, museums, art galleries and libraries stay open in the 
summer.

THEATER REVIEW; TRIO OF SINGING SISTERS FINDS HIGH-JINKS WHILE ON THE RUN; THE 
LIVELY CAST AT MOORPARK MELODRAMA PERFORMS POP AND ROCK SONGS DURING THE 
RAUCOUS TALE SET IN THE 1930S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Don't be deceived by its title: the Moorpark Melodrama's "Sisters on the Run" 
is not one of the current spate of shows featuring nuns that have been popping 
up across Ventura County. These are the Redding Sisters, a trio of New York 
singers, sometime in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Melodrama regular Tim Kelly's script is augmented (as usual for the company) 
by several pop and rock songs, performed by an energetic cast. It's a bright 
couple of hours, and one of the group's more consistently entertaining shows in 
recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, Lily and Daisy Redding (Jana Kovalivker, Bonnie DeGrood, Susanna Davis) 
work with crooner Eddie Grand (Tony Briant), whose agent, Larry Penn (Will 
Shupe II) is in trouble with the mob. After inadvertently witnessing an 
apparently fatal altercation between Penn and a gangster, the sisters high-tail 
it for the Ozarks. 
</P>
<P>
 They land in Mulekick, a town whose people would look to Dogpatch as the Big 
City. Cultures collide and, inevitably, high-jinks ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsfolk in Mulekick include farmer Abner (David Barry); flirtatious Judy and 
Trudy Goober (Joanna Dransfeldt, Amanda Reeves); boarding house owner and 
aspiring country singer Opal Boone (Linda Honeyman); and the spooky Conjur 
Granny (Laura Tennenhouse). 
</P>
<P>
 Back home in New York, characters include detective Eurydice -- "The best 
tracer of lost background singers in the business' ' -- (Elaine Raleigh); 
gossip columnist Deborah St. Nicholas (Susan Burns); and mobster Big George 
Cosmopolitan (Robert Craig, capably understudied at Saturday's matinee by Bob 
Porter). 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Enright directed and choreographed the show; musical director is Dean 
Mora, augmented on keyboards by Peter Burt. The sets and costumes (Linda 
Bredemann) are as colorful as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Note, too, the half-hour "vaudeville" revue that traditionally follows the 
main melodrama show is particularly strong this time around. It is a "Tribute 
to Summer," combining skits (with Tennenhouse particularly funny as David 
Barry's mother) and songs, and demonstrating that you don't need to be Abbott 
and Costello to deliver a convincing "Who's on First." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Sisters on the Run." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: 7 p.m. Thursdays; 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays; 3 p.m. Saturdays and 
Sundays, through July 30. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Magnificent Moorpark Melodrama & Vaudeville Company Theater, 45 E. 
High St., Moorpark.

'TENOR' HITS FUNNY CHORD AT CONEJO; PLAYERS IN THIS '30S-STYLE FARCE PULL IT 
OFF WITH APLOMB, ACHIEVING A CERTAIN HARMONY WITHOUT OVERPLAYING THEIR ROLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Perhaps the largest of larger-than-life art forms, grand opera has proved 
surprisingly immune to satire -- maybe because opera is thought to be too 
elitist for jokes about it to be understood by the masses. When populist art 
forms do take aim at its pomposity, though, the result can be as dead-on funny 
as the Marx Brothers' classic "A Night at the Opera," or the sublime Bugs Bunny 
animated short, "What's Opera, Doc." 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that brief list Ken Ludwig's "Lend Me a Tenor," a '30s-style farce 
whose plot pivots on antics taking place the night a professional company is in 
Cleveland. Ludwig seems to know the milieu, but his japes are broad enough that 
one needn't be an opera fan to understand the gags, and there are enough 
slamming doors, mistaken identities and foolish lovers to satisfy just about 
anyone who enjoys such shenanigans. 
</P>
<P>
 The presentation by the Conejo Players in Thousand Oaks is played with 
clockwork precision under the direction of Rick Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 As the curtain rises, the Cleveland company's general manager, Henry Sanders 
(Terry Fishman) is frantic: The world-renowned tenor set to guest-star for the 
company's anniversary concert hasn't shown up for rehearsal, and nobody seems 
to know where he is. The brunt of Sanders' fury is company gofer Max (Gary 
Romm), charged with locating the wayward star. More than his job is at stake: 
Max is sort of engaged to Sanders' daughter, Maggie (Patricia Netzer), and 
terrified of her father. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenor, Tito Mirelli (Bill Hillstrom) eventually shows up, but by then the 
wheels of impending disaster are inextricably in motion. The rest of the 
brightly paced show is devoted to sorting out the confusion instigated by Max's 
attempts to cover for the star's absence. 
</P>
<P>
 A familiar face around the Conejo stage, Gary Romm has played Eugene Jerome in 
episodes of Neil Simon's autobiographical trilogy. Max could be an extension of 
Romm's Eugene -- somewhere between Woody Allen and Jerry Lewis, and played with 
immaculate comic timing. Netzer is a welcome addition to the Conejo group as 
Max's sweet, somewhat addled girlfriend, and Fishman happily resists any 
temptation to overplay the impresario. Likewise, Bill Hillstrom plays Tito for 
gentle laughs; the tenor is no buffoon, but simply caught up in circumstances 
he's unwittingly set in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting characters, each with several moments to act silly, include 
Mirelli's wife (Nancy Barker) -- patient with his womanizing, but having had 
just about enough of it; a starstruck bellhop (Mark Fagundes); a man-hungry 
soprano (Aileen Scott); and the chair of the Cleveland Opera Guild (Pat 
Stewart). 
</P>
<P>
 The story doesn't make much sense upon close inspection -- the audience is 
required to believe that certain people are very easily fooled -- but 
characterization and wit largely compensate for story shortcomings. 
Interestingly, there's no real villain, and each character is quite sweet and 
vulnerable in his or her own way. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Lend Me a Tenor." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Thursday through Saturday nights at 8:00 through July 23. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Conejo Players Theater, 351 S. Moorpark Rd., Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $8 general admission Thursday, $10 Friday and $12 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>

reservations or further information, call 495-3715.

THEATER REVIEW; 'NUNSENSE II' OFFERS UP MORE OF THE SAME; THE SONGS, SITUATIONS 
AND GAGS IN 'THE SECOND COMING' ARE SIMILAR TO THE FIRST, AGAIN PRESENTED BY 
THE OJAI ART CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The run on nuns that's been inundating Ventura County since October draws to a 
close with the current production of "Nunsense II -- the Second Coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately, it's being presented by the Ojai Art Center, the same group 
that brought the first of three productions of Dan Goggin's original "Nunsense" 
to the area, and with their original cast intact. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fairly safe to state that those who enjoyed "Nunsense" will also like the 
second installment, which is essentially the same show with new (if familiar 
sounding) songs. The nuns are still performing a benefit show, there are 
continued references to convent cook Sister Julia "Child of God," Sister Mary 
Leo (Katie Malloy-Thatcher) is still a novice, the woman nicknamed Sister 
Amnesia (Marianne Ilges-Johnston) still has memory lapses, Sister Robert Ann 
(Juli Cuccia) is still something of a brat, and Sister Hubert (Debra 
Masserella) is still envious of Mother Superior (Barbara Zeiher). 
</P>
<P>
 The plot -- a term that gives Goggin too much credit -- involves an order of 
Franciscans trying to appropriate money won by Sister Mary Amnesia in 
"Nunsense"; apparently neither the Franciscans nor the Little Sisters of 
Hoboken have taken vows of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, though, "Nunsense II" is songs, dances (tap, square, polka, etc.) and 
Catholic jokes -- though not as many jesting references to religious dogma as 
in the earlier play. 
</P>
<P>
 And this time the show is performed on the set of "The Mikado" (Mother 
Superior gets drunk on sake), and the hopelessly obscure references include 
Josephine the Plumber (a commercial spokeswoman from years gone by) and the 
Vapors' semi-hit single, "Turning Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Sister Robert Anne gets to imitate Katharine Hepburn, and once 
again the show's best number is the finale -- this time something called "The 
Only Way to End Your Prayers," a near-clone of the earlier play's "Holier Than 
Thou." 
</P>
<P>
 The women in the cast have a good time under the direction of Buzz Cuccia, and 
their appealing enthusiasm spread like loaves and fishes through last Sunday 
afternoon's audience. The show is helped considerably by a three-piece band, 
with musical director/pianist Bobbi Lindstrom, percussionist LaVonne Theriault 
and bassist Abbie Beauchamp all dressed as nuns. 
</P>
<P>
 While the appeal of "Nunsense" may escape some people, it's clear that many 
others enjoy the boisterous, obvious and clumsy revue. To those, "Nunsense II" 
is heartily recommended. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Nunsense II (the Second Coming)." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday evenings at 8 through July 16. Sunday matinees at 
2 p.m. June 26 and July 17 only. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Ojai Art Center, 113 South Montgomery, Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $12 general admission; $10 for seniors, students and Art Center 
members. Group rates (20 or more) also available. 
</P>
<P>

ROCK TALK; THREE LOCAL BANDS SURVIVE ROCKY ROAD TO RECORD DEALS; GROUPS ARE THE 
EXCEPTION, SINCE MOST FALL BY THE WAYSIDE. WINNERS SAY THE BEST WAY TO A 
CONTRACT IS TO PLAY IN L.A. 
</P>

 Just about every musician in every band has those MTV dreams which, when they 
come true, will enable him or her to quit that brain-dead day job and become 
the rock star they know they are. All they have to do is get signed. It would 
help if David Geffen was Uncle Dave. In the meantime, for most bands it hasn't 
worked out yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some bands will say they're only in it for the music, which is 
another way of saying they don't have any fans. Justice and even talent seems 
to have little to do with getting a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past five years local bands such as the Mudheads, the I-Rails, Raging 
Arb & the Redheads, Tao Jonz, the Sleepwalkers, Blackworm, Lion I's, the Ska 
Daddyz, Durango 95, Contradiction, The Upbeat, Los Guys, Pinching Judy, 
Popsicko, Shellfish, Aerial, Woodburning Project, Spencer the Gardener, Big Bad 
Voodoo Daddy and others have made great music, but as yet, remain unsigned. 
Some of them broke up. 
</P>
<P>
 But there may be hope. Within the last few months, three local bands have 
actually inked deals -- Dishwalla from Santa Barbara signed with A&M; Sykotik 
Sinfoney from Ventura signed with Red Light, a label affiliated with Relativity 
Records; and April's Motel Room from Simi Valley signed with Immortal, an 
Epic-distributed independent label. 
</P>
<P>
 All three bands were signed after gigging incessantly in L.A., doing the 
dreaded showcases where industry types schmooze with each other, and 
occasionally even watch the band. 
</P>
<P>
 A quintet of Santa Barbarians who began as Life Talking then became Dish and 
now Dishwalla, may soon have enough money to be Dishwater, if they choose. J.R. 
Richard, the singer, told his story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah man, it's true. We got signed to A&M about a month-and-a-half ago. Our 
manager got a tape somehow into A&M through a lawyer. The first A&R guy that 
got it liked it, and called us up. As it turned out, we had a gig at the 
Lingerie in L.A. that same week, and after we played, a guy named Mark Mazetti 
came up to us and said, 'We'll sign you.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working on our album right now, which we'll probably record in 
September or October. It should be released by the end of January. It's just a 
matter of playing enough, and actually getting someone to listen to your 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the deal is made, then new deals arise. For example, most rock bands 
wouldn't be caught dead in the same area code with the Carpenters unless they 
were planning to rob them. Now A&M is going to release a Carpenters tribute 
album featuring excess adrenaline by the likes of Cracker, Sonic Youth, oh, and 
Dishwalla. Their song is going to be "It's Going to Take Some Time." 
</P>
<P>
 What's stranger than that? How about Ventura's own Sykotik Sinfoney -- they're 
stranger than everybody. They dress up like aliens and play like maniacs. Their 
practice site must sit on Three Mile Island West. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Meister, the guitarist in the group who sometimes dresses as a cow, told 
this story: 
</P>
<P>
 "John Fichera, the owner, and his second-in-command Tom Silva from Red Light 
Records came to see us at the Roxy about four or five months ago and told us, 
'We want you guys,' " Meister said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyway, we've probably played over 300 shows in L.A. over the last three 
years and probably just six or seven up here. We recorded our album, 'Eargasm' 
at Goldmine Studios in Ventura, and now we're just waiting for a release date 
which should be within three months. You have to play L.A. because it won't 
happen here, not unless you know somebody. If you just swamp yourself with L.A. 
gigs someone will see you or else you're not worth a damn." 
</P>
<P>
 April's Motel Room, out of Simi Valley, got out of Simi Valley to get their 
deal. It went down this way, according to singer Tom Kelly: 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we started doing all these industry showcases. One night we were 
playing in this tiny hole-in-the-wall bar and this guy named Happy Williams 
from Immortal Records came up to us and told us he was interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recorded an album called 'Black 14' in December, and it should be coming 
out soon. There are 14 songs on it, some new and some old ones off our tapes. 
The label just sent out a five-song EP to a bunch of college radio stations. 
'God' is going to be the first single and we're going to start on a video," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe all that's happened to us the last few months until I started 
talking about it. Now it's getting really crazy -- there's lawyers, business 
and contracts. Happy got us in with the William Morris Agency and we're going 
to be on the H.O.R.D.E. tour July 12 with the Allman Brothers, Big Head Todd & 
the Monsters, Blues Traveler, Sheryl Crow and the Black Crowes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyway, I'd say going to L.A. is actually the thing, and playing as much as 
possible. You've got to play those industry gigs because every once in a while, 
something happens."

VIDEO REWIND; ROMANCE AMID GUNFIGHTS IN FRONTIER OF 'WILL PENNY'; CHARLTON 
HESTON IS AN AIMLESS RANCH HAND WHOSE LIFE CHANGES WHEN HE MEETS AND DEVELOPS A 
CLOSE BOND WITH AN EASTERNER AND HER YOUNG SON.

<P>
 There's a moment in the thoughtful, touching 1968 Western "Will Penny" when a 
young man asks the title character how he knows so much about frontier 
survival. "Well," the aging, aimless ranch hand responds, "even a blind hog 
roots up an acorn now and then." 
</P>
<P>
 Will Penny, played with feeling and understatement by Charlton Heston, is a 
simple, kind-hearted drifter whose years have somehow slipped away during treks 
from one range job to the next. Almost 50, his body is weary of the hard life. 
But with no family, home or stake, all he can do is ride forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny doesn't think much about what his life could have been until he meets 
Catherine Allen (Joan Hackett), an educated Easterner trying to make her way to 
San Francisco with her young son. When the pair are deserted by their hired 
escort, Penny reluctantly becomes their protector. 
</P>
<P>
 The unlikely threesome grow close, and for the first time in his life, Penny 
feels a sense of belonging, a connection. But while he truly loves his newfound 
family, he is nagged by questions of whether he deserves -- or can handle -- 
this new lifestyle. But before Penny can resolve these anxieties, the homicidal 
Preacher Quint (Donald Pleasence) arrives on the scene to settle a score with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackett's strong performance as an independent, resourceful woman seeking a 
better life gives the film a dimension that many Westerns lack, while the 
genre's all-important bad guy quota is filled menacingly by the wild-eyed 
Pleasence and Bruce Dern, who plays the preacher's dim, malevolent son. 
</P>
<P>
 The requisite gunfights are executed dramatically, but the film's most 
compelling conflict is in the heart of Penny. After the dust settles, he must 
decide whether he will take the terrifying step of leaving the only life he has 
ever known, or if he will abandon the only love he has ever found to ride off 
into the lonely, lonely sunset. 
</P>

 "Will Penny" (1968), directed by Tom Gries. 109 minutes. Not rated. GEOFF

ON THE ROAD: CLUB TURNS NEW ARRIVALS INTO NEWCOMERS FOREVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Arrived: Sonia Jacobs, from Orlando, by way of Pittsburgh. Before that, the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrived: Jerrie Newman, from Philadelphia, long-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrived: Luz Mary Holt, from Culver City. Before that, Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrived: Evelyn Tombach, from Pasadena, long-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Camarillo's latest immigrants, its latest wave of arrivistes, its 
soon-to-be Typical Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 They have little in common but circumstance: They hardly know anyone. They're 
still getting set up. 
</P>
<P>
 They moved here within the last year and have gathered at the house of Debbie 
Sorensen, originally from Arizona, here now, yet soon to move on again, perhaps 
to Orlando or back to Arizona: Her house is up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorensen's house on this weekday morning is Camarillo's unofficial Ellis 
Island, a gateway of sorts for those not off the boat but instead just off the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, the Philadelphian, is the only one of the four who came here on 
purpose, strictly speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband and I are very thorough people," she says. "We took 12 trips to 
California in six years, decided we'd retire someplace north of Los Angeles and 
south of San Louis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd always start our jaunts from Camarillo -- go to Ventura, not like it so 
much, and come back; go to Ojai, not like it so much, and come back. Camarillo, 
we decided, was controlled. Quiet. Sort of like a little community of 20 years 
ago, almost boring. Here we are -- it's just what we want. Does anyone know of 
a conversational Spanish group?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sorensen will look into it. 
</P>
<P>
 She, along with Nancy Szany and Elise Jansen, run the Newcomers Club of 
Camarillo, a not-for-profit descendant of the familiar but for-profit Welcome 
Wagon. Indeed, Newcomers was formed when some Welcome Wagon members defected to 
become entirely social and, at times, in the public service by raising funds 
for the Camarillo Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers has evolved into a many-headed hydra. After holding its welcome 
receptions, it signs people up for a $20 membership that offers organized 
activities such as arts and crafts, the international cooking and dinner club, 
ladies movie group, couples theater group, book review circle, wine tasting 
group, couples bridge, ladies bridge, canasta, couples Bunco, softball, 
bowling, golf, tennis and co-op baby-sitting. To be perfectly Californian about 
it, the club has an annual car rally. Nearly 200 Camarillians are members, and 
for some it's been a very long time since being welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Newcomers' key function is in welcoming. And as Californians perhaps 
better than anyone know, the arrivals, and thus the welcoming, never ends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, Holt and Tombach are more typical of those who show up at the 
welcomings. Each has a husband whose work brought them here. Each has her own 
comedic version of the family itinerancy, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs' husband is a surgical assistant. He, she allows, likes to keep moving. 
She misses their just-made friends after only a year in Orlando. She'd heard 
Camarillo was "by the ocean," a comment triggering an eruption of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt and her husband had lived in Culver City, a 10-minute commute from her 
husband's corporate job, in Santa Monica. But his job shifted and took him to 
Camarillo. He commuted for hours a day, month after month, and Luz finally 
realized it was too much. She's still "adjusting" to Camarillo and seeing her 
friends from Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Tombach, the born storyteller among the arrivals, cites a shake-up at her 
husband's firm and his need to find another position, which he did, here in 
Ventura County. So they left Pasadena after 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her regret, however, is somewhat tempered. Her Pasadena house was a singed 
survivor of last year's fires only to have a wall of mud arrive at the front 
yard in the slides that followed and then lose much of the interior wall 
plaster in the Northridge quake. Tombach may now be happily settled in, on the 
same Los Posas Estates street as Newman, but she and her husband are still the 
unhappy owners of a troubled Pasadena house. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter -- at least not at this morning coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone feels quite welcome, and with the enticement of so many activities, 
it looks like the welcome will last and last. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why Tombach and Newman came up with a revised name for the group, 
Newcomers Forever. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a happy oxymoron that can only last until members move on again, and 
new arrivals fill their place. This is, after all, Camarillo, California.

JAUNTS; A GARDEN OF ISLAND DELIGHTS; NO NEED TO GET ON A BOAT TO SEE CHANNEL 
ISLANDS FLORA. A WIDE SELECTION OF HARDY SPECIMENS AWAITS VISITORS TO THE PARK 
AT VENTURA HARBOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you can't take a boat to the Channel Islands to see what grows amid the 
sand and salt there, the next best thing is a trip to national park 
headquarters at Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 There, parks botanist Sarah Chaney has spent the last 1 1/2 years creating a 
garden with plants, bushes and trees that thrive on the wind-swept islands. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no garden of sissy plants. These are hardy souls that can survive 
harsh conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Located at the front entrance to the building, the garden is set up for 
visitors to follow a walkway that runs through it. A guidebook isn't due out 
until fall, but Chaney has grouped the plants according to the way they might 
be found in their natural setting. Most are labeled. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coastal bluffs section, the giant coreopsis is a standout -- but not 
for its beauty. When it blooms in the spring, sometimes the display of 
daisy-like yellow flowers on Anacapa Island is so striking that on a clear day, 
the island has a yellow tinge. But the plant is in its dormant stage now, and 
it looks like a brown, stringy mop -- striking in itself. 
</P>
<P>
 It's quite natural, as Chaney explains it. Alongside the coreopsis, the island 
morning glory is still producing white blossoms. Scattered about is the island 
live-forever, a succulent with tall shoots bearing tiny flowers. The variety, 
found only on Santa Barbara Island, is on the endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dune section, visitors will find scads of the dune primrose with its 
yellow petals, along with the sand verbena and a purplish lupine. 
</P>
<P>
 Still another spot is reserved for the vegetation that grows in woodland and 
grassy areas. Chaney has planted native bunch grass here. In another areas, 
sage is thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the 100 or so species in the garden can be found on the Channel 
Islands, and most also grow along the coast. But some are native only to the 
islands, such as the ironwood tree with its fern-like leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only found naturally on the islands, especially Catalina Island," Chaney 
said. "It's a survivor from the last Ice Age. It survives in fog pockets on the 
islands." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Cruz Island gooseberry is another one. It grows only in a handful of 
places on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the garden has more than 1,000 individual plants spread over a 
half-acre or so. Chaney took the project on in addition to her regular chores. 
She grew many of the plants from seeds -- including a foot-tall oak tree that 
she started from an acorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working on a shoestring," she said. "No budget. No people." Help 
came from a volunteer, Frank Waldron. Even so, the garden is loaded with rocks 
that had to be moved to fit in with the landscaping design. 
</P>
<P>
 The spot in front of the building had become something of a weedy eyesore 
before Chaney took over. It had been landscaped with native plants after the 
building was built, but the long drought and lack of irrigation took its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the plants lived, and some didn't," she said. A few, like the Santa 
Rosa Island torrey pine and the sprawling lemonade berry bush, are holdovers 
from the original garden. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chaney isn't working in the garden or the little plant nursery at the 
visitor center, she is involved with an inventory of plants on the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1800s, hunters and ranchers came to the islands, which became 
heavily grazed by sheep, cattle, hogs, donkeys, even rabbits. Even the 
tenacious ice plant found its way to the islands from the mainland. Native 
plants and animals were damaged and sometimes wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service is working to rid the islands of the non-native 
plants and animals and restore the natural vegetation -- whatever it might have 
been a century or more ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early accounts are from passing seafarers, or letters, journals from 
ranchers, anecdotal history," Chaney said. "It's hard to find hard evidence."

EARTHWATCH: SOLAR POWER SAGA IS REALLY A TALE OF 2 STATES; IN CALIFORNIA THE 
ECOLOGICALLY SOUND ENERGY ALTERNATIVE IS POPULAR AND USE IS GROWING. IN 
ARKANSAS, IT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Depending where you live, solar electricity -- the kind generated by a local 
company, Siemans, which produces photovoltaic panels that look like sapphire 
roofing -- is either a wonderful or a terrible idea. 
</P>
<P>
 If you live in Ventura County and like the idea of a stable, clean industry 
that brings jobs to the area, solar is a good idea. If you live in a Sacramento 
or Boston suburb and want bargain electricity rates from a source that doesn't 
pollute, it's a good idea. If you live in our service area and want electricity 
at your remote mountain cabin but don't want to shell out a fortune to Southern 
California Edison to have a power line installed, it's a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you live in Arkansas, well, maybe you shouldn't get involved with solar 
energy. As reported on TV recently, it can get you in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Benson family of Fordyce, Ark., bought four photovoltaic panels 
from Real Goods of Ukiah, Calif., which in turn had recycled the Camarillo-made 
panels from a decade-old demonstration project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bensons found the electrical output from the panels was sufficient, and 
decided to have the local utility company disconnect the family home from the 
power grid. There ensued a protracted argument with the utility, Arkansas Power 
& Light. 
</P>
<P>
 According to paterfamilias Tom Benson, "We've been told so many times by so 
many of their people that solar power doesn't work, can't work, will never 
work, that it's just a pipe dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Benson went ahead anyway. Since the panels had been around for so long, Benson 
didn't expect them to be real peppy, but they were. So, by downsizing his 
fridge and TV set and otherwise moderating his power appetite, he was able to 
run his household off the four panels. 
</P>
<P>
 He was so pleased with his new setup that he put a sign in his front yard 
declaring the place to be "The First Solar Powered Home in Dallas County." 
</P>
<P>
 According to broadcast reports, local hooligans tried to tear down his sign 
and had to be chased off at gunpoint by Denton. And the power company, 
suspecting him of getting power via an extension cord running to the house next 
door, removed the neighbor's electric supply and the street light in front of 
both their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor, a pioneer-spirited octogenarian named Richard Denton, 
straightaway acquired his own set of solar panels, according to Real Goods, and 
erected a sign declaring his place "The Second Solar Electric House in Dallas 
County." The Ukiah firm shipped the neighbors a solar powered street light -- 
for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Garrison, spokesman for Arkansas Power & Light, talked to me over the 
phone. The utility, he said, was initially concerned that the neighbors might 
have been violating Arkansas Public Service Commission rules covering illegal 
usage of extension cords. That is now a moot issue since the neighbors are no 
longer customers of Arkansas Power & Light. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the general matter of Arkansans who might take up the practice of 
producing their own homemade electricity, in effect making moonshine from 
sunshine, Garrison: "Arkansas Power & Light has generating capacity till (the 
year) 2000." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty months of juice may be good enough for them, but representatives of the 
utilities in this state think we need to plan farther ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 When I called around California I found that our local utility, Southern 
California Edison, is promoting the idea of installing solar rigs -- brand new 
Camarillo-made stuff by the way -- for customers at remote locations. Edison 
supplies the rig and customers pay for it in installments. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, people right in the middle of town have been ordering solar 
rigs -- also Camarillo made -- installed by their local utility, Sacramento 
Municipal Utilities District. These rooftop installations are powerful enough 
-- producing many times the kilowatts and many times the cost of the Denton 
family rig -- to run a home, and they have enough juice left over to sell some 
of it back to SMUD. 
</P>
<P>
 It's part of a scheme to get SMUD to a point where it gets half its juice from 
renewable, non-polluting sources such as solar, wind and geothermal by a 
deadline about sixty months from now. In another words, the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility serving this county plans to be using 15% to 20% renewable energy 
sources by the year 2000. The rest they will purchase on the open electrical 
power market. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For information on photovoltaic solar installations on remote homes in 
our county call Southern California Edison at (800) 302-2508

FOR THE KIDS; SUMMER CLASSES ON OCEAN SAFETY DRAW YOUTHS IN WAVES; JUNIOR 
LIFEGUARD PROGRAMS OFFER NUMEROUS ACTIVITIES TO PUT YOUNG SWIMMERS AT EASE IN 
THE SURF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When your kid clamors to go swimming at the beach, does the thought riptide 
spring to mind and make your stomach jump? 
</P>
<P>
 Think junior lifeguard instead. The California Parks and Recreation Department 
and the city of Port Hueneme offer intensive summer beach safety courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs teach rescue techniques, along with a slew of other things any 
beach-crazy kid should know: first aid, CPR, physical fitness, ocean ecology, 
and even surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to make kids ocean-safe," said Carrie Whitman, a lifeguard 
instructor for the state's program. "Then, if they're out there goofing around 
and they see someone in trouble, they can help." 
</P>
<P>
 Some not only become better ocean swimmers, but also go on to become 
lifeguards a few years later, she said. But that's not necessarily the goal. 
Parents like the program because they worry less about letting their children 
swim or surf at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's program, in existence for some 20 years, operates out of San 
Buenaventura State Beach in Ventura. The four-week sessions run Monday through 
Friday, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. The first session begins Monday, and the second 
on Aug. 1. The cost is $220. 
</P>
<P>
 This is for kids, 9 to 15 years old, and they have to know how to swim 100 
yards, do 10 yards under water and tread water for five minutes. Those who 
missed the pool test last week can be tested on the first day of the session at 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 children sign up for each session. Each day starts out with an hour 
of exercise that includes a mile or so run and a swim between two buoys. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them swim great in a pool, but in ocean waves its -- aah!" Whitman 
said. On the last day of the session, they swim around the Ventura Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, the kids learn how to spot a riptide and how to swim out of 
one if they get caught. They learn the basics of rescue -- how to swim out to a 
drowning victim using a surf board or a foam buoy -- and first aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hear stories about kids who have been in the program and how they were 
surfing and saw someone in trouble and rescued them," Whitman said. "That's 
what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not all serious stuff. The kids also get a taste of surfing, body 
surfing, windsurfing and snorkeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the state began offering an afternoon program to students in the 
morning session who haven't had quite enough. It's mostly for those who are 
nuts about surfing or want to learn. It runs from 1 to 5 p.m. weekdays, and the 
four-week session costs $200. 
</P>
<P>
 In Port Hueneme, the program is much the same as the one in Ventura. But the 
sessions are three weeks long and run from 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays at the 
pier. The first session began this week, the second one starts July 11, and the 
last one is Aug. 1. The cost is $130. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the program learn lifesaving techniques, first aid and CPR, along 
with surfing, body surfing and a few tidbits about the ocean. But there is one 
major difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Port Hueneme is a south-facing beach, so the surf is bigger," said Doug 
Miser, the junior lifeguard coordinator. "They get a lot of experience in the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids must be at least 9 years old and they must be competent swimmers, 
although ocean experience is not required. A swim test is given the first day 
of each session. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not looking for Olympic athletes," Miser said. "We're looking for 
eagerness, a willingness to get into the water. It's an entirely different 
environment -- pool swimming and ocean swimming. We teach them to be confident 
in the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, 80 kids go through each session, and if vacation schedules conflict, 
they can sign up in the second week, he said. Some kids go through the program 
more than once. It's a good step toward becoming a lifeguard, he said, and this 
year two of the city's lifeguards are graduates of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids have fun, as well as learn beach safety. "We have a lot of play 
time," he said. "It's not paramilitary." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Junior lifeguard programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: California Parks and Recreation Department's program is at San 
Buenaventura State Beach in Ventura. Port Hueneme's program is at the city's 
pier. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: The first session of the state's program begins Monday. Kids can sign 
up on the first day or at lifeguard headquarters at the state beach (tower is 
located near Harbor Boulevard and Vista del Mar). The first session of Port 
Hueneme's program began this week. Second session begins July 11. Kids can sign 
up at the pier on the first day of each session. 
</P>

 The Thousand Oaks Arts Commission is holding the International Arts Festival 
'94 this Sunday. And in keeping with the theme of the event, there will be 
plenty of international food on hand, courtesy of local restaurants, caterers 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the participants are Yasmeen's Indian Cuisine of Oxnard, Kay's Gourmet 
Catering of Westlake (which will serve up Greek and possibly German fare), The 
Mandarin Wok of Thousand Oaks, and the D&R Italian Market, also of T.O. The 
festival will go from noon to 7 p.m -- or lunch to dinner -- at Conejo Creek 
Park North. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For those who would rather cook than eat, here's some advance notice of food 
contests coming up during the Fourth of July weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's start with dessert. The sweet-tooth's highlight of the Simi Valley 
Historical Society's Old-Fashioned Sundae in the Park, July 3 at Strathearn 
Historical Park, will be the Chocolate Chip Cookie Bake-Off. All you have to do 
is show up with a special recipe and two dozen cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizer Jan Smith, president of the Historical Society's board of directors, 
said the judges will likely look (or taste) for texture, all-around good flavor 
-- not too sweet, not to dry -- and moistness. Call 522-2920 for more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the main course. Chili. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think you've got what it takes, and you're a member of the 
International Chili Society, consider entering a dish at the eighth annual 
Sespe Creek Chili Cookoff and Car Show on July 4 at Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
 And try not to feel intimidated by the judges, even though four of them, two 
husband-and-wife teams from Fillmore, are former World Champion chili cooks. 
Jim and Eileen Beaty won top honors in 1986, and Kenton and Linda Stafford 
picked up the award in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take that first bite, it should intrigue you," Linda Stafford said. 
"It starts at the tip of the tongue and goes all the way through the palate, 
down to your throat. It's well-blended and flavorful all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
 Call 524-0351 if you're interested.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; DISCOVERING DELICACIES IN SUBURBIA; IT'S BEST TO STICK WITH 
THE SPECIALS AND THE SUSHI AT OSAKA. YELLOWTAIL TUNA IS ALSO A STANDOUT. 
</P>

<P>
 If it's sushi in the suburbs we're seeking -- way out in the county's 
hinterlands, in the hills on the fringe of the Conejo Valley -- there's not a 
lot of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 What there is -- tucked in a new shopping center on the border of Agoura Hills 
and Westlake Village at the edge of North Ranch -- is Osaka Sushi. Run by Ken 
and Christine Cheung, it's what might be called a white-bread Japanese 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottles of soy sauce on the tables are the low-sodium variety. I don't 
know if this is because of clientele demand or a restaurant owner's choice. I 
find it difficult to believe that all the fathers, each with a kid or two in 
tow, who patronize the restaurant in the early evenings are so concerned with 
low sodium. 
</P>
<P>
 Diners are best off ignoring most everything except the sushi menu and the 
specials. The major exception to this is an excellent rich, juicy, broiled 
yellowtail collar ($6.50). The dish is crisp on the outside, cooked gently, 
served in a tasty sauce of sweet and sour seasonings and green onions. 
</P>
<P>
 But other menu items, even though served in an attractive room of dusty rose 
fabrics and glistening black lacquered furniture, are not worth a trip. 
</P>
<P>
 I confess, I couldn't resist trying the tofu salad ($4.50). It's cold tofu, 
sitting on iceberg lettuce, sprinkled with kernels of corn. The salmon skin 
salad is the same thing, except this one has crunchy salmon skins to save it. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the sushi bar, things are better. The meal begins with an excellent 
tiny appetizer dish of spicy pickled vegetables. On the sushi list, there might 
be some delicious sweet shrimp ($3.60), fresh from Canada and tasting as though 
they've just come out of the brine. Or cherrystone clams ($3.60), an item not 
always on the menu, slightly chewy, served with an eel sauce. Forget the 
abalone slices. I like chewy textures but this, I think, has not been marinated 
properly, not pounded enough or -- perhaps I just don't know enough about the 
preparation of this particular delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some house sushi rolls are better than others. Some of them come so large that 
they're quite difficult to handle, whether with chopsticks or by hand. And the 
salmon roll ($6.50) comes with a cloying mayonnaise sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the perennial favorite, the California cut roll ($4.40), which is a 
particular disappointment. Its minced crab is at least partly the artificial, 
kanikama kind, which fails to hold the roll together. 
</P>
<P>
 One evening's special was baby tuna in a garlic sauce. Not too garlicky, and 
cooked perfectly. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Osaka Sushi. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 668 Lindero Canyon Road, Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Open 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 9 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday, 11 
a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 9:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 3 to 9 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: Meal for two, food only, $11 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Major credit cards accepted; reservations accepted; beer and wine; 
(818) 865-1988.

FASHION; DESIGNER HAS VESTED INTEREST IN GIVING NEW FORM TO SCRAPS; LINDSAY 
JACKSON HAS A SPECIAL WAY WITH DRAPERY REMNANTS -- SHE TURNS THEM INTO COLORFUL 
CLOTHING FOR WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WILLIAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Waste not, want not, Lindsay Jackson might say. Except we could tell right off 
that this woman is way too hip to go for crusty old maxims. 
</P>
<P>
 We met at her Westlake condo last week to talk about her start in the design 
field seven months ago, when she threw over a real estate career to make 
clothing from old draperies. 
</P>
<P>
 Destiny must have taken a hand -- as fashion design was not something she 
planned or trained for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took one sewing class in seventh grade," the new designer said, "I hated 
sewing." 
</P>
<P>
 But someone gave her a drapery remnant -- and without a pattern, she made it 
into a tank top that changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I wore it I got stopped left and right. People asked if it was 
hand-loomed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was all it took. It became the sort of venture that fires the soul, but 
appears so iffy, it may drive one's relatives to despair. Jackson began to 
search thrift shops for draperies, and set to work creating tunics, palazzo 
pants, fringed vests, tanks, skirts, hats. Her despairing relative was daughter 
Courtney, 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "She started getting like, pukey colors at first," recalled Courtney. "Now, 
she's getting cooler, and she gets brighter colors." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, whose company is Re-hangin' It With Lindsay, allows that her first 
materials were dusky greens and golds from the '70s. But she has since acquired 
a rainbow of fabrics, including many unused bolt ends too small for room 
decoration. She especially likes these bits because they assure one-of-a-kind 
garments. 
</P>
<P>
 She pre-washes these pieces to induce softness -- but, still, it's the clothes 
that had former lives as draperies that tend to sell first. 
</P>
<P>
 Drapery fabric is what it is -- casual, loose and fun -- yet, the majority of 
Lindsay's customers are middle-aged or more, according to the designer. 
</P>
<P>
 She recalls a 50-something woman who caught up with her in a mall in 
Scottsdale as she was about to model a crop-top for a retailer, insisting, "I 
want that top!" Jackson sold it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought more mature people would have an issue with the concept, but they 
don't -- they love it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the idea of recycling is one of the draws of her collection. She 
exhibited at Eco Expo in Los Angeles this spring, and soon after, the city of 
Thousand Oaks presented her with a Gold Wastewatch Award for reuse of 
materials. 
</P>

 Environmental stores in two states are carrying her clothes, as well as a 
boutique in Carmel and one in Monterey. Locally, her designs for women are 
shown by appointment at Eve Halpert's image studio in Agoura Hills.

 Drapes came together for Jackson, so to speak. Just five months after her 
first effort, she was supporting herself and her daughter with sales. Now, she 
could likely go into production; but she's not ready for that step. She likes 
working with unique designs and filling custom orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Women can buy a piece or two from her collection, then order more to be made 
from swatches. 
</P>
<P>
 One such customer is Margery Spielman of Ventura, an environmental artist who 
completed the marine panels for the Ventura Pier. She has bought several of the 
designs and expects to acquire more.

 "I think they're a work of art," she said. "Whenever I wear them, people 
exclaim over them."

 Lately, even Courtney occasionally puts on a Re-hangin' outfit her mom has 
created for her. But it's more of an accommodation; the flowing garments are 
not her first choice.

 "They're more for grown-ups," the fifth-grader says pointedly. "Anyway, I have 
my own style."

SHOP TALK; A CONSUMER'S GUIDE TO MAKING PICTURES A SNAP; HERE ARE SOME TIPS FOR 
CHOOSING THE RIGHT FILM AND TYPE OF CAMERA. IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF TASTE, BUT 
IT CAN ALL ADD UP. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County weather has been wonderful, the kids are, or soon will be, out 
of school, summer plans are being finalized. And you're finger is starting to 
itch. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the finger that each year around this time waits for the rest of the hand 
to dust off the old 35mm camera so it can start shooting summer vacation-type 
photos for the family album. It's the finger that seems to think it's just 
wonderful to capture these moments -- even if they're blurry and 
unrecognizable. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't help you take better pictures, unless of course you want to take us 
along with you on your next outing. But we can help you with the shopping end 
of things. This week we'll focus on 35mm color film, particularly leading 
brands Kodak and Fuji. 
</P>
<P>
 First question: What's the difference between one brand and another? 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic difference is very little," said Fred Bauermeister, photographer at 
Budget Photo Shops in Simi Valley. "Some films tend to have different tints. 
It's very subtle. But that tint is why some people prefer Fuji over Kodak over 
Konica over whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Dena Sparks, head of photo finishing at Dexter's Cameras in downtown Ventura, 
said the difference between Kodak and Fuji is that "Kodak has more natural 
colors and Fuji has brighter colors." In what she called a possibly biased 
opinion (Dexter's is a Kodak retailer), Sparks said, "The Fuji color has an 
added pizazz, but it's not true-to-life." 
</P>
<P>
 Another difference between films, of course, is price. We visited Camarillo 
Camera & Video, K mart in Santa Paula and Kinko's copy center in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 A 24-shot roll of Kodak Gold Plus, with film speed of 200 (a multipurpose 
speed) was $4.95 at Kinko's, $3.67 at K mart and $5.75 at Camarillo Camera. The 
same type of Fuji brand film was $4.85 at Kinko's and $3.47 at K mart. 
</P>
<P>
 We also priced the store brands at Kinko's and K mart. Again, these films were 
24 exposures, 200-speed. A roll of Kinko's 24-shot, 200-speed film was $2.95. 
The K mart brand, called Focal, was $2.97. 
</P>
<P>
 When discussing film it's hard to ignore the trend toward throwaway cameras -- 
the ones that come with built-in film, that are used just one time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks said a throwaway camera is good for infrequent photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who wonder if they should get a camera or if they should keep buying 
throwaways usually end of buying a camera they can use more than once," she 
said. "It's more expensive to keep getting the throwaways unless you're the 
type of person who takes pictures once a year." 
</P>
<P>
 As with the rolls of film, the cost of these throwaways varies. 
</P>
<P>
 At K mart we found the Kodak FunSaver, with 27 exposures and 400 speed, for 
$7.47. The store brand, the Focal One Time, was $6.47 for 24 exposures. K mart 
also had a Kodak FunSaver Panoramic, at $10.47 for 15 shots. The Focal One Time 
Panoramic was $8.97 for 12 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kinko's we found the Kodak FunSaver, with 27 shots and 400 speed, for 
$9.95. The Fuji Quicksnap, with 27 shots, was $14.95. And the Kinko's brand was 
$8.95 for 24 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if you can only get the kids to smile before you click.

THE GENUINE ARTICLE; COWBOY, RODEO LEGEND HARLEY MAY STILL BE RIDIN' ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trail boss Harley May first sensed trouble when one of his volunteer cowboys 
showed up for the cattle drive wearing a baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, shortly after 60 head of cattle began the trek from San Juan 
Capistrano to a rodeo site in Rancho Santa Margarita on a sunny day last month, 
one of the weekend cowpunchers -- a local Rotarian in real life -- tumbled his 
mount into a gully. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to use ropes to get the horse out, and, fortunately, nobody was hurt," 
May said wryly, shaking his head slightly. "Now, some of those guys were real 
city slickers. Real cowboys don't wear baseball caps." 
</P>
<P>
 Tall and lean as a fence post, face darkened and weathered by more than 50 
years of working outdoors on ranches and competing at rodeos across the 
country, Harley May knows a real cowboy when he sees one.  
</P>
<P>
 Experts say there are two kinds of cowboys today -- working cowboys who spend 
their time on the ranch, and professional cowboys who enter rodeos for cash 
prizes. The 68-year-old May, a three-time national rodeo champion and a cowboy 
legend, is both. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes him so unique," said Gilbert Aguirre, manager of 
40,000-acre Rancho Mission Viejo in South County, where May works as a "cowboy 
consultant." 
</P>
<P>
 "He pioneered the modern rodeo and in his era was probably the best 
competition cowboy going down the road," Aguirre said. "But he's really a ranch 
cowboy who happened to be a rodeo cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on the porch of the modest one-story home he shares with his wife, 
Lynn, May reflected that "working cowboys are part of a lifestyle that's 
vanishing along with the big private cattle ranches." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started rodeo in 1953, most of the cowboys were real working cowboys. 
Now there aren't very many working cowboys at all in the rodeo." 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to a small cluster of cattle grazing in a nearby meadow, May said, 
"Today's rodeo cowboy would have no idea how to gather a herd and move 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing you can get out of a book. You just have to get out and do it." 
</P>
<P>
 A past president of the National Rodeo Cowboys Assn., May stays in touch with 
rodeo by serving as the chairman of the association's rules committee and 
judging local competition. He plans to work at least one rodeo later this 
summer in Costa Mesa or San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his day, May was one of the best rodeo cowboys to ever strap on a pair 
of chaps, say rodeo aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
 He started tossing 1,600-pound steers to the ground in 1953, when people still 
put rodeo in the same class as Wild West circus shows. 
</P>
<P>
 May was one of the first rodeo cowboys to graduate from college -- today, 
cowboys pour out of several colleges and trade schools in the Southwest that 
offer competitive rodeo classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot's license in hand, May was also one of the first "flyboys," hopping by 
plane to as many as seven rodeo competitions in a single weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a superstar in his time," Aguirre said. "He's really a living legend, 
and there's not many of his kind left." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 May's modest ranch home is like a museum, filled with photos, awards and other 
memorabilia from his rodeo career. 
</P>
<P>
 Most striking are the bronze statues, frozen moments of frenzied action 
showing a cowboy hanging on to a bucking bronco or grabbing a huge bull in a 
headlock -- all tributes to May taken from action snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen the whole spectrum (in rodeo), starting from the '50s and '60s," 
May said. "Rodeo today is more popular than ever. The top rider won about 
$250,000 last year," contrasted with May's largest annual prize winnings of 
$34,000 in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to compare the two eras, May ruminates for a moment before deciding, "I 
like the old days the best. There weren't as many people in rodeo, and we knew 
each other pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to know people a lot more personally. Even though we competed against 
each other, we'd exchange tips and information about the horses and steers." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was in his early 20s, Jim Charles traveled the rodeo circuit with May. 
They competed in front of sparse audiences perched on rickety bleachers at 
dusty little towns throughout the West and before a packed arena in New York 
City's Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harley was like a big brother or a father to me," said the 58-year-old 
Charles, an Oakdale resident who guides hunters and anglers in the wilderness 
outside the Sacramento area. "Everybody respected Harley because he went to 
college and was always reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a steer wrestler, he just had a way to get the bulls down quicker than 
anybody. There was plenty (of rodeo cowboys who were) stronger, but nobody was 
ever able to copy him, though many tried." 
</P>
<P>
 Although May, a native of New Mexico, is outwardly soft-spoken and gentle, 
Charles recalled one time when his ex-running buddy showed his temper when 
crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 After a night of celebration following a rodeo, the men's boarding house was 
visited in the early morning by a thief, who stole May's bankroll and car keys. 
But the man was found a block away trying to escape and dragged back to the 
cowboys' boarding room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harley just banged him one on the head and the guy said, 'Please don't hit me 
no more, I got a plate on my head,' " Charles said. "Harley asked him, 'Where?' 
and the guy pointed to a spot on his noggin. Harley banged him on the head 
again in another place." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the trophies in his house, one in particular shows the steel of May's 
personality. Retiring from active participation in the rodeo circuit while in 
his mid-30s, May kept chasing after the one major title that eluded his grasp: 
the Calgary Stampede Rodeo steer wrestling championship. 
</P>
<P>
 May finally won the title. At age 47. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harley's from the old school," Aguirre said. "He will absolutely do what he 
says he's going to do. If he says he'll meet you at the North Pole on New 
Year's Eve in 1999, he'll be there."

MAN GETS 12 YEARS IN CHILD SEX-PHOTOS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former university professor was sentenced to 12 years in state prison 
Wednesday in a sexual molestation case sparked when photographs showing graphic 
abuse of a Newport Beach girl were found discarded on a Los Angeles street. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Ruskjer, 44, a one-time faculty member at Loma Linda University's 
school of public health, wept and apologized during a 40-minute statement 
before a San Bernardino Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 His girlfriend, Evelyn (Evie) Bacilio, 33, was sentenced on Tuesday to six 
years in prison after begging for forgiveness from the child's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months after a highly publicized hunt led to their arrest, Ruskjer and 
Bacilio pleaded guilty in April to multiple felony counts of sexually abusing a 
Newport Beach girl, then 2, and taking sexually explicit photographs of a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 The two, who lived in the San Bernardino County community of Grand Terrace, 
were arrested Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began to unfold in October when someone turned over to Los Angeles 
police 11 photographs that had been found on the street -- four showing a man 
apparently performing sex acts with a little girl, three showing a woman doing 
the same and four showing the girl by herself. Police believe the photos were 
thrown from Ruskjer's car by robbers who had stolen the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state law prohibits distributing pictures showing sex with children, 
police won court permission to publicly release three carefully edited photos 
to the news media in the hope someone would recognize the adults or the girl. 
Within hours after the photos were released, police received about 40 calls 
identifying Ruskjer and Bacilio as the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Ruskjer at Detroit Metropolitan Airport where he had just 
landed on a flight from Tokyo, while Bacilio, a former secretary for an Ontario 
medical supply company, was arrested at McCarran Airport in Las Vegas while 
preparing to fly to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tips led authorities to the identity of the girl and her parents in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach parents, who were not identified in court, told Superior 
Court Judge Roberta McPeters in a letter that they were disgusted by the 
photographed molestation of their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of my sweet little innocent 2-year-old bound by the wrists and the 
ankles being sexually molested by these two," one of the parents wrote in the 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the photographs were taken Jan. 9, 1993, at Ruskjer's home 
while Bacilio was baby-sitting the child. Detectives say the girl has no memory 
of being assaulted.

UCI PICKS VICE CHANCELLOR; EDUCATION: SIDNEY H. GOLUB WILL BE THE SECOND IN 
COMMAND. HE IS A CANCER RESEARCHER FROM THE UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, WHERE HE 
WAS INTERIM DEAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A UCLA cancer researcher and immunologist has been selected to be UC Irvine's 
new executive vice chancellor, the university's second highest position, UCI 
officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney H. Golub, the interim dean and provost of medical sciences at the UCLA 
School of Medicine, will take over the post Sept. 19, UCI spokesman Scott 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening picked Golub from three other candidates 
for the position. A panel of 14 UCI faculty members, students, staff members 
and administrators narrowed the field down to four in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the best man for the job," Wilkening said in an interview Wednesday. 
"I was particularly interested in his UC experience . . . and his biomedical 
background, since that is an area of emphasis for UCI, as we're going to be 
trying to move up the ranks of research universities." 
</P>
<P>
 Golub will receive an annual salary of $155,000, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting executive vice chancellor Spencer Olin, who filled the post after L. 
Dennis Smith left UCI for the University of Nebraska in December, will return 
to his former position as dean of humanities, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his duties, Golub will fill in for Wilkening in her absence, act as 
chief academic and budget officer on campus, coordinate the activities of the 
vice chancellors, and act as liaison between Wilkening and UC President Jack W. 
Peltason. 
</P>
<P>
 Golub said he is excited about the chance to work as a campuswide 
administrator. He became the interim dean and provost of medical sciences at 
UCLA in mid-1992, and under his direction the UCLA School of Medicine received 
$178 million in research funding during the following year, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been part of the UC system for 23 years," said Golub, who began as an 
assistant professor at UCLA in 1971. "But Irvine's a different campus. It's a 
growth campus, a new institution with lots of space, and a there's a chance to 
participate with staff and faculty to develop a vision for its future." 
</P>
<P>
 Golub will have to deal with shrinking budgets and departmental cutbacks at 
UCI when he assumes his office. Earlier this year, two controversial task-force 
reports recommended closing several academic departments to help cut about $10 
million from the budget and redirect UCI's goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Golub find prospects of dealing with budget problems daunting? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I'm a bit anxious," he said. "I think that's healthy, though." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, Golub said, $9 million was cut from UCLA's School of 
Medicine budget and another $6 million from UCLA's hospital budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's possible to manage" cost-cutting, he said. "I don't want any 
more of it, of course, but all of higher education is having to learn how to be 
more cost effective." 
</P>
<P>
 A UCI academic planning group recently recommended that the university invest 
resources in its strongest academic programs to carry UCI into the forefront of 
research institutions. Golub fits into that plan, Wilkening said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our own College of Medicine and biomedical programs are strong and represent 
the best opportunity for growth," Wilkening said. Golub is experienced in 
promoting more research and attracting grants, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Golub vowed that humanities departments will not be ignored under his 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Great research universities aren't built on a narrow base," he said. "We need 
a solid foundation in a whole variety of areas." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he hopes to find time to teach, something he was not able to do 
often at UCLA. "It's important to connect to students and faculty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The search committee for executive vice chancellor was led by F. Sherwood 
Rowland, a renowned researcher of ozone depletion at UCI. Rowland said he was 
impressed with Golub's background. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an outstanding person to fit into the Irvine campus," Rowland said. 
"He's familiar with the University of California system and he's relatively 
low-key but a good listener. . . . He's well-rounded, with a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Executive Vice Chancellor Andrea Rich called Golub's departure "a loss to 
UCLA, but a gain to the UC family." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the campus community at UCI was satisfied with Golub's selection. Some 
said they were disappointed that Wilkening did not pick University of 
Washington Law School Dean Wallace Loh, University of Houston Law Center 
Associate Dean Michael A. Olivas or Myra Strober, Stanford University's School 
of Education associate dean for academic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," said Maria Herrera Sobek, professor of Spanish and 
Portuguese. "I wanted Olivas to get picked -- he's Chicano, and in California 
we have a highly Mexican-American, Chicano and Hispanic population. Yet UCI is 
losing many of its Chicano and Latino instructors." 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Villarreal, professor of molecular biology and biochemistry and a member 
of the executive vice chancellor search committee, said he was impressed with 
Golub's ability to deal with conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was almost judge-like in his ability to express things," Villarreal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Golub received his bachelor's degree in biology from Brandeis University and 
his doctorate in microbiology from Temple University, Nelson said.  
</P>
<P>
 He is chairman of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Advisory Committee at 
UCLA, and serves on the board of directors of Drew University of Medicine and 
Science in Los Angeles, Nelson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Golub said he specializes in studying human cancer. He is a past recipient of 
the Jonsson Prize for Research presented by the California Institute for Cancer 
Research. Profile: Sidney H. Golub

JUDGE RULES BREA IMPROPERLY SEIZED DOWNTOWN PROPERTY; REDEVELOPMENT: IN ANOTHER 
SETBACK FOR CITY'S PLANS, OFFICIALS ARE ORDERED TO HOLD A HEARING OVER THE 
EVICTION OF A MAN FROM HIS DOWNTOWN WAREHOUSE IN 1992 AND THE RELOCATION OF A 
CHURCH THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Superior Court judge on Wednesday set aside a decision by Brea officials to 
seize an inventor's commercial warehouse to relocate a church there as part of 
the city's efforts to remake its aging downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruling in one of the most contentious cases in Brea's redevelopment project, 
Judge Leonard Goldstein found that city officials may have violated "the 
separation of church and state concepts in both federal and state 
constitutions" when they seized property owned by Michael Kunec, a 75-year-old 
inventor who is legally blind. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ordered that city officials start from scratch and hold a "fair, 
legal and impartial hearing" for Kunec, who was evicted from his workshop in 
1992 so that the city could turn over the property to the International Church 
of the Foursquare Gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Georgino, the city's redevelopment agency director, said Wednesday that 
Brea officials would withhold comment on the judge's decision until they 
consult their attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have problems with it, but there are other things we can do," Georgino 
said, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunec's lawyer, Michael Leifer of Irvine, said he was pleased with the judge's 
decision, but also declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein's ruling is the latest in a series of setbacks that has dogged 
Brea's redevelopment efforts. Since 1985, the city has been buying downtown 
properties and displacing longtime owners to make way for a supermarket, a 
cluster of town houses, a movie theater complex and a tree-lined strip of shops 
and restaurants.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the property owners have sued the city in what turned into a vicious 
war of words and writs to keep their land. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have stated that the acquisition of Kunec's and surrounding 
properties through the eminent domain process is necessary to transform a 
tattered and run-down city core into a vibrant, tax-producing downtown. Brea 
leaders concede there have been trouble spots along the way, but say that most 
of the problems occurred during previous administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last five years, three City Council members involved in the process 
of property acquisitions have either lost their seats or their right to vote on 
redevelopment, following conflict-of-interest charges.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, some former property owners said they were interviewed by 
FBI agents who wanted to know if they were coerced into selling to the city. 
FBI officials have declined to comment on the nature of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and say they are being 
unfairly tarred by greedy property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1991, the Brea Redevelopment Agency decided to condemn Kunec's 
property at 109 N. Brea Blvd. and to give it to the Foursquare Church, whose 
downtown property city officials acquired for the redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunec has waged a tenacious legal battle to be compensated for his warehouse, 
once a cluttered workshop where he tinkered with his inventions. He has been 
credited with inventing a blood pump used in heart surgery, developing devices 
for preventing infant crib deaths and creating a keyboard for teaching blind 
children to use computers, according to court documents filed by his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Before seizing the warehouse, the city valued the inventor's property at 
$210,000. Kunec, who is unable to drive a car, said he needed about $450,000 to 
find a replacement location in an area with public transportation. Because the 
case has been in dispute, the owner has not yet received any compensation for 
his property. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the city filed its eminent domain action in civil court, Kunec filed a 
countersuit alleging that the city illegally took his land. 
</P>
<P>
 During a non-jury trial before Goldstein last year, Leifer cited internal city 
memoranda showing that Kunec's property was "reserved for the church" by city 
officials as early as 1990. The lawyer contended that both the state and 
federal constitutions prevented the city from acquiring the property for 
religious purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 While the legal battle between the city and Kunec sizzled, the Foursquare 
Church was temporarily relocated to prefabricated building just down the street 
from Kunec's property. The judge's decision would further delay their plans to 
build a structure on Kunec's property. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials did not testify during the case.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; GROUP SPLIT ON FIRE SERVICES STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some residents have formed a group to fight the city's contracting with the 
county for firefighting services, but factions were already splitting off after 
the first presentation at this week's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Longacer read a long mission statement from the "Voters in Action" 
committee seeking to reverse the May 16 decision to close the city's Fire 
Department. His remarks left at least two members fuming over the belligerent 
tone of the presentation, which urged residents to "join in the battle" and not 
"surrender" to the council decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Longacer said the group leaders had contacted an attorney about how to legally 
reverse the decision. One member said after the meeting that the attorney 
recommended a ballot initiative as one of the better options. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission statement stressed that the group is not seeking a recall of 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Two members who attended Monday night's council meeting said Longacer's 
statements went beyond what they had agreed to at the group's meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Bagley said she did not share the "belligerent" attitude of Longacer's 
remarks. "If the decision could be changed without anger, that would be a 
different matter," she said. "I don't want to be in the position of standing up 
and being threatening." 
</P>
<P>
 Another member, Les McAdams, said he also was disturbed by the tone of the 
presentation. "We discussed taking a positive approach in the (group) meeting," 
he said. "There's a lot of people that don't understand the concept of 
disagreeing agreeably." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Bone told Longacer that he had heard rumors about the group. 
He offered to attend the group's meetings to answer questions and to get 
information from city staff about the Fire Department closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Schulman, a group spokesman who did not attend the council meeting, said 
the members had never agreed to a conciliatory approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have somebody who just stepped on your toes, you don't go up and 
thank them for doing it," he said. "And you don't ask them to next time wear 
slippers instead of hobnail boots." LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; ON MISSION TO HONOR FATHER SERRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He gazes into the distance, this life-size bronze statue of Mission San Juan 
Capistrano founder Father Junipero Serra, dedicated this week at the mission 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 What he might be seeing is the future, which holds another 20 bronze replicas 
of the Catholic priest, and would bring to 50 the number of Serra statues 
donated by multimillionaire developer William Hannon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannon has spread the knowledge of Serra, who founded the Mission San Juan 
Capistrano and another eight of the 21 early California missions, donating the 
statues to schools in Los Angeles and Orange counties. The statue dedicated at 
the church here Tuesday was the sixth donated to a mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people have asked me why I pick Father Serra," said Hannon, 79, who in 
his youth attended a Franciscan school in Los Angeles, where he became aware of 
Serra's work. "I have a great amount of respect for him. Father Serra did an 
awful lot of good for people, and he should be remembered." 
</P>
<P>
 The 30 statues have cost Hannon more than $1 million, money he said is well 
spent because it helps educate children about early California history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing our history is vital," he said. "The schools also get a $1,000 
scholarship for the students." 
</P>
<P>
 The statue was blessed Tuesday by Msgr. Paul Martin, who oversees the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Serra was an inspiration to him because "when I turned 60, I thought 
about Father Serra and how he was establishing missions when he was in his 50s 
and 60s," Martin said. "It was a great consolation and inspiration to me."FRANK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; SWAP MEET CLEARS ITS LAST HURDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved the redesign of an awning for a forthcoming new 
swap meet at Los Alamitos Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Darrell Essex said the council's approval means that the swap 
meet has now cleared all governmental hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The canopy for the food concession was the only thing remaining before the 
council," Essex said. "Now everything has city approval, and the swap meet is 
scheduled to open July 9." 
</P>
<P>
 The council on June 13 approved most of the design plans for the swap meet's 
food concessions and restrooms. But the council balked at the design for an 
awning, or canopy, over the food concession. The original design was for 
something like a circus tent, with peaks and pennants. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Joyce C. Nicholson said the original design had too much of a 
"carnival atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 And Mayor Richard Partin jokingly had accused the canopy designer of trying to 
copy the famous twin peaks at Churchill Downs, the Kentucky Derby track in 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 The new design, approved at a special meeting Monday, looks "more like a 
regular canopy," Essex said. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CITY OKS PROPOSAL TO REVISE CURFEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Advised by police that this city's staggered curfew, which allows 17-year-olds 
to stay out until midnight, is drawing out-of-town youths and causing problems, 
the City Council has given preliminary approval to a law that would corral all 
minors by 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. told the council Tuesday night that an 
increasing number of youngsters from other South County cities -- where the 
curfew is 10 p.m. -- are showing up at later hours in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's curfew law, the only one of its kind in the county, requires that 
youngsters 14 years and younger be in by 10 p.m. while allowing 15- and 
16-year-olds to roam until 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 When police find minors from elsewhere loitering in the city, they call the 
parents, who often had no idea their children were even gone, Purcell said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to the council, Purcell said that in recent months police have 
noticed more minors in town between 10 p.m. and midnight, especially on 
weekends, and that they have "increasingly been either victims of crimes or 
involved in more crimes and non-criminal mischief during these hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The teens are particularly drawn to Main Beach, Heisler Park and Forest 
Avenue, Purcell said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the revised ordinance, which Purcell said has the support of the Laguna 
Beach Unified School District, wins final approval July 5, teens will have 
about a month to get used to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Lida Lenney, a former schoolteacher, urged police to handle the 
transition "with a little tenderness." 
</P>
<P>
 The city had a 10 p.m. curfew from 1953 to 1986, when officials switched to 
the staggered version because they felt it was unfair to treat 13- and 
17-year-olds the same way, according to the memo.LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; PARKING PROGRAM IS BIASED, COUNCIL 
TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 Spanish-speaking residents packed City Hall this week to protest 
a new neighborhood parking program they consider discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano Villas residents, many with their families, told the City 
Council on Tuesday that they were not properly notified in Spanish that they 
now need stickers to park on the streets outside their homes at night. As a 
result, some have received at least a dozen $27 parking tickets, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been one year of negotiations and not on one occasion did a 
Spanish-speaking person get invited to represent the views of the residents," 
said Nativo V. Lopez, the director of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, who demanded 
that the council end the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia K. Stanley, a resident of the nearly 900-unit Capistrano Villas 
condominium community, told the council the new program, created to alleviate 
parking problems in the neighborhood, was created by only a few of the 
homeowners who "discriminated against the rights of these people." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am extremely agitated," Stanley said. "The city has allowed a few 
individuals to represent the community. . . . You have wronged my community and 
you have wronged me." 
</P>
<P>
 The speakers were referring to a parking program instituted May 1 that 
requires all residents of the villas to appear before a parking committee with 
their driver's licenses and vehicle registration to get stickers. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-March, Orange County sheriff's deputies had begun ticketing cars parked 
on the public streets from 3 to 5 a.m. without the stickers, said Jennifer 
Murray, an assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray denied that residents weren't property notified, saying several 
newsletters -- in English and in Spanish -- outlining the new parking 
restrictions have been distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a long history of parking problems in that neighborhood," Murray 
said Wednesday. For more than a year, the city has worked with residents of the 
villas to find a parking solution, and for the first two weeks of the program, 
deputies issued warnings instead of tickets, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Jeff Vasquez joined in criticizing the program Wednesday. 
Vasquez did not support it when it was adopted by the council in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is obvious by the comments that there are some discriminatory practices 
occurring," Vasquez said. "It sounds like there are some problems we have to 
fix. I think you will see these problems modified substantially." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials vowed to work with the residents to find a compromise and 
scheduled a meeting with community representatives for 9 a.m. Saturday at City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing we would ever want to do is discriminate against anybody, 
particularly in this community where we are so proud of our Hispanic heritage, 
" Mayor Collene Campbell said. LEN HALL

 The El Toro Reuse Planning Authority voted Wednesday to include a Marine

</P>
<P>
 U.S. Marine Col. Jim Ritchie was appointed a non-voting member representing 
the base commander, Gen. Drax Williams.Ritchie will serve as an adviser to the

 "We're bringing him in to answer questions that might come up since he has

Thomas F. Riley, who chairs the planning authority. "We wanted somebody with 
the extra up-to-date information that would help us move forward." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the board also voted to delay authorizing an environmental study 
until a specific reuse plan for the base has been decided. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have cost us twice the amount of money to do another environmental 
study," Riley said. "We decided that it would be least costly to do it the way 
we're doing it." TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MAN GUILTY IN DEATH OF GUNFIRE BYSTANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old man was convicted of murder Wednesday for his role in a 
shootout last year in Orange that killed a 15-year-old bystander who was on his 
way to a church retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury deliberated about fours before finding Tu Anh Do guilty 
of first-degree murder, street terrorism and weapons charges in the Aug. 6, 
1993, slaying of Lazaro Omar Acosta Jr. of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Do was also convicted of gang involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces a prison term of up to 26 years to life. Sentencing is scheduled for 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Do is one of six people charged in the fatal shootout, which authorities said 
was sparked during a meeting between factions of a Garden Grove street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Doi Ngoc Phung, 20, of Garden Grove, whom authorities identified as the 
shooter, was recently convicted of first-degree murder, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Robin Park said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other defendants still face trial or preliminary hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta, a sophomore at Century High School and a church choirboy, was sitting 
in his parents' car that Friday evening at the Qwik Korner store parking lot on 
Garden Grove Boulevard when gunfire erupted along nearby Lewis Street, 
according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 One of about 10 bullets fired tore through the trunk of the car in which 
Acosta sat, striking him in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's parents had only been inside the store a few minutes to buy snacks 
for a weekend church retreat he was getting ready to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Do was a passenger in one of three cars driving toward St. Callistus Catholic 
Church, where he and others were going to beat Phung and kick him out of the 
gang, according to police testimony at the trial. A gun battle ensued. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a complicated legal theory, Park said, all defendants, regardless of 
whether they fired a weapon, are liable for murder since they were acting in a 
way that could result in someone's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Dennis McNerney had argued that the prosecutor didn't prove 
Do did anything to cause the shooter to fire the fatal shot. ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; SCHOOLS TO FILE CLAIM IN TAX FUND DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A dispute over several million dollars that the Placentia-Yorba Linda School 
District says it is owed by the city Redevelopment Agency may wind up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 School district trustees Tuesday authorized their attorney to file a claim 
against the Redevelopment Agency, the first step in initiating a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1983 agreement, the agency pays the district a percentage of property 
taxes collected in the city's redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 The district contents it has been underpaid for the past four years under 
terms of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement allows for the tax funds to be used for projects of mutual 
benefit to the district and the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's attorney, Leonard D. Brinley, said: "The agreement 
between the Redevelopment Agency and the school district is convoluted, which 
has probably helped contribute to the problem. The agency has not paid certain 
funds, and so we are filing a claim." 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the dispute is a disagreement over the use of redevelopment money 
to pay for a proposed $2.5-million gymnasium at Hurless Barton Park, near Yorba 
Linda Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials of both the district and the city agree that the gymnasium 
would benefit both residents and students at the middle school, the district is 
reluctant to give up redevelopment funds unless it is an equal partner in the 
project. But the city's plans call for the district to be a tenant with no 
ownership rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In negotiations between the two parties, the city has offered the district use 
of the facility during school hours and on an unspecified number of evenings. 
In return, the district would pay part of the maintenance costs, estimated at 
$36,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would have the right to terminate the district's use of the gym after 
one year. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 A part-time instructor at Coastline Community College was arrested by police

<P>
 Rizzo and the undercover officers had arranged the Huntington Beach meeting 
after Rizzo sold them one ounce of cocaine on June 1, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzo, who has worked at the college for eight years, teaches students to work 
with victims of traumatic head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastline officials are discussing with their legal department "what decisions 
we can make," public relations director Gail Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working to get the details of the case and get a copy of the police 
report," Jones said. "We will take appropriate actions as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzo's classes are scheduled to meet beginning next week. Jones said the 
Fountain Valley college hopes to decide within the next few days whether Rizzo 
will teach them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzo, a Long Beach resident, could not be reached for comment. SHELBY GRAD,

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; CITY OKS BUDGET THAT ELIMINATES 26 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a $279.5-million budget for the 1994-95 fiscal 
year that calls for new building plan fees and the elimination of 26 employee 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The spending plan also includes a $12.9-million deficit, which will be made up 
mostly by one-time revenues such as the sale of a $5-million city reservoir, 
said Rod Coloma, executive director of finance and management services. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report to the board, Coloma blamed much of the city's financial trouble 
on the state government, which has balanced its own budget for the last few 
years by taking a larger share of revenue that previously went to city 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget calls for new fees of $50 to $90 an hour for staff time in 
reviewing building design and construction plans. Those reviews are now free. 
</P>
<P>
 It also calls for a 2.5% increase in the sanitation fee, which will raise the 
average cost per homeowner by $1.80 per year, and a 2.9% increase in the water 
rate, increasing the average bill about 50 cents a month.  
</P>
<P>
 The water rate hike will bring in about $600,000 a year to help pay for the 
expansion of a reservoir and the completion of four new water wells, according 
to a report to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Employee positions that will be eliminated include a fire safety specialist, a 
police arson investigator, two fire battalion chiefs, five police service 
officers, two building inspectors, four custodians and three library staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because employees will be shifted to other, vacant positions wherever 
feasible, only two employees are expected to be laid off, City Manager David N. 
Ream said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council rejected staff proposals to charge more for temporary library 
cards and admission to city pools. It also rejected a plan to close city pools 
on a rotating basis to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 The council eliminated fees for parking permits and modified a controversial 
fee for registering home and business alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 Now only businesses must pay the $25 alarm-registration fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Money generated by the alarm fees will enable the city to retain 17 police 
cadet positions that would otherwise have been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Daniel H. Young praised the staff for its creativity in finding new 
revenue to offset the deficit and added that "this is as close a cut to the 
bone as I've seen in my years on the council." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he warned that unless the economy improves and the state refrains from 
taking additional money from cities, Santa Ana could face substantial layoffs 
within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "One more slip of the rug and we're going to have some major pain at our 
table," he said.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; COUNCIL RESTRICTS GARAGE-SALE DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has given final approval to an ordinance that allows garage 
sales only on the first weekend in March, June, September and December. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was drafted in an effort to crack down on illegal businesses and 
clean up the city's neighborhoods, where residents use frequent yard sales as 
both a means of income and an affordable shopping alternative to secondhand 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The first city-sanctioned garage sale weekend will be in September, according 
to code enforcement officials, who will begin to cite violators in August. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they will spend the next month getting the word out to 
residents via water bills and the media about the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the ordinance takes effect, anyone holding a garage sale outside the four 
sanctioned weekends risks a fine and will have the goods confiscated, pending a 
hearing.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; CITY TO TAKE SMOKING MEASURE OFF BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted 2 to 1 this week to remove a proposed amendment to the 
city's smoking ordinance that was to have been on the November ballot as an 
advisory measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Henry W. Wedaa, who sponsored the amendment that would have banned 
smoking in all public places including restaurants and places of employment, 
was absent from the Tuesday night meeting, and his only consistent ally, Mark 
Schwing, abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will now consider a scaled-back version of the amendment that 
would require restaurants to set aside 70% of their tables for a nonsmoking 
section. Currently, the ordinance requires restaurants to reserve 33% of their 
tables for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John M. Gullixson, who made the motion to remove the advisory 
measure, said that while he initially supported the idea, he now thinks it was 
a mistake to have it on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wedaa manufactured this cause, and while it may have enjoyed some public 
support, was it an issue that people were banging on doors about? No," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullixson said an advisory measure, estimated to cost about $10,000, would be 
a waste of money because both the state and the county are considering smoking 
bans that could preempt whatever the city approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what (the state and county) are going to do," he said. "It may 
become a moot point. If not, we can come back in six months and do an advisory 
measure then." 
</P>
<P>
 Gullixson was supported by Mayor Barbara Kiley. Councilman Daniel T. Welch 
voted against removing the measure.DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

MAN ARRESTED IN FORGED AUTOGRAPH CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Luftwaffe flying ace's signature was worth a lot of money to a Newport Beach 
man, police said -- enough for him to sell hundreds of forgeries of it to 
unwary autograph collectors in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Shutt II, 48, faces charges of grand theft by fraud, they said, for 
selling bogus autographed photos of German World War II flier Erich Hartmann, 
the most successful fighter pilot of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 Shutt's arrest could lead to the discovery of other forgeries in the lucrative 
autograph trade, Ventura County Sheriff's Detective Stanley Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't prove yet that he's the one who actually signed them," Weber said. 
"We may have to start calling other dealers and see if they have dealt with Mr. 
Shutt before." 
</P>
<P>
 Shutt could not be reached for comment this week. He was released Monday on 
his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shutt case sheds light on the musty world of World War II memorabilia 
dealers, who hire veterans of Allied and Axis fighting forces to sign thick 
stacks of photos that can sell for $75 to $100 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartmann, credited with shooting down 352 Allied warplanes -- most of them 
Russian -- signed dozens of photos and lithographs before his death in October. 
</P>
<P>
 When Shutt offered a box of Hartmann photos to Thousand Oaks-based autograph 
dealers Terry and Angelika Kinsella, they said they were interested. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 20 years, the Kinsellas had been dealing in autographs and photos 
of famous and notorious historical figures under the name A Piece of History 
International. 
</P>
<P>
 They had developed a taste for "militaria" -- the photos, documents and 
autographs left behind by famous wartime personalities, particularly from World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 They even sold some of those items to Shutt over the years -- including the 
signature of Nazi architect Albert Speer -- for use in his own autograph 
business in Tustin, called King's Crown Gallery, Terry Kinsella said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Shutt announced in April that he was closing shop and offered to sell off 
his inventory, the Kinsellas met him in the lush lobby of the Westlake Hyatt 
Regency. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing them photocopies of letters Hartmann had written to him, Shutt offered 
to sell the Kinsellas a box of photographs, police said. The Kinsellas said the 
box contained 140 Hartmann glossies and 10 signed photos of Hans Baur, Adolf 
Hitler's personal pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 When Shutt opened his car trunk in the parking lot, the couple glanced at the 
top of the pile and hurriedly paid him $1,500 for the lot, Terry Kinsella said. 
But later, Kinsella says, he grew suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the safes, took the photos out and spread them out on the desk, and 
said, 'Uh-oh, definite forgeries,' " he said. Police confirm that the 
signatures were forged. 
</P>
<P>
 Ink had pooled along the signature's looping lines, indicating the 
stop-and-start drawing of someone tracing an original Hartmann autograph, 
Kinsella said. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he held a thin stack of photos up to the light, Kinsella said, the 
signatures all stacked perfectly atop each other as if they were one. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple called Ventura County detectives. They subsequently arranged to 
talk to Shutt about buying his whole collection and steered him again to the 
Hyatt lobby, where Weber sat nearby in plainclothes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a little haggling, the Kinsellas agreed to buy some of the items, 
including more signed Hartmann photos, for $4,200, and took Shutt outside to 
consummate the deal, police said.

POLICE SEEK SHOOTING VICTIM'S EX-BOYFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Police said Wednesday that they want to question the former boyfriend of a 
23-year-old woman who was found shot to death, along with her current 
boyfriend, inside her apartment this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been unsuccessful in our efforts to reach him," Lt. Robert Helton 
said of the former boyfriend, who has not been named as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get to the point where we can list him as a suspect, then we will 
try and get a warrant for his arrest," Helton said. "It's going to take a 
certain level of evidence before we can get to that stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Laura Suarez and 36-year-old Crisanto Flores were found dead Monday 
afternoon in her third-floor apartment in the 1100 block of West Civic Center 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors say Suarez, who worked as a cocktail waitress at a Santa Ana 
nightclub, and her former boyfriend had lived together in the apartment until 
two months ago, when she forced him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Bautista, assistant manager of the apartment complex, said Suarez had not 
asked management to change her locks.  
</P>
<P>
 The victims had been dead for about 36 hours when their bodies were 
discovered. A neighbor had reported to the apartment's maintenance worker 
Sunday morning that she had heard gunshots, but the worker did not tell 
management until sometime Monday, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lengthy delay as far as notifying the manager," Helton said. "We 
don't know why he didn't report it right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Bautista said the double murder has residents frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter what neighborhood you are in . . . anything can happen," 
Bautista said. "It could happen anywhere to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Said neighbor Max Mendez: "It happened right in front of my house. There are 
no security guards here. Anyone can get up here. I'm moving this month."

BEEF UP SECURITY AT SANTA ANA COURT, REPORT SAYS; VIOLENCE: GRAND JURY CITES 
INCREASING CRIME AT THE CIVIC CENTER IN URGING COUNTY TO SPEND $485,000 ON 
EQUIPMENT ALONE. BUT SUPERVISOR RILEY ISN'T CONVINCED. 
</P>

<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury called on the Board of Supervisors Wednesday to 
pay for airport-style security devices at the courthouse here, citing increased 
crime in the Civic Center area and shootings at other Southern California 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, an estimated 7,200 people enter the county court building in Santa 
Ana, which houses 11 floors of courtrooms and allows "virtually unrestricted 
access," the grand jury report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Courtrooms are known for their somber decorum, but when people have life, 
liberty, love or money at risk, tempers are apt to flare," members of the grand 
jury wrote. "Being deep in the sanctum of lawfulness does not stop mobsters, 
gang members or even angry spouses from threatening violence or carrying it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The report calls for six airport-style screening X-ray and metal detectors, at 
a cost of $485,000. According to the report, 19 county marshal's officers would 
be needed to operate the new security stations, at a yearly cost of $732,000. 
The report does not specify whether those officers would be new hires or 
reassigned from other duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said the panel's recommendations were worthy of "a 
good look" but seemed heavy-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My initial reaction was, 'Wait a minute, we better take another look at this 
before we set something up that looks like a high-security facility,' " Riley 
said. "Just the thing itself is difficult for me to accept, let alone the 
cost." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors recently approved $350,000 in security enhancements 
for the courthouse -- including security cameras and magnetic door locks. Riley 
said those measures would be less obtrusive and may be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 The county marshal's office applauded Wednesday's grand jury report. Last 
month, department officials said they were considering recommendations from 
state court authorities to install electronic screening devices at the 
entrances to the Civic Center courthouse and other county courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The marshal would like to thank the grand jury for highlighting the needs for 
additional security within the court facilities," Capt. Don Spears said.  
</P>
<P>
 Spears said Marshal Michael S. Carona only regretted that the grand jury 
limited the scope of its report to the courthouse in Santa Ana and did not 
mention the other county courts in Westminster, Newport Beach, Fullerton and 
Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no major security problems in Orange County courts, Spears 
said, but airport-style screening serves as a deterrent to people who might be 
carrying weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The screening would complement security measures recently approved by the 
Board of Supervisors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the only county courthouse with X-ray screening and metal detectors 
is the new juvenile justice center in Orange, where marshals say they routinely 
seize knives, brass knuckles, pepper spray and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Spears said the judges at each court must decide whether they support the more 
restrictive environment of airport-style screening, and the Board of 
Supervisors must ultimately decide whether to pay for such measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury report points to a 1992 fatal shooting of two people in a San 
Bernardino County courtroom, and a 1991 incident where a woman and her 
9-year-old daughter were gunned down in a Lake Elsinore court waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also noted that 2,200 crime incidents were reported within two 
miles of the Santa Ana courthouse in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although there are signs posted in the various entrances indicating that it 
is a crime to bring a weapon into the facility, if the weapon is not visible to 
court security personnel, no preventive steps can be taken," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report comes on the heels of heightened Sheriff's Department patrols 
launched in March around the Civic Center government complex after county 
employees complained of increased shake-downs for cash and other harassment by 
criminals loitering in the area.

CHARGES FILED IN DANA POINT MOLESTATION CASE; CRIME: THE 13 COUNTS AGAINST THE

 Thirteen counts of child molestation and harassment were filed in Municipal 
Court here Wednesday against a man suspected of stalking a Dana Point 
neighborhood for four months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Thomas Michael Cimino, 30, of San Juan Capistrano, include 
one count each of forced lewd behavior and indecent exposure, three counts of 
attempted child molestation and eight counts of child annoyance. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges involve 10 girls between the ages of 6 and 10, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Cimino's arraignment on the charges was postponed until Tuesday 
because his attorney wanted time to study Orange County sheriff's reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Cimino, calmly chatting with his wife and attorney from behind a wire cage in 
court, bore little resemblance to the police composite drawing that was 
circulated in the Capistrano Beach community where nine incidents of child 
molestation and harassment had been reported since March. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested late Monday by sheriff's deputies who had taken a photograph 
of Cimino and shown it to children who had been victimized. They made what 
investigators are calling a positive identification of Cimino by nine children. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Arthur G. Koelle denied media requests to take pictures of Cimino in 
court, saying he didn't want to prejudice the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Cimino's attorney, Paul J. Wallin of Santa Ana, gave an early sign of a 
possible defense strategy after appearing in court, telling a phalanx of 
reporters in the highly publicized case that testimony from young children is 
often unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't rush to a judgment in this case," he said. "He has been ID'd by a 
6-year-old girl in a photo lineup, that's all. Even if it was 10 girls, that 
doesn't mean he did it." Wallin accused the Sheriff's Department of bowing to 
community pressure to make an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are destroying (Cimino's) life and the life of his family," the attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Hal Brotheim, head of the sex crimes division of the Sheriff's 
Department, disclosed Wednesday that investigators now suspect that in addition 
to stalking a neighborhood, Cimino also exposed himself to a young girl on a 
basketball court at Palisades Elementary School on May 27.  
</P>
<P>
 In most of the other counts, prosecutors allege Cimino approached children in 
a park or in front of their home and attempted to lure them behind foliage with 
a story about his lost kitten. 
</P>
<P>
 In the one molestation charge, prosecutors allege the suspect grabbed an 
8-year-old girl and forced her to touch him in a sexual manner. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother said her child, who, according to investigators, picked 
Cimino from a photo lineup on Tuesday, "feels much better; she was practically 
glowing when she heard (a suspect) was caught." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us feel better now, because before he was some kind of faceless 
boogie man," she said. "Now there's a real-life person behind bars that I can 
direct my anger towards." 
</P>
<P>
 Court records show that Cimino had been charged with exposing himself before 
several young girls near a Manhattan Beach church in 1990. He ultimately agreed 
to a reduced charge of lewd conduct and was placed on three years' probation, 
which has expired.

TB VICTIM, FAMILY FILE CLAIMS AGAINST SCHOOLS, COUNTY; HEALTH: THEY ALLEGE 
NEGLIGENCE IN OFFICIALS' HANDLING OF DISEASE OUTBREAK AT GARDEN GROVE 
DISTRICT'S LA QUINTA HIGH. THE ACTION COULD BE A FIRST STEP TOWARD LITIGATION. 
</P>

<P>
 A student who lost part of a lung to tuberculosis and her family have filed 
claims against the Garden Grove Unified School District and the county for 
alleged negligence in their handling of a TB outbreak at La Quinta High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi French and her father, mother and older sister are seeking unspecified 
damages from the two agencies for injuries they claim to have suffered. While 
18-year-old Debi was the only one to contract the disease, other family members 
tested positive in October for the TB bacteria and were given drugs to reduce 
the possibility that they might become ill in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The four separate claims, which could be the first steps toward litigation, 
contend that "these agencies failed and refused to take any affirmative steps 
to inform students, parents and the local community" about a TB outbreak at La 
Quinta after it was discovered last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The claims refer to a report by investigators from the Centers for Disease 
Control, which concluded that county health officials could have prevented the 
outbreak by more aggressively monitoring the treatment of the first La Quinta 
student in whom tuberculosis was diagnosed. The report also faulted the 
student's private physician for initially misdiagnosing her illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Orange County Health Care Agency and Garden Grove Unified 
School District refused to comment on the claims, which were filed last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 French family members acknowledge in the filings that they missed separate 
legal deadlines to file the claims. The family contends that the filings were 
delayed by Debi French's illness and late recognition that she caught the 
disease from the first La Quinta student in whom it was diagnosed, back in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Bunker, the county's claims manager, said the county will decide within 
two weeks whether to waive the deadline. If the county refuses, he said, the 
French family could appeal to a court to exempt them from the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually we will look into the validity of the claim," Bunker said. "That 
usually takes 30 to 45 days. If we deny the claim, they have six months to file 
a lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 When the TB outbreak peaked at La Quinta last year, the disease had been 
diagnosed in 17 students. Officials believe the disease developed by 12 of 
those students can be traced to the female student who was initially 
misdiagnosed in 1991. She is believed to have been contagious for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl has developed a drug-resistant and contagious strain of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 French, who was originally diagnosed with the disease in June, 1993, but 
responded well to medication, experienced a relapse sometime between December, 
1993, and February of this year. When first-line medications failed to cure 
her, she went to the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory 
Medicine in Denver for specialized care. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, French had a third of her lung surgically removed to combat the 
disease. She said Wednesday that she feels fine and hopes to make up lost 
classes at La Quinta next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 During schoolwide testing last September, 175 other staff and students at La 
Quinta tested positive for the TB bacteria, 10 of whom were found to have the 
disease. In the wake of French's relapse, county officials initiated a new 
round of testing at La Quinta and since February have turned up as many as 126 
more students and staff who have tested positive for the bacteria that causes 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 County, state and federal investigators are in the process of determining 
which of these infections can be traced to French or other former TB carriers 
at the school.

COUNCIL REJECTS LIMIT ON PUBLIC COMMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council backed away this week from imposing a 45-minute limit on the 
public comment portion of twice-monthly council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 This decision also applies to sessions of the Brea Redevelopment Agency and 
the city's Public Financing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have been critical of a time limit and have called it a "gag rule" 
and an infringement on their First Amendment right of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Frank Benest has maintained that limiting the time devoted to 
public comment would allow the council and other municipal bodies to conduct 
business more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Council sessions have lasted late into the night as residents voice opinions, 
often about the 50-acre downtown redevelopment project. Each speaker is limited 
to a five-minute presentation, but there is no restriction on the overall 
duration of public comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council has rejected time limits, it may start requiring speakers 
to fill out a card stating their name, address and discussion topic. That idea 
is on the agenda for the July 5 council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of the cards would apparently put a stop to "serial speakers" who each 
deliver a five-minute segment of a coordinated presentation. At a recent 
council meeting, a series of seven speakers read material for at least 35 
minutes, the city manager pointed out.

DEMOCRATIC EFFORT TO UNSEAT DORNAN SUFFERS SETBACK; POLITICS: THE SECOND-PLACE 
FINISHER IN THE PARTY'S PRIMARY SAYS HE WILL RUN AS A WRITE-IN CANDIDATE, A 
MOVE THAT LIKELY WILL HELP THE INCUMBENT CONGRESSMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Democratic Party's campaign to defeat Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove) ran into complications Wednesday when the second-place finisher in the 
primary said he would run as a write-in candidate in November. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Robert J. Banuelos, who for the last two years has introduced himself 
as the man who nearly defeated Dornan in the 1992 election, said he feels 
compelled to run because of his dissatisfaction with Dornan and Mike Farber, a 
businessman who won the Democratic nomination in the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been involved in the district since 1986. I didn't just move here to 
run," Banuelos said, referring to both Farber and Dornan, who is seeking his 
ninth term to Congress and his sixth in the central Orange County district. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber was in Washington Wednesday and was unavailable for comment. But his 
campaign issued a two-sentence statement that read: "We must unify all 
communities behind the Democratic Party and work toward the goals important to 
all of us. We must work together to bring responsible representation back to 
Orange County . . . which begins with the retirement of Bob Dornan." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Marie Piring, the executive director of the Democratic Foundation of 
Orange County, was angered by Banuelos' announcement and conceded it could hurt 
the efforts to defeat Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 Banuelos "is out for his own glorification," she said. "If he were a true 
Democrat, he would respect the (primary) voters who chose Mike Farber instead 
of a do-nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Banuelos, who explained his reasons for his write-in candidacy to a White 
House political staffer during a meeting in Santa Ana last Saturday, said he 
expected Democrats would accuse him of disrupting party unity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where was party unity in 1992 when I won the primary and the district had 
been targeted" by Democrats? Banuelos said. "I asked for assistance, and I 
asked for help and it was not there. I was left out there to flounder on my 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 Banuelos said he was not attempting the write-in candidacy to settle a score 
with the Democratic Party for the way it handled his 1992 campaign, but "for 
the voters that came out and voted for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan, who can only benefit if Banuelos cuts into Democratic support for 
Farber, said he can "understand the statement (Banuelos) is trying to make" in 
light of the party leadership's rejection of his 1992 candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was treated shabbily (by Democratic Party leaders), especially if 
he carried the banner one year," Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Banuelos' claim that he is the only candidate who did not move 
to the district just to run for Congress, Dornan said that unlike Farber, he 
was invited by his party to run in Orange County. He purchased a home in the 
district immediately after his election to establish roots in the community. 
Dornan also listed numerous public works projects he helped fund for the 
district as a demonstration of his commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding itself being attacked on two fronts, the Farber campaign said that the 
Democratic nominee "has lived in the district two years, which is two years 
longer than Bob Dornan has actually spent in the district in the last 10." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 election, Dornan received just over 50% of the vote, compared to 
41% for Banuelos and almost 9% for the Libertarian candidate, Richard G. 
Newhouse, who is running again in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Democratic Party leaders conceded after the 1992 election that they had 
missed an opportunity to defeat Dornan and immediately organized the "Beat Bob" 
committee for the 1994 election. Democrats hold a six-point voter registration 
edge over Republicans in the district, which includes Santa Ana, Anaheim and 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason Banuelos' candidacy was not taken seriously in 1992 was 
that he ran a low-key campaign, spending only about $8,000 for the primary and 
general elections. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Banuelos spent less than $5,000 in the primary campaign compared to 
the roughly $180,000 by Farber. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber won the primary by only 207 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has had trouble raising money in the past, Banuelos said he hopes 
to raise $500,000 for his write-in campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The last successful write-in campaign for an Orange County legislative seat 
was in 1982, when Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) won his congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The official filing period for write-in campaigns for the November election 
runs from Sept. 12 through Oct. 25.

SKIP LOADER HITS FIRETRUCK; 1 HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Fire Department engine about to take part in a traffic 
accident rescue drill was crushed Wednesday evening by a 45,000-pound skip 
loader that careened across Los Alisos Boulevard and smashed into the parked 
firetruck. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the skip loader escaped injuries and the driver of the fire 
engine suffered only bruises to one arm, but the $200,000 firetruck may have 
been destroyed, Fire Department spokeswoman Emmy Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 Day said the accident is still under investigation, but officials speculate 
that a mechanical problem may have caused the skip loader to go out of control.

SHOOTING VICTIM FOUND IN CAR IDENTIFIED BY POLICE AS 23-YEAR-OLD L.A. WOMAN

<P>
 The body of a woman who had been shot "multiple times" and left in the back 
seat of a parked car has been identified as that of 23-year-old Sherri 
Cabaccang of Los Angeles, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabaccang's late-model Ford Mustang had been parked in a commercial lot near 
Westmont Drive and Euclid Street at least since Sunday, Sgt. Steve Rodig 
said.Someone finally notified police about the car on Tuesday and the body was 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The body was in the back seat, out of view," Rodig said. "We believe she was 
shot at the same location where the car was found. It is unknown how long she 
had been inside of the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodig said police have no suspects and have not established a motive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a lot of work to do on this case," Rodig said. "We don't know 
much" about Cabaccang, who lived in Los Angeles' Harbor City section. "We are 
still contacting family members and trying to determine a motive for why this 
may have happened."

1994 LOS ANGELES TIMES; ALL-VENTURA SOFTBALL TEAM; PLAYER & PITCHER OF THE 
YEAR; MARMONTE MARVELS; SARA GRIFFIN: TALENTED PITCHER ENDS SUPERLATIVE CAREER 
-- MUCH TO THE RELIEF OF MARMONTE LEAGUE BATTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The reign is over and Marmonte League batters couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High right-hander Sara Griffin, The Times' Ventura County pitcher 
of the year, has thrown her last trademark riseball for the Pioneers, who 
dominated during her four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin single-handedly guided the Pioneers to two Southern Section Division I 
championship games, one section title, two league titles and a No. 1 ranking in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Next season, the Pioneers without Griffin figure to be like the UCLA Bruins 
without Lisa Fernandez -- tough, but possibly not tough enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's Suzanne Manlet has coached several above-average pitchers in her 
14-year tenure, but none can match the sheer athleticism and skill of Griffin, 
Cal-Hi Sports' state player of the year the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's on top of them all," Manlet said. "Her hard work and determination from 
a very young age helped develop her into a wonderful player and individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan-bound Griffin was plagued by an inflamed arm throughout most of the 
season, but her statistics hardly suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 She pitched 16 shutouts and finished 21-2. She allowed just seven runs -- four 
of which were earned -- in 183 innings for a 0.15 earned-run average. She 
struck out 252 and her strikeout-to-walk ratio was 18-1. 
</P>
<P>
 She was no slouch as a batter either. Griffin led the team in nearly every 
offensive category. 
</P>
<P>
 She batted .301 with 16 runs, 25 hits, 12 runs batted in, four triples and two 
home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing more threatening to opponents than Griffin in the pitching 
circle was Griffin on the base paths. She stole 18 bases without being caught 
and stole home twice. 
</P>
<P>
 During Griffin's four-year reign, the Pioneers never lost more than six games 
in a season.  
</P>
<P>
 After her freshman year, she accounted for three of every four Pioneer 
victories. She finished her career with a 63-6 record and a 0.13 ERA. She 
struck out 704 in 532 innings, an average of 1.3 strikeouts per inning. 
</P>
<P>
 After guiding the Pioneers to the school's first section softball title in her 
junior year, Griffin returned for her senior season determined to repeat.  
</P>
<P>
 Although she picked up right where she left off, circumstances conspired 
against her. The Northridge earthquake, 8 a.m. practices, injuries and Manlet's 
hospitalization for cancer thwarted the Pioneers' repeat attempt.  
</P>
<P>
 After claiming its second consecutive league title, Simi Valley lost to 
Lompoc, 2-0, in the second round of the playoffs, the same day Manlet had 
life-saving surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We named our season, 'A season to remember,' " Griffin said. "We had our ups 
and downs and there were a lot of injuries. . . . We had a lot of obstacles 
(but) we had a fairly good season considering what happened." 1st-Team

CITY HALL JOURNAL: WHITTIER; CITY PLANS TO RENAME STREET TO HONOR NIXON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are planning to rename a short, curved access road behind City 
Hall after the late President Richard M. Nixon, who lived in Whittier for more 
than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council ordered its staff last week to prepare a resolution to change 
the name of Civic Center Road, a 700-foot street, to Richard M. Nixon 
Drive.Staff had recommended renaming an out-of-the-way street in honor of Nixon 
to minimize the impact on residents and business owners. The name change will 
cost the city $200 for new street signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Greg Nordbak argued, however, that the city should do more to 
recognize Nixon. Nordbak proposed that the city also seek private funding to 
build a fountain or a statue to honor Nixon. Consulting engineer Norbert 
Vinatieri said at the council meeting that a complex of buildings next to Civic 
Center Road should be named Nixon Square. The council did not act on either 
suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon lived in Whittier off and on from 1922 to 1946, graduating from Whittier 
High School and Whittier College. He also worked in a law firm in the city and 
represented Whittier and surrounding areas after being elected to the House of 
Representatives in 1946. He died April 22. JOHN D. WAGNER

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; YELLOW STREET LAMPS NO LONGER IN A GOOD LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The distinctive yellow street lamps that have lined city streets since 1978 
may soon be a fading memory. 
</P>
<P>
 The low-pressure sodium lights, which cast a dim, amber hue, have fallen out 
of favor.When the system was installed, city officials believed the softer 
lights would help reduce street crime. However, residents have complained that 
the yellow light actually makes it more difficult for witnesses to identify 
suspects and vehicles, City Manager James C. Hankla said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city would have to spend $25 million to $30 million to replace the 
lighting system with high-pressure sodium, or white lights, Hankla added. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week referred the issue to its committee on traffic and 
infrastructure. A full report from the city manager's office, detailing costs 
of the changeover and suggestions for paying the bill, is due within six weeks. 
The city would probably have to create a series of assessment districts to pay 
for new lights, Hankla said.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; COUNCILMAN FILES LIBEL SUIT AGAINST OPPONENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Councilman Warren Harwood has initiated a lawsuit against the man who 
defeated him in a runoff election two weeks ago, claiming that Councilman-elect 
Jerry Shultz libeled him during the campaign and should pay up to $1 million in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Harwood charges that, among other things, Shultz distributed campaign 
literature that implied that the councilman was a racist because it repeated an 
accusation from a neighbor on Falcon Avenue in North Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Shultz flyer, Harwood's next-door neighbor of five years, Debra 
Atlas, said: "As an African American, I vividly remember the day I moved in 
next to Mr. Harwood. He immediately built a block wall between our houses and 
would not allow his children to play with mine." Harwood said the wall was 
actually in place when he moved into the house in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz called the action "a frivolous lawsuit," adding that he is considering 
a countersuit. "It's a shame he's wasting my time with this when I have a lot 
of work to do for the council," said Shultz, who is scheduled to take over the 
District 7 seat from Harwood on July 19.

BOARDWALK BIKE BAN IS LIFTED, SPEED LIMITS SET; LONG BEACH: COUNCIL, REACTING 
TO A WAVE OF PROTESTS, OVERTURNS ITS 14-MONTH PROHIBITION ON BICYCLING. BUT 
CYLISTS MUST SLOW TO 15 M.P.H. AND 5 M.P.H. NEAR PEDESTRIANS.

 Leisurely pedaling his 12-speed mountain bike along the Alamitos Bay 
peninsula's wooden boardwalk in Long Beach, Rick Vargas passes the usual 
sights: a jogger, a couple walking hand-in-hand, two children with buckets and 
shovels -- and a sign pointing out that cycling is off limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, who has taken many weekend outings to this peaceful community at the 
southeastern tip of the city, pauses for a moment to sip from his water bottle, 
admiring the quaint seafront homes on one side, sand and surf on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm not exactly supposed to ride here," said the 20-year-old Cal State 
Long Beach student. "But no one ever says anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Vargas' perceptions, bicycle riding on the boardwalk, with its 
10-foot-wide planks, has been a subject of debate among residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The council banned riding 14 months ago after Councilman Douglas S. Drummond 
received reports of collisions between cyclists and pedestrians. After the ban 
triggered a wave of protests, the council opted for a compromise. The ban on 
two-wheelers will be lifted Monday, but the council imposed a general speed 
limit of 15 m.p.h. and 5 m.p.h. near pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed limit also applies to Bayshore Walk, a smaller cement path north of 
Ocean Boulevard facing Alamitos Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond said that when community representatives approached him last year 
with the idea for the ban, he was under the impression that they had surveyed 
the neighborhood. However, he said, they had not. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond called the ban "a mistake that's been rectified. It's amazing how 
many people ride bikes upon the boardwalk," he said. "The boardwalk is quite 
wide, so if bicycles are ridden slowly, there is enough room to get around." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Sahlin, a peninsula resident for 15 years, praised the move, as did 
several other residents. Bicycling along the 14-block boardwalk is an easy, 
quick way for many in the tight-knit community to visit one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bicycles have never been a major problem," Sahlin said. "But parking is a 
major problem at the peninsula. You go to visit a friend 10 blocks away and 
there's no place to park. Bikes are a good way to get around." 
</P>
<P>
 Sahlin said that many children, including his 8-year-old nephew, who visits 
every weekend, have had no other place to ride but on Ocean Boulevard, which 
can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Ocean, people tend to speed. There's parked cars and cars pulling out of 
side streets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But those arguments don't mean much to Charles A. Berry and other residents 
who support the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry, 64, a Belmont Shore resident, was taking one of his daily strolls along 
that boardwalk in October, when he was struck from behind and knocked down by a 
young woman on a bicycle, he said. His shin caught on a rusty nail, requiring a 
tetanus shot and an overnight hospital stay, he said. Berry said he could not 
walk for three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry pointed out that much of one side of the path is bordered by private 
fences, and the other by a four-foot retaining wall to keep away sand. As a 
result, he said, walkers have no escape from out-of-control cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Humans and bicycles just don't mix on the boardwalk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond said the new speed limit should cut down on possible accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's people roller-skating, jogging, and with all of the mix, 
occasionally, someone might run into someone else, but not frequently," 
Drummond said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't prohibit something on the basis of one or two accidents," he added. 
"Otherwise we wouldn't have freeways." 
</P>
<P>
 The speed limit will be enforced, said Long Beach police spokesman Joseph 
Levy. Several officers who patrol the beach area with four-wheel, all-terrain 
vehicles will check the boardwalk for speeders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on their training and experience, the officers can determine how fast a 
bicycle is going," Levy said. "If there is a problem, the officers can advise 
the person to slow down or issue a citation."

GOING TO BAT FOR YOUTHS; COACH HELPS COMPTON TEENS COMPETE ON FIELD RATHER THAN 
IN GANGS 
</P>

<P>
 For the boys from the Compton 'hood, the four-inning exhibition contest played 
recently in a modest Lynwood park was a chance to be big-league, a chance to 
show that kids from Compton could get together for some reason other than 
running with a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 The team of 13- and 14-year-olds didn't have a name. The players brought 
borrowed bats, one old practice baseball and barely enough jerseys for the 
starters. They had found the old jerseys stacked in a storeroom of a Compton 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 Their opponents, the Blue Jays, didn't bother to wear uniforms for this game 
at Dymally Congressional Park. The contest was just a tuneup for the Lynwood 
recreation league team, an opportunity to stay sharp for league and tournament 
play. They had little reason to fear the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Compton youths had been hanging out at Burrell-McDonald Park, near the 
west border of the city, when the man who would become their coach, Robert 
Carr, started playing catch with them one afternoon about three months ago. The 
teen-agers remembered Carr as a successful coach at Enterprise Middle School 
from 1989 through 1993. Carr had lost his job at the school and, with time on 
his hands, had decided to work out with youngsters who had lots of energy, too 
many temptations and too little else to do. 
</P>
<P>
 He used to be just like them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports kept me out of the streets," he said. "We wouldn't have all these 
problems if the older boys would put down their beer bottles and guns and help 
these little kids like I remember the big kids helping me." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, competing with the gangs is often harder than winning games on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a Latino kid at Enterprise who had an 80-miles-per-hour fastball as an 
eighth-grader," Carr said. "He was almost unhittable, but he turned to gang 
violence. And he's now dead. He was killed last year in a gang shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Carr started running and fielding drills in the park. The students hit 
baseballs off tees. They learned the mechanics of playing different positions. 
They played pepper. And they began to think of themselves as Coach Carr's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time I knew I had a team was when the kids started coming every day," he 
said. "They were showing up to practice even when I didn't show up." 
</P>
<P>
 Carr, 30, had been a standout athlete in three sports at Compton's Centennial 
High. His own athletic career was cut short by injuries, including a severely 
broken leg. His 6-foot-4 frame remains lean and muscular. 
</P>
<P>
 He was working in a warehouse when he first began volunteer coaching at area 
schools, which led to a job as a walk-on coach and teaching assistant at 
Enterprise. From 1991 to 1993, Carr's baseball teams finished first twice and 
second once in their league with an overall record of 17 wins and 4 losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr also won two championships in football, said Assistant Supt. LaVonne 
Johnson, who had hired Carr when she was the Enterprise principal. Current 
Principal Gipson Lyles refused to provide any information about the past or 
current performance of the school's sports teams. He would not discuss why Carr 
was replaced as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr lost his job last fall after being involved in a scuffle that began when 
he left school grounds to retrieve a belligerent student. Carr said a school 
official had directed him to bring back the student. He wrestled the student to 
the ground when the boy started kicking him, Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators decided to fire Carr shortly after the incident. 
District officials said they had no comment on the matter. Carr has been doing 
part-time maintenance work and odd jobs while looking for full-time employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was better than all of the coaches I ever played for," said 
shortstop-pitcher Juan Diaz, 13. "He motivates people. I felt bad when he 
left." 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz was eager to learn from the coach, and like the other players, he also 
wanted to play some real games. Carr feared that the teens' enthusiasm would 
flag without competition. He said he called about a dozen parks to ask about 
joining a league. Some leagues were full. Others told him they didn't accept 
teams from outside the area, or that he had missed the entrance deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they hear you're from Compton, it kind of scares them off," Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally a Lynwood city league agreed to set up the June 1 practice game, which 
would be an unofficial audition. If Carr's boys were not embarrassed too badly, 
they might be allowed to enter the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've waited three months for this," Carr told his players before the game. 
"There's no pressure on us. If it's not fun, we're not doing it right." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood pitcher Hector Hernandez, 13, used a mitt-popping fastball and a 
sweeping curve to strike out the first six batters. Meanwhile, the cagey 
Lynwood squad turned a few hits and a running game into three first-inning 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, Carr was teaching: showing his third baseman how to set his 
feet for a tag play, directing his shortstop to hold baserunners closer to 
second base, telling his catcher when to throw through to a base. Carr made 
sure every player batted and took the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was 4-0 before Compton broke through against Lynwood's backup 
pitcher for a couple of hits and a run in the third inning. Diaz got the big 
hit, a rocket to left center that went for a triple. 
</P>
<P>
 But this game would have no fairy-tale ending. The Lynwood team won, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance was good enough, however, to satisfy Blue Jays coach Oscar 
Flores, 21, a recreation leader for the city of Lynwood. He said his league 
would welcome Compton's participation. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just what Carr wants. The news also pleased Sherille CheathamCQ, the 
mother of 14-year-old Compton catcher Dante Green. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wasn't here right now, he might be in the streets somewhere hanging 
out, smoking cigarettes, smoking weed," Cheatham said of her son. "So many kids 
are going bad. The gangs are waiting for them with open arms. And if the 
streets get 'em, there ain't no coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Green had practiced with the team only five days because he was 
recovering from a broken arm he got in a fight, Cheatham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather be here at the park watching him play than at home not knowing 
where he is and praying," she added. "If I had to go to Cucamonga to buy 
baseballs for this team, I would do it."

FINANCIAL WOES STALL $40-MILLION COMPTON CASINO PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed $40-million casino complex in Compton has been stalled by financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction had been scheduled to begin this month, but the developer, 
Compton Entertainment Inc., asked for more time to arrange adequate financing, 
officials said.The City Council extended the deadline to start construction by 
six months to Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential investors have been reluctant to commit funds because of the city's 
crime rate and the threat of a drive to place the casino issue on the ballot, 
said Jerold B. Neuman, an attorney for Compton Entertainment. The ballot effort 
fizzled, and the developer has assured potential investors that the complex 
will have adequate security, Neuman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that construction will start in four to six months. The project 
will include a casino, two restaurants, a bar and a nightclub on a seven-acre 
site in the near-vacant Compton Auto Plaza off the Artesia Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Yvonne Arceneaux opposed the deadline extension. "I just question 
whether they'll obtain the financial backing," she said. "I hope this is not 
another failed project in Compton." 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Entertainment will have to pay the city $125,000 a month in licensing 
fees beginning in September, the month when the casino originally was scheduled 
to open. The council rejected the developer's request to postpone the fees.

COUNTY ROUNDUP: NEWSSTANDS OFFER A READING ON TRENDS IN DANCE, LIFESTYLE; A 
THIRD STORE HAS OPENED IN VENTURA COUNTY SELLING MAGAZINES THAT WILL GIVE FANS 
THEIR CELEBRITY-CHARGED FIX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 You say you just can't get enough of seeing Reba McEntire, the Judds or Clint 
Black and his wife, Lisa Hartman, on magazine, tabloid or TV Guide covers at 
the supermarket checkout line? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you're in luck. The Newsstands Magazines, Etc. . . chain just opened a 
third location in Ventura county. So now country fans can get their fix reading 
about national crooners, line dances and country lifestyles from a plethora of 
magazines sold at Newsstand stores in Thousand Oaks, Westlake and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the titles carried include: "Country Song Roundup," "Country Guitar," 
"Country America," Country Woman" and two fanzines -- "Howdy!" and my personal 
favorite, "Country's Hottest Hunks," a special issue put out by "Country Fever" 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Cash even graces the cover of the June issue of "Pulse!," a free 
rock-oriented music magazine available at Tower Record/Video stores. Cash is 
the subject of the cover story and there's also an article on country star 
Rodney Crowell. 
</P>
<P>
 And the new country trend isn't confined to news racks. For example, I tuned 
in a music video on Country Music Television the other night but thought I was 
watching VH-1. What a revelation! 
</P>
<P>
 Country pixie newcomer, Lari White was singing her hit, "He's My Baby," with a 
refrain so irritating that I had a flashback to the Archies' pop bubble-gum hit 
"Sugar, Sugar." White's new ditty is one of the worst pseudo-country songs 
since Barbara Mandrell used Montovani string arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of crossover influences, have you heard the Gibson-Miller band's 
remake of Willie Nelson's classic, "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be 
Cowboys"? The drum parts and disco bass on this new mix sound more like K.C. 
and the Sunshine Band doing "Shake Your Bootie" on a disco dance floor in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 So there may be truth in the rumor that a new disco-driven dance called the 
Nouveau Hustle may be showing up soon on country dance floors. With lots of 
country swing dance fans learning it, maybe the Nouveau Hustle will show up 
soon on country dance floors. After all, Urban Cowboy choreographer Patsy 
Swayze has said there is no such thing as the Cowboy Cha-Cha. Yet we're all 
dancing it. 
</P>

 CLIP & SAVE: Here are some updates on club formats and personnel changes as 
well as ways to save money and still get your nightly dance fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructor Ron Miller is no longer teaching at the Ban-Dar in Ventura. And the 
club now closes on Sundays and Mondays. At Cousin's in Simi Valley, Miss Ila 
has just introduced Two-Steppin' Tuesdays with beginning lessons at 7:30 p.m. 
and intermediate at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Women get in free at the Thousand Oaks Borderline on Tuesdays and anyone 
wearing a Borderline T-shirt on Wednesdays avoids the cover charge. Ladies free 
night at the Crazy Bull in Camarillo is Wednesdays and free Gents night is 
Thursday. The Crazy Bull has also introduced a punch card, good for a free 
admission on any night after 10 paid visits. And you can get in free on Sundays 
by wearing a Crazy Bull T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 I just heard that Logsdons in Santa Paula was full for line dance lessons last 
Wednesday, 6:30 to 7:30 p.m., and there was no cover charge. But there were 
almost no fellas there. Hey, cowboys, are you waiting for a special invitation? 
</P>
<P>
 Schooner Time in Simi Valley has a new format. Dance lessons are on hold for a 
spell. But there's tons of good live music Fridays starting at 9 p.m. and 
Sundays from 5 to 9 p.m. And they've introduced a $4.25 parking lot barbecue 
out front so you can eat outdoors or inside between noon and 6 p.m. Then enjoy 
the nice, new dance floor and live music. Best of all, there's no cover charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Country Tuesday nights at Splash in the Radisson Hotel in Simi Valley are a 
good deal. Beginning at 5 p.m. you can pay a $3 cover charge that includes the 
dance lesson. Or between 5 and 8 p.m., $5 gets you everything including an 
all-you-can-eat tri-tip barbecue buffet. Deejay-instructor Rick Henderson 
reports that remodeling is complete and the dance floor has been extended and 
cleared of impediments. 
</P>
<P>
 You may have heard by now that Red Dog Saloon, which for my money has the best 
dance floor in Santa Barbara, has gone to a rock 'n' roll format and now calls 
itself The Underground. So John Sperry Reynolds' Boot Camp country dance 
workshops held there during daytime hours and Lisa Kay's swing night series 
have relocated. I'm tracking their whereabouts down. Meanwhile, watch for a 
Boot Camp country extravaganza weekend workshop in August that will include a 
session on the New Night Club Two-Step, a three-count dance designed to 
accommodate a slower Two-Step music.

COMMUNITY NEWS: COMPTON; SENATE PANEL REJECTS PLAN FOR PRISON FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial bill that could have brought a prison holding facility to 
Compton was killed Tuesday night by the State Senate Judiciary Committee on a 
6-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed legislation had generated criticism in Compton.The City Council 
earlier this year adopted a resolution opposing the facility. Critics said the 
city has no room and that building such a structure would have a negative 
impact on the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation had been backed by Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. 
(D-Paramount), who said the facility would employ 1,000 people after 
construction and have an annual budget of $35 million. Murray said he would 
introduce the bill again in the next legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill mentioned construction of a prison in Southern California. But Murray 
favored building the 2,000-bed multistory holding center in Compton to house 
inmates 45 to 90 days before they are moved to state prisons.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SEABORG HOUSE STIRS LANDMARK DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking at a row of bungalows on San Antonio Avenue in South Gate, it is 
difficult to imagine that one of them is a historical monument. But the tiny 
white home with green trim at 9237 San Antonio Ave. is where Nobel laureate 
Glenn T. Seaborg, who discovered plutonium in 1940 at age 28, spent much of his 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the little house is growing into a big controversy over whether the city 
should save the 700-square-foot structure as a landmark. The historical 
significance of the home, currently occupied by a caretaker, has run up against 
South Gate's increasing need for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just like to see the house I was raised in kept," said Seaborg, now 
82 and a resident of the Northern California town of Lafayette. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has commissioned an analysis to figure out how much it would cost to 
move and refurbish the house. The outcome of that, city officials say, may help 
decide whether the house will be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to go the least expensive route," said South Gate Mayor Albert 
Robles, who supports preserving the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaborg won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1951 and served on the Atomic 
Energy Commission, the forerunner of the Department of Energy. He was also 
chancellor of UC Berkeley, where he still works as a professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaborg, who moved out of South Gate around 1930, sold the spacious lot to the 
city in 1991 for $175,000 and donated the house with the agreement that it 
would be preserved. But today the house, in need of a paint job, is looking 
less and less like a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who has taken up the fight to save the Seaborg house is Sam Echols, a 
70-year-old who also volunteers as president of the city's one-room museum. 
Echols has collected boxes of Seaborg's letters, research and copies of Time 
and Business Week from 1961 and 1964 that have Seaborg's picture on the cover. 
There are more boxes of Seaborg memorabilia in the City Hall basement. "I have 
a soft spot for stuff like this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the City Council voted 3 to 2 to move the house to make way 
for affordable housing. The city staff began drawing up plans for the project, 
which in addition to moving the house to a parking lot near City Hall would 
also include sprucing it up and retrofitting it to meet earthquake safety 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can move it to another location, but, like most cities, there is no money 
to do that," said Ruben Lopez, deputy director for redevelopment. BOB ELSTON

COMMUNITY NEWS: CERRITOS; CITY EARMARKS $88,290 FOR NEW STAGE SURFACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's 2-year-old Center for the Performing Arts needs a new stage 
surface, officials have decided. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week allocated $88,290 to replace the linoleum surface, 
which has bubbled occasionally since it was installed in December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Swanson, the city's director of cultural services, said the bubbling was 
minor and didn't create difficulties for performers, but it did pose problems 
for the center's advanced, flexible seating system. Giant seating towers 
resting on air casters slide across the stage surface when the theater's 
seating configuration is changed, Swanson said, and the bubbling sometimes 
caused delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is sort of like looking at a large Swiss watch," Swanson said. "When you 
build something as complex as this, there are a lot of things you could have 
problems with. We consider this to be pretty minor." 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson said the cause of the bubbling is unknown. "The theories range from 
the humidity in the air at the time the linoleum was laid down to incompatible 
adhesives," Swanson said. The linoleum supplier has agreed to reimburse the 
city for the cost of the materials to be replaced -- about $25,000, Swanson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A different company has been hired to resurface the stage with a new material 
that is applied as a liquid and has self-healing properties. GREG MILLER

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; RUNAWAY SON HELD IN DEATH OF TV ENGINEER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 15-year-old runaway son of an Emmy award-winning television sound engineer 
has been arrested in Cerritos on suspicion of shooting his adoptive father to 
death in the family's Cypress home on Father's Day, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police discovered the body of Gayle Hansen, 51, on his family room floor in 
Cypress on Monday afternoon, four hours after both his sister and his 
girlfriend reported him missing.Hansen, an ABC television employee, had been 
shot twice and had been dead since early Sunday morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign of a struggle or forced entry, police said, but Hansen's car 
was missing from the home in the 5500 block of Citrus Court. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 1, Hansen had reported his son as a runaway, police said. The 
teen-ager also had run away from home in Paramount, where the two had lived 
until about two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Using leads from the runaway investigation, police tracked the teen-ager and 
the car to a Cerritos home. When the boy and an 11-year-old friend drove off, 
undercover police gave chase, Cypress Police Lt. Jim Weuve said. Both boys were 
apprehended uninjured about 5:30 p.m. after the car smashed into a light pole. 
The 11-year-old was released to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager was booked in Orange County Juvenile Hall, Weuve said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen won an Emmy for "individual achievement" for his work on the 1984 
Summer Olympic Games, Weuve said. The boy was the youngest of three children 
adopted by Hansen and his former wife, a resident of Eugene, Ore. The 
15-year-old and his father lived at the home alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Weuve asked that anyone with information about the shooting call the Cypress 
Police Department at (714) 229-6600. TRACY WEBER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents in some sections of the city have complained that drinking water has 
turned cloudy and smells like bleach, but water officials insist that the water 
is safe to drink and should return to normal soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Water Department has been adding chlorine, a stronger 
disinfectant, to the water supply this month to ensure that the water remains 
safe to drink during the warm summer months when demand is higher, said 
department spokesman Robert Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been flushing water from fire hydrants to reduce the presence of 
the old disinfectants, called chloramines. The flushing has stirred up minerals 
inside older pipes in some areas of the city, giving water a cloudy appearance, 
Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had not flushed since 1987 during the annual changeovers to chlorine 
because of the drought. JOHN D. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS: CERRITOS; $1.8 MILLION IN CUTS OKD BY ABC SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Counseling for elementary school students would be eliminated and 
special-education students would have to make do with fewer supplies under a 
series of budget cuts tentatively approved by the ABC Unified District school 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved almost $1.8 million in cuts during an emergency 11-hour 
session Saturday in an effort to balance its $69-million budget for next year.A 
final decision is scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators were hit hard by the cuts. They were not given the salary 
increase granted to all other employee groups, resulting in a budget savings of 
$120,000. The school board also decided to require administrators to fill in 
when classroom teachers are absent. The move will save the district an 
estimated $160,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts must still be reviewed by the Los Angeles County Office of Education, 
which has assigned a fiscal adviser to help the ABC district draw up its 
$69-million spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The district serves 21,000 students in Cerritos, Artesia, Hawaiian Gardens and 
parts of Norwalk and Lakewood.

COMMUNITY NEWS: NORWALK-LA MIRADA; AGUILAR IS FINALIST FOR COUNTY SCHOOLS SUPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Norwalk-La Mirada schools chief Robert Aguilar is among five finalists being 
considered to succeed departing county schools Supt. Stuart E. Gothold. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar, 54, has headed the 20,000-student school system since May, 1990. He 
has two years left on his contract, said school board President Rudy Bermudez. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is expected to make its final 
selection in late July or early August, said Shigeki Kikkewa, who is organizing 
the superintendent search for the county administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar is one of two school district superintendents in Los Angeles County to 
be considered for Gothold's post. The other is Ronald Hockwalt, who heads the 
Walnut Valley Unified School District in the San Gabriel Valley community of 
Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
 Two administrators from the county Office of Education are also being 
considered: Gilberto Anzaldua, an assistant county superintendent for 
educational services, and H. Jennifer Hartman, an assistant county 
superintendent for educational programs. The fifth candidate is Donald 
Ingwerson, a former superintendent from the Jefferson County School District in 
Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 Gothold announced earlier this year that he will retire from his 
$118,000-a-year post by Sept. 1. He has held the job for 14 years.

COVER STORY; LOADS OF WOES; HEAVY TRUCK TRAFFIC ON THE 710 IS A NIGHTMARE FOR 
COMMUTERS, BUT HELP MAY BE ON THE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hauling a 45-foot container full of children's clothes down the Long Beach 
Freeway, the big 18-wheeler hits the dips and valleys on the freeway's grooved 
surface like a motorboat cresting a line of small waves. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck rattles rhythmically -- whomp-whomp-whomp -- as it hustles toward a 
waiting container ship, which will take the cargo to Central America. Up ahead, 
cars dodge left and right to make way for the imposing rig. 
</P>
<P>
 Driver Edgar Cruz, who plies the Long Beach Freeway two or three times a day, 
seems to barely notice the wavy action of his 1986 Peterbilt or a Toyota 
driver's nervous maneuver in front of him -- darting abruptly to the right -- 
as the truck overtakes the little car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the worst," mutters Cruz, 48, referring to the freeway's surface. "The 
trucks do it -- all the trucks going along here everyday." 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Freeway (Interstate 710), the most direct connection between 
the Long Beach/Los Angeles ports and the Los Angeles railroad yards, is one of 
the state's busiest truck thoroughfares. More than 25,000 trucks a day shuttle 
back and forth along the freeway's busy south end. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucks batter the surface of the freeway. "It'll just about bounce your 
eyeballs out," says longtime Long Beach resident Karen Adelseck, who travels 
that stretch frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucks also give commuters the heebie-jeebies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little frightening if you're in a compact car and there's an 
80,000-pound truck next to you with its wheels at eye level," acknowledges 
Norman Giller, a Long Beach truck driver who is active in North Long Beach 
civic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's those wind currents that the big rigs set off as they go barreling past 
small cars, contends Adelseck, who drives a 1986 Ford Tempo. "Unless you notice 
they're coming up past you, they'll create a kind of vacuum that'll suck you 
into it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The seething mix of cars and 18-wheelers hauling containers to and from the 
ports has given the Long Beach Freeway one of the most forbidding reputations 
in the state. Just about everybody in Long Beach, Carson, Compton, Paramount 
and other cities along the route seems to have a freeway horror story. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say they have seen big rigs skidding on their sides, creeping truck 
traffic and multi-vehicle pileups on the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are horrendous accidents on a continuous basis," says Long Beach 
Councilman Warren Harwood, who remembers how a tractor-trailer suddenly 
fishtailed across the lane in front of his car a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had been next to it, I would have gotten slapped across the freeway 
divider," says Harwood, who recently lost a reelection bid to represent a North 
Long Beach district that is bisected by the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, trucks have tipped over on the freeway, disgorging bubbling 
tar, groaning cattle and lakes of diesel fuel. They have jackknifed over lane 
dividers, sideswiped tow trucks and plowed into the backs of cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely this is the inferno of all freeways, some Long Beach residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the accident rate on the Long Beach Freeway is "pretty high," says 
Larry Loudon, chief of accident investigations for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary causes are speed and the large percentage of trucks," Loudon 
said. "There have been some real wingdingers with fatalities involved. People 
in cars don't seem to realize that trucks don't stop on dimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Loudon said he could not say which freeway had the highest accident rate, 
adding that agency policy prohibits him from giving exact figures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Long Beach Freeway's reputation as a frightening route for commuters 
derives more from the intimidating presence of huge trucks looming over family 
cars than from a frequency of spectacular multi-injury accidents, some law 
enforcement officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember the last 'horrendous accident,' if you mean accidents where 
there were major injuries," says Detective Steve Strichart of the accident 
investigations unit of the Long Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "A truck goes over on its side and you've got a big mess," says Strichart, 
whose responsibility includes only the Long Beach section of the freeway. 
"You've got nails and glass all over the place. It looks really bad. But it 
doesn't necessarily mean that you've got a lot of injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the freeway may not be the real-life bumper-car corridor that some 
Long Beach residents think it is, the traffic -- particularly the truck traffic 
-- is building at a daunting pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Port of Long Beach already handles almost 80 million metric tons of cargo 
a year -- much of it shuttled by truck along the Long Beach Freeway to the Los 
Angeles railroad yards -- and that amount is expected to more than double in 
the next 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost a fifth of the 135,000 vehicles that every day travel the freeway south 
of Pacific Coast Highway are trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time for some kind of action, transportation officials say, and a couple 
of proposals are in the works. Officials from the cities that line the freeway 
are resting their hopes for traffic relief on the Alameda Corridor project, an 
innovative $1.8-billion plan to bring trains directly to the Los Angeles-area 
docks and to provide a direct trucking link along Alameda Street between the 
ports and the Los Angeles railroad yards. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a slim chance that construction on new truck lanes along Alameda 
Street and grade separations for trains could begin as early as next year and 
be completed by the year 2000, said Gill V. Hicks, general manager of the 
Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project is still more than $1 billion short in funding, and Union 
Pacific Railroad has still failed to agree to pay to use the new Alameda Street 
tracks. Both the Southern Pacific and Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe railroads have 
signed on with the authority. 
</P>
<P>
 If the project is completed, truck traffic on the Long Beach Freeway should be 
lower, even though port cargo tonnage will be significantly higher, Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, which came from a 1984 study by the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments, is to allow dockside loading of trains as well as to streamline 
truck deliveries. Among other benefits, air pollution would be reduced by 
making port transportation more efficient, Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is also considering adding a truck lane to the Long Beach Freeway, 
either by widening the freeway or constructing an elevated lane above the 
current freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the freeway is a 21-mile ribbon of concrete that stretches north 
from 7th Street in Long Beach, following the paved channel of the Los Angeles 
River before slicing across East Los Angeles and ending abruptly in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead end at Valley Boulevard -- a shock to motorists who have followed 
signs indicating that they are headed to Pasadena -- is a monument to the 
tenacity of the citizens of South Pasadena and the Los Angeles neighborhood of 
El Sereno. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and officials of those communities, using legal and political 
pressure, have successfully blocked the proposed link between the Long Beach 
Freeway and the Foothill Freeway in Pasadena for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadenans argue that the freeway will decimate their little city, 
slicing it in half and destroying more than 300 buildings, some of them 
landmark homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But when city officials really want to generate some passion against the 
proposed 6.2-mile freeway link, they cite the freeway's flood of trucks that 
could be roaring through various neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, to the annoyance of trucking groups, a Caltrans advisory committee 
suggested that the freeway extension be built as a truck-free link. But most 
South Pasadena residents, skeptical of the proposal, continued to envision the 
freeway as an eight-lane concrete monstrosity with noisy trucks spewing diesel 
fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would economically destroy the city," said Antonio Rossman, the city's 
special freeway counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The $805-million project is awaiting a go-ahead from the California 
Transportation Commission, after which federal Highway Administrator Rodney 
Slater must give his approval. Gov. Pete Wilson has directed state 
transportation officials to take "all necessary steps" to complete the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Freeway is certainly no scenic route. 
</P>
<P>
 A round trip with Cruz between the Sea-Land Shipping Co. terminal in Long 
Beach Port and an Olympic Boulevard garment factory skirts the back ends of 
factories and warehouses, passing mountains of gravel and cracker-box apartment 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 A row of huge metal structures, bearing spaghetti strands of power lines, 
marches along next to the freeway. Weeds sprout profusely from empty lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach city officials worry that it is an unsightly gateway to their 
marketing-minded city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an attractive entrance to the downtown area," says Deputy Mayor 
Jeffrey A. Kellogg. "This is the ugly dog of freeways." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz -- a big-rig owner-operator who after 16 years on the road knows the Los 
Angeles-area freeway system intimately -- and other truck drivers find little 
that is charming on the freeway, particularly when it comes to traffic. "It's 
not so bad right now," Cruz said last week, surveying the midmorning traffic 
from his perch behind the driver's wheel, 10 feet above the roadway. "But in 
the morning, it's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, during peak hours -- between 7 and 9 a.m. and 4 and 5 p.m. -- there 
are often backups of trucks waiting to deliver loads, like a double row of 
boxcars, stretching along the freeway from the entrance to the big container 
terminals to Pacific Coast Highway, a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucking companies say the limited hours of operation at the docks add to 
traffic problems. Because of high nighttime labor costs, most terminal gates 
open at 8 a.m. and close at 5 p.m. In Long Beach, only Sea-Land operates 
evening shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all out there at the same time," says Jackie Mattare, owner of Desert 
Express Trucking Co. "We're trying to get back to the pier before it closes, 
just when everybody else is trying to get home from work. We're part of the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as some motorists are concerned, that's the understatement of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten so that if I have to travel any distance, I'll go on Saturday or 
Sunday just to avoid the trucks," says Beth Wilburn, who lives near the freeway 
in North Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go 55 in the truck lanes (the two right lanes to which trucks are relegated 
on most freeways) and you'll get run over," added Martha Croft, president of 
the Hamilton chapter of the North Long Beach Neighborhood Assn. "I've had them 
tailgate me right on my bumper, a big rig that probably couldn't stop in half a 
mile." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officers charged with reducing hazardous conditions on the 
freeway trace many of the problems back 14 years to the deregulation of the 
trucking industry by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Motor Carrier Act of 1980, which allowed virtually anyone with a truck to 
compete for shipping jobs, created a system of cutthroat competition in the 
industry, truckers and law enforcement officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent truckers found themselves stuck with lower shipping rates and 
lower profits, says Officer Ed Duer, who patrols the freeway for the Long Beach 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all of that came a decline in maintenance," Duer says. "A trucker will 
support his family before he maintains his equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Trucking industry representatives concede that there has been a slew of 
bankruptcies since deregulation was instituted, as rates fell and costs rose. 
But safety standards, enforced by hundreds of thousands of new roadside 
inspection stations, have risen greatly, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truck safety is better than it's ever been," says John Doyle, spokesman for 
the Virginia-based American Trucking Assn., which represents more than 90% of 
the industry. The number of inspection stations in the country has increased 
from 35,000 in 1981 to 1.7 million last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, during a morning shift, Duer easily identifies faulty equipment and 
overloaded trucks on the Long Beach Freeway. The officer, who carries portable 
scales in the rear of a Police Department pickup truck, pulls over 18-wheelers 
with sloppily fastened rear doors or tires that are worn to the steel cord. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lose that tire at speed and it could present a problem," Duer tells one 
trucker while writing a citation. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finds an unlicensed driver or a truck that could be hazardous to 
others, Duer calls a tow truck to haul the offending vehicle to an impound 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
 No one loathes the Long Beach Freeway more than the tow truck drivers who work 
on it. Jeff Hogan, a driver with City Towing, which hauls vehicles that have 
been impounded by the police, recalled a memorable experience on the freeway 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As he sought to hook up a car on the freeway's right shoulder, a racing truck 
bore down. "He ripped the side mirror off and kept on going," Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather work anywhere but the 710," Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing Sal Avalos did after he got his job as a tow truck driver with 
Number One Towing on Long Beach Boulevard was to get life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a 3-year-old kid I'd like to get home to," said Avalos, 23. "That's 
the worst freeway in the world out there." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ongoing wrangle between truckers and car drivers ("four-wheelers," the 
truckers call them) is something like the longtime feud between cattle ranchers 
and sheepherders, which featured sweeping allegations by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bothered greatly by comments about 'monster trucks,' when I have to deal 
with a lot of people who are less than competent in cars," said trucker Giller, 
who is also president of the Northwest chapter of the North Long Beach 
Neighborhood Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Truckers have their own stories about being cut off by motorists or forced to 
swerve in precarious situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Car drivers should have to take the truck test" to get their driver's 
licenses, contends Mattare of Desert Express Trucking. "A lot of drivers don't 
realize it takes two lanes for a truck to get around a corner. If a 53-footer 
is swinging around a corner and a car gets up under him -- forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to backups and accidents, the perception is usually worse than 
the reality, Strichart contends. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent morning, the northbound freeway lanes in Long Beach were clogged 
with traffic, with cargo-laden trucks and work-bound commuters inching along, 
their drivers peering ahead wretchedly. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of the backup, they soon learned, was not an overturned semi or a 
multi-vehicle smashup but an overheated car, stalled in the middle lane. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tightly packed Long Beach Freeway, much of the southern end of it a 
mere three lanes wide, it doesn't take a major accident to clog things up, 
Strichart says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have a fender-bender at Willow," he says, referring to a street three 
miles north of downtown Long Beach, "and back things up to the harbor."

CITIES IN PATH OF 710 EXTENSION TAKEN OFF ENDANGERED LIST

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that recent events have dimmed the chances of extending the Long Beach 
Freeway, the National Trust for Historic Preservation has taken the cities on 
the proposed extension route off its list of 11 Most Endangered Historic 
Places. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena, Pasadena and Los Angeles' El Sereno neighborhood, which had 
spent an unprecedented five years on the national list produced annually by the 
250,000-member preservation group, have been transferred to a "Watch List" of 
less-endangered but still threatened places. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 30-year battle to stop a 6.2-mile extension that would plow through five 
historic districts, (and) force the demolition of more than 1,000 homes . . . 
is not over, but the outlook is brighter," said Richard Moe, trust president. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust officials said the change occurred because of a number of events, 
including a Sacramento judge's decision forbidding construction without South 
Pasadena's agreement, a Los Angeles Times editorial encouraging consideration 
of a street-based "low-build" alternative, and the Northridge earthquake 
forcing the county Metropolitan Transportation Authority to put the project on 
the back burner. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mary Kelly, a spokeswoman for the city of Alhambra, which supports the 
extension, said the Assembly recently passed legislation that would override 
the judge and said that "low-build doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Transportation Commission delayed a decision on the route last 
month, which also would need federal funding that has not yet been approved.

BOXER WILLIAMS HAS TAKEN SHARE OF HARD SHOTS OUTSIDE RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeremy Williams' life in the boxing ring is not much different from his life 
on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had my head busted open in a street fight," Williams said. "I've had my 
teeth chipped, eyes bloodied, my back cut with a knife. I've been jumped just 
because I had been in the wrong neighborhood or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams began boxing professionally in 1992. In reality, he started 
practicing his trade much earlier on the mean streets of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I was 12 years old, I looked out the window and I would see 
some guy shooting heroin," he said. "I think that, and waking up on Christmas 
and not having any presents, that's where my anger comes from." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is only 21, but he has the savvy of a veteran when he steps into the 
ring. On Friday night at the Olympic Auditorium, he is scheduled to meet 
"Smokin' " Bert Cooper in a 10-round heavyweight bout. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing a 12-round decision to Larry Donald on March 12 in Las Vegas, 
Williams' career has taken on a sense of urgency. It was Williams' first loss 
in 16 pro fights and it cost him the World Boxing Council Continental Americas 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned to take my career seriously," Williams said. "I took it 
seriously, but I didn't take it a step further. In some ways, losing to Donald 
was a good thing because it showed me how important it is to take things one at 
a time and to take every fight seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 After the loss, Williams left manager Bill Cayton, who guided Mike Tyson early 
in his career. He also changed trainers, opting for Joe Goossen over his 
father, Charles Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen began working with Williams before a May bout against Andrew Stokes at 
the Olympic. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams knocked out the journeyman in 39 seconds of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams (16-1, 13 knockouts) is training in Big Bear with World Boxing 
Organization lightweight champion Oscar de la Hoya, junior-lightweight Gabriel 
Ruelas, International Boxing Federation lightweight champion Rafael Ruelas and 
former heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams came within a victory of making the 1992 U.S. Olympic boxing team but 
lost to Montel Griffin in a light-heavyweight bout. Williams had beaten Griffin 
in the Olympic trials, but lost two decisions at the team box-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was so upset about failing to make the team that he knocked over a 
table with a lectern and microphones during the post-fight news conference. He 
then went into a minute-long tirade against the tournament organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned to Long Beach, trouble was around the corner. Fellow boxer 
Tyrone White was shot to death in September, 1992, after a fight at a hamburger 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guy started talking beef, and he came over to me, since I was the 
biggest," he said. "I hit him and he fell and then I jumped on his friend, who 
was much bigger than we were. And the guy that I first hit pulled out a gun and 
aimed at me and shot Tyrone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyrone fell. When I looked up, the guy was plugging him with like four more 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams attributes much of his troubles to involvement with gangs. His older 
brothers Eric and Jason were gang members, and Jeremy followed their lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not gonna tell you what's right or what's wrong," he said. "I'm gonna 
tell you from my example. My two older brothers have been in prison all their 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watching my brothers, I said, 'OK, well maybe they just didn't do it right,' 
" he said. "So when I did it, I got stabbed, I got shot at. I was in a car 
going off to a club and the guy next to me got shot in the back, through the 
car door. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's what you want to do with your life, hell, go do it. But what I'm 
saying is that you will be a knucklehead like me."

LACK OF PYRAMID FUNDING MAY FORCE FANS TO TAKE A BACK SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The push for the Pyramid is shifting into high gear at Long Beach State and so 
is fund raising for the $19-million structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The on-campus athletic facility, which will be home to the university's 
basketball and volleyball teams, intramurals, physical education classes and 
athletic offices, is scheduled to be christened Nov. 30 with a basketball 
doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, it might be years before the Pyramid is completed; bout $5 million 
is still needed to finish the building project, which is experiencing cost 
overruns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've constantly been revising our plans to accommodate costs," Athletic 
Director Dave O'Brien said. "It's been nerve-racking, but one of our first 
priorities is to open the facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the Pyramid began in January, 1993, with costs estimated at 
$15.7 million. It is designed to seat 7,500, but thus far the university has 
been able to afford seating for only 4,200. About 1,200 chair-back seats will 
be available Nov. 30 when the 49er men play Marquette in a game scheduled to be 
televised by ESPN; the 49er women meet Louisiana Tech on that date as well. 
Bench seating will make up the majority of the seating until funds can be 
raised to put in permanent seating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be less than candid if there wasn't a time when I was concerned whether 
we would have to have 'Bring Your Own Chair Night' every night," men's 
basketball Coach Seth Greenberg said. "But I also had confidence in the 
university. There is no way you're going to build a $15-million building and 
tell me you have to bring your own chair. That wasn't going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic offices in the new building are also taking a back seat. Because of 
renovations in the physical education building, athletic department personnel 
recently moved into trailers vacated by the University Extension office. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, there will be no offices in the Pyramid, but plans call for the 
volleyball and basketball coaches to be the first to move in. Eventually the 
rest of the athletic department will join them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're slowly targeting the other needs," O'Brien said. "The offices will be 
Spartan and landscaping minimal." 
</P>
<P>
 The university, which received $11 million in state money for the building of 
an on-campus physical education building, has raised $4.5 million from various 
sources, including a 12-year, $1.2 million contract with Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach is searching for a donor willing to contribute $3.5 million in 
exchange for having the Pyramid named after their foundation or corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost overruns would be greater had the school decided against building a 
lightweight space frame instead of the conventional box design of massive 
girders and foundations. By building a space frame, the university estimated it 
saved $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on the north end of the campus and visible from the San Diego (405) 
Freeway several miles away, the arena is believed to be the largest space frame 
pyramid in the world. The structure, which peaks at 178 feet, is 345 square 
feet at its base and has a wide-open interior. 
</P>
<P>
 The frame has more than 14,000 interconnecting tubes, consisting of 
subassemblies of small pyramids measuring six feet in height and 12 feet along 
the base. 
</P>
<P>
 When finished, the Pyramid will include three full-court and six half-court 
basketball areas and five volleyball courts. Also planned are a fitness center, 
hospitality meeting rooms, storage space and vendor-developed concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Don Gibbs of the Long Beach architectural firm of Gibbs & Gibbs said 
he thought of using domes and octagons before submitting his final design for 
the Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Long Beach State) was looking for a symbol to start a new age and a new 
beginning," said Gibbs, the designer of the Performing Arts Center at Long 
Beach State and the Long Beach City Hall. "From an architectural standpoint, a 
pyramid seemed to create a point of reference in the community (that) other 
shapes didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg, entering his fifth season as coach, is already aware of dividends. 
He has been able to attract top-caliber opponents who were reluctant to play in 
the 1,900-seat Gold Mine in the Physical Education Building, which was built in 
1956. In addition to the Marquette game, ESPN will telecast 49er home games 
against Nevada Las Vegas and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost more kids over the last three years who said, 'Coach, I like your 
style. You guys play good basketball. Long Beach is really a beautiful school 
and offers a good education. But the gym? Give me a break,' " Greenberg said. 
"I think what the Pyramid enables us to do now is get past that burden. We'll 
be playing a top-20 caliber schedule and we have nothing to be ashamed of with 
this building. We should be able to attract anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lack of funding to complete the Pyramid, the university is wasting 
little time on promotion. An icon of the facility has been incorporated in the 
athletic department's logo on everything from clothing and media guides to 
business cards and stationary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pyramid logo is even painted on the walls of the Gold Mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain things as a coach you always remember," Greenberg said. 
"The first time you beat a nationally ranked team, the first time you make the 
NCAA tournament and obviously there is the anticipation of playing in the 
Pyramid."

ELECTIONS: CITY HALL AND BUREAUCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember the old saying, "The more things change, the more they stay the 
same"? Some would have us believe that a "changing of the guard" (with a 
promised new direction) is taking place in Long Beach because we have elected a 
new mayor and three new council members -- even though experience tells us that 
the mayor has no real power and that council members have been unable to 
demonstrate that they can rise above petty provincialism and move the city 
forward in a unified direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin Toffler, the celebrated futurist, has noted that in every election, 
whether you vote Democrat or Republican, one side always wins: the bureaucracy. 
This is true because in the struggle over reform, bureaucrats have always been 
able to outlast the politicians. This Murphy's Law of government has been 
reinforced locally with the recent passage of term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in the nature of bureaucracy to spend most of its energy protecting and 
preserving itself rather than serving its customers, not because the people who 
hold bureaucratic jobs are bad people but because their organizations lack the 
incentive to change. 
</P>
<P>
 We must root out the duplications and redundancy that cost Long Beach 
taxpayers millions of dollars each year and produce no services, just 
high-paying jobs for City Hall administrators, consultants and supervisors. We 
must examine each government program to determine whether it serves a 
compelling public interest. If so, we must find the most effective and 
efficient way to accomplish that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the post-election euphoria has worn off, I call upon Mayor-elect 
Beverly O'Neill and the new City Council to create a "reinventing government 
task force" to be responsible for the oversight and execution of this process. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the city manager's current budget proposal to close down the main 
library on Sundays and reduce park and street maintenance, coupled with 
increasing fees on natural gas, refuse, water and sewer service, avoids the 
real issue. It's just another case of socking it to the little guy. 
</P>
<P>
 I am unwilling to continue life support for an ailing City Hall that is at the 
brink of financial, intellectual and moral collapse. I think I speak for more 
than 16,000 Long Beach taxpayers who voted for me in the auditor's race when I 
say, reform or die.

TAXES: WEIGHING THE WAGES OF CIVIL SERVANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to congratulate La Mirada City Manager Gary Sloan for not accepting a 
pay raise. He responsibly believes that $106,000 per year is ample compensation 
for any government worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining a pay raise while asking for pay hikes for the people under him was 
a truly noble and surprising gesture by Sloan. However, no raises for anyone 
would have been the only true fiscally responsible decision. 
</P>
<P>
 It also is mystifying that City Council members would offer a 4% raise for 
city employees after Sloan requested a 3% raise. Are the City Council members 
going to make up the 1% difference from their own pockets? Of course not. The 
taxpayers will. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major concern is the City Council's going into closed session when it 
concerns pay raises/tax dollars. What's to hide? 
</P>
<P>
 There are some who say that since the City Council members are elected by the 
residents to represent them, the decisions they ultimately make reflect their 
constituents' views. Nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 In La Mirada, the most popular people win, like some high school student body 
election; then citizens fall asleep, don't attend council meetings, and have no 
idea how their tax dollars are blown and misused. 
</P>
<P>
 If, once a month, Sloan and the city employees had to go around to the homes 
of the citizens of La Mirada to collect their pay -- say, like paper carriers 
used to -- do you think that most citizens would gladly give a pay raise? Don't 
kid yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way government throughout the whole country has become bloated is 
because people are used to having their taxes taken out of their paychecks, so 
they don't feel the loss tangibly. If people received 100% of their wages and 
then paid their taxes to tax collectors at their front doors, we would finally 
have the tax rebellion the country so richly needs. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some who say that La Mirada city employees deserve a raise after not 
getting one for a few years. Spare me. 
</P>
<P>
 First, public employees are overpaid and receive tremendous benefits at the 
expense of taxpayers. Second, government employees create zero wealth, and they 
perform services that can be performed cheaper and more efficiently by private 
industries. Last, if they don't like their wage, they could always leave, and 
hopefully never be replaced.

MOLESTATION SUSPECT FACES 4 ACCUSERS; HEARING: ALLEGED CRIMES OCCURRED BETWEEN 
1967-72. THE WOMEN TESTIFY AGAINST THE DEFENDANT, NOW 64. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Clarita man who allegedly molested four young girls more than 20 years 
ago came face-to-face with his now-adult accusers Wednesday in court, where all 
of the women testified that he had repeatedly molested them. 
</P>
<P>
 William Lynch, 64, pleaded not guilty earlier this month to 14 counts of lewd 
conduct with a minor. The charges were brought against him under a new state 
law that allows prosecutors to file charges in child molestation cases within a 
year of the date a crime is reported to police, regardless of when it was 
allegedly committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors used the law to charge Lynch with molesting three sisters and 
their childhood friend between March, 1967, and July, 1972. Lynch's 
ex-girlfriend has been charged as an accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, who often baby-sat the sisters, allegedly molested them at his Van Nuys 
apartment and later at a house he purchased in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 During a preliminary hearing Wednesday in Downtown Los Angeles Municipal 
Court, Deputy Dist. Atty. Francesca Frey asked the oldest sister, now 37, 
whether she was ever asked to go to Lynch's bed, to which the woman replied 
"yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "What would you wear," Frey asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing," the woman replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did he wear?" Frey asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman testified that on one occasion Lynch "rubbed his penis" on her 
vagina while she was in his bedroom. She testified that she moved in with her 
father when she turned 13 because Lynch had told her he expected to have 
intercourse with her at that age. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a child I was terrified that anyone would find out," the woman said. "I 
figured there was something wrong with me. By the time I was able to say the 
words I was 26 and the (former) statute of limitations had run out." 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination by Lynch's defense attorney, Frank Di Sabatino, the 
woman testified she told her husband about the alleged incidents when she was 
26, and about two years later discussed them with her younger sister, who 
confessed that she too had been molested by Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," the woman testified, breaking into tears and removing her 
glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her if I had known for a second I would have told dad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's two younger sisters later testified during the hearing about the 
times Lynch allegedly molested them. 
</P>
<P>
 One sister, who is now 37, testified that she awoke one morning at Lynch's 
apartment to find that her sleeping bag had been opened, her panties removed 
and Lynch was fondling her. The woman's younger sister, now 30, then testified 
that Lynch tried unsuccessfully to have intercourse with her when she was 7 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch's ex-girlfriend, Mildred Fleetwood, 60, has pleaded not guilty to 
charges that she aided and abetted the molestation of the sisters' childhood 
friend, who said she remembered details of the alleged attacks during a 1992 
therapy session. The three sisters denied that their testimony represented 
"recovered memory," saying they never forgot the alleged molestations. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth woman, now 35, took the stand late Wednesday afternoon and is 
expected to finish testifying today, clearing the way for the judge to 
determine whether there is enough evidence to send the case to Superior Court 
for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth woman testified Wednesday that she took part in numerous sex acts 
involving Lynch and Fleetwood between 1968 and 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors submitted into evidence audiotapes of five phone calls the woman 
secretly recorded while talking to Lynch and an audiotape made in November, 
when the woman wore a concealed microphone into Lynch's home. The contents were 
not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures that Lynch allegedly took of the woman in the nude when she was a 
girl, along with other photos of Lynch and Fleetwood, were also submitted into 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) wrote the law used in the 
prosecution of Lynch and Fleetwood after learning of the case of Susan Jarreau, 
an Encino resident who said she did not remember being sexually abused until 
more than 10 years after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarreau could not file criminal charges against her abuser because the state 
statute of limitations, covering all crimes but murder, imposed a time limit on 
prosecutions of from two to six years from the time the acts occurred.

COUNCIL DEADLOCKS ON PROPOSED DAY-CARE CENTER; NORTHRIDGE: ZONING LAW CONCERNS 
ARE CITED. PLAN WILL GET ANOTHER CHANCE FRIDAY WHEN FOUR ABSENT MEMBERS ARE 
EXPECTED TO ATTEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A proposal to open a day-care center and preschool in Northridge failed to win 
the support of the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday, but the debate 
prompted council members to consider overhauling the city's approval process 
for child-care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, several councilwomen said, is that under the city's zoning laws 
such centers are viewed as commercial ventures, which require public hearings 
if proposed for residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where better to put children than in a neighborhood?" said Councilwoman 
Jackie Goldberg during the council's discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-child center under consideration Wednesday failed to win majority 
support from the council, but will get another chance Friday when four absent 
members are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, proposed by Sherri Segre for the 18000 block of Devonshire Street, 
has been fought for months by some nearby homeowners who say the location is 
inappropriate for a business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project will be a substantial commercial operation," neighbor Patrick 
McDonough told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Laura Chick and Goldberg, both of whom supported the project, 
said the case demonstrates how difficult the city's process makes it for 
child-care providers to meet the growing demand for day care. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really difficult for me to conceptualize a child-care facility as a 
true-blue commercial use," said Chick, who vowed to ask planning and zoning 
officials to review the approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 She suggested that the city needs to set guidelines for child-care centers, 
then allow those that meet the requirements to be automatically approved 
without the public hearings that so often draw neighborhood opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current approval process, a center for more than 12 children in a 
residential area requires at least one public hearing and the approval of a 
city zoning administrator. On average, about half of such cases are rejected, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning Administrator John Parks said such proposals usually are rejected 
because of concerns about traffic, inadequate parking space and neighbors' 
fears that child-care centers are "out of character with the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, a child-care facility with fewer than 12 children requires 
only a state license, not a city operating permit, and therefore no public 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics seem to prove how much easier it is to attain the state license 
than a city permit. In Los Angeles County, there are 8,065 family care 
facilities that care for fewer than 12 children and 2,940 centers that care for 
more than 12 children, according to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Segre's proposal to open her own center in Northridge was approved by Parks 
last year but was appealed by neighbors to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The 
board deadlocked on a 2-2 vote, sending the item to a council committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's Planning and Land Use Committee, headed by Councilman Hal 
Bernson, voted 2 to 1 this month to support the neighbors' appeal and reject 
Segre's proposal. Bernson agreed with residents that the project would set a 
bad precedent for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the council's split vote Wednesday, Segre was optimistic that she 
would someday operate the center in the home she and her husband, Fernando, had 
saved and borrowed to buy. If the council rejects her proposal Friday, she 
vowed to take her fight to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we are going to win," she said.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: $75,000 HARASSMENT SETTLEMENT OKD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has awarded a former Van Nuys 
prosecutor $75,000 to settle a sexual harassment claim.  
</P>
<P>
 Colette Facio contended in a lawsuit that she was fired in 1991 from her 
$59,000-a-year job for refusing to have sex with her boss, Deputy Dist. 
Atty.Andrew W. Diamond.  
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office contended that her dismissal was based on poor 
work performance, including unexplained absences, abusive behavior toward 
clerks, failure to prepare cases, shouting and arguing with bailiffs and 
mistreatment of witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
 Seven judges testified in support of the county and against Facio at a Civil 
Service Commission hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 But county attorneys recommended that the case be settled because two 
witnesses, including a Los Angeles police detective, were prepared to testify 
that they had seen Diamond harassing Facio.  
</P>
<P>
 Diamond, who was briefly transferred to the San Fernando courts and who has 
now been reassigned to Van Nuys, declined to comment on the case Tuesday. Facio 
no longer lives in Los Angeles County and her attorney could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted to settle the suit Tuesday. TRACEY KAPLAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: WWI VETERAN, 99, TAKES A LOOK BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONDRA FARRELL BAZROD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Paul Jarrett, 99, recounted his World War I experiences, his voice was 
strong and his spirit bright. The memories were clear in his mind, as though 
the events had happened yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 "About a month after war was declared, in April, 1917, I knew I would be 
drafted, so I enlisted," said Jarrett, who was then 21 and running a stockyard 
in Osceola, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 When he joined the service, Jarrett said, "(I) went to an officer I knew with 
the National Guard, and he told me he'd like to send me to officer's training 
school for a three-month class." 
</P>
<P>
 He left the school at Fort Snelling, Minn., a second lieutenant and was sent 
home for two weeks. Then, he found himself on a train bound for Camp Mills on 
New York's Long Island, where he became part of the 42nd Infantry Division, 
later known as the Rainbow Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We became the Rainbow because troops had to be sent quickly to France and the 
elite National Guard was called in from 26 different states," Jarrett said. 
"Someone said, 'It's like a rainbow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jarrett, who now lives in Woodland Hills, recently marked his 99th birthday 
with a celebration at his daughter's home. He will be one of the few World War 
I veterans to attend a reunion of the 42nd Infantry Division July 14 in 
Louisville, Ky. The division also served in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the first man of our regiment to set foot on French soil when we landed 
at Brest, France, in November, 1917," Jarrett recalled. "For some reason, I was 
picked for everything, and I was sent to a hand-to-hand combat school in the 
north of France near Belgium, where I learned trench, knife and bayonet 
fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 By Christmas Eve, 1917, Jarrett was in the trenches on the front lines. He 
fought in the Battle of Champagne in July, 1918, and said he often had to crawl 
all night to capture prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, when he and his men had nothing to eat, they found some bread, ate it 
and landed in the hospital, thinking they were poisoned.  
</P>
<P>
 "We learned the bread had absorbed phosgene gas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 29, 1918, an artillery shell blew him over an embankment, and he broke 
his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go back, and even though the doctor told me I couldn't be in 
combat with my leg, I did get back to my company," he said. Later, he received 
the Purple Heart. 
</P>
<P>
 He remained in the hospital until May, 1919, in France and returned to the 
United States as a hospital patient until August of that year.  
</P>
<P>
 As an officer, Jarrett carried a .45-caliber gun and a dagger. "When I came 
home, I threw my .45 in the river," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Jarrett went to the University of Omaha on the GI bill, but 
because the cold weather bothered him, he moved to Los Angeles on Thanksgiving 
Day, 1921.  
</P>
<P>
 Then he sold real estate for Harry Culver (Culver City was named after him), 
worked for Southern Pacific Railroad and owned a lumber company. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1926, he became Culver City's city clerk and served as postmaster there 
from 1939 until his retirement in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to retire, so I went to work at MGM Studios for five years as a 
prop maker and in special effects," Jarrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Never one to be idle, Jarrett has traveled widely and has returned to France 
twice to the scene of the long-ago World War I battles. On July 16, 1989, the 
citizens of Neuviller, France, surprised him when they named a street there 
"Rue Paul J. Jarrett." 
</P>
<P>
 "The French people really appreciated what we did for them in WWI," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In WWI, we had no choice," Jarrett added, "but I think throughout all the 
human race, wars are just stupidity. You can't solve anything that way." SONDRA

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; JUDGE DENIES HEARING ON SELLERS' BAIL STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victoria Sellers was sent back to jail Wednesday after a judge declined to 
hold a hearing on her bail status. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Barry Hammond had asked Superior Court Judge Stanley M. 
Weisberg to free Sellers, contending that a Municipal Court judge had illegally 
jailed her without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 But bail was set at $100,000 on Tuesday. Weisberg said he would not overrule 
Municipal Court Judge Michael S. Luros without knowing what evidence he had 
heard. Weisberg also noted that Hammond's request was outdated. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was just an attempt to get another judge to relitigate the same issues 
without having all the information," Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol Fisch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond said he would seek another hearing before Weisberg. He added that 
Sellers cannot afford the high bail, which is 10 times the amount usually set 
for the charge against her, a single felony count of receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 "To set bail in this extreme amount is just cruel," Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers, the 29-year-old daughter of late British comic actor Peter Sellers 
and actress Britt Eckland, was charged after police investigating a series of 
armed robberies found stolen jewelry in her dresser drawers and under her bed. 
The discovery was made during a search of a talent agent's Northridge house, 
where Sellers lived with two of the robbery suspects. Police have identified 
the suspects as Sellers' boyfriend and bodyguard, and the talent agent also has 
been charged with receiving stolen property.  
</P>
<P>
 Luros ordered Sellers jailed last week when she failed to appear for an 
arranged fingerprinting and booking. ANN W. O'NEILL

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CITY BUDGET INCLUDES QUAKE REPAIR COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando City Council has approved a city spending plan of $36.5 
million for 1994-95, up about one-third from last year's budget, mostly because 
of earthquake repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the budget is $7 million to repair damage caused by the Northridge 
earthquake, $1 million for construction of a bikeway along the Metrolink right 
of way and $475,000 for improvements and renovations at Las Palmas Park, said 
Finance Director Mike Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 The bikeway is being built with grant money from the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority, Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members this week voted to give themselves only cost-of-living 
pay increases. Funds that might have gone toward their salaries will now go to 
the city's parks and recreation programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone agreed with that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it costs you money to do this job, and it costs you money to get the job, 
that will discourage a lot of good people," said Raul Godinez, who argued that 
the council should get raises.  
</P>
<P>
 He read statistics that showed the council has had only two raises since 1980 
-- a 34% raise in 1986 and a 5% raise in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I earned the money I get," said Doude Wysbeek, a veteran 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members now are paid $378 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon said that the cost-of-living rate now is just under 1%. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; REDEVELOPMENT PLAN GETS INITIAL SUPPORT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Community leaders this week expressed tentative support for a city proposal to 
create a redevelopment area in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 But local activists also expressed concerns with the proposal, which would 
divert local property taxes to the cost of earthquake rebuilding and repairs, 
at a meeting Tuesday night with Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (program) has to be designed so that it is targeted to be helpful -- not 
create stumbling blocks to the private market," said Fred Gaines, co-chairman 
of the Sherman Oaks Town Council. "What we don't need is another layer of 
bureaucracy with regard to planning and zoning and transportation issues." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great idea, but time is of the essence," said Don Shain, owner 
of Shain's, a Ventura Boulevard restaurant. "The best idea in the world is 
going to be worthless if we don't get on with it in Sherman Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Yaroslavsky has not backed the concept, proposed by the city's 
Community Redevelopment Agency, the councilman said he would not have brought 
the idea to community leaders if he did not think it worthy of consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good tool to turn our area around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds for the program would come from the increase in property taxes expected 
above those collected in the base year of 1994, a method known as tax increment 
financing. The CRA could raise a large sum of money upfront by issuing bonds to 
be repaid by the increment over the years, or it could operate on a 
pay-as-you-go basis. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PANORAMA CITY; AIDS PATIENTS TO GET HELP WITH CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For parents with AIDS or HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, arranging child care 
can be an overwhelming prospect, especially for those who make frequent trips 
far from home for medical treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 "In large families with five or six small children, where the mothers have to 
take the bus for a medical appointment, they tend to say, 'Forget it,' " said 
Linda Rodriguez, director of HIV/AIDS programs at the Northeast Valley Health 
Corp. in Panorama City."They either bring their children or don't go at all."  
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a $20,000 grant from the United Way, things are about to get a 
little easier. Through the San Fernando Valley HIV Consortium, a conglomeration 
of 13 agencies that treats people with HIV or AIDS, the Northeast Valley Health 
Corp. will coordinate free child care for parents while they receive medical 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 of the more than 3,500 people diagnosed with HIV in the Valley are 
women, and many of them have small children, Rodriguez said. In addition, some 
of the men are single parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in August, the corporation will act as a liaison, connecting 
patients with a child-care agency that will provide a baby-sitter during 
medical appointments. SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CHATSWORTH GRAD TO SING FOR PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those on the other side of the spotlight are usually faceless, and Farah Alvin 
can easily close her eyes and forget them while singing her lucky song, "Johnny 
One-Note." 
</P>
<P>
 Next Thursday at the Kennedy Center in Washington the faces in the audience 
will be harder to blink away -- those of the President and First Lady, 
especially. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm incredibly nervous, and I'm sure I will be until the moment I go 
onstage," Alvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old from Northridge was recently named one of 20 Presidential 
Scholars in the Arts, and will receive $3,000 and a medallion as proof. But 
it's the performance she's most thrilled about. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kennedy Center, after all. Not to mention the audience members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Presidential Scholarship -- awarded to a handful of the most promising 
high school seniors in several disciplines -- is the most recent in a year when 
Alvin's lifetime of work has begun paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent Chatsworth High School graduate also starred in the Alex Theatre's 
"Fame -- the Musical," this year, performed for Grammy award nominees with the 
Grammy All-American Choir, and was the only student out of 6,000 to be honored 
in the pop singing category by the National Foundation for Advancement in the 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't always been so easy though. Besides being the hand model for the 
famous "E.T." glowing-finger movie poster (artist parents John and Andrea 
create the posters), the parts and gigs have been tough to come by, though 
Alvin said she always knew she'd be a performer and Broadway has long been her 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, they get 18-year-olds to play 14-year-olds and at 14, Alvin 
looked, spoke, sang and acted like someone at least old enough to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Casting and booking agents loved her powerful and mature voice, but as Alvin 
said, "If you heard a 12-year-old was singing . . . would you go?" 
</P>
<P>
 She looked too old to play a kid and was too young to play an adult. So, she 
sang the old Cole Porter classics she loved and learned to accept rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned more from going to auditions and not getting the part than I think 
I would have in years of working," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, people did go to see the 12-year-old's own cabaret show, and she 
landed a few jobs singing for television and doing backup vocals on a Kenny 
Loggins album.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, this past year, as mother Andrea puts it, "She kind of grew into the 
material she was playing," and people started paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at 17, Alvin is doing one-woman shows at Los Angeles clubs like 
Cinegrill. She has agents and publicists, and has her sights on New York and 
Broadway before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has the Clintons and the Kennedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she's never nervous once she gets on stage, Alvin said she'll stick 
with "My Funny Valentine" next week in Washington -- a song she's sung for 
years and figures she could pull off even with a few butterflies in her 
stomach. ERIC SLATER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ROGAN IS CO-AUTHOR OF PADDLING BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale) is co-author of a bill that would allow 
juveniles convicted of graffiti vandalism to be sentenced to a couple of whacks 
with a wooden paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, introduced by Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), is under 
consideration by the Assembly Public Safety Committee and Rogan said it is 
receiving widespread support. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan said legislators were inspired to draft the initiative when American 
Michael Fay, 19, was caned in Singapore after he allegedly sprayed paint on 
cars with other foreign teen-agers last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fay incident crystallized the issue of corporal punishment for us and how 
well it worked," Rogan said, recalling his high school days when students were 
sent to the principal's office and flogged for various misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, a former Glendale Municipal Court judge, was elected in May to the 
Assembly seat formerly held by Pat Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed bill, judges could sentence juveniles convicted of graffiti 
vandalism with four to 10 whacks of a wooden paddle. Paddling sentences could 
be used in addition to more common sentences involving community service and 
monetary fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan said he doubts juveniles will scoff at a paddling sentence, and adds 
that embarrassment caused by a public paddling may prevent juveniles from 
becoming repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, if passed into law, would require a juvenile's parents to administer 
the paddling sentence in front of the judge in a court open to the public. If, 
in the judge's estimation, the parents don't paddle hard enough, Rogan said, 
the bailiff can take over. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure is meant to discourage taggers and to rid communities of graffiti 
more efficiently than other, more affable sentences such as community service, 
sponsors said.  
</P>
<P>
 It's important to stem the continuous tide of graffiti because it goes beyond 
vandalism and sends out a message that no one cares about the buildings it 
covers, and hence about the community, Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the paddling measure are unsure about the bill's future, and 
said it must be approved by two Assembly committees and the full Assembly in 
order to be sent to the state Senate. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; SCHOOLS TO EXPAND AIDS PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling the first year of an AIDS awareness program for high school seniors a 
success, the Las Virgenes Unified School District has confirmed plans to expand 
the program next year to include sophomores and juniors. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion of the program last year from a freshman workshop to a three-day 
awareness period for 12th-graders, including an assembly and related 
activities, dramatically exceeded state requirements that public high schools 
and middle schools offer one AIDS awareness session to their students. 
</P>
<P>
 The program stirred controversy among some parents when it was first 
considered, but school administrators say concern died down after parents 
learned more about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The curriculum includes an assembly with a variety of guest speakers and 
several smaller question-and-answer forums where students can ask HIV-AIDS 
mentors frank questions about topics concerning the disease and its prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, at Calabasas High School only one parent requested that a student 
be excluded from the three-day program, and at Agoura High School, no parents 
denied their students permission to participate, according to program 
coordinators at both schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was considerable consternation a year ago," Assistant Supt. Leo Lowe 
said. "But no complaints have been registered with me this year." SUSAN BYRNES

MISSING RESEDA WOMAN FEARED DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police investigating the disappearance of a Reseda woman in January now 
believe she may have been harmed or killed, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ann Johnson, 54, was last seen Jan. 20 as she left her job as an account 
representative for Robinson's-May Department Stores in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now believe she may have met with foul play," said Detective Robert Cosley 
of the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide investigators have taken over the case due to the time that has 
passed since Johnson was reported missing and due to an alleged threat made 
against her a month before she disappeared, Cosley said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Laura Chick, whose district includes Reseda, introduced a 
motion Wednesday to offer a $10,000 reward for information that would reveal 
Johnson's fate. The council is scheduled to consider the motion next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police approached us (because) the only hope now is through the offering 
of a reward," said Eric Rose, Chick's district director. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosley said that when Johnson was last seen she had told co-workers that she 
was meeting her estranged husband, Andrew Johnson, at an undisclosed location. 
Johnson's husband later told police he last spoke with her on Jan. 19, but was 
not scheduled to meet with her the next day as she had told her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Johnsons separated in 1993, but had not filed for divorce and were seeing 
each other again, Cosley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found Mary Ann Johnson's 1988 black Chevrolet Corvette on Jan. 26 in 
the parking lot of Louisiana West, a Van Nuys restaurant she and her husband 
own. Cosley said the keys to the car were found inside the locked restaurant, 
which closed recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ann Johnson's sister told police that the missing woman had been 
threatened by three men on Dec. 22 or 23. The sister said the men told Johnson 
they had been paid $800 to break her legs but instead only warned her that 
someone wanted to harm her. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosley said the three men did not tell Johnson who had paid them or why 
someone wanted her hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects and are seeking the public's help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're real interested in talking to anyone who may have seen anyone parking 
the Corvette on Jan. 26 or anyone who may have information about the three 
men," Cosley said.

MAN'S DEATH BLAMED ON INFECTION; ARLETA: UNLICENSED HEALER TREATED JESUS 
ANCHONDO BEFORE HE SUCCUMBED. BUT THE CULPRIT WAS NATURAL CAUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old Arleta man who died last April after receiving an injection from 
an unlicensed healer died of a severe throat infection and not the injection, 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He died of natural causes, that is the bottom line," said Scott Carrier, 
spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. "It wasn't from an 
injection." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier said traces of antibiotics were found in the blood of Jesus N. 
Anchondo Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchondo went into spasms and died April 10 after receiving a shot from 
Refugio Sandoval, 60, at her illegal home clinic in Reseda, police said. He had 
complained of a fever and other flu-like symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval, who authorities believe fled the country, is being sought by police 
for illegally practicing medicine, a detective with the Los Angeles Police 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have an ongoing investigation of . . . practicing medicine without a 
license," said Lt. George Rock of the West Valley Division. "The latest 
information from our investigation is that she is in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 After Anchondo died, Sandoval left her Hesperia Avenue home, leaving behind 
hundreds of bottles, vials and boxes of medicine, police said. The 
investigation suggested that Sandoval had been providing regular care to a 
large clientele for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlicensed healers are popular in immigrant communities, particularly when the 
cost of regular medical care may be prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, practicing medicine without a license is a misdemeanor. Rock 
said Mexican federal authorities might charge Sandoval, who is a Mexican 
citizen, with the same crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also have a problem with private practitioners who don't have a medical 
license," Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials said people who are unable to afford normal health care often 
use unlicensed healers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These alternate practitioners are generally a group of people who sell an 
idea that they can help or cure people," said Shirley Fannin, director of the 
disease control program at the Los Angeles Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general community is harmed by it," Fannin said. "People who have 
conditions that can worsen, are usually worse by the time they get to a 
hospital. And (the care) is not cheap. It is the most expensive cost-saving 
method that you have, especially if you have a disease that is curable in the 
early stages." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin said a person with streptococcal sepsis, the bacterial throat infection 
Anchondo died of, would need to be treated immediately because swelling of the 
throat shuts off the windpipe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is considered a medical emergency," Fannin said. "That is the difference 
between knowing what you're doing and not knowing, and that is why we 
regulate."

CITY TO VIE FOR FEDERAL ZONING PLAN DESIGNATION; URBAN AGENDA: SELECTION BY HUD 
AS ONE OF THE SIX ZONES WOULD MEAN $100 MILLION IN AID FOR POOR AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday unanimously approved an application 
to enter parts of the city -- including Pacoima -- into a competition to be 
named one of six federal "empowerment zones" later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The empowerment zones are the showpiece of the Clinton Administration's urban 
agenda and designation as one of the empowerment zones would bring $100 million 
in social programs and tax incentives for businesses to the poor areas, making 
it the most significant economic development program in Los Angeles in more 
than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will designate the zones 
in September. Competition for the program is fierce, with more than 400 cities 
expected to apply. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacoima area included in the application is home to 13,400 people and has 
a poverty rate that ranges from 25% to 40%. The two-square-mile area includes 
the Hansen Dam recreation area and the San Fernando Gardens, a low-income 
housing project with more than 2,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Community development officials and Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose district 
includes Pacoima, had to argue against community leaders from other 
poverty-plagued areas of the city to retain the small working-class Latino 
community in the zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said other city officials who backed the inclusion of Pacoima realized 
that "helping Pacoima helps the Valley, and that helps all of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 City bureaucrats have been scrambling to meet a June 30 deadline after being 
informed by HUD officials earlier this month that Los Angeles' application was 
lacking in detail and not competitive. City officials said they were told they 
had to outline specific programs that would be funded with the $100-million 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a lot of work, but it will get done on time," said Marilyn 
Lurie, director of industrial and commercial development for the city's 
Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Los Angeles' application, the Eastside and South-Central would receive 
the lion's share of the federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The application calls for dividing the 20-square-mile zone into three pieces, 
each of which meets federal guidelines requiring that at least half of the 
census tracts have poverty rates of 35% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 One empowerment zone would start in the industrial area of Boyle Heights, 
cross the Los Angeles River and encompass a section of South-Central along the 
Central Avenue corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 The second area would take in the Broadway-Manchester corridor in 
South-Central, stretch south and include Watts and unincorporated county areas 
in Willowbrook. The third portion would be in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles also is applying for four of the 65 HUD-designated "empowerment 
communities" that will receive $3 million each in federal funds. Those areas 
would include portions of Pico-Union, Westlake, Koreatown, South-Central and 
the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the county Board of Supervisors said it would support a joint 
application for one of the 65 zones by the southeast cities of Cudahy, Vernon, 
Huntington Park, Maywood, Bell and Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During Los Angeles City Council hearings, community leaders expressed concern 
that they would not be allowed sufficient decision-making input on how the 
money will be spent if Los Angeles' application is approved. They were 
generally optimistic, however, that their concerns would be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal guidelines, the city would be allowed to spend the $100 million 
for programs ranging from child care to job training. Also, businesses in the 
zone would be eligible for various tax incentives. They would include payroll 
tax breaks of as much as 20% on the wages of workers who live in the zone and 
accelerated depreciation of equipment, enabling owners to write off machinery 
upon purchase instead of the normal five- to seven-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Hugo Martin contributed to this story. Pacoima Empowerment 
Zone An application for a proposed federal empowerment zone was approved 
Wednesday by the Los Angeles City Council. It would include a 2.4-square mile 
area of Pacomia that has been plagued by poverty and high unemployment rates 
for years. The zone, the centerpiece of of President Clinton's urban 
revitalization effort, is expected to provide tax breaks, grants and social 
services programs.

AROUND THE VALLEY: PLUCKING FRUIT FROM LIMB SWEETENS SEASON FOR CHERRY LOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Big John Mayfield was just about picked clean. But he wasn't complaining. In 
fact, he was encouraging visitors to pluck the season's last gleaming red 
cherries from the upper limbs of his orchard in Leona Valley. The pickers had 
to climb ladders to reach the few clusters still clinging to the highest 
branches. This was the season's last -- some say its sweetest -- fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks earlier, Mayfield and Leona Valley's other "U-Pick" growers had 
opened their gates to hordes of cherry lovers. Even the lowest branches were 
then thick with fruit, drooping under its weight. 
</P>
<P>
 But like a lot of life's pleasures, cherry season just didn't last long 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 It began a couple of months earlier when delicate white cherry blossoms burst 
open to signal the beginning of spring. Soon, the petals gave way to tiny round 
fruit. By early June, the sweet cherries were ripe. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Los Angeles County is too warm to support cherry trees, which need 
plenty of freezing weather each winter to produce fruit. But Leona Valley, 
tucked up against the mountains west of Palmdale and no stranger to snow, is 
fertile ground for cherries. Each spring, the little town celebrates the 
opening of picking season with a parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter temperatures and rainfall affect the size of the crop. In a good year, 
cherry-picking season may last seven or eight weeks. A more modest crop, such 
as this year's, lasts only three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first two weekends this month, thousands of visitors invaded Big 
John's Orchard, snapping up much of his crop. 
</P>
<P>
 By a recent afternoon, many branches were bare, and only about two dozen 
pickers showed up for the last of the harvest. The price was a buck a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Trish Reilly of Valencia and her four children found slim pickings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to go pretty high (to find branches with cherries) on this farm," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach the upper branches, Reilly, who was visibly pregnant, scaled an 
aluminum ladder. "I'm not afraid," she said. But she quickly added: "My OB 
would kill me. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the work was worth it. "Fruit's always better off the tree," Reilly 
said. "It's always better here than at the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Judith Flowers of Monrovia was using one hand to hold the leash 
attached to her frisky dachshund. Her other hand steadied the ladder her 
12-year-old son Nathan had climbed to pick cherries. 
</P>
<P>
 She watched as he devoured some of the fruits of his labor. "One in the mouth, 
two in the bucket," she said laughing. "That's why this is taking so long." 
</P>
<P>
 For Flowers, the visit to Leona Valley was a trip down memory lane. As a 
youngster, she picked plenty of cherries here, usually by climbing the trees -- 
a technique that Big John forbids because of the risk to pickers and tree 
limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised up here," Flowers said. "My father was one of the people who 
planted the first big cherry orchard in Leona Valley. . . . For me, it's coming 
back once a year and doing what I did in my childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 She gazed into the branches where her son was busy. "The ones at the top are 
the best because they get the most sunshine, and they last the longest," she 
explained. "I'd like to get that cluster up there, but it's out of reach." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers said her son appears to have inherited her affection for cherry 
picking. "Even though it's a lot of work, he asks to come back each year," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few trees away, Leslie Smoot, who runs a day-care center in Lancaster, was 
riding herd over 20 children and adults who were on a cherry-picking field 
trip. She was having a tough time keeping the younger kids from climbing the 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big John said it was better if they gathered the (cherries) on the ground," 
Smoot said. "He won't charge us for them." 
</P>
<P>
 At the checkout counter, Norman Lobo of Northridge strode up with 18 pounds of 
the fruit, which he planned to serve at his church's potluck dinner. It had 
taken him two hours to pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take one of these cans, stick it around your neck and drop it in with 
both hands," he explained. "You have to get up high to get the good ones. If 
you're afraid of heights, forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another customer approached Big John himself with a more modest pail of 
pickings. "That should do me," the visitor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not quite," replied the orchard owner, as he grabbed a machete-sized knife 
and brought it down with a loud whack. 
</P>
<P>
 A thick red slice of watermelon fell over on the cutting board. Big John 
grinned and handed the sample to his customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanned, wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt stained with dust and fruit juice, 
Big John Mayfield, 63, looks like a hard-working farmer. Producing fruit, 
vegetables and honey was once merely a hobby. Now it consumes much of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 As a contractor, Mayfield says he helped build thousands of tract houses in 
the west San Fernando Valley. Later, he specialized in building custom homes. 
</P>
<P>
 He's lived in Leona Valley since 1959 and bought his cherry orchard 17 years 
ago. Now it's grown to 265 trees and Mayfield is just about retired from the 
building business. 
</P>
<P>
 His cherry season is over now. But Mayfield plans to keep his roadside stand 
open, selling the honey he gets from his 200 beehives. Pretty soon, he will add 
the watermelons, tomatoes and bell peppers he is growing across the street. 
Soon afterward, his Asian pears will be ripe. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayfield's goal? To keep the stand open until October, when the pumpkins will 
be ready for harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds silly, but I'm not in it for the money," he says. "I always wanted 
to be a farmer. I don't care if I ever build another house."

DAMAGED SCHOOL TO BE DEMOLISHED; EDUCATION: STUDY FINDS GROUND BENEATH VAN GOGH 
ELEMENTARY IS UNSTABLE. COST OF REBUILDING IS ESTIMATED AT $5 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Earthquake-ravaged Van Gogh Elementary School in Granada Hills will be 
demolished, although it will take up to three years and about $5 million to 
rebuild, school district officials told parents and the school's staff late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of study, two consulting firms hired by the Los Angeles Unified 
School District concluded that the ground beneath the campus is too unstable to 
support the existing buildings during another strong earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gogh, the only public school still closed because of damage by the Jan. 17 
Northridge quake, is holding classes for its 350 students in a section of 
nearby Frost Middle School. When the earthquake tore hundreds of crisscrossing 
fissures through the school and playground, district officials closed the 
campus until geological studies could be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district will apply for a grant from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to pay for the demolition and the construction of a new 
school, said Doug Brown, director of facilities for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 In its final report, the Studio City firm of Jerry Kovacs and Associates Inc. 
said that another strong earthquake would probably cause more ground fissuring 
and structural damage, such as occurred at Van Gogh on Jan. 17 and in the 1971 
Sylmar quake. The firm recommended that the buildings be replaced with new 
structures on stronger foundations that could sustain violent soil vibrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles firm of Law, Crandall Inc. concluded that the current 
buildings could be salvaged, but only by substantially strengthening their 
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the reports, Brown said, the district decided the best option 
would be to start over. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the kinds of things we would have to do, there wasn't much choice 
left," Brown said before the meeting. "It would cost the same to knock it down 
and rebuild." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents who feared the site would be abandoned were relieved that it will 
continue as a neighborhood school. 
</P>
<P>
 The fissures that the Northridge earthquake opened in the playground as well 
as cracks running through the main hallway were similar to those caused by the 
1971 Sylmar quake, suggesting to engineers that the soil underneath the school 
buildings may have briefly liquefied in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquefaction occurs in areas of loosely packed, fine-grain soil saturated by 
ground water in an earthquake. Buildings on the site twist and crack as the 
soil's load-bearing strength weakens.

 Kovacs concluded that the damage at Van Gogh was caused by a combination of 
liquefaction, seismically induced settlement and a process called translation, 
in which the soil shifts location during liquefaction. But Law Crandall said 
that liquefaction was not a major element in the destruction, blaming strong 
ground movement instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kovacs report concludes: "It is the opinion of this firm that the damage 
to the school site and grounds observed after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake and 
the 1994 Northridge earthquake has occurred at other times in the past and will 
occur in the future in response to a sufficient level of ground shaking." 
</P>
<P>
 To counteract the shaking, Brown said, the new buildings would be designed of 
heavy-duty wood to the strictest seismic standards, grouped in modules of four 
classrooms each and supported by foundations designed to bridge shaky ground. 
Brown assured parents there are no plans to abandon the site. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Van Gogh Principal Maureen Diekmann said there have been no problems related 
to the site since the students were moved to Frost Middle School. Initial 
parent concerns that the middle school students would mingle with the 
elementary school students, she said, proved to be unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before hearing the conclusions of the studies, Diekmann said, parents and 
the school's staff were prepared to stay at Frost for at least the next school 
year. A handful of students transferred to other schools in the district 
because of the move after the quake, Diekmann said, but more than 60 others 
applied to enter it under the new school choice program to begin school there 
in the fall.

4 BRUSH FIRES IN SANTA CLARITA VALLEY KEEP CREWS BUSY 
</P>

<P>
 Four brush fires -- three of which burned simultaneously -- sent 225 
firefighters hurrying across the Santa Clarita Valley on Wednesday, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three teen-age boys were detained on suspicion of arson in the first blaze, 
which burned about 1 1/2 acres of land above Saugus High School, said Lt. 
Barbara Persten of the Los Angeles County sheriff's station in Santa 
Clarita.Authorities suspect the youths were playing with a lighter in the brush 
above the school when flames were seen at 12:30 p.m., Persten said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 county firefighters and jail inmate work crews battled that blaze in 
the 21900 block of Centurion Way for more than two hours before bringing it 
under control, said Fire Inspector Bob Brandelli. Two firefighting helicopters 
aided them, Brandelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 firefighters battled a half-acre brush fire in the 18900 block of 
Soledad Canyon Road about 1:45 p.m., Brandelli said. That fire was brought 
under control within an hour, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two fires erupted in the Angeles National Forest along the Golden 
State Freeway, causing lane closures at two sites, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first fire, which began about 2 p.m. just north of Castaic, burned five 
acres of brush in 50 minutes before firefighters contained it, Brandelli said. 
The second began shortly after 6 p.m. north of the earlier roadside fire, said 
Cheryl Parker, a county fire dispatch supervisor. That fire burned about 10 
acres before it was contained, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Forest Service firefighter suffered second-degree burns to his face and 
was airlifted to the burn center at Sherman Oaks Hospital.

FEW RETAILERS SHOW UP FOR PARTY PROMOTING PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The slick invites had been sent, the fancy brochures prepared and the favors 
-- popcorn-filled plastic wine bottles labeled "Things are popping in Palmdale" 
-- were ready to hand out. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all part of the latest effort by the city to lure high-profile 
retailers to Palmdale. Representatives of dozens of retailers -- including such 
yuppie favorites as Ikea, Crate & Barrel and Adray's -- were invited to a 
luncheon at the local Holiday Inn and a 30-minute bus tour of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But only about a dozen showed up. And only two took the bus tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the turnout, city officials said they were pleased with the event, 
noting that it could help solidify negotiations for restaurants and stores to 
come to Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are three deals that will be made as a result of this lunch," 
said Dolores Buddell-Teubner, Palmdale's economic development coordinator. 
"Some of the key retailers we wanted came. All in all, we got a good 
representation from some of the ones we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from T.G.I. Friday's, Malibu Grand Prix, Cost Plus Imports and 
Adray's were there. Ikea was among the no-shows. 
</P>
<P>
 John Fisher, owner of a diner in Palos Verdes, said he is considering opening 
a second diner at the Antelope Valley Walk, an entertainment and retail 
development proposed for an area north of the city's auto mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher seemed sold on the city. "Palmdale is very active, very aggressive in 
wanting growth," he said at the luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 This is just what Mayor Jim Ledford wanted to hear. "We've got the hottest 
regional marketplace in the Antelope Valley," he told those at the luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin Bettar Jr., representing Adray's, said he believes that the discount 
electronics chain will eventually open a store in the Antelope Valley, but not 
until there is a larger population in the area. Still, he said he came because 
he wanted to hear firsthand what was happening in the city and wanted to keep 
tabs on the competition. "It helps us understand what's coming in," Bettar 
said.

4 OFFICERS FIRED, 1 SUSPENDED OVER PRISON ESCAPE; CORRECTIONS: INMATE IN 
OCTOBER INCIDENT WAS CAUGHT QUICKLY. NEW STATE FACILITY HAD BEEN CRITICIZED FOR 
PERCEIVED LAX SECURITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four correctional officers have been fired and a fifth given a 30-day 
suspension for allowing a convicted murdered to escape from the new state 
prison in Lancaster last October, interim Warden John Ratelle said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratelle said he took action against the officers in late May but did not make 
it public until a meeting of the prison's citizens advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members said they were pleased to hear about the punishment. The 
Oct. 6 escape had triggered a citywide outcry concerning security at the 
prison, which opened in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmate Eric Rene Johnson, 23, climbed over an eight-foot block wall and two 
12-foot chain-link fences, all topped with razor wire, to make his escape. He 
was recaptured five hours later outside a convenience market in Lancaster, 
several miles from the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials said no officers would be disciplined until an investigation 
had been completed. As the months went by, some local leaders expressed 
impatience over the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's meeting, Ratelle said investigators simply determined that the 
officers were not paying attention to the prisoner or the fences when Johnson 
escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know exactly how it happened," the warden said. "The inmate saw an 
opportunity and took it. He saw the staff was lax. That's what happened here -- 
a lack of attentiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Ratelle said he could not identify the disciplined officers because of state 
privacy laws. The officers had been with the state Department of Corrections 
for four to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers can appeal their firings to a state board, but they cannot retain 
their jobs while awaiting the outcome, Ratelle said. He did not know whether 
any of the officers had filed an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 A sixth officer who also was investigated in connection with the breakout 
received no punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's escape angered many residents because at the time the prison was 
proposed, many city leaders fought it partly because of security concerns. But 
state officials insisted that escapes were extremely rare. 
</P>
<P>
 The new prison -- which houses more than 3,000 maximum- and medium-security 
prisoners -- received a second blow to its reputation in January when another 
prisoner, serving a life sentence for attempted murder, escaped by hiding 
inside a garbage truck. He, too, was recaptured, but a month later state 
officials removed the prison's first warden, Otis Thurman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratelle, who has been running the prison since then, said the investigation 
into the second escape is continuing and that no officers have been disciplined 
yet. But he said the prison has changed its garbage collection procedures to 
reduce the prospects of another such escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The warden also said an electrified fence, now under construction, will make 
it highly unlikely that another inmate can escape the way Johnson did. The 
electrified fence, which will carry a potentially lethal charge, is expected to 
be activated at the Lancaster prison in January.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PLANNED DEVELOPMENT GETS 3RD EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A developer who has not begun building a 2,500-home community approved four 
years ago has received another one-year extension on his proposal, despite 
objections from nearby residents, the Lancaster city staff and two City Council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the council -- Mayor Frank Roberts and Councilmen Henry Hearns 
and George Runner -- voted Monday to keep the Encino-based Larwin Co.'s Del Sur 
Ranch development agreement alive for one more year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Larwin had violated its 1990 agreement by failing to start 
construction, the council majority thought the company deserved another chance 
because of the problems it had encountered during the economic recession and in 
arranging water and sewer service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm inclined to be very compassionate to a company like Larwin," said Roberts 
about the company that has built numerous houses in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearns also agreed to the extension but added, "I hope they won't ask me to do 
this again." 
</P>
<P>
 The company had received extensions twice previously. 
</P>
<P>
 In their previous roles as homeowner activists, newly elected council members 
Michael Singer and Deborah Shelton had criticized the Del Sur project. They 
voted against the extension Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said he believed the problem was not with the economy in general but 
that the Del Sur community was too expensive to build. "I don't think this a 
feasible project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the Del Sur Ranch development would extend over 880 acres in the 
far northwest corner of Lancaster, bounded roughly by Avenue G, 90th Street 
West, Avenue H-8 and 105 Street West. The development agreement gives Larwin 
the right to build 2,500 dwellings under city rules that were in effect four or 
five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have complained that Del Sur Ranch is so far from central Lancaster it 
will cost the city too much to provide services to the homeowners. Current 
residents of the nearby Antelope Acres community have complained that Del Sur 
Ranch would spoil the rural character of their area. 
</P>
<P>
 But others believe the project would be an asset to the city. Last year, the 
council approved a revised Del Sur plan that added a 21-acre private lake and 
replaced many larger lots with smaller parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Brian N. Hawley, the city's community development director, urged 
the council to terminate the Del Sur agreement because Larwin had not begun 
building any of the houses. 
</P>
<P>
 But J. Michael Nolte, Larwin's executive vice president, told the council that 
the project was being delayed largely by county sewer and water agencies that 
are beyond the company's control.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SUSPECT DENIES GUILT IN FATAL SHOOTING OF 
UNARMED MAN 
</P>

<P>
 A Hi Vista man pleaded not guilty to one first-degree murder charge and seven 
other felony counts stemming from the weekend shooting death of an unarmed man. 
</P>
<P>
 Teodoro Sanchez Huerta, 34, entered the plea in Lancaster Municipal Court late 
Tuesday afternoon and was ordered held without bail.A preliminary hearing was 
set for July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Huerta is charged with fatally shooting Joaquin F. Bonilla, 43, on Sunday with 
a 30-30 rifle, which is a high-power gun traditionally used for hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men and their families had apparently argued at least twice that day 
at a gathering at Huerta's home in this unincorporated, remote area east of 
Lancaster, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Pam Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 4 p.m., as Bonilla was leaving the gathering with his wife and 
two young children, Huerta allegedly fired several rounds into their van, 
Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla, who was unarmed, got out of the van and confronted Huerta, she said. 
Huerta then allegedly shot Bonilla once in the chest and once in the head, 
Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence is pretty clear both men had been drinking at the time of the 
shooting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huerta allegedly fled the scene but was arrested about four hours later when 
he returned home. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the murder charge, Huerta faces three counts of attempted 
murder, three counts of assault with a deadly weapon and one count of shooting 
an occupied vehicle.

 John Wordin, a former football assistant at El Camino Real High, has been 
hired at Granada Hills, where he is expected eventually to replace Darryl 
Stroh. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroh, the Highlanders' co-coach, announced last month that he will resign 
after the 1994 season.Wordin, 31, will start as an assistant in the fall but 
might take over Stroh's duties as defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroh, 55, will remain as the school's baseball coach. He is believed to be 
the only coach ever to lead teams to City Section major-division titles in 
baseball (five) and football (one). 
</P>
<P>
 Wordin graduated from Calabasas High in 1981 and was a defensive end at Cal 
State Northridge from 1981-85. For the past five seasons, he has been a varsity 
assistant at El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 Wordin also is a nationally known amateur cyclist with the Nutra-Fig racing 
team.

 Jim Landress, a two-year starter at quarterback for Granada Hills High, has 
quit the team to concentrate on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Landress, who will be a senior, was an All-City 4-A selection in baseball last 
spring.  
</P>
<P>
 Landress started at quarterback for the Highlanders as a sophomore. In 1993, 
He completed 99 of 197 passes for 1,201 yards and 11 touchdowns. In the spring, 
Landress, an outfielder who also has played shortstop, batted .443 with 10 
doubles, four home runs and 26 runs batted in.  
</P>

WI CHIPS AWAY AFTER POOR SHOT TO ADVANCE IN STATE AMATEUR; GOLF: FORMER 
CHAMPION MAKES ROUND OF 16 FOR FIFTH YEAR IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The worst-looking shot Charlie Wi hit on Wednesday produced the best-looking 
results. That's the way it goes sometimes at Pebble Beach Golf Links. Other 
days, it's vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get down on yourself," Wi said. "If you lose confidence here, you 
can lose hole after hole after hole. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't the story line for Wi in the 83rd State Amateur Championship as he 
advanced to the round of 16 for the fifth time in as many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, a Westlake High graduate who lives in North Hills, was the only area 
player from a group of three to survive the first round of match play. He 
easily defeated Mark Miller of Antioch, 4 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, 22, will face Mark Johnson of Helendale in the second round today at 6:36 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wi, the 1990 State Amateur champion, momentum picked up on the fifth hole, 
a 166-yard par-three. He missed the green with a five-iron, but chipped in for 
birdie from 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The tee shot) was pretty ugly," Wi said. "But chipping in got me rolling." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 42, was soon rolled asunder. Wi then birdied the par-five sixth to go 
2-up and parred the ninth to move 3-up. Putting the match away was simply a 
matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to play steady," Wi said. "Don't blow it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, a senior at Cal, closed out Miller with a routine par on the 15th hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, the defending Southern California Mid-Amateur champion, played the 
toughest match of the day. He defeated Joey Ferrari of Lodi, the State Amateur 
runner-up in 1993, on the third hole of sudden death. Both players birdied the 
first two playoff holes before Johnson won with a birdie on the third hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamey Forsyth of Chatsworth and Chad Wright of Ventura had decidedly more 
mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsyth, 25, never had a chance in an 8 and 6 defeat to Steve Woods of Upland 
and San Jose State. It was an all-out blitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, the event's stroke-play medalist, was 4-up after four holes. It ended 
on the par-three 12th hole when Forsyth hit his tee shot out of bounds and 
conceded the match. Woods was two under at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geez, shaking hands on the 12th hole is pretty brutal," said Forsyth, who was 
competing in his first State Amateur. "That's disappointing. I didn't even put 
up a fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, a sophomore at USC, fought back and then some. Wright was all but dead 
in his match against Ed Cuff of Temecula when he made a spirited comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuff was dormie after the 13th hole -- he held a five-hole lead with as many 
to play. Cuff, 32, mentioned to Wright on the front nine that he was a former 
pro who had played on the Asian Tour and assorted stateside mini-tours before 
regaining his amateur status three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before that, I was thinking, 'Who is this guy and where did he come from?' " 
said Wright, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The next question might have been, What is he doing? Wright, facing 
elimination if he so much as halved a hole, won three holes in a row heading to 
the storied 17th. Wright parred, but Cuff got up and down from a greenside 
bunker to save par and win, 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright was one-over for the day, but Cuff was three-under on the front nine 
alone and didn't make a bogey until the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 Against tough competition on a demanding course such as Pebble Beach, it's 
difficult to gain ground because birdies are hard to come by, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I played pretty well," Wright said. "But I didn't make up anything 
until the end of the round."

LADIN IS NEARLY PAR FOR THE SENIORS' COURSE; GOLF: DEFENDING CHAMPION FROM 
WESTLAKE FIRES OPENING-ROUND 73. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After making his first and only birdie putt of the day, an eight-footer on the 
18th hole at Poppy Hills Golf Course, Paul Ladin raised a hand over his head 
and barked loud enough to rattle the dishes in the clubhouse kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His play wasn't that bad. Not by a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin fired a one-over-par 73 Wednesday, good for fourth place after the first 
round of the 3rd State Senior Amateur Championship, for players 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin, the defending champion and a Westlake Village resident, led a group of 
five area players seeking to make the 36-hole cut after today's round. The top 
24 players plus ties advance to the final round Friday in the 54-hole, 
stroke-play event. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin wasn't dissatisfied with the round -- which left him two shots off the 
lead -- he was just miffed that he didn't capitalized on several opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played fair," said Ladin, 61, who owns an auto dealership in Thousand Oaks. 
"It was OK. That about covers it." 
</P>
<P>
 Monotonous is another way to describe his round. Ladin didn't make many 
birdies, but he didn't make many mistakes, either. He had 15 pars and two 
bogeys before he rammed home the putt at No. 18. During one stretch, he parred 
nine consecutive holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin trails co-leaders James Riedstra of Novato and James McMurtrey, who shot 
71s. McMurtrey, one of the nation's top senior amateurs, is the reigning 
Northern California Golf Assn. Senior champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Paulson, director of the NCGA, which makes its headquarters at Poppy 
Hills, is third at 72. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo's Jim Patterson, 68, shot 76 to remain in the hunt. William Mott, an 
orthodontist from Calabasas, shot 79 and was the only other player from the 
region to break 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson was among seven players at 76, good for a share of 12th place. 
</P>
<P>
 Mott also would have ranked among the leaders without a dreadful two-hole 
stretch on the back nine. Mott, 56, triple-bogeyed the 13th and double-bogeyed 
the 14th, both par fours. He shot 42 on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit it in the woods and I couldn't get it out," Mott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin experienced no such disaster, though he said missing five birdie putts 
from within 20 feet almost qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on the 18th, a 474-yard par five, Ladin reached the green with a 
driver and four-iron, and two-putted from the fringe for birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Wagner of Camarillo shot 80 and Jerome Chirpich of Granada Hills shot 
81. Joe Bolstad of Westlake Village withdrew after nine holes because of a bad 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin definitely looked the role of the pre-tournament heavy. He dressed 
completely in black, from his shoes and spikes to his hat. 
</P>
<P>
 His somber attire had nothing to do with intimidation or a backhanded 
compliment to Gary Player. The choice was for both form and function. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have on black shorts, too," he cracked. "But I wore black to keep warm. I 
wanted to absorb all the heat I could. I can't stand the cold up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the chance, most of the field probably would have burned their score 
cards. The weather definitely had a chilling effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 11 of 81 players shot 75 or better, despite playing from the white tees.

MORRICONE: HOLLYWOOD'S SCORE KEEPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pressed to pick his favorite Ennio Morricone score, Warren Beatty hems and 
haws. But he doesn't hedge too politically long in naming Morricone his 
favorite scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't much that he's done that I haven't really loved," says Beatty, 
who recently hired Morricone to do the music for "Love Affair," his next 
production. "I always felt there's nobody better than Ennio to create a 
haunting theme. And I think he has as thorough an understanding of movies as 
any composer in the world. You could make a very good case -- not that these 
cases are worth anything -- but I don't know who's a more significant composer 
in the world right now. Do you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Beatty isn't going out on too terribly tenuous a limb: Many scoring buffs 
would agree with the star's appreciation of the man he refers to as "the 
maestro." What's for certain is that no other European scorer's services are 
coveted nearly so much in Hollywood circles as those of Morricone, whose 
popularity on these shores has risen even as, after decades of work here, he 
still politely declines to learn English. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's a given that no other film composer who's enjoyed Morricone's 
consistent level of esteem has turned out anywhere near his body of work, which 
amounts to more than 250 movies over the last 33 years, the most recent being 
the current box-office topper, "Wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 So, where to place him in the pantheon? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting to gauge his place in film music because, despite all that 
success, I'd say for a long time he was very underrated," says scoring expert 
Steven Smith, author of a hailed Bernard Herrmann biography. "I don't know if 
it's American chauvinism, but the fact that he didn't win the Oscar for 'The 
Mission,' which was considered a shoo-in, some could almost perceive it as a 
snub. I think he has not received his due in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "The Mission" -- the choral/orchestral combination that seems to be 
the one film score sitting in just about everybody's CD stack -- Morricone was 
also nominated for the gently luminous "Days of Heaven," the throbbing "The 
Untouchables" and his previous collaboration with Beatty, "Bugsy." 
</P>
<P>
 But although in recent years he's been associated more with a kind of lush, 
emotive romanticism, his name may be forever popularly tagged to the stranger, 
sparer sounds he concocted for the Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns of the '60s, 
most famously the instantly recognizable strains of "The Good, the Bad and the 
Ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 How does a composer stay in vogue for nearly 3 1/2 musically turbulent 
decades? 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wrote music that was en vogue , a la mode ," says Morricone, 65, 
through a translator, on a visit to Los Angeles to receive a career achievement 
award from ASCAP. "The music that's fashionable, when it's fashionable, it's 
already over. So the only answer is to write music that will serve the director 
in such a way that he can carry on with the film and give it the meanings that 
he wants to give it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have tried to impose things that meant something to me personally -- such 
as the choice of the timbre in the music, the strange sounds, the application 
of using contemporary music with simple, hummable, thematic, melodic tunes . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
 Morricone has regrets about having given up the hallowed halls of what might 
loosely be considered classical music early on in favor of movie scoring. But 
some of his admirers suggest that writing for the movies has almost certainly 
allowed him to be more innovative than more traditionally "serious" performance 
music might have, if only because of the wider variety of instrumental 
combinations possible -- a Morricone trademark ever since he combined weird 
whistlings, wordless sopranos and twangy electric guitars in the classic Leone 
Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Says Smith, "The great thing about a film score is you can create a totally 
original instrumental ensemble for each project, and Morricone's very good at 
doing that. He can move from traditional melodic orchestration to something 
very alive and contemporary-sounding. A score like 'The Untouchables' can 
employ a very modern rhythmic sound -- a driving, almost disco-like beat that 
captures the staccato rhythm of gunfire, almost, or the sense of a manhunt." 
</P>
<P>
 For "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," Morricone found his stylistic solution 
in imagining the sound of a coyote heard from a distant hillside, and trying to 
find instrumentation that might best represent that lonesome howl in purely 
musical tones. This year, he was faced with a different sort of lupine 
inspiration: Mike Nichols' "Wolf," whose music is smoothly frantic and full of 
classic romantic portent. But he categorically refuses to categorize the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has within itself a great force of humanity," says Morricone. "Therefore I 
don't consider it a suspense thriller, even if it has some very strong moments 
of tension in it. It's a film that has its own character, its own personality, 
its own different cinematic style." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Morricone doesn't quite articulate what that unique character is. 
He tends to speak of his own work with some reluctance and in generalities. And 
getting a bead on "the maestro's" own personality is not necessarily any more 
definite. 
</P>
<P>
 "In person, he's very much all business, very cool," says one puzzled admirer 
who's spent time around Morricone. "I don't know how to read it, except that 
he's an artist type whose passion must all come out in the writing process." 
</P>
<P>
 Beatty, on the other hand, reads Morricone's lack of gregariousness as a lack 
of pretension: "I find him to be without affectation, both in his manner and in 
his music, so that everything counts. That same kind of humility or modesty or 
reticence that he has in life, he has in his music." 
</P>
<P>
 If Morricone has the modesty Beatty claims for him, it still doesn't cause him 
to suffer fools gladly. The composer is famous for railing against other 
scorers who use orchestrators to arrange their music, a practice that's 
considered a necessity by most of Hollywood's busier composers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A composer who does not do his own orchestrations, it's a serious defect to 
consider him a composer 100%," says Morricone. "Either he's not capable, or 
he's lazy, or he's capable but he doesn't love his own profession -- three 
negative things that make him a halfway composer. I am comforted in what I say 
by the consideration of the great composers of centuries ago, Beethoven and 
Bach and Stravinsky and Mozart -- they didn't have arrangers, orchestrators." 
</P>
<P>
 If Morricone's disregard for the supposed shortcuts of his musical 
contemporaries makes him sound a little, well, contrary , he seems on the other 
hand to have uncommon respect for the filmmakers he collaborates with. The 
maestro says his first and foremost aim is always to serve the director's 
vision for a film, and then serve his own purposes in using that vision as a 
springboard for music that will eventually wind up a self-sufficient work of 
art via CD. 
</P>
<P>
 "The true mark of a film composer," he says, "is to find the path which serves 
his dignity as a composer, and serves the public and the producer, but 
especially serves the director. This conditioning does not impede the composer. 
It may take off or explode and ensure his creativity with this new freedom, 
found above the obligations of the film."

NIGHTCLUBBING ON THE EDGE; ENTERTAINMENT: TRENDY SPOTS ARE POPPING UP IN SOME 
OF HOLLYWOOD'S SEEDIEST AREAS, AND FOR MANY OF THE CUSTOMERS THE SLUMMING IS 
HALF THE FUN.

 Scene 1, Las Palmas and Hollywood Boulevard: A thin, tall man with glazed eyes 
and a high-pitched voice approaches you at midnight as you park your car. He 
tells you he needs some help. Seems he's lost his dope, and he's convinced if 
he doesn't find it soon, someone else will and that'll be the end of his stash. 
Nearby, a couple of young guys begin to chuckle at the stranger, who by now has 
scooted under the car to take one last look around. 
</P>
<P>
 Scene 2, El Centro and Santa Monica Boulevard: Two wiry young men walk side by 
side at night. It's springtime and unseasonably cold, but both have opted to go 
shirtless -- their flannels tucked into the left back pocket of tight-fitting 
Levi's. The driver of a gold Lincoln Continental slows to a cruise and motions 
them over. The younger looking of the two hops in for a ride, the other 
continues walking to Gower Street, where he crosses the boulevard and begins 
the walk back. 
</P>
<P>
 Scene 3, La Brea between Hollywood and Sunset: A well-dressed man stumbles out 
from behind a strip-mall bush. He begins walking up the street toward his car, 
when a group of young men start forming a circle around him. They taunt him 
until he tries to break away from them with an open-hand swipe at the tallest 
of the youths. One youth retaliates with a beer bottle to the man's forehead, 
and everyone begins scattering in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon viewing these street tableaux, it's clear you're not in Kansas anymore. 
Welcome to the heart of Hollywood -- an area that long ago relinquished its 
glamour tiara to the more prosperous turf on the Westside. Although such chance 
meetings aren't for the faint of heart, threats of similar encounters don't 
appear to be keeping too many club-goers at home: Each vignette illustrates 
actual events that recently occurred outside three of Hollywood's newest and 
most vibrant nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bar Deluxe on Las Palmas, Bob's Frolic III on Santa Monica and the Lava Lounge 
on La Brea represent the latest crop of trendy and fearless Hollywood clubs. 
Enticed into seedy parts of town after seeking out ailing venues with valid 
liquor licenses and space for live music, each of the three has proven the 
adage correct: If you build it, they do indeed come -- even if that means 
street parking on El Centro. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the danger factor seems to even enhance the patrons' 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you enter Bob's Frolic III from that weird side entrance, it feels like 
an underground club," says Eva Rose Cook, a 21-year-old club-goer who frequents 
all three venues. "You get that shady feeling that you kind of want. It's 
mysterious and people like that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I be afraid to come here?" says Vaughny Bower, a 23-year-old 
customer of Bar Deluxe. "I live in a ghetto. I live in Silver Lake." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Marini, the 30-year-old owner of the Lava Lounge -- the crown jewel 
of the new crop of clubs -- says the dicey neighborhood also appealed to her 
for aesthetic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept of the Lava Lounge was to create a paradise in the middle of 
hell," says Marini, who worked as a film art and set director before opening 
the Lava Lounge six months ago. "You walk in and you're swept away." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Marini has succeeded in creating a small nether world in the 
oddest of places, a run-down Hollywood strip mall, with an edgy, unsavory feel 
to it. Customers walk through beaded curtains into a cozy room with faux lava 
walls and a Waikiki-meets-Vegas flair. Jazz trios perform a few nights a week 
to a crowd that appears too young to remember when glittery lounge acts were 
uncool. For Marini, the business has been steady ever since she opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mini-mall situation actually appealed to me," says Marini. "I can get my 
laundry done, my nails painted and a bite to eat without leaving work." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1 1/2 years it took to purchase and transform the venue -- which 
had been a Hungarian bar for eight years and, according to Marini, a 
"prostitute hang-out" -- the Northern California native did have some trying 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "During construction, we used the peephole like television," she says. "It was 
like watching 'Cops.' It was really seedy and a bit scary. But since we've 
opened, the crime seems to have actually subsided." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Nunley, the owner of Bob's Frolic III, says that the month-old club has 
actually enhanced the safety of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were kind of hesitant to start a club like this down here," says Nunley, 
47. "We were afraid that if something wasn't done about the neighborhood, 
people wouldn't come here." 
</P>
<P>
 He says that the decision to transform the venue from a Latino bar to the 
Frolic III, coupled with a new theater (the Actors' Gang) opening up across the 
street, has prompted more police cars to patrol the area. Most of the 
street-corner loiterers apparently decided to find a new location. 
</P>
<P>
 The Frolic III, which is the third in Nunley's Frolic trilogy (the original 
Frolic Room is on Hollywood Boulevard and Bob's Frolic II is on Wilcox Avenue), 
is the first to offer live music on a regular basis and favors local 
alternative acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "These venues were bound to pop us," says Mary Nixon, a 33-year-old L.A.-based 
promoter who books the room five nights a week along with her partner, Johnny 
Vargas. "The Shamrock closed, the Central stopped doing its local alternative 
nights when it became the Viper Room and people don't want to drive (as far as) 
downtown to Al's Bar." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly the least fashionable of the three new clubs, Bob's appears more 
concerned with showcasing new talent than with creating a paradise lost. There 
were no cosmetic changes before it opened. "We just closed it for a few months, 
changed the jukebox, did a little face lift, nothing major," says Nunley. 
</P>
<P>
 But, somehow, this lack of atmosphere is part of the club's charm.  
</P>
<P>
 "People like the little bar scene," says Nixon, "where you feel like you belly 
up to the bar, playing pool, doing a shot, watching a band. That's the feel 
that people want when they're out at night. Unfortunately, the only places left 
to create these settings are in little dive restaurants, in lousy parts of 
town." 
</P>
<P>
 Bar Deluxe, which opened six months ago on Las Palmas Avenue just above 
Hollywood Boulevard, built a mountain out of a veritable molehill when it took 
over an Indian restaurant. The club is in arguably the roughest location of the 
trio -- when you walk in its neighborhood it's not uncommon to be offered 
crack. A mere glance at the boarded-up buildings surrounding the place gives a 
hint of the work that its owner, Janice DeSoto, has cut out for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the potential for the space," says DeSoto, an L.A. native in her 30s. 
"I didn't necessarily want to be by Hollywood Boulevard, but, on the other 
hand, it didn't scare me that much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bar-hoppers are a lot more adventurous than other people," adds DeSoto, who 
worked as a promoter for eight years before opening her own club. "It adds to 
the intrigue. It's like, 'Let's find out what a place is like.' "  
</P>
<P>
 As her steady stream of customers might indicate, people are finding out just 
what lurks behind Bar Deluxe's red-lit entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bi-level venue is beautifully decorated in red and black, with 
antique lighting fixtures and hand-painted details enhancing the club, the 
atmosphere is more relaxed than the Lava Lounge, which tends to attract a more 
be-seen crowd. The live music is partially responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Favoring rockabilly, blues and country, DeSoto says she's aiming for an 
"eclectic, country-bar vibe." From psychobilly bands such as Jack and the Dead 
Cats to honky-tonk regulars, the Groovy Rednecks, the wide-ranging music 
attracts a mixed crowd of music fans and club-goers who aren't put off by the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, DeSoto credits the neighborhood for allowing her to create the type 
of music scene she wanted at Bar Deluxe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighbors don't care what you do around here," she says. "We're the good 
guys on the block. We upgraded the area by attracting a nicer clientele. They 
don't bother me about the music. Try getting that kind of attitude in more 
upscale neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've blended in and I'm kind of anonymous. They've got too many other things 
to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 Marini even credits her location for adding an element of intrigue to an 
evening out: "(My customers) tell me it's kind of a challenge and kind of cool 
coming here. People like a bit of danger."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like that 'Twilight Zone' episode," adds Nixon. " 'Will I make it to St. 
Lou'? Will I live through the show? Will I get to see the third band?' 
</P>
<P>
 "We all get a thrill."

U.S. UPSET ENDS 44-YEAR WAIT FOR WORLD CUP WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States, long a soccer lightweight, scored an improbable upset in 
its second game in the World Cup on Wednesday, beating highly regarded 
Colombia, 2-1, in front of a screaming, flag-waving crowd of 93,194 at the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first World Cup win for the United States since 1950, when it 
stunned England 1-0 in Brazil. The win also means the U.S. team will almost 
certainly advance out of the first round of the World Cup for the first time 
since 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 The news of the win was viewed like an exploding rocket in the soccer world, 
which has come to view the American team as a hard-working but lightweight 
representative of one of the few nations that demonstrates an indifference to 
the world's most popular sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Beating Colombia was astonishing enough, but to utterly overwhelm one of the 
tournament's favorites will likely give American soccer instant credibility and 
boost interest in the tournament, which is being held in nine U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude of the win was not lost on the crowd at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Perrin of Studio City was on her feet cheering during much of the game, 
even though this was her first professional soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like it," she said, after the United States took the 
unexpected win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian loss also made an impact on fans at the Rose Bowl. After the 
game, many left the stadium in stunned disbelief. Oscar Alvarez, a Palm Springs 
mini-market owner and Medellin native, spoke softly as the crowd around him 
celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Colombians are going home with a great sadness but in football, this is 
how it is," said the 34-year-old, clutching his chest. "I feel this in my 
heart; this is a great loss." 
</P>
<P>
 For Colombian fans, the unthinkable had happened. "We never expected them to 
do this badly," said Alvaro Arenas, 55, a doctor from Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colombia, the streets were full of people with flags waving and car horns 
were honking as the game started. Afterward, the streets had become eerily 
quiet as the country, which had been picked by soccer legend Pele to win the 
tournament, dealt with its grief. 
</P>
<P>
 The first U.S. goal came in the 35th minute after a huge Colombian error. 
American midfielder John Harkes sent a centering pass to onrushing Ernie 
Stewart. Colombian defender Andres Escobar intercepted the pass and attempted 
to kick the ball harmlessly out of bounds. Instead, the ball bounced off his 
right foot into his own net. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart scored the second goal after racing past most of the Colombian 
defense. The entire Colombian team, noted for its creativity and superior 
skill, played in disarray. After losing its opening game against Romania, 
Colombia was under tremendous pressure to win Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 For once, the U.S. team got a boost from the home crowd, which cheered with 
gusto. Most of the fans stood and howled in the game's waning moments as they 
took in the enormity of what the U.S. team had accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even a goal from Adolfo Valencia in the 90th minute could dampen the 
enthusiasm of the crowd or the players, who raced around the field after the 
game, trailing American flags and leaping into each other's arms. 
</P>
<P>
 For the United States, the 44-year wait for a victory in the World Cup was 
over.

PADDLING BILL PUTS CONROY IN HOT SEAT OF NATIONAL DEBATE; LEGISLATURE: CRITICS 
CALL IT BARBARIC, BUT ASSEMBLYMAN SAYS IT'S COMMON SENSE. MEASURE FACES FIRST 
TEST TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Few can forget a painful childhood paddling, and Mickey Conroy is no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-century ago in his hometown among the coal fields of western 
Pennsylvania, Conroy got dragged to the principal's office for mouthing off in 
his sixth-grade classroom. The school kept two wooden paddles for meting out 
discipline -- a solid model, and another with holes bored through it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you did something really bad you got the one with the holes," Conroy 
recalls, noting the relativity of air resistance and paddle speed. "I never 
graduated to that one. But the experience made an impression on me. Those were 
lessons learned." 
</P>
<P>
 Now a white-haired Republican assemblyman from Orange County, Conroy figures 
there are more than a few California youths out there in need of a couple of 
good whacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by the controversial caning recently of an American teen-ager accused 
of spray-painting cars in Singapore, Conroy has introduced a bill to make young 
graffiti vandals subject to as many as 10 paddle strokes in juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the measure may face long odds in the Democrat-dominated California 
Legislature, as well as questions about whether it meets the tests of 
constitutional interpretation, it has already catapulted the conservative 
lawmaker to a position of national notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, television and radio stations throughout the country have 
been clamoring for a chunk of his time. He has appeared on more than 20 talk 
radio shows. The BBC has done a segment on his proposal, and so has CNN. Oprah 
and Donahue have come calling, as have "20/20" and "60 Minutes." Newsweek has 
done an item. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on probably every 50,000-watt radio station in the United States," 
Conroy says in his no-brag, just-fact style. "CNN, Pat Robertson's '700 Club.' 
You name it, I've been on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Conroy's fourth-floor office overlooking leafy Capitol Park, staff members 
have sifted through more than 400 letters mailed from spots as far-flung as 
Hawaii, Illinois and Britain. Much to their delight, the letters run 40 to 1 in 
favor of the paddling bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good work," wrote Larry Manning of Granbury, Tex. "We the people of Texas are 
on your side." Blanchard E. Roth of Mt. Morris, Mich., advised Conroy that 
"these punks need to be publicly embarrassed as well as their parents." Robert 
Lerner of Valley Center gushed: "Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! This liberal Democrat 
from San Diego County applauds you, as do most Californians who have had it up 
to here with the coddling of graffiti vandals." 
</P>
<P>
 With the bill facing its first hearing Tuesday, Conroy will need all the help 
he can get. Crime may be the hot-button issue of this election year, but 
critics of the bill are already lining up in opposition, saying Conroy's 
paddling proposal is atavistic, barbaric, the sort of shallow blathering that 
exemplifies the pathology of media politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's penal law by press release," said Franklin Zimring, a professor at UC 
Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law. "The bill's author succeeds when you write 
the story. He's looking for the same thing that the kid scratching graffiti on 
the wall is looking for -- that is, attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Tom Bates, a liberal Democrat from Berkeley who sits on the Public 
Safety Committee that will have first crack at Conroy's legislation, called the 
bill "a sadistic joke." 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to deal out punishment, but it's just so extreme," Bates said. "I 
think this whole thing is an example of publicity-seeking and there's no real 
chance the bill will survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin Hyman, a Temple University psychology professor who heads a center for 
the study of corporal punishment, worries that Conroy's proposal and similar 
ideas circulating in Florida, Maryland and Texas could begin to yank the 
country back toward a style of punishment largely abandoned decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hyman sees it, paddling of juveniles could spread to the adult penal system 
and hence to the military, where the flogging of U.S. sailors on the high seas 
was practiced through the mid-1800s. He also worries about the potential for 
sadistic abuse when society gives people power to inflict pain on others. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he cites research showing that corporal punishment can lead to 
embitterment, anger and post-traumatic stress while teaching impressionable 
youths the contradictory lesson that violence is the way to solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fought these battles in the 1800s," Hyman lamented. "Unfortunately, we 
have some Neanderthal lawmakers who want to go back to the days of the slave 
owners." 
</P>
<P>
 That a bill authored by Conroy has become the vortex of such opposition and 
adulation is somewhat remarkable. Until now, the lawmaker's three-year stint 
has been relatively placid. 
</P>
<P>
 An avuncular sort, the 66-year-old Conroy had a variety of experiences before 
coming to the Capitol. He quit school at 16 to join the merchant marine during 
World War II and went on to a 21-year career in the Marine Corps, retiring as a 
major. He moved on to private enterprise, working as regional distribution 
manager for a printing company. More recently, Conroy was at the helm of the 
nonprofit Veterans Charities of Orange County and served as president of 
California's Armed Forces Retirees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, the amiable conservative is well liked by Capitol staff as well 
as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. He is the rare politician who goes to 
political fund-raisers for partisan opponents -- and stays to the end, 
good-naturedly pumping hands and working the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 An exception to Conroy's collegiality has been his quixotic quest to have 
state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), the liberal former anti-war activist, 
thrown out of the Legislature for what the Republican considers traitorous 
behavior during the Vietnam War. Conroy, a Vietnam veteran, began his fight 
against Hayden in the mid-1980s and hasn't given up yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy is equally persistent on more prosaic legislative matters. Last year he 
sponsored more bills than any other Republican in Sacramento, and he generally 
seems driven more by the desires of constituents than headlines or politics. 
Probably the biggest stir Conroy has caused among his colleagues was when he 
formed an "on-time committee" last year to prod tardy lawmakers to be more 
punctual for floor sessions and committee hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most everyone loves him," observed Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach), Conroy's closest ally in the Legislature. "He's a throwback to that 
Irishman who might not agree with you, but he'll drink with you. He'll joke and 
be friendly, but don't cross his basic beliefs because he won't budge." 
</P>
<P>
 Such bulldog perseverance will come in handy as Conroy begins the battle for 
his paddling bill. Characteristically, he has boned up on the subject, studying 
court briefs and consulting with legal experts. In his interviews, Conroy 
tosses out alarming statistics: 118,000 juveniles were arrested for vandalism 
in 1992 nationwide, $1.2 million was spent to clean up graffiti in Santa Ana 
last year, another $500,000 was spent thwarting taggers along Orange County's 
network of flood control channels. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to underline the need, Conroy himself was recently the victim of a 
tagger. His district office in Orange was spray-painted with the words "Spank 
Me" by a wry vandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's legislative solution to graffiti is anything but voluminous. Three 
short pages spell out all the particulars of his paddling proposal: the size of 
the paddle (three-quarter-inch-thick hardwood, 18 inches long and six inches 
wide with a six-inch handle); who wields the paddle (a parent, but the judge 
can order a bailiff to take over if the parent declines or doesn't deliver "a 
satisfactory paddling"), and how many strokes (four to 10 administered through 
clothing). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bill would require the public naming of juvenile offenders 
who are paddled, a tactic designed to heighten humiliation and deter other 
would-be taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the uproar over his bill, Conroy sees lots of precedents supporting 
paddling in juvenile court. Although paddling is outlawed in California 
schools, the practice remains legal in public schools in nearly two dozen 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal scholars such as Zimring say the constitutionality of school paddlings 
is a decidedly different issue than corporal punishment for juvenile offenders, 
but Conroy argues that youngsters would be guaranteed more solid protections in 
a court of law than in a schoolroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is valid and constitutional to paddle a child in school, why would it 
be unconstitutional to have a parent paddle the child in front of a judge?" 
wonders Conroy, who says traditional forms of punishment, such as putting 
juvenile offenders in California Youth Authority facilities, are seen by 
hardened teen-agers as a "badge of honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's resolve was further buttressed when U.S. Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia -- the intellectual leader of the court's conservative wing -- 
predicted in a recent talk that caning, a far more brutal form of punishment 
than paddling, could pass the high court's muster. 
</P>
<P>
 As for arguments that paddling could harm the psyche of juvenile taggers 
brought to justice, Conroy scoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current anti-crime climate, Conroy feels he is on the right side of the 
issue -- especially in an election year. With that in mind, the assemblyman is 
convinced that the bill has a 50-50 chance of becoming law. Indeed, even some 
Democrats -- most notably Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos), chairman of the 
Public Safety Committee -- have already embraced the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to be a legislator making all those touchy-feely psychologist 
arguments about why paddling is wrong," Conroy said. "Those arguments won't 
work. People are going to just look at those lawmakers like they don't have any 
common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense is big in Conroy's list of virtues. It is largely his own life 
experiences, his own sense of what's right and wrong, that have driven Conroy 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's experiences with his own children only reinforce his bedrock belief 
that the mere specter of the paddle is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really had to paddle mine," Conroy recalled. "I had a belt that hung 
on the back of the door. There was the full understanding that if I asked them 
something, I wanted an answer. I never had to use that belt." Profile: Mickey

JUDGE DENIES SIMPSON GOT SPECIAL TREATMENT IN '89; COURTS: SENTENCE FOR 
ASSAULTING WIFE WAS THE ONE PROSECUTORS URGED, HE SAYS. TRANSCRIPTS SEEM TO 
BACK HIM. 
</P>

<P>
 Breaking a week of silence, the judge who has come under fire for allegedly 
letting O.J. Simpson off too easily on a 1989 charge of wife beating defended 
himself Wednesday, saying he gave the football star-turned-murder-suspect 
"almost exactly" what prosecutors asked for and was not "star-struck." 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Ronald R. Schoenberg -- who has become a lightning rod for 
criticism of the judicial system's handling of domestic violence -- said he did 
not give Simpson jail time because the Los Angeles city attorney's office, 
which prosecuted the case, did not ask for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, contrary to the angry assertions of prosecutors, Schoenberg said 
Simpson was not initially allowed to undergo counseling by telephone. But the 
judge acknowledged that he permitted Simpson to continue his sessions by phone 
when the retired running back moved to New York to work as a football 
broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Partial transcripts of the case, made public after Schoenberg called a news 
conference in his Downtown Los Angeles courtroom, appeared to support the 
judge, adding yet another bizarre twist to the unfolding drama surrounding 
Simpson -- charged in the slayings of his former wife, Nicole, and her waiter 
friend, Ronald Goldman -- and his previous brushes with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, instead of prosecutors pointing fingers at a silent judge, the judge and 
prosecutors are pointing fingers at one another. A matter that seemed clear-cut 
now turns on semantics, with prosecutors continuing to insist that they did ask 
for jail time -- albeit not publicly -- and the veteran judge complaining that 
critics are smearing his good name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until now, I have sat quietly by as the district attorney, members of the 
city attorney's office, legislators and reporters questioned my integrity and 
judgment based on false and inaccurate statements," Schoenberg said. "The 
sentence I gave Mr. Simpson was almost exactly the punishment recommended by 
the city attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 The bespectacled 56-year-old jurist, who was elected to the bench in 1978, 
spoke for just five minutes, reading aloud from a three-page typewritten 
statement. He said he had remained silent because he "wanted to make sure that 
my recollection of what happened was correct and that I could prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was through, he announced that he would not take any questions and 
referred reporters to the transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours later, the court made partial transcripts public -- 26 pages 
documenting bits and pieces of three 1989 hearings held before Schoenberg, one 
on May 22, another May 24 and a third Sept. 1. The records reflect a 
give-and-take between the judge and his celebrity defendant, with the judge at 
times complaining that Simpson was not carrying out his sentence properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in a position of being mean," Schoenberg tells the former football star 
at one point, "of making you do something that you don't like to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But the records do not tell the whole story, according to Deputy City Atty. 
Robert Pingel, who prosecuted the case. Pingel said that in discussions before 
the open-court proceedings, he argued repeatedly that Simpson should be jailed 
"due to the violent nature of the battery incident" and because police reports 
indicated this was not the first time Simpson had abused his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Pingel said Wednesday that he also asked for a fine, 
for Simpson to contribute money to a shelter for battered women and for him to 
perform community service and undergo therapy at a program designed to curb 
domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout those discussions," the statement said, "the judge was unreceptive 
to those arguments." 
</P>
<P>
 The transcripts, however, document only what happened in open court, and not 
behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the transcripts, when Simpson was sentenced in May, prosecutors 
asked that he be fined $200, plus a penalty, that he perform 120 hours of 
community service, that he give $500 to a shelter for battered women and that 
he attend a counseling program for men who batter their wives. Pingel also 
asked the judge to place Simpson on 24 months probation, and to have him report 
to the court every six months to see if he had fulfilled the terms of the 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge did order the $200 fine, plus a $270 penalty, as well as the $500 
payment and 120 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 To complete the community service requirement, Simpson worked raising money 
for a charity -- Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times. In September, when 
Simpson reported back to the judge, the volunteer coordinator responsible for 
supervising Simpson's case said she approved the work, even though the charity 
was not registered with her agency and it was Simpson -- and not she -- who 
selected the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing his efforts to seek corporate sponsorship for the event, Simpson 
told the judge that he flew to Atlanta to meet with Coca-Cola executives, to 
Boston to meet with officials from Reebok and to New York to talk to 
representatives of Hertz, whose car rental commercials he appeared in. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge was not impressed. "This is business. This is just not community 
service," he complained to Simpson's lawyer, Howard Weitzman. ". . . That's 
part of what he does as a celebrity." He also complained that Simpson had not 
paid his fines on time -- a lapse for which Weitzman claimed responsibility. 
The judge then ordered Simpson to perform an additional 32 hours of "regular 
community service." 
</P>
<P>
 The transcripts also show that, at the May sentencing, prosecutors asked 
Schoenberg to order Simpson to attend a special state program for men who abuse 
their spouses. Simpson balked at the program. Weitzman told the judge that the 
former football player was already undergoing counseling "not just simply for 
this situation, but also to get to the cause behind the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Denying the prosecution's request, the judge permitted Simpson to remain with 
the therapist he was using. He instructed Simpson to continue his therapy. In 
September, when Simpson moved to New York, the judge permitted him to continue 
the sessions by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Pingel has complained in interviews that the therapist Simpson used was not 
trained to help violent spouses. On Tuesday, Deputy City Atty. Alana Bowman, 
who heads the unit that handles domestic violence, declared that out of the 
20,000 cases her office handles each year, in only one -- Simpson's -- was a 
defendant allowed to undergo counseling by phone. "Something happened," she 
said, "that is not common." 
</P>
<P>
 The transcripts also reveal that by September, Simpson was tired of the 
counseling, saying he had overcome whatever problem he had. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know what else to talk about. I come in. I sit down with him 
(the therapist)," Simpson told the judge, who was ordering him to continue the 
sessions. "We start talking about other things that are happening in my life at 
this point. . . . I mean, I just don't know how long, sir, I can talk about one 
incident in my entire life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've been a great citizen," Simpson continued. "My wife has indicated 
we have a great marriage. We had one bad night in our life. . . . I think we 
all understand what happened that night, why it happened and have taken steps 
to see to it that it can never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 With Simpson facing double murder charges, the nation's attention has now been 
riveted on the issue of domestic violence and the court's handling of the 1989 
battery charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge stemmed from a New Year's Eve incident in which Simpson beat his 
former wife so badly that she sought hospital treatment. Police records reveal 
that Simpson stormed out of the house and drove off in his Bentley when it 
appeared police were going to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police have been out here eight times before, and now you're going to 
arrest me for this?" Simpson is quoted in one report as yelling to two police 
officers who were responding to a 911 call. "This is a family matter. Why do 
you want to make a big deal out of it when we can handle it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson, bruised and scratched, ran out of bushes crying: "He's going 
to kill me, he's going to kill me," one of the officers wrote. "She kept 
saying: 'You never do anything about him. You talk to him and then leave.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As details of the beating emerged, Judge Schoenberg came under intense 
criticism not only from prosecutors in the Los Angeles city attorney's office, 
but also from victims rights advocates, the news media, and Los Angeles County 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, who called his sentencing "inappropriate and 
ineffective." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has been portrayed as an example of how the judicial system fails to 
protect abused women and how celebrities receive favored treatment in the 
courtroom. The sentence imposed by Schoenberg has already sparked a wave of 
reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the Assembly has approved a resolution requiring judges to 
attend annual training sessions to learn more about domestic violence. And in 
New York, legislative leaders have agreed on a bill that would require police 
officers to arrest anyone suspected of seriously beating a spouse. Although the 
measure was in the works before the Simpson case, Gov. Mario Cuomo acknowledged 
that the case is likely to spur activity on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Schoenberg has kept out of the spotlight. A Santa Monica native, he 
is the son of the renowned Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg. The younger 
Schoenberg worked as a public defender for three years after graduating from 
law school at UC Berkeley and worked in private practice for a few years before 
being elected to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days he has refused to talk to reporters, even as he was being 
vilified in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, a reporter visited Schoenberg's Brentwood home, which is on 
the same street and a few blocks away from Simpson's house. The judge would 
only say "No!" when asked if he would comment on his handling of the Simpson 
case or whether he knows the football star. 
</P>
<P>
 In another connection, the judge's son works for the same law firm as 
Weitzman, the high-profile criminal defense attorney who represented Simpson in 
the 1989 spousal abuse charge and served as his lawyer in the first few days 
after the double murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that Schoenberg's son, E. Randol Schoenberg, began working at 
Weitzman's previous firm as a clerk some time after the judge sentenced 
Simpson, and was hired as a lawyer at Weitzman's current firm after graduation 
from USC Law School in 1991. Contacted by The Times, the son refused to discuss 
the matter. Weitzman did not return telephone calls seeking comment on how 
Schoenberg's son came to work at his firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenberg receives mixed reviews from prosecutors and defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Guarino, a former deputy city attorney who teaches law in San 
Francisco and who ran for office against incumbent City Atty. James Hahn, 
praised Schoenberg as "bright and fair and a very decent man." 
</P>
<P>
 Guarino, who once was at odds with Schoenberg over a sentence he considered 
too lenient, nonetheless complained that prosecutors have been protecting 
themselves through their harsh criticism of the judge. Guarino said that if the 
city attorney's office was so insistent on jail time for Simpson, prosecutors 
should have demanded it in open court. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do," he said, using the pronoun we even though he no 
longer works there, "is get our own office off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy City Atty. Pat Milne, acting supervisor of the West Los Angeles 
office, was one of several prosecutors openly critical of Schoenberg. "He was a 
very lenient sentencer," Milne said. "We had a lot of disagreements with him 
where we wanted jail time and he just wouldn't do it."

911 TAPE TELLS OF STORMY SIMPSON RELATIONSHIP; INQUIRY: DEFENDANT'S EX-WIFE 
PLEADS FOR HELP AS OBSCENITIES ARE SCREAMED. DEFENSE REVIEWS FORENSIC EVIDENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 On tapes released Wednesday by the Los Angeles Police Department, O.J. 
Simpson's ex-wife is heard crying and pleading for help as a man identified as 
Simpson furiously screams obscenities in the background after breaking down her 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you get someone over here now? . . . He's back. Please. He's O.J. 
Simpson. I think you know his record. . . . He showed up again. Could you just 
send somebody over here? He's in a white Bronco. But first of all, he broke the 
back door down to get in. . . . He's f------ going nuts. . . . He's going to 
beat the s--- out of me," Nicole Brown Simpson says on the tape of her 911 call 
-- made Oct. 25, 1993, eight months before she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He broke the whole back door in. . . . He came and he practically knocked my 
upstairs door down, but he pounded it and he screamed and hollered and I tried 
to get him out of the bedroom because the kids are sleeping in there." 
</P>
<P>
 In the background, a man says: "I don't give a s--- anymore." Nicole Simpson 
responds: "Would you just please, O.J., O.J., O.J., O.J. . . . Please leave." 
The man screams back: "I'm not leaving!" 
</P>
<P>
 On the tape, she describes Simpson as "ranting and raving" and "crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The tape offers a chilling peek into the tumultuous union between the former 
high school homecoming princess and the Heisman Trophy winner -- a relationship 
that prosecutors contend ended brutally when he killed Nicole Brown Simpson and 
her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman 11 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Nicole Simpson's account on the tape, the incident began after 
O.J. Simpson became upset over a picture of an ex-boyfriend in her photo album. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to press requests, police also released a tape of the 1989 
incident that led to Simpson's no-contest plea to misdemeanor wife-beating. On 
that tape, the phone is apparently off the hook and a female at the Simpsons' 
North Rockingham Avenue address can be heard screaming. There is no dialogue, 
and a police log of the incident says only: "Female being beaten . . . could be 
heard over the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities took no action after the October, 1993, emergency call because 
Nicole Simpson declined to press charges. However, during the same month, she 
contacted the unit of the city attorney's office that prosecuted her 1989 
battery case against Simpson, saying she was terrified and in fear for her 
life. According to authorities familiar with that contact, Nicole Simpson said 
there were "many, many incidents" in which Simpson had threatened her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been an ongoing, chronic, severe problem," said one authority familiar 
with that conversation. "It wasn't one time or five times. It was many times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was before 1989, it was after 1989 -- it was no secret," said the 
authority, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "She was completely 
terrorized. It was not exclusively hitting her. (It was) other things. She was 
extremely frightened and in fear for her life. Chronically. She was terrified; 
she believed he was going to kill her." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Alana Bowman, head of the city attorney's office domestic 
violence unit, said Nicole Simpson was treated like other victims of spousal 
battery. Although unable to provide specifics about Simpson's encounter with 
her office, she said Nicole Simpson "talked to one of our victim advocates over 
the years, but . . . never brought forth any criminal violations that we could 
proceed on" besides the 1989 case. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes released Wednesday, though not specifically linked to the murder 
case against Simpson, appeared to add a sobering emotional dimension to the 
public's understanding of the stormy marriage at the heart of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson's lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, could not immediately be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Shapiro and other members of the defense team were allowed 
to examine detailed evidence in the double-murder case against Simpson 
including coroner's photos, tissue and blood samples and tapes of an unusual 
three-hour interview that Simpson gave investigators the day after the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 At a courtroom hearing Wednesday, the prosecutor in the case shot down one of 
the more sensational reports in the torrent of coverage of the murders: that 
investigators had recovered a bloody ski mask and booked it into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no ski mask," Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of Americans, already drawn to the strange, twisting saga via the 
unrelenting eye of the news media, were zoomed into the courtroom and 
inadvertently allowed to eavesdrop on a private exchange between the jailed 
sports legend and the bailiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll do anything to stay out of that cell," Simpson said in a plaintive, 
personal aside picked up by a television microphone that the judge later 
sternly ordered removed. The comment -- the first personal reaction by Simpson 
broadcast since the sensational case exploded -- came as the officers tried to 
usher him from the courtroom during a break in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dark, pin-striped suit and tie-less shirt open at the collar, Simpson 
appeared more attentive and relaxed than during his first court appearance 
Monday. He said little, but no longer seemed dazed and groggy as his eyes 
scanned the spectators and reporters packed into the courtroom of Municipal 
Judge Patti Jo McKay. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the procedural hearing, the defense team, including two 
forensic pathologists, went to the coroner's office to examine evidence under 
the supervision of the coroner, Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran. The coroner 
looked on but declined to answer any defense team questions about the evidence, 
said his spokesman, Scott Carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 After a four-hour review of material in a secured, subterranean area of the 
coroner's complex, the lead pathologist for the defense team, Dr. Michael 
Baden, emerged and immediately disputed chilling reports that Nicole Simpson 
had been nearly decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no. There is none," Baden said of the near-decapitation reports as he 
made his way to a waiting cab. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the defense team at the coroner's office and in the courtroom was a 
new co-counsel, retiring Santa Clara University School of Law Dean Gerald 
Uelmen. Shapiro described Uelmen, 53, as "the foremost constitutional scholar 
in California" and said Uelmen would explore "statements that could prejudice 
or preclude a fair trial" for his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen, a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles who is considered an expert 
on the death penalty, has known Shapiro for 20 years and the two worked 
together on another high-profile slaying involving Marlon Brando's son. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles judge widely criticized for giving Simpson allegedly lenient 
treatment in a 1989 domestic battery case involving Nicole Simpson called a 
news conference to defend his handling of the case, saying that the athlete had 
received no special treatment. Judge Ronald R. Schoenberg said the city 
attorney's office agreed with a sentence that included no jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Los Angeles detective wrapped up an unsuccessful hunt for the murder 
weapon in Chicago, saying he had recovered useful evidence and witness 
statements, leaving open the possibility that investigators could return to the 
city where Simpson headed after the slayings. Among the items collected by 
investigators were a broken glass and bloodstained washcloth. Simpson has 
maintained that a cut on his hand came from a broken glass in the hotel room 
where he briefly stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Divorce court records offered new details on the financial and personal 
relationship between Nicole and O.J. Simpson. Nicole began dating the former 
sports star when she was 18 and just out of high school and moved in with him 
when she was 19, according to papers filed by her attorneys in the 1992 divorce 
case. Seeking large alimony payments to maintain a lavish, bi-coastal 
lifestyle, her attorneys portrayed Nicole Simpson as a community college 
dropout who sacrificed her own career to be a devoted companion of her 
high-profile husband, who "required that she be with him." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles County Grand Jury on Wednesday continued -- for a fourth day 
-- hearing evidence in the O.J. Simpson case in secret. Jurors are due to 
return today to hear more testimony that prosecutors apparently hope will lead 
to an indictment against Simpson and eliminate a preliminary hearing on June 
30, the day the grand jury's term expires. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, the most significant development was the acknowledgment that a 
bloody ski mask is not among the evidence against Simpson gathered by police. 
(The existence of the mask was widely reported, but the Los Angeles Times could 
not verify those reports and did not publish them.) 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro extracted the ski mask disclosure when he said in court that it was 
one of two items that had been reported by some journalists, but were not on a 
list of evidence given to him by the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when asked, he would not say what the second item is. 
</P>
<P>
 In her remarks to McKay, Clark noted that statements that Simpson gave police 
the day after the slayings were made voluntarily and that he had waived his 
right to remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she would turn over a tape-recording of those statements to the 
defense team along with any other evidence or reports the defense requested, 
including some raw notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark lost her bid, however, to videotape the defense team as it examined 
physical evidence gathered from the autopsies. But McKay allowed for someone 
from the coroner's office be on hand during the examination. In other rulings, 
McKay ordered that Simpson be provided with a cervical pillow to ease his 
discomfort from what his lawyer said is an old football injury.

DOLE CHARGES FIRST LADY WITH A 'CHEAP SHOT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a pivotal Senate committee struggling to get health care reform back on 
track, tensions boiled over Wednesday as Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) accused First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton of taking "a cheap shot" at 
Congress to win support for the Administration's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's comments marked a rhetorical removal of the gloves. Thus far, opponents 
of President Clinton's plan generally have refrained from personally 
criticizing the First Lady, who led the team that put together the 
Administration plan and who has come to personify it in the public's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that during a closed session of the Senate Finance Committee, an 
angry Dole went so far as to ask the panel to take the extraordinary step of 
publicly criticizing the First Lady for saying on national television that it 
is "only fair" that the American people should have health care benefits as 
good as those enjoyed by members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of a cheap shot, frankly," Dole said in an interview. "She's been 
doing it for weeks, and so has (the President)." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole was incensed in part because the congressional health care plan is the 
same one to which all federal employees and their families -- including the 
President and the First Lady -- belong. Federal employees have a choice of 
several insurance plans, with Blue Cross being the most popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Added one GOP aide: "She throws it around like a challenge: Here are these 
guys ripping off the system, and leaving you guys with nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The new, more personal tone in the health care debate reflects the 
make-or-break point that the deliberations have reached, as well as lawmakers' 
sensitivity to the low regard the public now has for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole also suggested derisively that Hillary Clinton has attempted to disguise 
old-fashioned partisanship by coming up with such terms as "conviction 
politics" in rallying Democrats to the President's health care plan. That, he 
said, was the appeal she made to Democratic senators during a luncheon meeting 
Wednesday on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady made the comment about lawmakers' health insurance in response 
to a question from NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw during a program on health care 
broadcast Tuesday night. Dole also appeared on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said Wednesday he plans to offer an amendment to the health care bill 
that would require members of Congress, the President and the First Lady to pay 
for their own health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) indicated 
that he was prepared to go along with the proposal to criticize Hillary 
Clinton, a source said, until committee Democrats argued it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Caputo, a spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton, said the First Lady was 
mystified at Dole's anger because many in Congress have made a similar 
argument. "We don't quite understand why he is so upset. (Senate Majority 
Leader) George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said the same thing," Caputo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a day after indicating that his committee cannot begin drafting a 
health care reform bill until the middle of July, Moynihan abruptly changed 
course and said the panel would hold its first public "markup" on Monday. It is 
still far from certain, however, that it can finish before Congress' July 4 
recess, as lawmakers had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 Although five congressional committees are charged with producing health care 
legislation, the Finance Committee is considered the most crucial battleground 
because its membership is most reflective of the Senate at large. House members 
are watching it just as closely as their Senate counterparts because they fear 
taking any difficult stands on the issue before they have some idea of what the 
Senate will do. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope for a consensus now appears to ride on an informal group of moderate 
Democrats and Republicans. The group has been meeting feverishly in an effort 
to present the committee with a proposal that could claim broad bipartisan 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving along, but I tell you, it is tough," said Sen. John H. Chafee 
(R-R.I.), who is considered the group's leader. 
</P>
<P>
 As described by participants in the effort, the approach under discussion is a 
complicated one that would first give the market a chance to work by putting 
into place reforms aimed at making health insurance more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 If at least 95% of the public did not have insurance by the year 2002, a 
government-appointed commission then would make recommendations for other means 
of expanding coverage. And if Congress did not accept that proposal, 
individuals would be forced to buy health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the proposal raises as many questions as it seeks to answer. For 
starters, there is no evidence that the idea of requiring individuals to pay 
for insurance would be any more acceptable than the President's proposal to 
force businesses to pay for it. The proposal is also expected to include large 
tax increases on business, which would be used to help subsidize individuals 
who could not afford coverage.

GREENSPAN CALLS ECONOMIC OUTLOOK BRIGHT; MARKETS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, in a strikingly optimistic 
mood, declared Wednesday that the outlook for the economy "is as bright as it 
has been in decades." 
</P>
<P>
 His comments came as financial markets calmed after Tuesday's declines, with 
stocks and bonds recouping some of their losses and the dollar rebounding in 
value against foreign currencies. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said that 
the United States and its industrial partners were prepared to intervene to 
support the dollar, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's value closed in New York on Wednesday at 100.85 yen, compared to 
a Tuesday close of 100.35. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 16.80. Bond 
prices rose, too, driving down the interest rate for the key 30-year Treasury 
bond to 7.4%, from 7.49%. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this week's market turmoil, which had seen the dollar fall on Tuesday 
to its lowest level against the Japanese yen since World War II, Greenspan 
offered a resolutely upbeat review of the economy. "Economic activity has 
strengthened, unemployment is down and price trends have remained subdued," he 
told a meeting of the House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan's cheerful rhetoric was unusual because the central bank chief 
usually cloaks his comments in tones of neutral obscurity. Against a background 
of widespread talk of possible additional rate hikes, he was implicitly 
defending Fed actions this winter and spring as adequate to head off any 
resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts have been saying that markets are jittery because investors 
expect another boost in interest rates by the Fed, which already has raised 
rates four times this year. But the thrust of Greenspan's remarks was that the 
Fed has done its job. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of some raw materials are rising. But because wages are increasing so 
slowly, there are no significant changes in the prices for finished goods, 
Greenspan said. And business is boosting its spending to expand production, a 
step that has the double benefit of adding jobs and improving efficiency at 
U.S. corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, we are in the midst of a capital spending boom, as companies strive to 
modernize existing plants and add capacity," the Fed chairman said. Spending 
for computers and high-tech communications devices "has been particularly 
strong, stimulated by waves of technological improvement and rapidly expanding 
opportunities for the application of these technologies," Greenspan added. 
</P>
<P>
 With new equipment, business can enjoy increased productivity -- a greater 
value of output by each worker -- generating more wealth for the economy 
without driving up prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed chairman said long-term interest rates are "higher than they should 
be," because of the sometimes unwarranted nervousness of investors. "There 
remains a significant inflation premium, embodied in long-term interest rates, 
reflecting a still-skeptical world financial market view that American fiscal 
and monetary policies retain some inflation bias," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to discuss the volatile performance of the dollar against foreign 
currencies, other than to tell the committee that he and Bentsen "have been 
following developments closely." Later in the day, Bentsen issued a statement 
saying that the United States, in concert with the other G-7 industrial powers, 
"continues to be prepared to act as appropriate," holding open the possibility 
of steps to buy dollars to strengthen the currency. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dollar's rebound Wednesday apparently took place without any concerted 
action by governments. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, speaking briefly at a White House photo session with King 
Hussein of Jordan, said that the financial markets eventually would be calmed 
by the underlying soundness of the U.S. recovery. "I think we just have to keep 
working on our fundamentals and know that in the end that the markets will have 
to respond to the . . . realities of the American economy," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan said the Fed's maneuvers to hike interest rates, starting in 
February, were vital to temper the economy's expansion and prevent a future 
resurgence of inflation. If short-term rates had remained low, Greenspan said, 
"we would have engendered a degree of inflationary instability destructive of 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite higher rates, the economic expansion continues, the Fed reported 
Wednesday in the latest issue of its "beige book," a nationwide survey of the 
business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing shows strength in most regions, and home sales "continued at a 
strong pace," the Fed reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, suffering through a long and persistent recession, "economic 
conditions are reported to be improving slowly," according to the report. 
"Manufacturing activity still is mixed, as weakness is reported in the 
aerospace industry while improvement is expected by some Silicon Valley firms." 
</P>
<P>
 Residential construction, according to the Fed, is "reported flat in Northern 
California, improving in Southern California, and down from earlier levels in 
the Central Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Budget Committee hearings, Democrats were pleased and Republicans 
irked as Greenspan declared that the Clinton Administration budget package 
adopted last year was successful in helping reduce the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan also said, to the enthusiasm of Democrats and dismay of Republicans, 
that the increases in personal tax rates for higher-income Americans had no 
short-term damaging impact on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) accused Greenspan of steering Fed 
policy "hand-in-glove with the Clinton Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed decision-making process "whether it produces lower rates or higher 
rates at any given time must be seen as an integral part of the Clinton game 
plan," Cox said. "It could even be argued that the Federal Reserve's 
independence has been compromised." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan responded by insisting that the Fed must work in consultation with 
the White House while retaining its independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be a coordinated policy between the executive branch and the 
central bank because there is one economy," Greenspan said. "It is an art form, 
not a science. I am very well satisfied (with) the way it has worked out 
between myself and the secretary of the Treasury."

RUSSIA JOINS NATO 'PEACE PARTNERSHIP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid solemn vows to avoid the errors of history, the principal enemies of the 
Cold War -- Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- pledged 
themselves Wednesday to "a far-reaching cooperative relationship" in defense 
and security matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The vows came as Russia joined the alliance's "Partnership for Peace" program, 
ending months of uncertainty. When Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev finally 
signed the program's framework document at an official ceremony here, it was 
welcomed as a major event. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a defining moment in shaping the security of our continent," declared 
NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Balanzino. "We must not repeat the 
mistakes of Europe's past. Our main objective remains a new Euro-Atlantic order 
of security with the active participation of Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in Washington, President Clinton also hailed the accord's signing, 
saying, "Today Russia took an important step to help shape a safer and more 
peaceful post-Cold War world." 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev's trip to NATO headquarters here came just two weeks after Moscow 
entered a cooperative agreement with the Organization of Economic Cooperation 
and Development -- a group of 24 rich countries -- and on the eve of Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin's scheduled signing of an important economic and 
political accord with the 12-nation European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russia-NATO cooperation is seen as the most important element of this 
larger, intensive diplomatic effort aimed at binding Moscow firmly into the 
community of democratic nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The severe economic turmoil unleashed by Russia's free-market reforms, coupled 
with appeals by ultranationalists such as Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky for Russia to 
sever its Western ties, have raised fears that Moscow might once again be 
tempted to turn its back on the West and go its own way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, we are taking another decisive step toward banishing Europe's historic 
divisions," declared Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who witnessed the 
signing. 
</P>
<P>
 He met later with Kozyrev, and at a news conference, the two gave the 
appearance of wanting to work closely on global issues, including North Korea 
and the continued search for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's decision to join the Partnership for Peace program commits Moscow to 
work closely with NATO in key military areas, including planning, training and 
exercises for possible joint peacekeeping missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow and its former archfoe also issued a statement after the signing 
ceremony, stating they had agreed to pursue "a broad, enhanced dialogue," with 
political consultations and information-sharing on important security matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a written statement was seen as a significant concession to Moscow, which 
had fought hard to be granted a special status by NATO -- something the 
Russians believed essential for the biggest, most powerful country to emerge 
out of the former Soviet empire and the nation expected to become the sole 
custodian of the Soviet nuclear deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of the partnership negotiations, Moscow had initially sought a 
direct voice in NATO decision-making. When that failed, it pushed hard for a 
formal consultative role before finally settling for the looser formula of 
"political consultations, as appropriate, on issues of common concern." 
</P>
<P>
 NATO, eager to engage Moscow but not to be swallowed in the process, tried to 
avoid a statement of any kind that defined the political relationship in 
writing. Two weeks ago, at a meeting of foreign ministers from NATO and most of 
the former Warsaw Pact countries in Istanbul, Turkey, the Russians held up 
agreement on a final communique for more than five hours by insisting on minor 
wording changes, apparently to show their displeasure with terms offered under 
the partnership program. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that ill will was visible Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia is the 21st formerly neutral or Soviet Bloc nation to join the 
partnership program, an idea conceived by the Clinton Administration to offer 
closer cooperation, but not full membership and the security guarantees that go 
with it, to the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these countries, such as Poland and the Baltic states, expressed 
concern that a strong Russia-NATO accord could lead to another division of 
Europe into spheres of influence similar to the Cold War division agreed to at 
the Black Sea resort of Yalta in early 1945 by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. 
"Since we strictly exclude any idea of zones of influence, such a relationship 
has nothing to do with some kind of NATO-Russia condominium or a Yalta II," 
said Balanzino. 
</P>
<P>
 For many at NATO headquarters who had spent their careers working up defenses 
against Moscow's formidable military might, it was difficult to absorb what 
actually was unfolding before them. Kozyrev echoed those sentiments, saying, 
"Things that were unthinkable two years ago have now become virtually a routine 
matter in bilateral cooperation and military exchanges." 
</P>
<P>
 At a separate news conference at the Russian Embassy on Wednesday afternoon, 
Christopher said he and Kozyrev had developed "a common approach" toward a U.N. 
resolution for sanctions against North Korea, if Pyongyang continued to flout 
international controls on its nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said the United States and Russia were also continuing to work 
closely to end the Bosnian war. He said that talks among American, Russian and 
EU officials were advancing and that their working group would meet again next 
Thursday to agree on incentives and consequences to entice the warring parties 
to accept an imposed settlement.

U.S., N. KOREA TO REOPEN TALKS; ASIA: WASHINGTON WILL PUT SANCTIONS DRIVE ON 
HOLD IN RETURN FOR PYONGYANG'S SUSPENSION OF NUCLEAR PROGRAM. ACCORD IS 
'OPPORTUNITY TO FIND A SOLUTION,' CLINTON SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The United States and North Korea took a major step away from crisis on 
Wednesday, with the Clinton Administration agreeing to reopen direct 
negotiations and suspend its drive for sanctions in return for North Korea's 
pledge to freeze its nuclear program and allow international monitoring of its 
reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord is the "beginning of a new stage in our efforts to pursue a 
non-nuclear Korean Peninsula," President Clinton said, announcing the talks' 
reopening. "These developments mark not a solution to the problem, but they do 
mark a new opportunity to find a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's announcement firmed up an offer that North Korean leader Kim Il 
Sung made to former President Jimmy Carter during his visit to Pyongyang last 
week. White House officials had expressed caution about Carter's announcement 
that North Korea would freeze its nuclear program and had insisted on seeing 
the pledge in writing directly from the Pyongyang government. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms, the North Koreans pledged not to place any new fuel in their 
nuclear reactor or to begin reprocessing of fuel rods withdrawn from the 
reactor last month. Reprocessing would free plutonium that could be fashioned 
into nuclear bombs. The freeze would last until the completion of the new round 
of talks, expected to begin early next month in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Koreans also agreed to allow continued international inspections and 
monitoring of their facilities, which American officials say will allow the 
freeze to be verified. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agreement does not resolve the issue of North Korea's past 
nuclear-related actions. The CIA believes North Korea has acquired enough 
plutonium, diverted from its reactor in 1989, to make one or two nuclear 
weapons, although North Korea has never conducted a nuclear test. 
</P>
<P>
 The new talks will let American officials answer a critical question -- 
whether Kim's regime has pursued a nuclear program to build an arsenal at any 
cost or whether the program is a bargaining chip to be traded away in return 
for international recognition and economic aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad outlines of a possible deal in Geneva are already clear. The United 
States wants North Korea to relinquish its capability to make nuclear weapons. 
In exchange, North Korea would like diplomatic relations, economic help, new 
technology for peaceful nuclear power and some form of security guarantees from 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, in an interview on Cable News Network, hailed the possibility of such 
a deal, saying "this was one of those perfect agreements where both sides won." 
</P>
<P>
 But pessimists in the longstanding debate over North Korea believe the 
negotiations will end in frustration, as past rounds have. Even as the White 
House celebrated a rare piece of foreign policy good news, others were quick to 
denounce the new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), for example, asserted that the 
Administration had agreed to "throw in the towel" by reopening talks. "There is 
no basis in history or experience to believe more talk and more delay will 
limit North Korea's nuclear ambitions," Dole said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The pessimistic view is that, after a delay of a few months, the United States 
and its allies may once again be forced to discuss some form of collective 
action against North Korea; Pyongyang, meantime, will have bought more time to 
develop its program. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the cynical camp have long argued that North Korea has no intention 
of giving up its nuclear program. They contend that Kim wants weapons for their 
own sake -- to ensure his regime's survival and, perhaps, to help achieve the 
long-cherished goal of reunifying the Korean Peninsula by force. That would be 
the only means of overcoming South Korea's huge and embarrassing victory over 
North Korea in the economic sphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The top priority for American officials in the talks will be to see if North 
Korea will agree to make its program freeze permanent and verifiable -- 
effectively putting an end to the threat that the North will begin to develop a 
full arsenal of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 One element of an agreement would be American assistance for North Korea's 
stated desire to obtain a new, light-water nuclear reactor to replace its 
graphite reactor. Graphite reactors breed a ready source of plutonium that can 
be diverted to weapons, while light-water reactors do not. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program can be capped, American officials would then turn back to the 
issue that until recently had dominated U.S.-Korean tensions -- whether North 
Korea already has weapons. Until Carter's visit to Pyongyang, the 
Administration had insisted that tracking North Korea's past behavior would be 
a precondition for new talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's removal of fuel rods from the reactor destroyed the most readily 
available evidence of the amount of plutonium that may have been diverted. The 
only way now to determine what occurred is through "special inspections" of 
sites where nuclear material may have been stored or dumped. 
</P>
<P>
 In their letter, delivered to American officials Wednesday afternoon, the 
North Koreans pledged, "in the context of an overall solution, that they will 
fully implement the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the (International Atomic 
Energy Agency) safeguards," a senior Administration official told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials interpret that to mean an agreement to abide by special 
inspections. But the official conceded that the Administration cannot be sure 
North Korea meant that. Until now, the North Koreans have steadfastly refused 
to allow special inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's announcement capped a period in which the United States and North 
Korea seemed to be moving inexorably toward a military confrontation. Tensions 
mounted rapidly after the removal of the fuel rods and the Administration 
announcement that it would pursue sanctions. North Korea has warned repeatedly 
that it would regard sanctions as an act of war. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible this escalation may have caused Kim -- who ordinarily leaves 
day-to-day management of North Korean affairs to his son, Kim Jong Il -- to use 
the Carter visit as a chance to turn around the policies of the North Korean 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington specialists who follow the North Korean press say there are signs 
that the elder Kim, 82, may have improvised during the Carter visit, doing 
things not part of the regime's original game plan. Carter said Wednesday that 
lower-level North Korean officials seemed surprised by the amount of time Kim 
spent with him and the pledges he made. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatively, some analysts suggest, there was no turnaround, and Kim planned 
this all along. North Korea is famous for what American policy-makers call 
"salami tactics" in negotiations -- cutting issues in thin slices and 
repeatedly adding new conditions that can later be given up in exchange for 
concessions from the other side.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: FAMILY TIES BIND ON DEATH PENALTY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a teen-ager, Kathleen Brown would wait for her father to go to bed, then 
sneak down the spiral staircase of the old Governor's Mansion and read his 
thick black briefing book on the latest death penalty case. 
</P>
<P>
 She'd stare at grisly photographs of the victim, the crime scene and the 
killer on Death Row. She'd read the horrifying details and the letters from 
families -- from the victim's demanding retribution and from the condemned's 
pleading for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never forget those death penalty days," she told reporters Tuesday, 
standing solemnly in the living room where her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, 
had agonized over life or death decisions from a mustard-colored chair. 
</P>
<P>
 She could tell when another execution was approaching because she'd arrive 
home from school to find chanting demonstrators in her path. One evening, as 
she walked up the back steps with her father, an elderly woman in tears grabbed 
the governor and begged him to spare her son. 
</P>
<P>
 She vividly recalls attending the opening ceremonies of the 1960 Winter 
Olympics at Squaw Valley as a 14-year-old, how joy suddenly turned to fright 
when thunderous boos greeted the introduction of her mother. Bernice Brown was 
there representing her husband, who had just stayed the execution of "Red Light 
Bandit" Caryl Chessman. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, her father sent 36 people to the gas chamber and granted clemency to 
23 others, a record. He tried twice to abolish the death penalty. The issue 
severely damaged his political career. It left him vulnerable to attacks from 
Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the face of all of that," his daughter reminded, "he stood firm in 
his personal opposition. It was a value passed on to me that was so strong and 
powerful, I could no more contemplate being politically correct on this issue 
than contemplate disavowing my family . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I oppose it because my father taught me it was wrong and the religious 
experiences I had reinforced that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For an hour, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee bared her soul. She revealed 
details of her formative years and offered insights into her Catholic faith. 
But she never could explain to reporters specifically what it was her father 
taught was wrong about the death penalty -- or how it violated her religious 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 And my conclusion was that Brown's opposition to capital punishment is rooted 
primarily -- if not totally -- in deep devotion and intense loyalty to her 
father, now 89 and ailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Brown opposed the death penalty on the grounds that it did not deter 
murderers, it clogged the courts and was enforced unfairly. But "those are not 
my reasons," his daughter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very hard for me to talk about because there is no neat and tidy 
way . . . I can't give you a black and white answer . . . It is a gut thing." 
She said her father's advice on the issue was to "follow the gut." 
</P>
<P>
 As for deterrence and "all the other arguments," she said, "I can argue those 
either way . . . It's a deterrent to the person who is executed." 
</P>
<P>
 Is she troubled by the state's taking of a life? "No . . . I am not speaking 
as a theologian . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I am speaking about values that suffused my upbringing. They were in part 
Catholic. And they were very much values that I learned from my family and 
particularly, in a very personal way with respect to the death penalty, from my 
father . . . In fact, the church itself is divided." 
</P>
<P>
 She opposes capital punishment, Kathleen Brown indicated, because to support 
it would be tantamount to repudiating her father. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, I asked Brown why she opposed the death penalty and her reply 
was "that's irrelevant" because she would enforce it. After finally hearing her 
answer, I'm inclined to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, she sounded like a death penalty supporter. She has always 
understood -- partly because of those old briefing books -- why the public 
demands capital punishment, she said. "I would feel the same way if anyone 
harmed my children or my grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 As a crime-fighting tool, the death penalty itself is virtually irrelevant. 
There have been only two executions in Gov. Pete Wilson's term, none in George 
Deukmejian's two terms. There are 383 murderers stacked on Death Row. Any blame 
rests with the federal appeals system and has nothing to do with Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be refreshing if the gubernatorial campaign were fought over some 
legitimately important issues -- how to combat gangs, create jobs and improve 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the death penalty is a comforting symbol for too many voters. It is 
Brown's position, rather than answers, that leaves her vulnerable to Wilson. 
And he'll hound her -- as Nixon and Reagan did her father.

BAN ON LAGUNA TOLLWAY CONSTRUCTION EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A ban on building a toll road through Laguna Canyon was extended at least 
through September when a U.S. appeals court Wednesday issued an injunction 
allowing the road's opponents time to prepare a suit claiming federal officials 
illegally approved the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-page ruling by a three-judge panel from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco was a significant setback to the San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor Agency, which is building the tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 The injunction affects only a 4.4-mile link between Newport Coast Drive and El 
Toro Road that cuts through the environmentally sensitive Laguna greenbelt, 
including Laguna Canyon, and 1.7 acres owned by UC Irvine. Plans for the 
thoroughfare call for it to stretch for 17 miles from San Juan Capistrano to 
Newport Beach when completed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the appellate court ruling raised doubts about the tollway agency's 
plans to finish the six-lane toll road on schedule. Work on the disputed 
segment of roadway that bisects the Laguna greenbelt has been halted since 
Sept. 7, when a U.S. District Court judge in Santa Ana issued a preliminary 
injunction against construction at the request of environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge lifted the injunction June 14, and transportation officials 
immediately dispatched bulldozers to the site. Opponents, led by Laguna 
Greenbelt Inc., quickly countered by sending protesters to the construction 
site, and lawyers for environmental groups went to the federal appeals court 
the same day to contest the lifting of the injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 15, an appeals court justice temporarily stopped the bulldozers. 
Attorneys for the tollway agency petitioned the court to let work resume. A 
judicial panel from the appeals court denied the petition Wednesday, but 
ordered a hearing in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate ruling means that construction will not have been allowed in the 
area for a year. Transportation officials said construction delays cost about 
$5 million each month, and they said taxpayers will eventually have to pick up 
the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joel Reynolds, attorney for the environmental groups that sued to stop 
construction, said the delays and additional costs could have been avoided if 
the tollway agency and Federal Highway Administration had followed U.S. 
environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't be embroiled in this if they had complied with the law in the 
first place," Reynolds said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Local transportation officials tried putting on the best possible face when 
told of the appeals court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "While it is disappointing that the court did not lift the injunction, we are 
pleased that there will be a hearing on this matter in just a few weeks," 
William Woollett Jr., chief executive officer of the tollway agency, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the project said the Federal Highway Administration violated 
environmental laws when it approved construction of the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, environmentalists argued that federal officials should have filed 
a supplemental environmental impact report after a massive fire burned a large 
part of the Laguna greenbelt in October.

'REAL COWBOYS DON'T WEAR BASEBALL CAPS'; IN 50 YEARS OF RANCH WORK AND RODEO 
RIDING, HARLEY MAY HAS SEEN PLENTY; 'I LIKE THE OLD DAYS BEST,' HE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trail boss Harley May first sensed trouble when one of his volunteer cowboys 
showed up for the cattle drive wearing a baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, shortly after 60 head of cattle began the trek from San Juan 
Capistrano to a rodeo site in Rancho Santa Margarita on a sunny day last month, 
one of the weekend cowpunchers -- a local Rotarian in real life -- tumbled his 
mount into a gully. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to use ropes to get the horse out and, fortunately, nobody was hurt," 
May said, shaking his head. "Now, some of those guys were real city slickers. 
Real cowboys don't wear baseball caps." 
</P>
<P>
 Tall and lean as a fence post, face darkened and weathered by more than 50 
years of working outdoors on ranches and competing in rodeos across the 
country, May knows a real cowboy when he sees one. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say there are two kinds of cowboys today -- working cowboys who spend 
their time on the ranch, and professional cowboys who enter rodeos for cash 
prizes. The 68-year-old May, a three-time national rodeo champion and a cowboy 
legend, has been both. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes him so unique," said Gilbert Aguirre, manager of 
40,000-acre Rancho Mission Viejo in south Orange County, where May works as a 
"cowboy consultant." 
</P>
<P>
 "He pioneered the modern rodeo and in his era was probably the best 
competition cowboy going down the road," Aguirre said. "But he's really a ranch 
cowboy who happened to be a rodeo cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on the porch of the modest one-story home he shares with his wife, 
Lynn, May reflected that "working cowboys are part of a lifestyle that's 
vanishing along with the big private cattle ranches." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started rodeo in 1953, most of the cowboys were real working cowboys. 
Now there aren't very many working cowboys at all in the rodeo." 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to some cattle grazing in a nearby meadow, May said, "Today's rodeo 
cowboy would have no idea how to gather a herd and move 'em. It's nothing you 
can get out of a book. You just have to get out and do it." 
</P>
<P>
 A past president of the National Rodeo Cowboys Assn., May stays in touch with 
rodeo by serving as chairman of the association's rules committee and judging 
local competitions. He plans to work at least one rodeo later this summer in 
Costa Mesa or San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 In his day, May was one of the best rodeo cowboys to ever strap on a pair of 
chaps, rodeo aficionados say. 
</P>
<P>
 He started tossing 1,600-pound steers to the ground at a time when people 
still put rodeo in the same class as Wild West circus shows. 
</P>
<P>
 May was one of the first rodeo cowboys to graduate from college -- today, 
cowboys pour out of several colleges and trade schools in the Southwest that 
offer competitive rodeo classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot's license in hand, May was also one of the first "flyboys," hopping by 
plane to as many as seven rodeo competitions in a single weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 May's home is like a museum, filled with photos, awards and other memorabilia 
from his rodeo career. 
</P>
<P>
 Most striking are the bronze statues, frozen moments of frenzied action 
showing a cowboy hanging on to a bucking bronco or grabbing a steer in a 
headlock -- all tributes to May taken from action snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen the whole spectrum (in rodeo), starting from the '50s and '60s," 
May said. "Rodeo today is more popular than ever. The top rider won about 
$250,000 last year," contrasted with May's largest annual winnings of $34,000 
in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to compare the two eras, May ruminates for a moment before deciding, "I 
like the old days the best. There weren't as many people in rodeo, and we knew 
each other pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to know people a lot more personally. Even though we competed against 
each other, we'd exchange tips and information about the horses and steers." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was in his early 20s, Jim Charles traveled the rodeo circuit with May. 
They competed in front of sparse audiences perched on rickety bleachers at 
dusty little towns throughout the West and before a packed arena in New York 
City's Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harley was like a big brother or a father to me," said the 58-year-old 
Charles, an Oakdale resident who guides hunters and anglers in the wilderness 
outside the Sacramento area. "Everybody respected Harley because he went to 
college and was always reliable." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the trophies in his house, one in particular shows the steel of May's 
personality. Retiring from active participation in the rodeo circuit in his 
mid-30s, May kept chasing after the one major title that eluded his grasp: the 
Calgary Stampede steer wrestling championship. 
</P>
<P>
 He finally won the title, at age 47. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harley's from the old school," Aguirre said. "He will absolutely do what he 
says he's going to do. If he says he'll meet you at the North Pole on New 
Year's Eve in 1999, he'll be there."

WILSON CHASTISED ON BUDGET IN WASHINGTON; GOVERNMENT: CLAIMING STATE PROGRAM 
ENCOURAGED ILLEGAL INFLUX, SEN. BYRD SAYS BLAMING U.S. FOR IMMIGRATION COSTS IS 
HYPOCRITICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson came under a prolonged, blistering attack from one of the 
most powerful members of Congress on Wednesday for his use of "overblown" 
rhetoric in blaming California's budget crisis on the federal government's 
failure to pay costs associated with illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), chairman of the influential Appropriations 
Committee, chastised the Republican governor for about 30 minutes during a 
daylong hearing to explore the financial burdens created by illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd suggested that Wilson had no business criticizing Congress for passing 
laws that may encourage immigrants to enter the country illegally when the 
state's Department of Health Services last year actively urged undocumented 
pregnant women to apply for a publicly funded program to pay their medical 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd simply suggest, governor, that we lower our voice just a little bit with 
respect to the fault of the federal government in its mandate and take a good 
look-see at what our own state agencies are doing to see if they're enforcing 
the law," Byrd told Wilson, a former colleague in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was flanked by the governors of Florida and Arizona at a witness table. 
Afterward, Wilson told reporters that the promotional program, called 
"BabyCal," was "unauthorized" and corrected this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that it was a waste of time, frankly," Wilson said of Byrd's line 
of questioning. "What we ought to be doing is focusing on the fact that federal 
failure continues to provide this massive flow of illegal immigrants into my 
state and the other states." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's appearance before the Appropriations Committee marked the fifth 
time in six months that Wilson has traveled to Washington to lobby for federal 
reimbursement and complain that the Clinton Administration is not doing enough 
to solve California's budget woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson announced Wednesday that West Hills Community College in Coalinga is 
being made available to the federal government as a second federal center to 
quickly train and deploy Border Patrol agents. Congress last year approved 
funding for 1,010 new agents in the Southwest by the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Wilson said he was satisfied that the three governors had 
persuaded the Senate panel that large border states have unfairly shouldered 
the financial burden of providing health, educational and incarceration 
services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they knew there was a problem, but I think they were shocked to learn 
of its dimensions," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson urged Congress to act swiftly to reimburse California the more than $3 
billion he claims it spends annually on illegal immigrants and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only question is: When will the federal government accept its 
responsibility and how will they act to solve this crisis? Let me tell you, 
it's imperative that we see action this year," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 No such action appears forthcoming. Byrd warned all three governors at the 
hearing -- Wilson, Democrat Lawton Chiles of Florida and Republican Fife 
Symington of Arizona -- that little in discretionary funds will be available 
over the next five years to pay for illegal immigration costs. 
</P>
<P>
 After the committee heard statements from the three governors, Byrd zeroed in 
on Wilson, who seemed caught off guard by his hostile approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd began by calling attention to blown-up posters of promotional literature 
printed in 1988 by the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health that 
said, "Medi-Cal has good news for pregnant women. You do not need to be a 
citizen to get Medi-Cal." 
</P>
<P>
 Using the same language that Wilson employs to describe how federally required 
benefits draw illegal immigrants across the border into California, Byrd said 
of the brochure, "Isn't it a kind of magnetic lure?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson tried to explain that San Bernardino County officials were acting 
independently of the state and discontinued the flyers in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Chairman, I'd be happy to respond," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm not ready yet," Byrd replied to a roomful of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you are, I'd be happy to respond," Wilson added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll call on you," Byrd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd then produced a 1993 brochure by Wilson's California Department of Health 
Services titled "BabyCal." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is 1993. That brochure asked the question, Can you get Medi-Cal? If you 
are pregnant, you can get Medi-Cal even if you are not lawfully in the U.S., 
you are not a U.S. citizen, you have applied for amnesty, you were denied 
Medi-Cal in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd asked, "Now do you believe that this brochure might encourage illegal 
aliens to cross our border for prenatal care?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson assured Byrd that the brochure was "not authorized" and he did not know 
it had been distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Byrd: "Well, how does a state agency get away with that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very good question," Wilson said. The governor noted that the 
information was inaccurate because the program is restricted to California 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), no great ally of either Byrd 
or Wilson, tried to come to Wilson's defense. "I suspect the governor may be 
told one thing while another thing is going on," Feinstein offered. But when 
the California senator attempted to continue, Byrd cut her off, saying, "No, 
not on my time." 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman then continued to grill Wilson. "Were you not aware, governor, 
that the state health department was putting out this information in Spanish as 
well as English?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, exasperated by the questions, expressed bewilderment at the point Byrd 
was trying to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point of the question is that states as well as the federal government 
must act together to reduce the attraction of the United States for illegal 
immigrants," Byrd said.

SCANDAL OVER TAPES WIDENS IN COLOMBIA; LATIN AMERICA: LOSER IN PRESIDENTIAL 
VOTE DEMANDS WINNER STEP DOWN IF DRUG-MONEY CHARGES PROVE TRUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid a widening scandal, the loser in Colombia's presidential election 
Wednesday demanded that President-elect Ernesto Samper step down if allegations 
that drug money financed his run for office are proven true. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the country wants is the absolute tranquillity that its president is a 
clean president," Andres Pastrana told a packed news conference following the 
discovery of taped telephone conversations in which two of the world's biggest 
cocaine traffickers discuss deals and money to be offered to the Samper 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper, of the ruling Liberal Party, has denied that his campaign received 
dirty money. But the explosion of this scandal just days after his election 
Sunday threatens the credibility of a government that must prove it is not 
beholden to leaders of the mighty Cali cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations revived fears in the international community, and especially 
in Washington, that drug influence has permeated Colombian society and is 
steadily undermining this country's besieged democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials have been critical of the Colombian government's failure to 
fight the Cali cartel with the same force as it fought the notorious Medellin 
cartel, whose leader Pablo Escobar was slain by police last December. Samper 
has indicated that he will not alter the government's policy of plea-bargaining 
with Cali drug bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia supplies much of the world's cocaine. The multibillion-dollar 
business is dominated by the Cali cartel, which, in contrast to the brazenly 
violent Medellin cartel, extends its power more subtly through corruption, 
bribery and infiltration of government circles. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials and some Colombians have long expressed concerns that the 
traffickers would use their huge fortunes to influence the presidential 
election, then be well-positioned to pull strings in the new government. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters this week obtained tape recordings of three telephone conversations 
between two heads of the Cali cartel, brothers Gilberto and Miguel Angel 
Rodriguez Orejuela, and Colombian journalist Alberto Giraldo, who has been 
linked frequently to the cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 Giraldo on Wednesday confirmed that he served as the cartel's go-between with 
the campaigns, although he claimed they did not take him up on the offers of 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
 What is remarkable and chilling about the tape is to hear men whom American 
law enforcement officials have branded as two of the world's largest cocaine 
traffickers discuss -- calmly, in cavalier fashion and in the language of 
street thugs -- how to influence the election of a president and future 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, how's it going with Samper, man?" one of the brothers, thought to be 
Miguel Angel, says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in your hands," Giraldo responds. "Look, the truth is they need 5 
billion (pesos), of which they have two. They need three, from you all." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's available," Rodriguez Orejuela says. "It's set." 
</P>
<P>
 Three billion pesos is equivalent to $3.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Giraldo is more explicit: "The presidency depends on you all," he tells 
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela. 
</P>
<P>
 The cartel bosses, according to the tape, apparently expected to cut a deal 
with Samper's defense minister and may have been seeking other government posts 
for cronies. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape also implicates Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, former head of the secret 
police and ostensibly one of Colombia's chief players in the war against 
narcotics. Giraldo seems to suggest Maza also took drug money. Maza ran 
unsuccessfully for president in the first round, then backed Samper. He said 
the charges were slanderous. 
</P>
<P>
 The authenticity of the voices on the tape was confirmed Wednesday by the 
Defense Ministry and the National Police. How the tape was recorded remains 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper said he would cooperate with an investigation already under way by the 
state prosecutor general, Gustavo de Greiff. He said he would make his campaign 
contribution books available and fire anyone in his campaign who is proven to 
have accepted dirty money. 
</P>
<P>
 De Greiff has been a principal target of American criticism for what 
Washington officials consider his leniency toward traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper's assurances were not expected to satisfy Pastrana or law enforcement 
agencies. "It is not enough to open the campaign's accounting books," Pastrana 
said. "Colombian public opinion, as well as the community of nations, awaits 
the assurance, which I am sure Dr. Samper will make, that, if it is proven that 
the president-elect's campaign received money from drug trafficking, he will 
resign from his public mandate, because he would have a flawed credential." 
</P>
<P>
 Pastrana said an unidentified man outside a hotel in Cali gave the candidate a 
copy of the tape last week. Pastrana handed it over to President Cesar Gaviria 
and Defense Minister Rafael Pardo, who promised an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastrana confirmed that his treasurer, Hernan Beltz, received an offer of 
money from the Cali group but said it was rejected. On the tape, Rodriguez 
Orejuela seems to suggest Pastrana's campaign accepted other drug money, but 
Pastrana denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Gelbard, U.S. assistant secretary of state for narcotics matters, told 
the Associated Press the reports were "the worst kind of information we could 
receive."

U.S. FREEZES ASSETS OF ALL HAITIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton ordered U.S. financial institutions Wednesday to freeze 
assets of all Haitians residing in Haiti, widening an economic stranglehold 
once limited to military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton signed the executive order late Tuesday.It was transmitted to banks 
and other institutions before the business day began. Sealing off bank accounts 
is part of Clinton's plan to force military leaders to reinstate ousted 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has not ruled out a military strike, but U.S. officials fear that it 
would be difficult to extract U.S. troops from the nation even after a 
successful invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 About 600 military leaders and their supporters were barred earlier this month 
from access to their money in U.S. bank accounts. And Clinton previously barred 
all financial transactions between the United States and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a loophole for Haitians not in the military: They could transfer 
their money to a non-American bank and reclaim it. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeze -- which forbids transfers, withdrawals and any other transactions 
-- applies to all deposits in foreign and domestic branches of American 
banks.ECONOMIC SANCTIONS

FRANCE WINS U.N. OK FOR RWANDA PLAN; AFRICA: FORCE WILL TRY TO END MASSACRES. 
FIRST TROOPS TO LAUNCH MISSION TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A divided Security Council, wary of making things worse yet desperate to end 
the horror, authorized France on Wednesday to lead a military force into Rwanda 
to stop the massacres that have left several hundred thousand civilians dead in 
the midst of a tribal war. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, Defense Minister Francois Leotard said the first few hundred French 
troops will launch "Operation Turquoise" this morning. He said France will 
contribute 2,000 to 2,500 troops. Senegal has pledged to augment this with an 
undisclosed number of its troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's Security Council vote reflected the world body's unease about a 
Rwandan mission. France managed to muster only one more than the nine votes 
required for the resolution. Five nations -- China, Nigeria, New Zealand, 
Brazil and Pakistan -- abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Their stated objections were twofold: that the intervention should be led by 
the United Nations, not France, and that one of the warring groups -- the rebel 
Rwandan Patriotic Front -- says it regards the resolution as a declaration of 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Madeleine Albright, the American ambassador to the United Nations, voted for 
the resolution and hailed France for its "bold . . . initiative" and "noble 
offer to lead the world community in dealing with the tragedy in Rwanda." 
</P>
<P>
 "The tales of butchery . . . become almost mind-numbing," she said. "But we 
cannot afford to become numb to this tragedy, for it is still unfolding before 
our eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her praise, the French intervention, if successful, could prove 
embarrassing to the Clinton Administration. Using Rwanda as the test case of 
the Administration's stringent new policy on peacekeeping, Albright forced the 
Security Council in mid-May to put conditions on its authorization of a U.N. 
peacekeeping mission of 5,500 troops. U.N. officials believe that the obvious 
lack of American enthusiasm for a U.N. intervention crippled Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali's attempts to recruit troops for the mission then. 
</P>
<P>
 His failure prompted France to offer to send its troops for two months while 
the United Nations organizes its own mission. The French intervention is 
unhampered by the conditions -- such as approval from warring parties and 
signing of a cease-fire -- imposed on the United Nations by the United States. 
A successful Operation Turquoise would be regarded as persuasive evidence that 
the Administration's conditions were unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The massacres erupted in Rwanda when the presidents of Rwanda and neighboring 
Burundi, both members of the Hutu tribe, died in a suspicious plane crash in 
April. The Hutu-dominated army and gangs of Hutu extremists then began a 
slaughter of the minority Tutsi tribe and of Hutu politicians willing to share 
power with the Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front then swooped down from the north 
to battle the Hutu army, taking over perhaps half of the tiny, hilly country in 
Central Africa. Weeks of civil war have produced massacres of Hutus by the 
rebels as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels oppose the intervention because France has been a major supporter 
and arms supplier of the Hutu-dominated government. 
</P>
<P>
 But French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee told the council: "The French 
initiative has an exclusively humanitarian goal. . . . Our objective is simple: 
Help the threatened civilians, end the massacres and do it all in an impartial 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 countries voting in favor of the resolution were France, the United 
States, Rwanda, Britain, Russia, Oman, Spain, the Czech Republic, Djibouti and 
Argentina.

OPPOSITION TO TRY OUSTING JAPAN COALITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending a political truce that was called to allow the passage of Japan's 1994 
budget, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party committed itself Wednesday to 
submitting a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
</P>
<P>
 The party's five top executives and its General Affairs Committee approved a 
proposal by Yohei Kono, president of the party that ruled Japan from 1955 until 
last summer, to seek the ouster of Hata's minority coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Kono asserted that the coalition lacks a mandate and acted "irresponsibly" in 
trying to retain power while holding only 37% of the seats in the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 Kono was entrusted with deciding when to submit the no-confidence motion after 
the long-delayed 1994 budget is given final approval by the upper house, an 
action likely to occur today. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of a no-confidence motion is not assured, and the possibility remains 
that Kono will back down if he fails to win support from the Socialists, who 
walked out of the coalition April 26 immediately after electing Hata prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists, who now hold the crucial votes in any showdown between the 
government and the Liberal Democrats, launched talks Wednesday with leaders of 
Hata's coalition. The parties sought to work out agreement on key policies as 
the price for the Socialists' return to the fold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the hurdles are too high. Agreement is possible," Yuichi 
Ichikawa, secretary general of the coalition's Buddhist-backed Clean Government 
Party, said after the meeting. Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's chief strategist, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wataru Kubo, the Socialists' secretary general, also paid a call on Liberal 
Democratic leaders to explain his party's policy demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Socialists reach a policy agreement with Hata's forces, the party 
has demanded that Hata resign before it returns to the government. Such a move 
would force the lower house of Parliament to vote again to choose a prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 In negotiations conducted before the Clinton Administration announced a 
breakthrough Wednesday in the North Korean nuclear inspections standoff, the 
Socialists had insisted that any new coalition reject possible sanctions 
against North Korea and limit itself to "dialogue and persuasion" to solve the 
issue of Pyongyang's suspected development of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hata refused, Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama declared, his party 
would join in supporting a no-confidence motion, then form a "caretaker 
government" with the Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, the combination would give the two parties 276 votes, 20 more than a 
majority. But both parties, archrivals throughout the Liberal Democrats' 
38-year rule, face the possibility of intraparty rebellions. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, who toyed with the idea of bolting 
the Liberal Democrats to join the coalition in April, said he and his faction 
will abide by the party's decision to submit a no-confidence motion. 
</P>
<P>
 But he promised to seek Kono's ouster as party chief if the motion fails to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of a no-confidence motion would threaten to force a dissolution of the 
lower house and a general election in the midst of U.S.-Japanese negotiations 
to set up a new "framework" to reduce Japan's global current account surplus of 
$131 billion and establish rules for trade between the two nations. It also 
would weaken Japan's standing at the annual economic summit of the world's 
seven major industrial democracies in Naples, Italy, from July 8 to 10.

JAPAN ADMITS TO WWII LABOR ABUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Japanese government Wednesday acknowledged for the first time that it 
forced tens of thousands of Chinese to work in Japan under brutal conditions 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the existence of the forced-labor program was widely known, the 
Foreign Ministry had refused to accept it, maintaining that documents with 
evidence were burned after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is regrettable that it caused pain to the Chinese people," Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa told a parliamentary committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's admission followed a Foreign Ministry investigation begun last year 
when a Chinese resident of Tokyo, Chen Kungwang, publicized documents given to 
him by a Foreign Ministry official. The official had kept the documents secret 
for 40 years, disobeying orders to destroy them. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents showed 38,935 Chinese were forcibly brought to Japan to work in 
mines and factories between 1943 and 1945.

MEDICINE; THE NEW PILL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This fall, 2,000 volunteers will begin testing the abortion pill in up to a 
dozen sites around the nation, a critical step in attempts to gain its 
acceptance in the United States. Abortion rights advocates hope that the pill, 
known as RU 486, will be a cheaper, safer alternative to the surgical 
procedure. Opponents contend that the pill is dangerous for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Argument For 
</P>
<P>
 "RU-486 is a one-two punch. It changes forever the terms of the abortion 
debate and it dramatically increases abortion access for women. This is a 
victory not only for women but for health care. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eleanor Smeal, The Feminist Majority Foundation 
</P>
<P>
 Argument Against 
</P>
<P>
 "RU-486 kills an unborn baby who's heart has started to beat, has killed and 
injured women, and can deform an unborn baby who survives the abortion 
attempt." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Richard Glasow, National Right to Life. How RU 486 Works 
</P>
<P>
 When a woman in pregnant, her body produces progesterone. Receptors recognize 
the presence of this hormone, thus preventing the shedding of the uterine 
lining.

 . . . and the body sheds the lining along with the fertilized egg just like

<P>
 If the woman does not abort within 48 hours, she is given a second drug, 
prostaglandin, which induces contractions to expel the remaining contents of 
the uterus. 
</P>
<P>
 UTERINE LINING HOW RU 486 COMPARES TO SURGERY 
</P>
<P>
 RU 486 
</P>
<P>
 When it can be done: First seven weeks of pregnancy.

 Procedure: First visit, is to confirm pregnancy. Second visit, the first pill 
is given, no waiting required. If the woman has not aborted, a second drug is 
given and the woman stays at the office for four hours, during which time she 
usually aborts. 
</P>
<P>
 Side effects: Cramping, bleeding, abdominal pain, nausea. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: The price of the drug has not been determined. In France, it is the 
same as first-term surgical abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can perform / administer it: All doctors who are licensed to evaluate and 
preform abortions. 
</P>
<P>

LAWMAKERS REJECT YELTSIN'S ANTI-CRIME PLAN AS TOO HARSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia's Parliament sent President Boris N. Yeltsin a resounding nyet 
Wednesday, voting overwhelmingly to reject a presidential anti-crime plan that 
foes say would wipe out many hard-won new constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a crime wave that has terrorized and enraged many Russians, lawmakers 
protested that Yeltsin's harsh cure smelled too much of the odious practices of 
Soviet days. 
</P>
<P>
 His June 12 decree would allow police to detain suspects for 30 days without 
charges; search offices, cars and passengers without warrants, and inspect bank 
records of those suspected of organized crime without obtaining a court order. 
It would also make evidence gathered by wiretapping admissible in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exactly how it all began in the '30s," said radical nationalist 
lawmaker Sergei N. Baburin, referring to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's reign 
of terror. "We all know what this finally led to." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stalin-era terror was heralded by a 1934 law-and-order decree that made it 
easier to convict criminals. The campaign is believed to have claimed the lives 
of at least 20 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, outnumbered democrats in the 6-month-old Duma, the lower house, 
found themselves -- to their astonishment -- agreeing with Communists and 
nationalists in the 279-10 vote. Parliament lacks the power to override a 
presidential decree, but Yeltsin's staunchest allies voted to ask him to 
suspend the anti-crime measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebuff came even as Yeltsin scored big international gains. In Washington, 
Russian officials announced that a Clinton-Yeltsin summit will be held in 
September; in Brussels, Russia at last signed the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization's "Partnership for Peace" accord -- with a side treaty that gave 
the fallen superpower bragging rights to much of its lost prestige. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in what appeared to be a trial balloon, Vladimir F. Shumeiko, 
leader of Parliament's upper house, told various news organizations that 
Yeltsin and parliamentary leaders had agreed "in principle" to postpone the 
1996 elections for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Rybkin, leader of the lower house, initially said he liked the idea but 
on Wednesday told Russian television that it should be treated with caution. 
The constitution that Yeltsin begged voters to adopt six months ago calls for 
presidential and parliamentary elections in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumeiko has supported Yeltsin's most unpopular decisions. When Yeltsin 
dissolved the old Supreme Soviet in September and promised to run for 
reelection this month -- then changed his mind after his foes were defeated -- 
Shumeiko took to the hustings to defend the president. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate reaction to Shumeiko's statements from the Duma, which 
was preoccupied with forcing Yeltsin to revise his crime plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Former dissident Sergei Kovalyov, chairman of the Human Rights Committee, 
called the president's decree an intolerable violation of the civil rights 
guaranteed by the new constitution. Kovalyov, who was sent to labor camp for 
defending Andrei D. Sakharov, the late Nobel laureate and human rights 
activist, said Russia has a bad tradition of letting doctors, not patients, 
write laws on health care -- and police, not citizens, draft criminal codes. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited an instance, in the Volga republic of Bashkortostan, in which police 
were recently permitted to detain suspects for 30 days after a state official 
was slain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five hundred suspects were detained in a town of 35,000," Kovalyov said. 
"Three of the suspects tried to commit suicide, and two quite independently of 
each other pleaded guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nikolai I. Travkin, leader of the conservative Democratic Party of Russia, 
called Kovalyov one of "God's fools." 
</P>
<P>
 "They would let half the country be shot in the street but not a single 
criminal's human rights may be violated," he said. "Today we will not conquer 
crime by normal, civilized methods. It is overwhelming us." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's decree took a drubbing in Moscow's most influential newspapers. One 
of its only backers was Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn, the famed, Nobel 
Prize-winning author who returned to Russia last month from exile in Vermont 
and is now lamenting the moral decline of his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Neo-fascist lawmaker Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, predictably, denounced the 
Yeltsin decree as insufficiently tough. He said he would introduce his own 
Draconian plan Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's promise to crack down on "criminal filth" followed a bloody spring 
of bombings, killings, kidnaping, hostage-taking and hijacking, as well as 
street crime -- which has grown all too common here. 
</P>
<P>
 One Yeltsin aide warned lawmakers not to discredit themselves by appearing to 
be soft on crime; both sides promised to seek compromise. The Kremlin and Duma 
are each at work revising the unwieldy Soviet-era criminal code.

NATIONHOOD ON MIND OF BELARUS VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT BIVENS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of presidential elections that may determine if this nation remains 
independent, the editor of its largest newspaper complained about the new 
red-and-white flag. "It's too nationalistic," said Igor N. Osinsky, editor of 
Sovietskaya Belarossiya. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does the 700-year-old heraldic mounted knight, recently retrieved from 
history's dustbin, inspire the editor to patriotism. "We don't like warlike 
symbols," he said. "No one knows who that armed horseman is, or where he's 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 Where indeed? Belarus has tried its hand at independence for three years, and 
many citizens think it just isn't working out. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters today will elect the country's first president. Six candidates are 
running -- four pro-Russian Communists and two independence-minded nationalists 
who back free-market reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The main issue that divides them is Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich's plan to 
abandon the Belarussian currency, return to the Russian ruble and let Moscow 
control its former subject's monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are actually heading toward a sort of annexation (by Russia), and I cannot 
agree to it," said Stanislav Shushkevich, 60, the former Belarussian leader who 
is running against his old subordinate Kebich for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 While nationalist movements raged in other former Soviet republics, Belarus 
had only a token independence movement. But in August, 1991, Belarus' 10 
million citizens suddenly found themselves in an independent nation the size of 
Utah, wedged between Poland, Russia and Ukraine, as well as Latvia and 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
 Kebich, who took over from Shushkevich in January, is considered the 
front-runner, trailed by Alexander Lukashenko, a gravel-voiced collective farm 
chief who has made a name as a corruption fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Minsk was turned upside down when Lukashenko accused Kebich of 
trying to have him killed. "A foreign-made car flew past us and fired two shots 
into the back seat, where I was sitting," Lukashenko told reporters Saturday. 
"I'm convinced it was Kebich." 
</P>
<P>
 The government says Lukashenko concocted the assassination attempt to get 
attention. "It's a pretty obvious hoax," said security spokesman Pyotr Snopok. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this feud, Kebich, 58, and Lukashenko, 40, had been considered allies. 
Both back the monetary union with Russia that was signed in April and awaits 
ratification by both countries' parliaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Belarus last year reluctantly introduced its own currency, but its ruble is a 
sore spot. Everyone calls it "the rabbit," because the baby blue one-ruble note 
sports a smiling hare in mid-leap. There are also green three-ruble beavers and 
pale pink half-ruble squirrels. 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbit isn't worth much. In the past three months alone, it has lost 
three-quarters of its value against the American dollar and the Russian ruble. 
Meanwhile, prices here have risen 21-fold in the past year, while industrial 
output is half what it was in Soviet days. 
</P>
<P>
 Belarussians attribute their economy's collapse to Russia's new policy of 
making them pay full price for oil. In Soviet days, Belarus' factories were fed 
a steady diet of cheap energy and materials. Today, Russia still gives some 
energy subsidies to domestic factories, but foreigners like the Belarussians 
are charged world market prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Monetary union with Russia would change that. Belarus would be offered raw 
materials at cheaper, Russian prices. Citizens would also be allowed to swap 
weak rabbits for stronger Russian rubles at a rate of one to one -- a steal 
given today's rate of 12 rabbits per ruble. 
</P>
<P>
 Shushkevich, who as chairman of the Supreme Soviet ran Belarus for two years 
before Kebich allies ousted him in January, said Kebich seeks union with Russia 
to hide his mismanagement of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Shushkevich and Zenon Poznyak -- a dissident famous for his grim determination 
to catalogue crimes of the Stalin era -- are the only candidates who actively 
oppose the ruble-zone treaty. Kebich calls them Belarussian nationalists and 
says either's election would bring discord and civil war.

5 REPORTED KILLED IN MEXICO PRISON RIOT 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least five inmates were killed and five injured in a second spate of 
rioting this month at a Mexican prison just south of the U.S. border, a 
newspaper reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence broke out Tuesday night, and one person reportedly was decapitated, 
La Cronica said. Officials refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The rioting may have been sparked by a feud among prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Three people were injured in rioting at the prison June 6, and a standoff 
lasted until June 15. Inmates won the dismissal of the prison's warden at the 
prison in Mexicali, just south of Calexico, Calif.

INDONESIA CLOSES 3 NEWSMAGAZINES FOR VIOLATING PRESS RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Indonesia, in one of the most repressive steps toward its press in years, has 
closed its three leading newsmagazines after the government said they 
overstepped official restrictions on the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 The Information Department, which must license all publications in the 
sprawling island nation, announced that it has revoked the permit for Tempo, 
the country's biggest news weekly; DeTik, a rapidly expanding tabloid, and 
Editor, another newsmagazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Information Director General Subrata, who in the Javan tradition uses only one 
name, said Tempo lost its license because of its news content, while the other 
two weeklies were banned for "administrative" reasons for failing to operate 
within the terms of their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The closures, announced Tuesday, come after a period of relative openness in 
Indonesian media, during which newspapers and magazines began subtly to 
criticize government actions while refraining from any direct criticism of 
President Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear what precipitated the crackdown. But Indonesia is undergoing 
labor and social unrest, which climaxed in May in riots in the Sumatran city of 
Medan. 
</P>
<P>
 With a population of 180 million spread over more than 13,600 islands, 
Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim country and the most populous country 
in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Indonesia has come under severe international criticism for 
human rights abuses, especially in the former Portuguese territory of East 
Timor, where government troops opened fire on a crowd in November, 1991, 
killing between 100 and 180 people.

FDA PANEL REOPENS DEBATE ON HOME AIDS TEST KITS; MEDICINE: ADVOCATES SAY THE 
HOME TESTING COULD SAVE OR PROLONG LIVES. OPPONENTS FEAR ABUSES AND EVEN 
SUICIDES WITHOUT COUNSELING GIVEN BY CLINICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration Wednesday reopened the controversial debate 
over whether to approve home AIDS test kits, an idea that was rejected four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 During a daylong hearing before the agency's blood products advisory 
committee, advocates predicted that the availability of a home test kit would 
encourage more people to be tested -- thus prolonging or saving additional 
lives -- while opponents argued that the kits hold the potential for abuses, 
possibly even dire consequences, particularly in the absence of face-to-face 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests do not work like home pregnancy tests, in that results are not 
immediately available. They are, in fact, home collection kits, meaning that an 
individual takes a blood sample at home, mails it to a lab and then calls a 
week later for the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Testing is all we have, testing is what we must do," said former Surgeon 
General C. Everett Koop, a consultant to Direct Access Diagnostics, a 
subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, developer of the leading test kit. "We cannot 
only triple the volume of people who are tested, but we can do it without 
government budgets and without government bureaucracies." 
</P>
<P>
 But Marion Brown, director of HIV counseling and testing for the Whitman 
Walker Clinic, a gay and lesbian health services center in Washington, warned: 
"I shiver when I think of people getting tested for HIV without the benefit of 
face-to-face pretest counseling and then receiving their test results over the 
phone." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is not expected to make a recommendation immediately. Although the 
FDA is not bound by the committee's advice, it typically wields considerable 
influence in the agency's final decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA acknowledges that the climate toward the idea has begun to change. 
Many who initially had opposed the concept of AIDS home testing have said they 
now believe that the potential benefits are greater than the risks and that the 
availability of testing kits could fill critical gaps that now exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Many clinics, backed by federal funding, offer free or inexpensive tests to 
those who cannot otherwise afford them. But the wait for an appointment often 
can be as long as six weeks, with another several weeks before results are 
available. Approval of home testing would not affect the existing system. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the kits said that they offer an opportunity for privacy that 
the clinics -- or personal physicians -- do not provide, especially for those 
who live in small towns or rural areas. Also, the kits would make testing 
easier for individuals who cannot obtain transportation, child care or even 
time to get to a clinic, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, they cited statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention that show 24% of those who thus far have failed to be tested would 
use such a kit. 
</P>
<P>
 CDC figures also indicate that a significant percentage of people who undergo 
testing fail to receive the appropriate counseling under the current system, 
the proponents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Fisher, the prominent Republican who heads the Family AIDS Network, was 
infected by her late husband, whom, she said, never took the test. She said 
that knowledge of his infection might have prevented her from becoming 
infected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder whether such an option (the home kit) might have saved my life," she 
told the panel. "Two out of three people at risk have never been tested. I can 
put a name on one of them. His name was Brian. We shared a marriage and two 
sons and eventually one virus." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these arguments, critics of the kits said they were worried that the 
impersonal nature of the process would result in an increased risk of suicide 
among HIV-positive individuals, or that children or teen-agers would use the 
test without understanding its implications.

51% OF RAPE VICTIMS ARE GIRLS UNDER 18, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Girls younger than 18 are victims of more than half the rapes reported to 
police, and the younger the victim, the more likely the attacker is a relative 
or acquaintance, the Justice Department reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls younger than 12 are the victims in 16% of reported rapes, according to 
the estimates from the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics.One in five 
victims younger than 12 is raped by her father. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics bureau, using police reports from 11 states and the District of 
Columbia, said girls younger than 18 were the victims in 51% of rapes in 1992, 
even though girls of that age made up only 25% of the female population. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate data from 1991, the bureau said family members or acquaintances 
accounted for 96% of rapes of girls younger than 12 in a three-state survey and 
for 94% in a survey of state inmates convicted of rape. The percentage of rapes 
by strangers increases as the age of the victims increases, which experts said 
reflects the more sheltered lives of younger females.

ABORTION COVERAGE INCLUDED IN HOUSE PANEL'S HEALTH BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The House Ways and Means Committee voted by a larger-than-expected margin 
Wednesday to include coverage for abortions in its version of the health care 
bill, although advocates on both sides of the controversial issue said the real 
showdown will come later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal by Rep. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) to bar abortion services except in 
extremely limited circumstances was rejected, 23 to 15, mainly along party 
lines. Four Democrats voted to restrict abortion coverage while three 
Republicans voted against Bunning's amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a final vote on this matter," Acting Chairman Sam Gibbons 
(D-Fla.) said in advance of the committee's action. "This is a very 
controversial question." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other congressional panels -- the Senate Labor and Human Resources 
Committee and the House Education and Labor Committee -- previously have voted 
to provide coverage for abortions in their versions of the health reform 
legislation sought by President Clinton. But efforts to exclude or restrict 
access to abortion are expected at every stage of the legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got more votes than we expected," said Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly (D-Conn.), 
a committee member who lobbied her colleagues on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 As Rep. Gerald D. Kleczka (D-Wis.) put it: "I might not like abortions, but 
they are legal." Kleczka earlier had proposed an alternative plan to give 
insurance companies the option of refusing to provide abortion services, but it 
was rejected, 33 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
 In another test of strength, the committee rejected, on a 22-16 roll call, a 
move by Rep. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) to keep state laws regulating abortion -- 
such as waiting periods, parental consent rules and restrictions on terminating 
pregnancies in the last trimester -- from being preempted by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ways and Means panel adopted, 20 to 18, a proposal by Rep. Fred Grandy 
(R-Iowa) to include hearing aids for children in the standard benefits package. 
Although Gibbons pleaded with Democrats not to approve any additional benefits 
without finding revenue to pay for them, the panel did just that on Grandy's 
amendment after voting down his plan to provide the estimated $100 million 
needed by making slight reductions in subsidies for small business.

EXERCISING WITH WEIGHTS FOUND TO AID ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Researchers at Tufts University have found that frail people in their late 80s 
and 90s get around more quickly, climb stairs better and sometimes even throw 
away their walkers after a few weeks of lifting weights to strengthen their 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
 The study suggests that one reason the elderly grow chair-bound is that their 
muscles are weak from lack of exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Evan Hadley, associate director for geriatrics at the National Institute 
on Aging, recommended that nursing homes start exercise programs similar to the 
routine used by the Tufts group. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, published in today's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, 
involved 100 men and women who appeared to be typical of frail nursing home 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Their average age was 87, and about one-third were in their 90s. Half were 
demented, and many suffered from a variety of other ills, including arthritis, 
lung disease and high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 They were randomly assigned to participate in ordinary nursing home activities 
or to work out vigorously for 45 minutes three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who exercised increased their walking speed by 12% and their ability to 
climb stairs by 28%. Four who needed walkers to get around became able to walk 
with just a cane. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who worked out were also less depressed and more likely to take 
part in nursing home activities.

FAA TRYING TO TRACK AVIATORS WITH TAINTED FUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 1,000 Northern California small-plane pilots bought contaminated 
Chevron fuel last month, and officials were still trying to track down several 
dozen aviators. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration emphasized Wednesday that no crashes have 
been traced to the fuel, which was improperly mixed last month at Chevron's 
Richmond refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of right now, contaminated fuel is not suspected in any of the accidents 
that have occurred since May 16," agency spokesman Hank Verbais said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is tracking down purchasers through plane tail and credit card 
numbers recorded at airports where the fuel was delivered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 16, a leaky valve at the Richmond refinery allowed kerosene-based jet 
fuel to blend with low-lead gas used in propeller planes, Chevron Inc. 
spokesman Mike Libbey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial batch was about one-third jet fuel, but was sold for propeller 
planes at Sacramento's Metro and Executive airports. 
</P>
<P>
 A much-less contaminated mix was also sent to Oakland, Petaluma, Watsonville 
and Buchanan Field in Concord. On May 31, a pilot reported engine roughness and 
the smell of kerosene, Libbey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company investigated and notified the FAA the next day. The Sacramento 
tanks were emptied, but tanks at other airports were found to be within 
acceptable limits, Libbey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger arises from the reduced octane level, which can cause poor 
combustion and clog the engine, said Scott Erickson, an investigator with the 
National Transportation Safety Board.

 Following are partial transcripts of two 911 calls Nicole Brown Simpson made 
to police on Oct. 25, 1993, from her townhouse: 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: Can you send someone to my house? 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: What's the emergency? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: My ex-husband has just broken into my house and he's ranting and 
raving outside in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: Has he been drinking or anything? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: No. But he's crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: Did he hit you?

<P>
 Nicole: Nicole Simpson. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher puts out domestic violence call for any patrol car to respond to 
the address at Gretna Green Way. About 50 seconds later, Nicole Simpson called 
back:  
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: Could you get somebody over here now, to . . . Gretna Green. He's 
back. Please. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: What does he look like? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: He's O.J. Simpson. I think you know his record. Could you just send 
somebody over here? 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: What is he doing there? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: He just drove up again. (She begins to cry.) Could you just send 
somebody over? 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: What is he driving? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: He's in a white Bronco, but first of all he broke the back door down 
to get in. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: Wait a minute, what's your name? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: Nicole Simpson. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Nicole: Yeah.

threatening you? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: He's f------ going nuts (sobs) . 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: Has he threatened you or is he just harassing you? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: You're going to hear him in a minute. He's about to come in again. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: OK, just stay on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: I don't want to stay on the line. He's going to beat the s--- out of 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: Wait a minute, just stay on the line so we can know what's going 
on until the police get there, OK? OK, Nicole? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: Uh-huh. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: Just a moment. Does he have any weapons? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: I don't know. He went home. Now he's back. The kids are up there 
sleeping and I don't want anything to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: OK, just a minute. Is he on drugs or anything? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: No. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: Just stay on the line. In case he comes in I need to hear what's 
going on.

</P>
<P>
 Nicole: He came and he practically knocked my upstairs door down but he 
pounded it and he screamed and hollered and I tried to get him out of the 
bedroom because the kids are sleeping in there. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher: Um-hum. OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole: He wanted somebody's phone number and I gave him my phone book or I 
put my phone book down to write down, the phone number that he wanted and he 
took my phone book with all my stuff in it.

TALKING TO POLICE LIMITS DEFENSE, EXPERTS SAY; COURTS: SIMPSON'S INTERVIEW THE 
DAY AFTER THE KILLINGS 'WAS A COLOSSAL MISTAKE,' ACCORDING TO ONE LAWYER. NO 
MATTER WHAT HE SAID, IT RESTRICTS HIS ATTORNEY'S OPTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When O.J. Simpson's lead lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, went to court Wednesday, 
one of the first things he requested was a tape of his client's 3 1/2-hour 
interview with Los Angeles police officers last week before Shapiro was on the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson spoke with investigators June 13 against the advice of his first 
lawyer, Howard Weitzman. And legal experts say that interview could have a 
dramatic impact on his defense, no matter what he said and regardless of his 
innocence or guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson locked himself into a statement before his lawyer could explore the 
case with him, said Loyola law professor Laurie Levenson. 
</P>
<P>
 That easily could come back to haunt him, several experienced criminal lawyers 
said. "The prosecution now has that statement as a potential weapon," West Los 
Angeles criminal lawyer Harland W. Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your client wants to talk (to police), you chain him to your desk at your 
office!" Braun exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 If Simpson deviates from the statement in any way, he can be impeached and his 
credibility questioned, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the legal experts contacted by The Times cautioned that they do not know 
what Simpson said and emphasized that he is entitled to the presumption of 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 However, whatever Simpson said will have a serious effect on his attorney's 
range of options, Los Angeles criminal lawyer Bradley W. Brunon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without that interview, Shapiro would be playing on a much more open field and 
could be more creative in his strategy, without having to worry about a 
possible "credibility deficit," Brunon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro has declined to make any comments about his strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark said in court Wednesday that Shapiro would be 
given the tape promptly. However, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's 
office said late Wednesday that she did not know if a copy of the tape had been 
turned over. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark also said in court that the interview had been conducted "with full 
waivers." According to the landmark Supreme Court decision of Miranda vs. 
Arizona, before the police can question an individual in custody, they must 
advise him of his right to remain silent and that any statements he makes may 
later be used against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite any waivers by Simpson, his defense lawyers may still attempt to keep 
out of evidence any statements he made to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman did everything but physically restrain Simpson from talking, 
according to sources. They said that Weitzman spent nearly an hour attempting 
to keep Simpson from talking to LAPD detectives, but the former football star 
said he had nothing to hide. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Weitzman would only confirm that he advised Simpson not to talk 
to the police, but would not discuss anything else about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman has said that the press of other cases and his long personal 
relationship with Simpson prompted him to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources said Weitzman was stunned and angered by Simpson's decision to 
speak with police, and dropped out of the case soon thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal lawyers from Los Angeles to New York said they were shocked that 
Simpson talked to the police, and that Weitzman was not present when he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a colossal mistake," said Los Angeles criminal lawyer Danny Davis, who 
successfully represented Ray Buckey in the McMartin Preschool molestation case. 
</P>
<P>
 For Simpson to go "in front of a very hostile LAPD was a terribly bad error," 
said William Kunstler, a New York lawyer who has represented prominent murder 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case in particular, there was no benefit to your case to talk," said 
attorney Paul Harris, who won several high-profile cases in the 1970s and is 
now teaching at New College of Law in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason is to look good to the media, and you could have done that by 
having your lawyer say, 'My client authorized me to say he is innocent,' " 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Simpson "had a perfect reason to just go into seclusion," 
because his former wife had just been brutally killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The day Simpson was interviewed by the police, Weitzman told reporters that 
Simpson was innocent. "He had nothing to do with this tragedy. He is in shock," 
Weitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 What Simpson said in those 3 1/2 hours is known to only a few people, and they 
are not talking. 
</P>
<P>
 But, whether Simpson is innocent or guilty, he now has to live with what he 
told Detectives Tom Lange and Phil Van Atta. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things that experienced homicide detectives do . . . are to ask an 
individual they suspect questions that inherently carry knowledge about 
physical evidence," said Davis, who added that he knows and respects both of 
the detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under pressure, all (an innocent suspect) can do is wiggle and equivocate, 
when they are trying to look as though they are innocent . . . and try to help 
and they can't. All they do is compound suspicion about their culpability," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levenson said the lengthy interview also gave the LAPD detectives an 
opportunity to observe Simpson's demeanor, which would aid them in evaluating 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, she said, their observations of him the day after the killings could 
be critical if his attorney eventually decides to mount a defense asserting 
temporary insanity or claiming that Simpson acted in the "heat of passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, there still has to be an explanation made about why a defendant, 
who initially claimed to be innocent, later would admit to the crime and seek a 
lesser penalty, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecution . . . would use the fact that he talked for that long a time 
(to police) to show that he was rational enough to make up things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the pitfalls, several lawyers said Simpson's statement to police may 
not turn out to be a fatal mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage need not be irreparable," Levenson said. "Any statement he made 
could be explained as a statement made by a man in shock."

TAINTED BEEF IS TRACED TO EARLIER OUTBREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An outbreak of illnesses in San Luis Obispo County last month has been traced 
to ground beef contaminated with the same strain of the E. coli bacteria that 
was linked 18 months ago to 500 illnesses and four deaths on the Pacific Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercooked hamburgers sold at a fast-food restaurant chain caused most of the 
illnesses in the original outbreak. The latest victims bought the contaminated 
ground beef at three Vons supermarkets in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Department of Agriculture investigators found that Vons Meat Service 
Center in El Monte supplied the meat to the three markets. The El Monte 
facility serves as a central distribution point for the chain's 344 markets in 
California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 The E. coli illnesses were confined to the San Luis Obispo area and no other 
incidents have been reported, according to Vons spokeswoman Julie Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamburgers reportedly eaten by three children at their homes came from Vons 
markets in Atascadero, Santa Maria and Los Osos. The three San Luis Obispo 
County children who became ill . . . have been treated at hospitals and 
released," said Terry Medley, acting administrator for the USDA's Food Safety 
and Inspection Service in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 People stricken with E. coli typically experience nausea and abdominal pains 
and, in the advanced stage, bloody diarrhea, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by the USDA and the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention found that the same Vons Meat Service Center also supplied some of 
the contaminated beef to Jack in the Box restaurants during the January, 1993, 
outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Vons closed the facility within the Vons Meat Service Center that 
produced the beef patties for Jack in the Box, and the chain no longer produces 
patties for other companies, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 The USDA has yet to determine the slaughterhouse, feedlot or ranch where the 
beef in the San Luis Obispo outbreak originated, Medley said.

1994 LOS ANGELES TIMES; ALL-VALLEY BASEBALL TEAM; COACH OF THE YEAR; A CLASS 
ACT TAKES A CURTAIN CALL; MIKE MAIO: DURING TRYING TIMES, HE OFFERED A STEADY 
GUIDING HAND. 
</P>

<P>
 Baseball season is over, but life on the road continues for El Camino Real 
High Coach Mike Maio. 
</P>
<P>
 Maio and his wife are living with their son in his Moorpark home after being 
forced from their damaged residence in Thousand Oaks by the Northridge 
earthquake two months before the season's first pitch. The displacement shook 
up Maio's coaching preparation considerably, to say nothing of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 But finally, nearly six months, $100,000 worth of repairs and a City Section 
4-A Division championship later, Maio is counting the days until he moves back 
into the house in which he has lived for the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an inconvenience," Maio said. "You lose stuff. And you have to pack 
stuff away and then you forget where you put it. But I think after you get over 
the initial shock, you realize that it's no reason to feel bad and use it as an 
excuse to do poorly. You just kind of adjust. You just do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Maio's guidance, El Camino Real, despite earthquakes and emotional 
turmoil, accomplished what no team has done in 15 years -- win consecutive City 
titles. Earlier this month, the Conquistadores defeated West Valley League 
rival Chatsworth, 7-6, in nine innings at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Maio also repeated. For the second year in a row, he is The Times' Valley 
coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the 1994 spotlight shone on senior left-hander Randy Wolf, who pitched 
a complete game at Dodger Stadium and was voted City 4-A player of the year for 
the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Wolf's father died unexpectedly of a heart attack at age 56, 
prompting an outpouring of sympathy and a decision by players to don a black 
arm patch bearing James Wolf's initials. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the season, Maio, 54, ever humble and among the most likable of 
area coaches, steered the team along a steady course consistent with his 
stick-to-business style. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an extremely classy guy," Wolf said. "He had a real feeling for what I 
was going through, but he doesn't want to bring down the atmosphere by talking 
about bad things. He's tried to teach us to be thankful." 
</P>
<P>
 The coach's personal tribulation was never a topic of team discussion. "He 
never brought that out to the field," first baseman Craig Carlton said. "He 
might have looked a little fatigued, but you would never hear him complaining." 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake insurance lessened the financial blow for Maio. Yet the shake-up 
wreaked havoc on his coaching plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Detailed scouting reports of opponents, carefully prepared and relied heavily 
upon by Maio in his 12 years as El Camino Real coach, were lost in the move, 
hastily packed away among piles of paperwork. Some might be gone for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Maio found much time to search. In recent months, he has been busy 
coordinating home repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he kept the team focused and intense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, it was like we were the team to beat," Carlton said. "But this 
year, he had to spend all his time trying to get everybody up. That's why it 
was kind of sweet to win this one for him. It probably meant more than last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not, Maio said. Comparing one City title to another, Maio said, "is 
like asking if you love your father or your mother better." Both titles are 
special, he said, only this season's rise to the top was more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might have had an easier time if I hadn't pushed so hard," Maio said. "At 
times, I caught myself getting a little too uptight." 
</P>
<P>
 That's OK. Rounding third, Maio soon will be safe at home. Maybe then he can 
relax. 1st-Team All-Stars Invited to Times' Awards Ceremony

1994 LOS ANGELES TIMES; ALL-VALLEY BASEBALL TEAM; PLAYER & PITCHER OF THE YEAR; 
PITCH PERFECT; JIM PARQUE: LEFT-HANDED STRIKEOUT ARTIST STOOD TALL FOR 
CRESCENTA VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To be fair to Crescenta Valley High's Jim Parque, let's squash the 
how-tall-is-he-really debate for now. Parque, whose height has been reported 
anywhere from 5-foot-6 to 5-10, insists he is 5-10. 
</P>
<P>
 And, lacking a tape measure, who can argue? 
</P>
<P>
 Unquestioned is Parque's talent. And, like his height, it is often 
underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Parque, The Times' 1994 Valley pitcher of the year, was dominant this spring, 
leading the Falcons into the Southern Section Division I semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 12-3 with an 0.49 earned-run average, the best in the area. In 85 
innings, he struck out an area-high 156, an average 12.8 per seven innings. He 
allowed only 43 hits, walked 25 and allowed a grand total of six earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Parque was named to the All-Southern Section Division I and Cal-Hi Sports 
All-State teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really thought he would have a great year," Coach Tony Zarrillo said, "but 
I don't think I ever thought he could do this." 
</P>
<P>
 But Parque has not surpassed his own expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 He has merely met them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be the best pitcher in the area," he said. "I wanted to spread my 
name around and spread my reputation, show everyone that I'm not a fluke. I can 
really do these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Like strike out 10 batters in three innings? He managed to do that against 
Montclair Prep when one batter reached base on a passed ball after striking 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Like strike out 17 batters in six innings? Parque did that in a game against 
Muir. He didn't even get a chance to go for 20 because Zarrillo pulled him 
after six to save him for his next outing a few days later against Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little bitter about that," Parque said, "but it's over now." 
</P>
<P>
 And how, you wonder, did he do in his next start against Hoover? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a three-hitter with 15 or 16 strikeouts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to feel sorry for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Parque has even been the subject of a bidding war of sorts lately. In the 
fall, he accepted a partial scholarship to pitch at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parque was drafted in the 50th round by the Dodgers earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 So, just to make sure Parque didn't have any ideas about becoming a Dodger 
instead of a Bruin, UCLA Coach Gary Adams granted Parque a full scholarship, 
rare in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing missing from Parque's career, however, is a no-hitter. Although 
he has gone 21-9 with a 1.40 ERA in three varsity seasons, he hasn't been able 
to finish off a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 He threw three one-hitters this season. He took a perfect game into the 
seventh inning against Muir early in the season, only to lose it on a two-out 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little gap not fulfilled," Parque said of his lack of a no-hitter. 
"I'm not really too disappointed. It will come sooner or later." 1st-Team

1994 LOS ANGELES TIMES; ALL-VALLEY BASEBALL TEAM; PLAYER & PITCHER OF THE YEAR; 
PITCHER PERFECT; RANDY WOLF: DODGER DRAFT PICK ACCOMPLISHED NEAR MIRACULOUS 
FEATS FOR EL CAMINO REAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Randy Wolf might have been able to do more for El Camino Real High in his four 
years as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk on water, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridiculous? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's easy to slip into hyperbole when discussing Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, a senior left-hander and the clear choice as The Times' 1994 Valley 
player of the year, was 12-3 with a 1.19 earned-run average, including 3-0 in 
the playoffs, this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He also batted .443 with six home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two seasons Coach Mike Maio used Wolf as a pitcher, he was 23-4 with a 
1.13 ERA. In 191 1/3 innings, he gave up 107 hits and struck out 265 while 
walking 81.  
</P>
<P>
 He threw 24 complete games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to learn three things to coach Randy Wolf," Maio said. "I had to learn 
to spell his name to put it in the lineup card. I had to learn to unwrap the 
balls. And I had to learn to give them to Randy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be too smart." 
</P>
<P>
 Maio made that comment just before Wolf pitched nine innings in the City 
Section 4-A Division final at Dodger Stadium. He beat Chatsworth to lead the 
Conquistadores to their second straight title. 
</P>
<P>
 In his career in the playoffs, Wolf was 5-0 with an 0.83 ERA and 64 strikeouts 
in 42 innings, which was probably one of the main reasons he won back-to-back 
City 4-A player of the year honors, the first player to do so since Dorsey's 
Billy Consolo won the award in 1951-52. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of back-to-back, Wolf threw a no-hitter and perfect game in 
consecutive starts last season when he was The Times' Valley pitcher of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf missed two more no-hitters this season when his own fielding miscues were 
ruled hits, once early in the season against Birmingham and again in the 
playoffs against Carson. He finished with one-hitters both times. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf is far more than an accumulation of plaques and statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 18, Wolf's father James died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf missed only two games, and in his first game back, he hit a home run, 
glancing to the sky just after the ball cleared the fence in center field, as 
if to say, "That was for you, Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was difficult (to play again) because that was what I had 
to do," Wolf said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get on the field. That's my place. My dad wouldn't want me sitting 
out. He'd want me to go out and play." 
</P>
<P>
 Maio said of Wolf: "He has tremendous character. That's what's going to help 
him out in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf's teammates had black patches with James Wolf's initials placed on their 
sleeves for the remainder of the season.  
</P>
<P>
 The Conquistadores also honored James before each game by touching the 
flagpole. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Dodger Stadium before the final, the players all leaped in front of 
the center field fence, motioning toward the flagpole between the outfield 
bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, which El Camino Real won, 7-6, in dramatic fashion, Wolf sat 
in the dugout and thought, again, about his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of broke down right after that game in the dugout," Wolf said.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's when it really hit me that he wasn't going to be there. That was the 
final game. There wasn't a game to look to next." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a promising future for Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 He accepted a baseball scholarship to Pepperdine last fall, and he was drafted 
earlier this month by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the Dodgers come up with a six-figure deal to sign Wolf, or if he goes 
to Pepperdine, where the baseball field overlooks the Pacific Ocean, odds are 
he will be happy. 
</P>
<P>
 And if he performs anywhere close to the way he did at El Camino Real, his 
teammates will be happy, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk on water? Give him time. He's only 17. 1st-Team All-Stars Invited to

1994 LOS ANGELES TIMES; ALL-VALLEY SOFTBALL TEAM; PITCHER & PLAYER OF THE YEAR; 
STUDENTS OF THE GAME; CRYSTL BUSTOS: CANYON SHORTSTOP EXPLOITED OPPOSITION 
WEAKNESSES AND INTERESTED COLLEGE RECRUITERS. 
</P>

<P>
 The recruiting letters started arriving before her junior season, which means 
one thing: Canyon High's Crystl Bustos is no secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Division I college coaches hoping to land the shortstop during the early 
signing period next November must take a number and stand in line. Bustos, the 
Times' Valley player of the year, is as good as it gets at the high school 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 Bustos, who played organized baseball until age 10, is an aggressive player 
who looks for weaknesses in the opponent's defense. Of the 51 hits Bustos 
rapped out this season, 25 went for extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get a base hit and I see that they are off guard and I feel I can take 
the base, then I'll just go and I'll take it," Bustos said. "My dad always 
said, 'If they give you something, you have to take the chance and make 
something more out of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that Foothill League opponents would be aware of Bustos. But 
Bustos probably studies her opponents better than they do her. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I watch close enough, they'll slip," Bustos said. "Anger and frustration 
can set in (with them). If you get them that far, it will open doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Bustos opened eyes with the numbers she put up in her junior season, batting 
.573. She was named the league's player of the year after she scored 41 runs, 
stole 31 bases in 34 attempts and had 27 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no more (school) records for her to set," Canyon Coach Greg Hayes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bustos is a career .468 hitter with 63 RBIs, 91 runs, 20 doubles, 13 triples, 
19 home runs and 62 stolen bases. Still, she's not satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to improve because there's always room for improvement," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange as it sounds, her love for the game of softball started on the bench, 
when she was 10. She watched her Amateur Softball Assn. teammates as a reserve 
for an entire summer. Although a fine little athlete at the time, little was 
the operative word. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a midget," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bustos benefited from her bench time. "Most people don't want to sit the 
bench," she said. "But if you sit and watch and learn, it can benefit you." 
</P>
<P>
 Take it from Bustos, a former bench warmer who will have her pick of colleges.

1994 LOS ANGELES TIMES; ALL-VALLEY SOFTBALL TEAM; PITCHER & PLAYER OF THE YEAR; 
STUDENTS OF THE GAME; JENNIFER GOULD: ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS FOR EL 
CAMINO REAL HIGH'S GIFTED RIGHT-HANDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't be fooled by Jennifer Gould's modesty. What she doesn't say speaks 
volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Boasting is not in her nature. The El Camino Real senior right-hander doesn't 
offer information about herself, yet everyone who knows her is well aware of 
her many accomplishments on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould, The Times' Valley pitcher of the year, will attend Princeton in the 
fall on an academic scholarship. She is among several valedictorians this year 
at El Camino Real. She has never received any grade other than an A in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Gould is not a stereotypical egghead. Her kindness, generosity, quiet 
leadership and quick wit -- plus an uncanny ability to pitch to spots with 
remarkable consistency -- make her El Camino Real's most beloved player. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould pitched every inning for the Conquistadores, finishing with a record of 
20-4 and a 0.21 earned-run average. She had 175 strikeouts in 164 innings and 
owned a 8-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has made her mark as a pitcher, she is no slouch as a hitter, 
either. Gould batted .311 with 19 runs batted in as El Camino Real's cleanup 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 After leading the Conquistadores to their seventh softball title in 10 years 
with a 4-0 victory over top-seeded San Pedro in the championship game, Gould 
was chosen City Section 4-A player of the year. Beating San Pedro, which 
featured two NCAA Division I recruits, was no small feat. San Pedro had not 
lost to a City team in three seasons before Gould's three-hit gem. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been an extra special young lady," El Camino Real Coach Neils Ludlow 
said. "In a coach's career, there are always a few players that you refer to 
when you talk to the other girls and you kind of hold them up as examples. 
Jenny is going to be one that I will hold in that esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Gould seems to prefer to downplay her own accomplishments and favor talking 
about the friends and family who surround her. She can't say enough about her 
teammates. And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jen is just so great," said freshman Ramona Shelburne, a teammate and a big 
fan of Gould's. "She's so good at everything." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's title was El Camino Real's second in four years. As a freshman, 
Gould pitched the Conquistadores to a 1-0, nine-inning victory over Granada 
Hills in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as one of only two seniors on this year's team, Gould recalls her 
most recent victory as the sweetest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been awful if we had lost," Gould said. "It was really exciting 
to win it (as a freshman), but looking back, I don't think I realized exactly 
what it meant. Now I do. So, it meant more this time." 1st-Team All-Stars

1994 LOS ANGELES TIMES; ALL-VALLEY SOFTBALL TEAM; COACH OF THE YEAR; HE'S 
FILLING UP THEIR TROPHY CASE; NEILS LUDLOW: EL CAMINO REAL'S LATEST CITY 
SOFTBALL TITLE IS NO. 7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 If Neils Ludlow is withholding a secret to his unprecedented softball coaching 
success, don't expect to find a clue on his poker face. 
</P>
<P>
 His El Camino Real High team (20-4) beat two-time defending champion San 
Pedro, 4-0, in the City Section 4-A championship game last month to win its 
seventh title under the tutelage of Ludlow, who took over the Conquistadore 
program in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't get any easier," said Ludlow, The Times' Valley coach of the year. 
"It's not easy to win a City title just because you win one or two or three or 
how many we are fortunate enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ludlow has become as much a part of El Camino Real softball folklore 
as the state record 73-game winning streak over his first three seasons, he 
refuses to take credit for the Conquistadores' success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very fortunate to be part of this," Ludlow said. "Sometimes in life, 
you're in the right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of great athletes come to school here and it's just a matter 
of me being able to get the right person in the right (position). I don't want 
people to think that we did this because I'm a great coach, because that's not 
the case at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Ludlow also coaches the boys' basketball team at El Camino Real. Like most 
male softball coaches, his background is in baseball. In fact, he pitched for 
Brigham Young University in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ludlow has been a student of the game of softball since he began coaching 
the sport 10 years ago. And although he routinely becomes stressed out before 
big games, he loves every minute of it. Especially the day after a big victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the game's over, the next day the adrenaline is flowing, so you're so 
hyped-up that you could go for a day or two," said Ludlow, explaining what he 
has gone through each time the Conquistadores have won a City title. "Then it's 
almost like you hit the wall and you just want to crawl up in a corner 
somewhere for a couple of days and just literally, mentally, physically, 
emotionally, spiritually just kind of rejuvenate." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Ludlow does not take his job lightly. And although he takes little 
credit for victories, he blames himself for losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team on the field is a reflection of you," he said. "I personally feel 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Once before a City championship game against Canoga Park, Ludlow was so tense 
about having the right girl pinch-hitting or pinch-running in the right spot at 
the right time that he didn't sleep -- for three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludlow guided the Conquistadores to victory that year against Canoga Park as 
he had done in years past and years to come. Just as he is sure to do years 
from now. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for now, he's is basking in the glow of his most-recent victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (City title) was especially gratifying because it had been two years 
since we had won it," he said. 1st-Team All-Stars Invited to Times' Awards

PASTORINI NETS $150,000 AWARD IN SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brahna Pastorini, a tennis champion and softball standout at Taft High, was 
awarded $150,000 by the Los Angeles City Council Wednesday to settle a suit she 
filed after she was hit and injured in 1990 by a parks maintenance worker 
driving an electric cart. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastorini suffered a broken left leg and injuries to her right leg that 
required surgery and the continued use of a leg brace, according to a report by 
the City Attorney's Office to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastorini was in the parking lot of the Van Nuys/Sherman Oaks Recreation 
Center on Aug. 22, 1990, when a city maintenance worker driving an electric 
utility vehicle that hit her and pinned her against a parked car, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The worker apparently was bending over to pick something off the ground while 
driving toward Pastorini, the report said. When he tried to slam on the brakes, 
he accidentally pressed the accelerator and hit Pastorini, then 14. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report, Deputy City Attorney Herbert R. Seinden said the injuries 
appear to have diminished Pastorini's ability to play tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had she achieved her potential, there is little doubt that she would have 
earned a great deal as part of her tennis career, including product 
endorsements," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastorini is the daughter of former NFL quarterback Dan Pastorini and actress 
June Wilkinson. She was raised by her mother and has remarked that she wouldn't 
know her father if she saw him on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 As a tennis player, Pastorini was the City Section singles champion in 1992. 
After running her varsity record to 41-0, she was defeated in the 1993 City 
final by freshman Kendra Segura of Dorsey, 6-7 (7-2), 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Pastorini played catcher for the Taft softball team and batted 
.354.

U.S. UPSET ENDS 44-YEAR WAIT FOR WORLD CUP WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States, long a soccer lightweight, scored an improbable upset in 
its second game in the World Cup on Wednesday, beating highly regarded 
Colombia, 2-1, in front of a screaming, flag-waving crowd of 93,194 at the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first World Cup win for the United States since 1950, when it 
stunned England 1-0 in Brazil. The win also means the U.S. team will almost 
certainly advance out of the first round of the World Cup for the first time 
since 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 The news of the win was viewed like an exploding rocket in the soccer world, 
which has come to view the American team as a hard-working but lightweight 
representative of one of the few nations that demonstrates an indifference to 
the world's most popular sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Beating Colombia was astonishing enough, but to utterly overwhelm one of the 
tournament's favorites will likely give American soccer instant credibility and 
boost interest in the tournament, which is being held in nine U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude of the win was not lost on the crowd at the Rose Bowl, nor on 
the small but enthusiastic knot of supporters who turned out at the Dana Point 
Resort Wednesday night to welcome the victorious U.S. team as it returned to 
its hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're involved in an historical event," said David Good, a 46-year-old Dana 
Point businessman, who greeted the team with his 9-year-old son, Dylan. "There 
is a new sport in town." 
</P>
<P>
 Waving American flags, about two dozen well-wishers chanted "Go U.S.A." and 
embraced weary team members as they got off their bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the most exciting game of my life," said Theresa Schmetzer, 31, of 
Seattle, who was at the Rose Bowl to watch the first U.S. victory in 44 years 
and then drove to Dana Point to cheer the victors. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. team member Alexi Lalas said he was not disappointed by the small turnout 
at the resort, which contrasted with the throngs who attended the game and 
celebrated in the streets of Pasadena after the U.S. victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowds are getting bigger and bigger all the time," said Lalas, an 
aspiring musician who is a popular figure on the Orange County club circuit. 
"This is a very good day for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Rose Bowl, Sarah Perrin of Studio City was on her feet cheering during 
much of the game, even though this was her first professional soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like it," she said, after the United States took the 
unexpected win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian loss also made an impact on fans at the Rose Bowl. After the 
game, many left the stadium in stunned disbelief. Oscar Alvarez, a Palm Springs 
mini-market owner and Medellin native, spoke softly as the crowd around him 
celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Colombians are going home with a great sadness but in football, this is 
how it is," said the 34-year-old, clutching his chest. "I feel this in my 
heart; this is a great loss." 
</P>
<P>
 For Colombian fans, the unthinkable had happened. "We never expected them to 
do this badly," said Alvaro Arenas, 55, a doctor from Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
 The day for the Colombians was one that began on a bleak note and only got 
worse. A death threat against one of their players and his family was 
telephoned to the Fullerton Marriott hotel where the team was staying. The 
threat, directed against midfielder Gabriel Gomez and his family, caused team 
coach Francisco Maturana and his aides to pull Gomez from the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very hard to say who is making these threats," Gomez told a Colombian 
television network. "I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me my family and their families have been threatened if I play," 
Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Colombian team spokesman said the threat was directed at Gomez and Maturana. 
"The caller said that if Maturana played Gomez, both he and Gomez would suffer 
the consequences, and their families in Colombia would be in grave danger," 
said the spokesman, Antonio Correa. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton police are investigating the threats, said Sgt. Tom Jones. 
The campus police were assigned by soccer officials to d and constitutional to 
paddle a child in school, why would it be unconstitutional to have a parent 
paddle the child in front of a judge?" wonders Conroy, who says traditional 
forms of punishment, such as putting juvenile offenders in California Youth 
Authority facilities, are seen by hardened teen-agers as a "badge of honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's resolve was further buttressed when U.S. Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia -- the intellectual leader of the court's conservative wing -- 
opined in a recent talk that caning, a far more extreme form of punishment than 
paddling, could pass the high court's muster. 
</P>
<P>
 As for arguments that paddling could harm the psyches of juvenile taggers 
brought to justice, Conroy scoffs. He sees paddling as a long-practiced 
punishment that would persuade errant youths to straighten up. It would also 
act as a deterrent for those who haven't strayed, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current anti-crime climate, Conroy believes he is on the right side of 
the issue -- especially in an election year. With that in mind, the assemblyman 
is convinced that his bill has a 50-50 chance of becoming law. Indeed, even 
some Democrats -- most notably Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos), chairman of 
the Public Safety Committee -- have already embraced the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to be a legislator making all those touchy-feely psychologist 
arguments about why paddling is wrong," Conroy says. "Those arguments won't 
work. People are going to just look at those lawmakers like they don't have any 
common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense is big in Conroy's list of virtues. It is largely his own life 
experiences, his own sense of what's right and wrong, that has driven him. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls days as a Marine Corps officer stationed in North Carolina hearing 
about parents ordered to paddle their children in court as punishment for 
juvenile crimes. It quickly changed a child's errant attitude, he says. 
Conroy's experience with his own children only reinforces his bedrock belief 
that the mere specter of the paddle is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really had to paddle mine," Conroy says. "I had a belt that hung on 
the back of the door. There was the full understanding that if I asked them 
something, I wanted an answer. I never had to use that belt." Profile: Mickey

<P>
 Robert Lerner of Valley Center, Calif., gushed: "Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! This 
liberal Democrat from San Diego County applauds you, as do most Californians 
who have had it up to here with the coddling of graffiti vandals." 
</P>
<P>
 With the bill facing its first hearing next Tuesday, Conroy will need all the 
help he can muster. Crime may be the hot-button issue of this election year, 
but critics of the bill are already lining up in opposition, saying Conroy's 
paddling proposal is atavistic, barbaric, the sort of shallow blathering that 
exemplifies the pathology of media politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's penal law by press release," says Franklin Zimring, a professor at UC 
Berkeley's Boalt School of Law. "The bill's author succeeds when you write the 
story. He's looking for the same thing that the kid scratching graffiti on the 
wall is looking for -- that is attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Tom Bates, a liberal Democrat from Berkeley who sits on the Public 
Safety Committee, which will have first crack at Conroy's legislation, calls 
the bill "a sadistic joke." 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to deal out punishment, but it's just so extreme," Bates says. "I 
think this whole thing is an example of publicity-seeking, and there's no real 
chance the bill will survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin Hyman, a Temple University psychology professor who heads a center for 
the study of corporal punishment, worries that Conroy's proposal and similar 
ideas circulating in Florida, Maryland and Texas could begin to yank the 
country back toward a style of punishment largely abandoned decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hyman sees it, paddling of juveniles could spread to the adult penal system 
and hence to the military, where the flogging of U.S. sailors on the high seas 
was practiced through the mid-1800s. He also worries about the potential for 
sadistic abuse when society gives people power to inflict pain on others. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he cites research showing that corporal punishment can lead to 
embitterment, anger and post-traumatic stress while teaching impressionable 
youths the contradictory lesson that violence is the way to solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fought these battles in the 1800s," Hyman laments. "Unfortunately, we have 
some Neanderthal lawmakers who want to go back to the days of the slave 
owners." 
</P>
<P>
 That a bill authored by Conroy has become the vortex of such opposition and 
adulation is somewhat remarkable. Until now, the lawmaker's three-year stint in 
Sacramento has been relatively placid. 
</P>
<P>
 An avuncular, amiable sort well liked by Capitol staff as well as lawmakers on 
both sides of the aisle, the 66-year-old conservative is the sort who goes to 
political fund-raisers for Democratic opponents -- and stays to the end 
good-naturedly pumping hands and working the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 He is consistently hard-working -- last year he sponsored more bills than 
anyone else in Sacramento -- and generally seems driven more by the desires of 
constituents than headlines or politics. Probably the biggest stir Conroy has 
caused among his colleagues was when he formed an "on-time committee" last year 
to prod tardy lawmakers to be more punctual for floor sessions and committee 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most everyone loves him," observes Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach), Conroy's closest ally in the Legislature. "He's a throwback to that 
Irishman who might not agree with you, but he'll drink with you. He'll joke and 
be friendly, but don't cross his basic beliefs because he won't budge." 
</P>
<P>
 The vintage example of that persistence has been his unending effort to have 
state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), the liberal former anti-war activist, 
thrown out of the Legislature for what Conroy contends is traitorous behavior 
during the Vietnam War. Conroy, a Vietnam veteran, began his fight against 
Hayden in the mid-1980s while Conroy was a veteran affairs official. He hasn't 
given up yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Such bulldog perseverance will come in handy as Conroy begins the battle for 
his paddling bill. Characteristically, he has boned up on the subject, studying 
court briefs and consulting with legal experts. In his interviews, Conroy 
tosses out alarming statistics: 118,000 juveniles were arrested for vandalism 
in 1992; $1.2 million was spent to clean graffiti in Santa Ana alone last year; 
another $500,000 was spent thwarting taggers along Orange County's network of 
flood control channels. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to underline the need, Conroy himself was recently the victim of a 
tagger. His district office in Orange was spray-painted with the words "Spank 
Me" by a wry vandal with a sense of political irony. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's legislative solution to graffiti is anything but voluminous. Three 
short pages spell out all the particulars of his paddling proposal -- the size 
of the paddle (it would be of 3/4-inch-thick hardwood, 18 inches long and six 
inches wide with a six-inch handle), who wields the paddle (a parent, but the 
judge can order a bailiff to take over if the parent declines or doesn't 
deliver "a satisfactory paddling") and how many strokes (four to 10 
administered through clothing). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bill would require that the names of juvenile offenders who 
get the paddle be made public, a tactic designed to heighten the humiliation 
and deter other would-be taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the uproar over his bill, Conroy sees lots of precedents that support 
paddling in juvenile court. Although paddling is outlawed in California 
schools, the practice remains legal in public schools in nearly two dozen other 
states. Legal scholars such as Zimring say the constitutionality of school 
paddlings is a decidedly different issue than corporal punishment for juvenile 
offenders, but Conroy argues that youngsters would be guaranteed more solid 
protections in a court of law than in a schoolroom.

COURT EXTENDS BAN ON BUILDING O.C. TOLL ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA and LESLIE EARNEST, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A ban on building a toll road through Laguna Canyon was extended at least 
through September when a U.S. appeals court issued an injunction Wednesday to 
allow opponents time to prepare a lawsuit claiming that federal officials 
approved the project illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco was a significant setback to the San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor Agency, which is constructing the tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's action means construction will have been stalled for a year, a 
delay that transportation officials said will eventually cost taxpayers about 
$5 million for each month. 
</P>
<P>
 The injunction affects only a 4.4-mile, six-lane link between Newport Coast 
Drive and El Toro Road that cuts through the environmentally sensitive Laguna 
Greenbelt, including Laguna Canyon, and 1.7 acres owned by UC Irvine. The 
thoroughfare will stretch 17 miles between San Juan Capistrano and Newport 
Beach and was scheduled for completion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 However, work on the disputed segment of roadway that bisects the Laguna 
Greenbelt effectively has been halted since last Sept. 7, when a U.S. District 
Court judge in Santa Ana issued a preliminary injunction against construction 
at the request of environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The same judge lifted the injunction on June 14, and transportation officials 
immediately dispatched bulldozers to the site, where protesters were already 
waiting. Lawyers for environmental groups, led by Laguna Greenbelt Inc., went 
to the federal appeals court the same day to contest the lifting of the 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, an appeals court justice temporarily stopped the bulldozers. 
Attorneys for the tollway agency petitioned the court to let work resume. A 
judicial panel from the appeals court denied the petition Wednesday, but 
ordered a hearing in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Although transportation officials are upset over the costly delays, Joel 
Reynolds, attorney for the environmental groups that sued to stop construction, 
said the delays and additional costs could have been avoided if the tollway 
agency and Federal Highway Administration had followed U.S. environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't be embroiled in this if they had complied with the law in the 
first place," Reynolds said Wednesday. "This is a Neanderthal project that 
cannot pass environmental review. It's clear that (federal officials) simply 
rubber-stamped this project. They never studied it." 
</P>
<P>
 Local transportation officials tried putting on the best possible face when 
told of the appeals court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "While it is disappointing that the court did not lift the injunction, we are 
pleased that there will be a hearing on this matter in just a few weeks," 
William C. Woollett Jr., chief executive officer of the tollway agency, said in 
a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the Federal Highway Administration's role in approving the tollway 
project. Opponents said the federal agency violated environmental laws when it 
approved construction of the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, environmentalists argued that federal officials should have filed 
a supplemental environmental impact report after a massive fire burned a large 
part of the Laguna Greenbelt in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is the environmental review required by federal law was 
inadequate and illegal," Reynolds said. "The federal government never really 
paid attention to this project." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stockstill, spokesman for the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor 
Agency, said both the agency and the Federal Highway Administration followed 
the law. He said the issues that have been raised in the appellate court 
already have been raised in other courts, where the tollway has been challenged 
by opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've won at every level," Stockstill said. "Given that track record, we're 
hopeful the (appellate) court will rule in our favor." 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters who had maintained a vigil at the construction site since the June 
14 ruling were jubilant when they received word about the appellate court's 
action. About 30 demonstrators were present Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's proof positive that if people organize, they can make a difference," 
said Tim Carpenter, a founder of Alliance for Survival, an activist group based 
in Santa Ana. "It's a great moment. It's made our summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach City Councilwoman Lida Lenney, who has been a steady fixture at 
the protest site, said she was "ecstatic" at the "almost unbelievable" news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't get any better than this," Lenney said. "It's Christmas, the 
Fourth of July and New Year's Eve all rolled into one." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenney and Carpenter said tollway opponents will meet with tollway agency 
officials today and demand that they fund a project to replant the hillsides 
and meadows that were graded when bulldozers were at work for 12 hours last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to call on the (Orange County) community to come out this summer 
and replant the canyon and restore it," Carpenter said. "They're not going to 
get an opportunity to bulldoze it again. We're going to continue our court 
challenge. . . . Ultimately, we will save the canyon. There will be no road 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 News of the injunction was also celebrated in San Francisco, at the office of 
Lawrence Halprin, a landscape architect hired by the county to design the 
Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationally renowned designer said he has been following tollway-related 
events in Orange County and was relieved by the court's ruling. "I think it's 
wonderful, just wonderful," Halprin said.

 Malosi Taeleifi remembers how, back home in Hawaii after getting out of 
college, he used to see the group Kapena in little hole-in-the-wall joints. 
Within a few years, Kapena was filling stadiums and winning Hoku awards (the 
Hawaii version of the Grammy). 
</P>
<P>
 "Their sound is very different," Taeleifi says. "They can make a ukulele sound 
just like a guitar. . . . They mix a traditional sound with jazz, rock 'n' 
roll, country and a little bit of reggae." 
</P>
<P>
 The sound is called "Jawaiian," Taeleifi says, and Kapena and other big-name 
acts, such as Keo and Willie K., will bring it to the Aloha Concert Jam '94, an 
event that will not only give displaced islanders a little taste of home, but 
offer Southern Californians a look at real Hawaiian culture they might not get 
at a vacation luau.  
</P>
<P>
 Along with the music will be food and merchandise in a village atmosphere 
reflecting the aloha spirit. The event takes place Saturday, 3-10 p.m., at 
Olympic Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills, 1000 E. Victoria St. Tickets 
$15-$20 ($26 seats sold out). Call for reservations: (310) 549-3296. LAURIE K.

U.S. UPSET ENDS 44-YEAR WAIT FOR WORLD CUP WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States, long a soccer lightweight, scored an improbable upset in 
its second game in the World Cup on Wednesday, beating highly regarded 
Colombia, 2-1, in front of a screaming, flag-waving crowd of 93,194 at the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first World Cup win for the United States since 1950, when it 
stunned England 1-0 in Brazil. The win also means the U.S. team will almost 
certainly advance out of the first round of the World Cup for the first time 
since 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 The news of the win was viewed like an exploding rocket in the soccer world, 
which has come to view the American team as a hard-working but lightweight 
representative of one of the few nations that demonstrates an indifference to 
the world's most popular sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Beating Colombia was astonishing enough, but to utterly overwhelm one of the 
tournament's favorites will likely give American soccer instant credibility and 
boost interest in the tournament, which is being held in nine U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude of the win was not lost on the crowd at the Rose Bowl, nor on 
the small but enthusiastic knot of supporters who turned out at the Dana Point 
Resort Wednesday night to welcome the victorious U.S. team as it returned to 
its hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're involved in an historical event," said David Good, a 46-year-old Dana 
Point businessman, who greeted the team with his 9-year-old son, Dylan. "There 
is a new sport in town." 
</P>
<P>
 Waving American flags, about two dozen well-wishers chanted "Go U.S.A." and 
embraced weary team members as they got off their bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the most exciting game of my life," said Theresa Schmetzer, 31, of 
Seattle, who was at the Rose Bowl to watch the first U.S. victory in 44 years 
and then drove to Dana Point to cheer the victors. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. team member Alexi Lalas said he was not disappointed by the small turnout 
at the resort, which contrasted with the throngs who attended the game and 
celebrated in the streets of Pasadena after the U.S. victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowds are getting bigger and bigger all the time," said Lalas, an 
aspiring musician who is a popular figure on the Orange County club circuit. 
"This is a very good day for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Rose Bowl, Sarah Perrin of Studio City was on her feet cheering during 
much of the game, even though this was her first professional soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like it," she said, after the United States took the 
unexpected win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian loss also made an impact on fans at the Rose Bowl. After the 
game, many left the stadium in stunned disbelief. Oscar Alvarez, a Palm Springs 
mini-market owner and Medellin native, spoke softly as the crowd around him 
celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Colombians are going home with a great sadness but in football, this is 
how it is," said the 34-year-old, clutching his chest. "I feel this in my 
heart; this is a great loss." 
</P>
<P>
 For Colombian fans, the unthinkable had happened. "We never expected them to 
do this badly," said Alvaro Arenas, 55, a doctor from Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
 The day for the Colombians was one that began on a bleak note and only got 
worse. A death threat against one of their players and his family was 
telephoned to the Fullerton Marriott hotel where the team was staying. The 
threat, directed against midfielder Gabriel Gomez and his family, caused team 
coach Francisco Maturana and his aides to pull Gomez from the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very hard to say who is making these threats," Gomez told a Colombian 
television network. "I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me my family and their families have been threatened if I play," 
Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Colombian team spokesman said the threat was directed at Gomez and Maturana. 
"The caller said that if Maturana played Gomez, both he and Gomez would suffer 
the consequences, and their families in Colombia would be in grave danger," 
said the spokesman, Antonio Correa. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton police are investigating the threats, said Sgt. Tom Jones. 
The campus police were assigned by soccer officials to escort and guard the 
Colombian team. Jones said other law enforcement agencies may also be involved 
in checking out the threats. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colombia, the streets were full of people with flags waving and car horns 
were honking as the game started. Afterward, the streets had become eerily 
quiet as the country, which had been picked by soccer legend Pele to win the 
tournament, dealt with its grief. 
</P>
<P>
 The first U.S. goal came in the 35th minute after a huge Colombian error. 
American midfielder John Harkes sent a centering pass to onrushing Ernie 
Stewart. Colombian defender Andres Escobar intercepted the pass and attempted 
to kick the ball harmlessly out of bounds. Instead, the ball bounced off his 
right foot into his own net. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart scored the second goal after racing past most of the Colombian 
defense. The entire Colombian team, noted for its creativity and superior 
skill, played in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 For once, the U.S. team got a boost from the home crowd, which cheered with 
gusto. 
</P>
<P>
 For the United States, the 44-year wait for a victory in the World Cup was 
over.
