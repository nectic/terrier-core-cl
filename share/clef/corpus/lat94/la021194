DANA PARSONS: THERE'S A CATCH TO CRIME-FIGHTING 'THREE STRIKES' PITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime, or, more specifically, talking about crime , is now the national 
political pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure we all understand that, politicians have simplified the crime 
lingo to that of our other national pastime: in crime now, as in baseball, it's 
three strikes and " Yer outta here! " 
</P>
<P>
 Three violent-crime convictions and hit the showers, bud. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Assembly has approved five "three strikes" measures, President 
Clinton has endorsed the concept, and even the presumed bleeding heart liberal 
governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, supports it. 
</P>
<P>
 At first blush, there's nothing wrong with the three-strikes provision. 
There's not much of an argument to be made for why society should be 
perpetually at risk from proven hard-core criminals. And, strictly as a 
political ploy, the strikeout strategy is right up there with support of the 
death penalty for sheer fan appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 But will it make much difference? Will we be that much safer? 
</P>
<P>
 As an overall crime strategy, it has an inherent defeatist tinge. Before the 
punishment kicks in, the criminal gets three whacks at victims. Three dead or 
battered bodies is hardly cause for celebrating a "get-tough" crime provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the danger for the public. Politicians no doubt see the strikeout 
as a way to impress the crowd. Used to be they could talk about building more 
prisons and that would wow the public. Now, the public is saying, "Hey, we 
built all these prisons and we still don't feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was that more strikingly proven than in 1991 in Orange County, a 
law-and-order outpost if ever there was one. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sheriff Brad Gates threatening the public with criminals-on-the-loose 
because of overcrowded jails and asking for only a half-cent sales tax increase 
to build a new one, Orange County resoundingly said no. Nobody showed up to 
vote (one in six registered voters turned out) and three out of every four who 
did voted against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, I suggested that proved that crime was overrated, but other 
analyses were probably more accurate: namely, that the public wasn't convinced 
that government knew how to handle the crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
 So, here we are in 1994, and crime heads the list of things Orange County 
residents are concerned about, according to a poll last summer. Similar concern 
is voiced from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any more reason today to believe the public trusts government to 
handle the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Criminologist and UC Irvine assistant professor Brian Vila doubts it. "In 
general terms, people are discouraged about the conventional approaches to 
dealing with crime," he says. "Clinton became the sixth President in a row to 
declare war on crime and people know that the crime rate goes up and the crime 
rate goes down, one kind goes up and another kind goes down, and I don't think 
people have the perception that government is very effective in dealing with 
crime. And, in particular, that's one of the main reasons they haven't been 
anxious to build a new jail in Orange County, for instance, or build more 
prisons." 
</P>
<P>
 With a law enforcement background, including a stint as a Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputy, Vila says he is "no kind of flaming liberal." But, he says, 
we've got it all wrong when it comes to the crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a growing body of research that the 5%-6% of the people who commit 
50% of the serious crimes were severely damaged early in their lives," he says. 
Those problems run the gamut, he says, from prenatal problems to child abuse to 
growing up in dysfunctional families. "Lots of people survive those same 
traumas, but a large proportion of people who go on to become our biggest 
problems do come out of dysfunctional backgrounds," Vila says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious to Vila that that's where a large share of money must go. "I 
think a real key is to think about the life course, to think about prevention 
not as a thing you do for today or this year, but that you try to effect over 
the course of an individual's life." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like the old liberal philosophy that lost public support, I suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Vila agrees but said even Great Society goals were too short-term-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the short term," Vila says, "we need cops on the street, we need prisons 
and jails, we need supervision for people on parole and probation, but those 
are short-term solutions and they don't do much about the real roots of the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Vila said politicians underestimate the public's intelligence on root causes 
of crime and that leaders of "stature, understanding and guts" could sell a 
long-term approach. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take a sell job, because my reading is that the public thinks we tried 
that, and it didn't work. But my reading also is that the public, deep down, 
isn't convinced more jails and prisons are the answer either. 
</P>
<P>
 You want to talk "three strikes and you're out"? 
</P>
<P>
 While pitching for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1969, recent Hall of Fame 
designee Steve Carlton struck out 19 batters in a nine-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
 He also lost the game, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton learned that there's a lot more to winning a game than striking people 
out.

 Reader rumblings: Guess who phoned us about our item on the San Jose Mercury 
News column that was headlined "What Los Angeles Really Needs Is a Bigger 
Quake"? 
</P>
<P>
 The San Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative wanted a copy of Only in L.A.'s report on the article by the 
Mercury News' Joanne Jacobs. You may recall that Jacobs had postulated that 
"the problem is that not enough of Los Angeles fell down." Apparently 
unconcerned with the potential loss of lives and homes that would result, she 
said a destructive quake would give planners a chance "to rebuild Los Angeles 
as a more livable city." 
</P>
<P>
 The day we discussed Jacobs' theory, the San Jose newspaper was inundated with 
angry calls. "They couldn't all get through," the Mercury News rep said. "I 
know they're going to want to sock it to us again today. I want to have your 
column in front of me when they call." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Unexpected support: After the quake, Debbe Behr snapped a shot of a bicycle 
rack ad that gives an ironic message of encouragement to residents whose houses 
overlook Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Flashback, 1933: Quake jitters are nothing new here in Seismic California. The 
6.3 Long Beach quake of 1933, the most destructive ever to hit that city, was 
still on the minds of residents three years later, writes Ruth Snyder. She 
recalled attending a Long Beach showing of the movie "San Francisco," which 
culminates with the 1906 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were still so nervous," she said, "that they screamed and some ran, 
thinking it was happening again -- not just a film." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flashback, 1925: Mary Jane Schmidt, meanwhile, remembers visiting Santa 
Barbara with her family after the 6.3 quake that struck that city in 1925. Her 
father was a general manager of the Pasadena Light and Power Department and 
wanted to assess the damage -- which was considerable -- to help prepare 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember standing in a line a block long (it seemed to me, at age 6) with 
my mother at the only open service station restroom," she said. "When the 
ladies were slow in leaving, my mother said: 'Those women, they are only in 
there smoking cigarettes!' And, remember, this was in the days when ladies did 
not smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The devil they say: We haven't received any confirmation of the shocking 
report in the Weekly World News Tabloid -- that "17 demons" escaped from "the 
gates of hell (through) a gaping crack in the Golden State Freeway" after the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But city Firefighter Vince Marzo has a report from the other side, so to 
speak. Marzo says that when his crew returned to the Northridge firehouse 
several hours after the quake, they were pleased to see a tiny pink angel 
sitting on the station's front wall.  
</P>
<P>
 It was one of the 5,000 or so plaster seraphs that artist Jill D'Agnenica has 
been distributing throughout the city to put more angel in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Marzo adds: "Since we made it out of the station in one piece and have moved 
back in, it is obvious the power of divine intervention played an important 
role!" 
</P>
<P>
 Take that, demons. miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 You can't blame actress Sophia Loren if she felt upstaged when she received 
her star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame the other day. How was she to know that 
retired City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, an ex-big-band orchestra leader, would 
receive a star the same day?

MOVIE REVIEW; LOVE POWERS 'THE GETAWAY' CAR; ALEC BALDWIN, KIM BASINGER STEAM 
UP THE SCREEN IN CRISP THRILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though it began life as an unpretentious paperback original by pulp icon Jim 
Thompson, "The Getaway" has turned into a lovers' lane for hot Hollywood 
couples. Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw starred in the first version, Alec 
Baldwin and Kim Basinger headline this one, and for all we know Macaulay Culkin 
and Anna Chlumsky are already planning another a ways down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 A perfectly respectable thriller that mostly manages to be as crisp and 
efficient as the crimes it depicts, this Roger Donaldson-directed "Getaway" 
compares favorably with the Sam Peckinpah original. In fact, if this version 
has a problem it's that, with the same screenwriter (Walter Hill, now 
collaborating with Amy Jones) and two of the same producers, its smooth surface 
sticks so close to its predecessor's that the oomph originality can bring is 
lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing about this "Getaway" turns out to be that Baldwin-Basinger 
pairing as Doc and Carol McCoy, partners in crime and concupiscence. Though 
McQueen and MacGraw may have been just as crazy about each other, the new 
couple is much better matched in terms of on-screen charisma. Not only in the 
glamorous love scenes, which will make interesting viewing for future 
grandchildren, but also in angry confrontations and even quiet moments, Baldwin 
and Basinger's palpable chemistry brings a pleasant buzz to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 First glimpsed on a firing range playfully bickering as to who gets to keep 
which gun, Doc and Carol are kind of a renegade Nick and Nora Charles who never 
miss an opportunity to crack wise. While she handles the driving, he is a 
practiced safecracker and explosives expert, a stand-up guy who does the jobs 
others say can't be done. "It's a hell of a way to make a living, Doc," she 
says. "You should have married a dentist," he agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The serpents in this particular garden are plentiful, starting with the grungy 
Rudy (Michael Madsen), a low-class career criminal who brings Doc a set-up he 
says can't miss. But "The Getaway" is barely under way before Doc is seen 
languishing in a Mexican prison, trying to figure a way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Snake No. 2, Jack Benyon (James Woods), a disreputable businessman 
oozing power, influence and unctuous depravity. Benyon has always wanted to use 
Doc's talents, and the imprisoned man sends Carol, wearing a dress that is 
practically painted on, to cut a deal: Get me out of prison and I'll sign on 
for one last job. 
</P>
<P>
 Doc gets out, but nothing is simple after that. Grudges and suspicion soon 
proliferate, double- and triple-crosses become commonplace and everybody ends 
up chasing everybody else, heavy-duty weapons in hand. Though many of "The 
Getaway's" most intriguing twists duplicate the original, they still retain the 
ability to engage audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from greater explicitness in the love scenes, also marking this 
"Getaway" as up-to-date is an off-putting increase in the amount of sadism 
present in bad boy Rudy's relationship with a young woman named Fran (Jennifer 
Tilly reprising the Sally Struthers role). "It's been my experience that having 
a friend is overrated," Rudy says, and with a friend like him, it's easy to see 
why. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Donaldson, whose last film was the neo-thriller "White Sands," rides 
out all these storms, doing a solid, unruffled job with the step-by-step crime 
re-creations and in general bring a bit more style than usual to this 
violence-begets-violence tale. If nothing else, they don't make many movies 
with guys named Doc as heroes anymore, and it's nice to see another one come 
around.

 'Aladdin' Sequel Coming: For those who can't get enough of Walt Disney's 
"Aladdin," the sequel is on its way. But it won't be on movie screens. Instead, 
Walt Disney Home Video is releasing "The Return of Jafar," which picks up where 
"Aladdin" ended with the evil sorcerer Jafar trapped inside a magic lamp, as 
its first original, made-for-video, animated movie. The video features the 
return of Scott Weinger and Linda Larkin as the voices of Aladdin and Jasmine, 
with Dan Castellaneta of "The Simpsons" fame taking over as the Robin Williams 
role of the genie. (Last November, Williams angrily accused Disney of using his 
voice to market products without authorization.) In the sequel, a clumsy thief 
inadvertently releases Jafar from the lamp, so he plots his revenge against 
Aladdin, setting the scene for new adventures. The video arrives in stores May 
20, just in time to pick up the slack after Disney stops selling videos of the 
original animated "Aladdin" April 30.

 Lawrence Rapped With NC-17: "Martin Lawrence You So Crazy," a stand-up comedy 
concert film starring Lawrence, has received an NC-17 rating from the Motion 
Picture Assn. of America because it addresses such topics as oral sex. 
Distributor Miramax Films, along with Lawrence, director Thomas Schlamme and 
HBO Independent Productions, plan to appeal the rating next week. Said 
Schlamme: "The reason we made this film is because Martin has a unique way of 
connecting with his audience on a personal level about racism, relationships 
and other topical issues. . . . His message is meant to be insightful and his 
intentions are completely without malice." An NC-17 rating would prohibit 
anyone under the age of 17 from admission to the film. TELEVISION

 Troika of New ABC Programs: ABC will unveil another drama from "NYPD Blue" 
producer Steven Bochco, a sitcom starring Ed Asner and a new magazine show in 
March. Debuting March 3, replacing the Daniel J. Travanti series "Missing 
Persons" at 8 p.m., is "The Byrds of Paradise," Bochco's hourlong family drama 
with former "thirtysomething" star Timothy Busfield. Busfield plays a widowed 
father of three who relocates his family to Hawaii after the murder of his 
wife. And starting March 9, Asner's "Thunder Alley," about a former racing car 
driver whose life changes when his divorced daughter and her young children 
move in with him, takes over the 8:30 p.m. slot currently occupied by the 
animated series "The Critic." The same night, "Turning Point," ABC News' latest

Brian Dennehy series "Birdland" at 10 p.m.

MOVIE REVIEW; SUGAR IS WHAT 'MY GIRL 2' IS MADE OF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anna Chlumsky, the star of "My Girl 2," isn't a conventionally adorable movie 
tyke, and that's to her credit. She has pluck and smarts, and she doesn't mug 
for the camera. This sequel to "My Girl" isn't much -- it's essentially for 
people who found that first film endearing -- but Chlumsky, at 13, may turn out 
to be one of the few child stars to successfully make it into the world of 
adulthood performing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, there are cloying entertainments like "My Girl 2" (citywide) 
to contend with. In the first film, Chlumsky's Vada, whose mother died giving 
birth to her, maneuvered her way into an adult writing class because she had a 
crush on the teacher. Her father, played by Dan Aykroyd, was a mortician who 
embalmed corpses in the basement of their home. 
</P>
<P>
 With this kind of background, one would expect Vada to be a bit more wiggy and 
careworn than she is in "My Girl 2." The film, set in the spring of 1974, is 
about Vada's search for information about her deceased mother. (She's writing a 
school paper on her.) Journeying to Los Angeles, where her mother grew up, she 
stays with her uncle (Richard Masur) and the woman he lives with (Christine 
Ebersole) and her son (Austin O'Brien) and ferrets out clues. She pressures her 
mother's old high school friends to offer up personal tidbits. Of course, we're 
supposed to regard her mission as an inner voyage. Vada learns who she is by 
finding out who her mother was. 
</P>
<P>
 This dubious scenario is made even more so by the treacly approach of director 
Howard Zieff and screenwriter Janet Kovalcik. Everything in this film is 
sugared with sermons about the importance of Being Yourself. Vada doesn't 
experience any twinges of rage at the loss of her mother or any misgivings 
about her quest. She's preternaturally mature. 
</P>
<P>
 The processed coziness of "My Girl 2" is tolerable only because, besides 
Chlumsky, the performers are better than average for this sort of thing. 
Aykroyd once again plays well against Jamie Lee Curtis, as Vada's stepmom; they 
seem like a real married couple and not the usual movie put-up job. Masur is 
warmly expert, and Ebersole matches him. O'Brien, rebounding from "Last Action 
Hero," works well with Chlumsky. They all do better by this movie than it 
deserves. They should call themselves GooBusters.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'BLANK CHECK' FANTASY BUYS INTO MATERIALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven-year-old Preston Waters (Brian Bonsall) finds himself the recipient of 
a blank check in "Blank Check" (citywide) and proceeds to cash it for a million 
bucks and shower himself with toys and gizmos. It's a child's fantasy that's 
also an adult fantasy -- particularly in Hollywood. For its producers, the 
fantasy, of course, is that the movie will shower them with millions. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also clear from the get-go that this movie also wants to practice Good 
Values -- it wants to demonstrate that money isn't everything. It's a standard 
Hollywood two-step: Indulge but Moralize. 
</P>
<P>
 Preston is supposed to be a nerdy kid whose father (James Rebhorn) is a 
taskmaster and skinflint. Actually, Preston seems pretty spunky. His creepy rep 
with his classmates is undeserved. Have our filmmakers even forgotten how to 
convincingly characterize a nerd? Was "Revenge of the Nerds" all for naught? 
</P>
<P>
 A movie about a kid who goes gaga buying toys and gizmos is a natural for 
product placements; there is so much brand-name merchandise highlighted in this 
film that watching it is like riffling though a mail-order catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the children in the audience, all those gizmos may turn out to be 
overkill. What's missing from this film is any trace of the joy in simple 
pleasures. Preston isn't a very imaginative child; he's a goodies gatherer. 
</P>
<P>
 The supporting cast tries hard to inject some spunk into the proceedings. As 
the bad guy whose blank check sets the plot in motion, Miguel Ferrer does a 
junior-league variation on his even worse guy in "RoboCop." Tone Loc shows up 
as Ferrer's assistant, and he's so out of place in this fantasy that he seems 
weirdly in place. Best is Rick Ducommun as Preston's chauffeur; his scenes with 
the boy have a goofy charm. They both have a weakness for tubs of ice cream. 
Miraculously, the ice cream is not identified by brand.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'TWOGETHER': UNCOMMONLY REFLECTIVE LOVE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Twogether" (Monica 4-Plex) is a terrific love story, one of those 
independently made intimate movies that comes out of nowhere to captivate you 
with its passion and integrity. Unlike most Hollywood romances, "Twogether's" 
tempestuous story is firmly rooted in the real world and involves people who 
have a capacity to think as well as feel. Writer-director Andrew Chiaramonte, 
who spent nine years getting this film off the ground, has cast two talented, 
spectacular-looking actors, Nick Cassavetes and Brenda Bakke, and then given 
them roles of uncommon substance and dimension. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassavetes is John Madler, an ambitious, volatile Venice-based painter who's 
not shy about trading on his looks and charm and, beyond that, the mystique of 
the artist as a wild man not beholden to the rules that govern us more prosaic 
types. At a gallery opening of his work, a benefit for a Greenpeace-like 
organization, he locks gazes with a volunteer, Bakke's Allison McKenzie. Since 
they both radiate availability, they waste no time in consummating their mutual 
attraction, rushing off to Vegas for more sex and partying only to wake up 
sober, realizing that somewhere along the way they got married. 
</P>
<P>
 They decide, as "mature, intelligent adults" -- that's Allison's description 
-- on a quick divorce. Yet when Allison arrives at John's Venice cottage with 
their final papers, they unexpectedly make love one more time -- leaving 
Allison pregnant with a child they agree should be aborted. It's only when, 
much to their surprise, they find they can't go through with the abortion that 
these strangers start getting to know each other. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a great deal of pretext with which to get a story underway, but 
Chiaramonte has lots on his mind and has such a deft way with montages to 
further the action, such a sure instinct in what to leave out, that his film's 
pace never lags. What happens is that we share in John and Allison's discovery 
of each other, which proves to be an inspired, involving strategy on 
Chiaramonte's part. 
</P>
<P>
 The big revelation here is Allison, for beneath her seemingly poised and 
uninhibited facade lurks a tragedy-scarred poor little rich girl, the product 
of a rigidly conservative Bel-Air family that never valued her. John falls in 
love with Allison -- she moves in with him during her pregnancy -- but his 
pride and concern for freedom and independence drive him to conceal this truth, 
especially from himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the matter is that in John and Allison's thrashing out of their 
lives we can see ourselves. We're confronted with how we go about making our 
own choices and establishing our own priorities, how tough it can be to make 
any relationship work, how easy it is to avoid every kind of responsibility, 
how crippling are immaturity and self-absorption, how little we really know 
ourselves -- in short, how so many of us need simply to grow up, whatever our 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Chiaramonte inspired Cassavetes and Bakke to bare their souls as well 
as their bodies, and if there's any justice, "Twogether" ought to give their 
careers a significant boost. There are lots of splendid people in support, none 
better than Damian London as the mercurial, tough-minded art gallery owner. 
"Twogether," which dares to wear its emotions on its sleeve, is one of those 
"little" movies that just might make it into the mainstream.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'ONCE A COP' LONG ON ACTION, SHORT ON LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the credits unroll for Stanley Tong's lively martial arts action picture 
"Once a Cop" (at the Monica 4-Plex), we're shown why Yang Kin-Wah (Michelle 
Khan) is so richly deserving of the highest medal awarded by the Beijing police 
department. In a display of breath-taking bravado, she stages a daring rescue 
of an important Japanese government official, held hostage in the top floor of 
a skyscraper. Aiding her in the rescue -- but playing a decidedly supporting 
role in the operation -- is her boyfriend, Cheng Feng (Yu Rong-Guang). 
</P>
<P>
 Yang is a true and satisfied servant of the people, but Cheng, a bitter 
veteran of the Vietnam War, is fed up with his low pay and abruptly announces 
that he's off to Hong Kong to make some money working with an old friend but 
will return to marry her. Shortly thereafter, Yang is assigned to go to Hong 
Kong herself, to help break up a gang of criminals believed to be illegal 
immigrants from China. You probably won't faint from shock to discover that 
Cheng has joined them. 
</P>
<P>
 Tong is terrific at staging action, which takes precedence over exploring the 
relationship between Yang and Cheng, who are onscreen together only rarely. It 
speaks a great deal for Khan and Yu's charisma and authority that in a few 
brief moments they're able to make the couple's relationship as credible as it 
is. Clearly, Yang did not know what her man was all about -- even if she is a 
top cop. In any event, "Once a Cop," although certainly entertaining, might 
have been more involving had Tong and his co-writer Shaw Lai-King struck a 
better balance between action and emotion. They are able, however, to inject 
some lighter moments in the camaraderie among the Hong Kong policeman with whom 
Yang is working, and the film's finale is an action tour de force. 
</P>
<P>
 What is most interesting about "Once a Cop" is its spirit of detente as 1997 
approaches and with it, Chinese control of Hong Kong. Raymond Chow's Hong 
Kong-based Golden Harvest company has long been shooting in the People's 
Republic of China, and in depicting Yang as a virtual superwoman the film is 
able to suggest that China has its crooks just like every place else. 
Significantly, "Once a Cop" shows Yang and her counterparts in Hong Kong 
working together in perfect harmony in going after the bad guys.

 Little doubt about the lineage: The pyrotechnic licks, the smug humor -- Ahmet 
and Dweezil are Zappas through and through. But beyond free-thinker rhetoric 
and hot chops, the young brothers don't really have much to say, and even then 
it's not much new.Couldn't they think of any more original attacks than "Jesus 
Clone" or the macho-rocker mocker "Did I Mention It Was Huge"?  
</P>
<P>
 Despite wry wit and Dweezil's encyclopedia of guitar tricks, this is more like 
Rush with a sense of humor than late papa Frank's "Hot Rats." And that's often 
perilously close to the kind of slick, sterile rock that Frank delighted in 
chewing up and spitting out as ruthless parody. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

MUSIC REVIEW; MANN IN COMMAND DURING JUILLIARD STRING PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Juilliard String Quartet brought its seasoned wares to Ambassador 
Auditorium yet again on Wednesday, trailing some speculation that first 
violinist Robert Mann might be winding down his activities with the ensemble 
over which he has presided for the 46 years of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
 The speculation stemmed from some less-than-satisfactory personal outings in 
recent seasons, without reflecting on the undiminished skills of his much 
younger colleagues, second violinist Joel Smirnoff, violist Samuel Rhodes and 
cellist Joel Krosnick. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wednesday's program, one could only thank the benevolent heavens that 
the 73-year-old Mann was still in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was an ill-tuned phrase here, the fleeting suggestion of flagging 
vitality there, the overall impression remained one of mastery over both his 
instrument and his material. 
</P>
<P>
 And the material was daunting indeed, beginning with Haydn's sad, secretive 
Quartet in D minor, Opus 103, the composer's final, unfinished effort in the 
medium he had virtually invented a half-century earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with less a change in mood than in compositional style, the Juilliard 
revived one of its old signature pieces, Alban Berg's "Lyric Suite." 
</P>
<P>
 This gnarled exercise in post-Romantic agony sighed, whispered, thundered, 
screamed, sang and, in the scurrying measures of the bat-infested Allegro 
misterioso, very nearly frightened in these players' inspired hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Schubert's "Death and the Maiden," tediously overexposed on local 
stages in recent seasons, emerged no less effective than the Berg in the 
Juilliard's rough, dare-all traversal: faster, slower, louder, softer, more 
gripping than might seem possible with such a familiar score. HERBERT GLASS

JAZZ NOTES: LETTING MUSIC SPEAK IN CHURCH SETTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inspired by the 27-year history of Jazz Vespers programs at St. Peter's 
Lutheran Church in New York, actor and music fan Steve Rowe has initiated a 
similar service at the First Lutheran Church of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to create a place for the music to speak in a church setting," says 
Rowe, a member of the First Lutheran congregation who started Jazz Vespers 
there in September. "To me, improvisation is the pure expression of 
spirituality, and it opens me up to a lot of things in scriptural readings that 
I can understand for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz Vespers at First Lutheran are nondenominational, and while there are 
readings -- mostly of Psalms from the Old Testament -- the accent is on the 
music, Rowe says. "The music carries the service," he says. "The possibility of 
new listening in this space is provoked by the music, not by the word. And the 
musicians have acknowledged that it is a place to have their music listened to 
without the hubbub of a club." 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Bennett Brandeis and pianist Cecilia Coleman are among those that 
have led ensembles at First Lutheran. Each group has played selections of its 
own choosing. Black/Note, the strong L.A.-based group, appears this Sunday at 
6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really a spiritual kind of thing," Coleman says of her experience at 
First Lutheran. "The setting seemed to give the music a little more meaning, 
and you could tell the people were really into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowe says attendance at the services, which are held the second or third 
Sunday of each month, has been around 200. Rowe pays the musicians a small fee 
and hopes to raise additional funds from donations. A fund-raising dinner will 
be held Sunday, 5 p.m., at the church, located at 1300 E. Colorado Blvd., 
Glendale. A $10 donation is requested.

 Changing Plans: Joe Zawinul's group Zawinul Syndicate, scheduled to make a 
rare six-night club stand at Catalina Bar & Grill starting Tuesday, has 
canceled. Zawinul, who lives in Malibu, cited the earthquake and recent 
inclement weather for the decision. Saxophonist Odean Pope, a longtime member 
of Max Roach's quartet, will appear Tuesday through Feb. 20 in place of 
Zawinul. . . . Dave Koz, the pop-jazz saxman whose "Lucky Man" Capitol Records 
release is currently No. 3 on the Billboard magazine Contemporary Jazz chart, 
will perform Feb. 19 at the Strand in Redondo Beach. Shows are at 8 and 10:30 
p.m. Tickets are $21.50. Koz had been scheduled to appear that evening at the 
Henry Fonda Theatre in Hollywood, but that venue has been closed due to 
earthquake damage.

 Jazz in Alhambra: In a desire to expose more people to music, Vicki Pedrini of

room for electronic keyboards, Pedrini hosts free concerts each Saturday, from 
1:30 to 4:30 p.m. Bill Cunliffe's trio plays Saturday, guitarist Ron Affif's 
quartet appears Feb. 19 and the New York-based Hardbop quintet, with pianist 
Keith Saunders, is set for Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedrini Music also hosts a free vocal workshop on Feb. 19 with jazz singer 
Cathy Segal-Garcia, and schedules other events, from classical concerts to 
"Meet the Composer" programs.

HOME TECH / LASER BIN: ROMANCING YOU AND YOUR VALENTINE

 Romance by laser light? Valentine's Day is one time of the year when even 
mediocre films, seen on laser, can add a rose-colored glow to the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Several recent laser releases may not win any prizes for best picture of the 
year, but they can make your Valentine's night a little more romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankie & Johnny" (Paramount, letterboxed), the 1991 romance by Terrence 
McNally based on his hit play "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune," wants 
the audience to believe that superstar celebrity-actors Al Pacino and Michelle 
Pfeiffer are ordinary working folks looking for love in a coffee shop. It's a 
tribute to both actors that they almost pull it off, making the ex-con 
short-order cook and hard-boiled waitress believable as they take a chance, 
maybe their last, on each other. Director Garry Marshall and McNally opened up 
the play only slightly, but its observations on life and the possibilities of 
love remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Night We Never Met" (Miramax/HBO Video) is a piece of 1993 romantic fluff 
featuring an attractive ensemble cast of Matthew Broderick, Annabella Sciorra, 
Kevin Anderson, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Justine Bateman. The hackneyed plot 
centers around a time-shared apartment, 1990s style, where Broderick, a gourmet 
cook stuck behind the counter in a designer deli, and Sciorra as a young wife 
in a doomed marriage finally consummate an obvious relationship. It's not 
"Sleepless in Seattle" (Columbia/TriStar, letterboxed), but enough like it -- 
with so much time before kismet takes effect -- to make for a romantic evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heart and Souls" (MCA/Universal, letterboxed) takes a page from "Ghost" 
(Paramount, letterboxed) with Robert Downey Jr. and Elisabeth Shue as the young 
couple being led to the altar by ghosts as disparate as Charles Grodin as a 
frustrated singer, Tom Sizemore as a two-bit burglar, Kyra Sedgwick as a young 
woman who lets the love of her life get away and Alfre Woodward as a single 
mother devoted to her kids. It's silly stuff, but Downey and Shue are pleasant 
enough and Woodard is surprisingly moving in the role of a mother worried about 
the children she left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Reitman's "Dave" (Warner Home Video, letterboxed) features an endearing 
Kevin Kline in a dual role as a presidential look-alike who takes over the big 
House. He eventually wins over the President's first lady, Sigourney Weaver, 
whose devastating look at the pretender naked in the shower is one of the 
funniest scenes in recent movies. 
</P>
<P>
 If watching love unfold through the eyes of an observant 10-year-old (Eliza 
Dushku) quickens your heartbeat, you may find 1993's "That Night" worth the 
effort (Warner Home Video, letterboxed). Juliette Lewis and C. Thomas Howell 
are the Romeo-and-Juliet star-crossed lovers who Dushku finally brings 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 All that notwithstanding, the best movie Valentine of the last few years is 
also available on laser. The 1989 "When Harry Met Sally . . . " (Nelson, 
letterboxed), starring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, should be at the top of any 
couple's (or about-to-be-couple) viewing list. Warm, wry, touching romantic 
comedy doesn't get much better. It's not as fattening as chocolate and its warm 
glow lasts much longer than a dozen roses.

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: MATHIS' 'COLLECTION' A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You get a sense of the wide appeal of Johnny Mathis' music by just looking at 
the photos in the booklet that accompanies "The Music of Johnny Mathis/A 
Personal Collection," a four-disc set from Columbia/Legacy Records. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 68-page booklet, you see Mathis working or relaxing with such varied 
artists as Nat King Cole, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Judy Garland, Henry 
Mancini, Mitch Miller and Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
 That same warm, photo-album intimacy is reflected throughout the set, partly 
because Mathis selected the 86 numbers and reminisces in the liner notes about 
each of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly, however, the warmth is in Mathis' voice, which seems as disarmingly 
pure and affecting today as it did in 1955 when he broke into the pop charts at 
age 21 with "Wonderful! Wonderful!" 
</P>
<P>
 Though Mathis' sweet, romantic sound was far from the dominant rock style of 
the time, his voice was as much a radio fixture during the late '50s as that of 
any of the rockers. Among more than a dozen other Top 40 hits from the '50s 
alone: "It's Not for Me to Say," "Chances Are" and "The Twelfth of Never." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mathis continues to record for Columbia, it is those early hits that 
remain his signature work. "Johnny's Greatest Hits," which was released in 1958 
and includes all four of the cited hits, spent more time on the national album 
charts (490 weeks) than any other album of the modern pop era except Pink 
Floyd's "The Dark Side of the Moon" (741 weeks). 
</P>
<P>
 The other selections in the Columbia/Legacy set range from additional hits -- 
1962's "Gina" to 1978's "Too Much, Too Little, Too Late" duet with Deniece 
Williams -- to lots of Broadway and film ballads and three previously 
unreleased recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as there is often a sense of innocence and wonder in Mathis' vocals, his 
comments about the various recordings also reveal a disarming modesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on his 1957 recording of Johnny Burke and Jimmy Van Heusen's "It 
Could Happen to You," he writes: "I think when I first started recording I 
wanted to do everything that I loved. My great loves were Nat Cole, Ella 
Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Lena Horne, Peggy Lee, June Christy, Chris Connor, 
the types who sang wonderful songs whose origins I didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Ella singing 'It Could Happen to You.' I tried to sing it exactly 
the way she sang it. In fact, for the first 10 or 12 years of my life, all I 
did was try to sing like somebody else. Fortunately, something of my own came 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 For Mathis fans, "A Personal Collection" is a winning documentation of a style 
that, modesty notwithstanding, does indeed carry its own engaging stamp.

HOME TECH / VIDEO: OSCARS GIVE RENTALS NEW LEASE ON LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To home video retailers, the Oscar nominations, which were announced 
Wednesday, are prime marketing tools that can really trigger rental surges. 
</P>
<P>
 Video retailers benefit most when Oscar-nominated movies come out on home 
video just before the nominations are revealed, allowing them to profit from 
all that post-nomination media exposure that continues for weeks up to the 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really can boost the rentals of nominated movies," said Brad Burnside, who 
runs the Video Adventure chain in the Chicago area. "People like to be able to 
sit down and watch the Oscar show having seen as many of the nominated movies 
as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Of this year's major nominees, only "In the Line of Fire," featuring best 
supporting actor contender John Malkovich, is a new release -- it came out 
Wednesday. Obviously, though, the filmmakers were hoping for a broader range of 
major nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 The only movie already in the rental market featuring a front-line nominee is 
"The Firm," co-starring Holly Hunter, who's up for best supporting actress for 
this movie as well as for best actress for "The Piano." 
</P>
<P>
 Since "The Firm" is already the No. 1 rental on the Billboard chart, will the 
nomination make any difference? 
</P>
<P>
 "It will give the movie another shot in the arm," Burnside said. "So far it's 
been a real surprise. It's lasted much longer as a top rental than we expected 
-- and now it will last even longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Enterprising retailers can capitalize on nominations in other ways. "We 
showcase other movies starring the nominees," Burnside pointed out. "For 
instance, with Holly Hunter and Emma Thompson, each up for two awards, we can 
get some mileage out of their old movies. During the period between the 
nominations and the award ceremonies, the nominated actors and actresses are 
real hot properties." 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, most of the major nominated movies came out last fall and aren't due 
on video for at least five or six months after their theatrical opening date. 
So none of the following will hit the home video market before the March 21 
Oscar ceremonies: "Schindler's List," "The Piano," "The Remains of the Day," 
"In the Name of the Father," "The Age of Innocence" and "Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 The next best thing to debuting on home video in time to take advantage of the 
nominations is being situated to capitalize on being an Oscar winner. So coming 
out on the days after the awards ceremony can pay rental dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Due out March 22: "The Fugitive," which is up for seven awards. A day later, 
retailers will offer "What's Love Got to Do With It," featuring Laurence 
Fishburne and Angela Bassett -- both up for best acting honors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fearless," co-starring best supporting actress nominee Rosie Perez, comes out 
April 6. If she wins, that would be a big rental-market boost for a movie that 
so far hasn't done great business in theaters -- $6.5-million gross. But 
whether Perez wins or not, this movie will be more attractive to renters. 
Without the Oscar attention, many would have ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
 Also due on April 6, "The Age of Innocence," which has five nominations, 
including Winona Ryder for best supporting actress. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar nominations can also increase revenues for the video companies releasing 
the movies. For instance, retailers will order more rental copies of "What's 
Love Got to Do With It," "Fearless" and "The Age of Innocence" -- which means 
more money for the video companies. These movies are in an ideal position since 
their prime ordering periods are in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The movies not yet scheduled for home video release will benefit from the 
nominations too. First of all, nominations invariably lead to increases in 
box-office grosses. Since the best indicator of rental-market performance is 
still box-office earnings, the bigger the gross, the bigger the shipments from 
video companies to rental outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 For the video companies releasing "The Piano" and "The Remains of the Day" -- 
a best picture nominee -- the nominations could prove especially helpful. 
Though both have piled up good grosses so far, they're still arty, fairly 
low-profile, non-mainstream movies that are tougher to sell to some video 
retailers -- particularly in small towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, both are instantly high-profile movies that are a must for any 
video retailer. What's New 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Line of Fire" (Warner); An aging Secret Service agent (Clint Eastwood) 
plays cat-and-mouse with a brilliant psychopath (John Malkovich) who's trying 
to assassinate the President. Malkovich's riveting character dominates last 
year's best suspense thriller, which boasts a truly gripping final half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Real McCoy" (MCA/Universal); A master burglar (Kim Basinger) -- an ex-con 
bent on kicking the criminal habit -- is blackmailed into pulling a job by the 
vicious villain (Terence Stamp). Val Kilmer co-stars as a clumsy crook. A truly 
terrible movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Meteor Man" (MGM/UA); A clever idea -- the ghetto-ization of the Superman 
myth -- is ruined by director-star Robert Townsend, who plays a modest 
'hood-dweller turned super-hero. Even all the star cameos can't energize this 
lame comedy. Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
 "The Secret Garden" (Tuesday); "Man Without a Face," "The Program," "Benefit 
of the Doubt" and "Calendar Girl" (Wednesday); "For Love or Money," "Son of the 
Pink Panther," "Dazed and Confused," "Son-in-Law," "Needful Things," "Strictly 
Ballroom" and "Boxing Helena" (Feb. 23); "Demolition Man," "Much Ado About 
Nothing," "The Good Son" and "Striking Distance" (March 2); "The Fox and the 
Hound" (March 4).

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; 'FIRM' KEEPS FIRM GRIP ON NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 This is getting monotonous. Once again, "The Firm" holds off "Sleepless in 
Seattle" (No. 2) and "Dave" (No. 3). Though "Dave" seems doomed to permanent 
also-ran status, "Sleepless" may not be slumbering in second much longer. With 
Valentine's Day coming up, retailers are gearing up for a run on this romantic 
movie. If this doesn't boost it into the top spot, nothing will. Jean-Claude 
Van Damme's latest action movie, "Hard Target," may turn out to be his biggest 
rental hit. A $31.5-million grosser, it opened at No. 11 and could make the Top 
5. The silly "Coneheads" comedy, which debuted at No. 18, may get enough rental 
action from fans of low-brow comedy to push it into the Top 10. Expected to be 
huge box office, it registered just a mild $18.5-million gross. "Poetic 
Justice," starring Janet Jackson, started quietly, debuting at No. 34. It did 
decently in theaters--$27.5 million--and is expected to be a big hit among 
young black, music-oriented renters. 04,05,31,06,08 Rank Weeks Last on the Week

reality-juggling, Arnold Schwarzenegger movie but not nearly as many as 
expected. The gross--$50 million--was a drop in the bucket compared to what's 
needed for this staggeringly expensive movie to show a profit. Schwarzenegger 
couldn't lure moviegoers to this action-adventure movie, which got many bad 
reviews, but he should be able to attract renters. But the first week--a No. 13 
debut--wasn't great. Its position next week will be a better indication of its 
ultimate rental fate.

POP ALBUM CHART; J.M. MONTGOMERY'S 'KICKIN' IT UP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Country singer John Michael Montgomery has been the target of some nasty 
critical cracks--like being dubbed Billy Ray Cyrus II, the country hunk, 
flash-in-the-pan, etc. So with "Kickin' It Up" reaching the top of the pop 
album chart in just two weeks, he must be kickin' up his heels with joy--and 
thumbing his nose at all those detractors. Even after the album entered at No. 
3 last week, many were predicting it would sink quickly out of the Top 10. That 
loud noise you hear is those detractors eating crow. NKOTB, alias New Kids on 
the Block, must be singing the blues about its new album, "Face the Music." 
After debuting at No. 37 last week, it dropped to No. 75. One theory is that 
they distanced themselves so much from their old teen-idol image that their 
hard-core fans don't know they have a new album. Another theory is that judging 
from the scathing reviews, it's simply a bad album fans don't care about. 
Celine Dion's "The Power of Love" is still the No. 1 pop single. 04,53,06,08,08

THEATER REVIEW; 'THE WAY OF THE WORLD' IS A MOUTHFUL FOR CAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Way of the World" may be the prize of Restoration comedy, but it's no 
cakewalk for actors. In fact, as the ambitious production that opened last 
weekend at the Powerhouse proves, it requires a command of both theatrical 
style and complex language. And if you can't speak the speech, you can't play 
the play. 
</P>
<P>
 A late-17th, early 18th-Century genre written for an audience of men and women 
of leisure, Restoration comedy is rife with love dalliances between pompous 
rakes, lecherous old dames, dull cuckolds and sundry other cads and fops who 
converse in flashy, epigrammatic speech. 
</P>
<P>
 In William Congreve's "The Way of the World," the lovers and poseurs who plot 
against one another are distinguished not by their ethics, but by how well they 
pull off their own personal style, whatever that may be. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Philip Littell shrewdly understands this comedy of manners as an 
amoral, rather than immoral, satire of society's vanity. He keeps the action 
appropriately light but not too light, and the interactions tinged with double 
entendre. 
</P>
<P>
 The action unfolds on a striking abstract set (by Kip Marsh) dominated by rows 
of turquoise chairs and a central miniature house that reveals surprises 
throughout the play. It's a flexible backdrop that suggests both the 
superficiality and the ambiguity of a world preoccupied with fashion and 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no matter how good you make it look, it's how your actors handle the text 
that makes or breaks Restoration comedy. And that's where Littell has a major 
problem -- namely, most of his cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Littell does have a bona fide comic diva in Jacque Lynn Colton. 
An estimable actress who came on board as a replacement only after the 
earthquake, she's nonetheless light-years more flamboyant, intelligent and 
articulate than anyone else onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if Colton's Lady Wishfort dominated the action throughout as she does 
in Act IV, the evening would be almost beyond reproach. Unfortunately though, 
that's not the way of this world. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Duffy (Petulant) and David Quicksall (Witwoud), and to a lesser extent 
Paul Marius (Mr. Fainall), are also up to Congreve's task and able to get the 
jokes across. But they stand out in a production replete with mumble mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are other problems. The mostly modern costumes coordinated by Lisa 
Gold are so random and unindicative of character that they look as though the 
actors were simply told to bring something from home to wear. And, with the 
stage's front four doors open to accommodate the design scheme, the Powerhouse 
gets very cold, so audience members too need to bring something warm from home 
to wear. 
</P>
<P>

Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends March 13. $12. (310)

THEATER BEAT; 'HUMAN COMEDY': A PAROCHIAL MUSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William Saroyan, as critic Brooks Atkinson once noted, was a wildly uneven 
writer. His plays contain flashes of poignance amid rambling melodrama, and 
cleverly eccentric characters alongside cardboard cutouts. But "The Human 
Comedy" at the West Coast Ensemble is a musical adaptation of a Saroyan story 
that gives us only the lesser Saroyan, and it's mostly hometown hooey. 
</P>
<P>
 Set during the 1940s in a small California burg not unlike the one in which 
Saroyan himself was born, "The Human Comedy" focuses on a widow and her 
children, including one son, Homer (game Richard Israel), who takes a job as a 
telegram messenger, and another, Marcus (the unemotive Scott Poland), who's 
away at war. 
</P>
<P>
 Homer's duties delivering war department notices every time one of the town's 
young men are killed in action provide the pathos. He tries to keep a stiff 
upper lip, the town girls pine away for their fellas overseas and the stalwart 
Mother (capable Angela DeCicco) struggles to keep her brood together, as life 
goes quaintly on. 
</P>
<P>
 Act I is mostly expository, but it's a familiar scenario that could be 
sketched in half the time. It's not until well into Act II that the story 
spends time with a character -- Marcus' war buddy Toby (lukewarm but honest 
Bill Dispoto) -- who makes this ditty the least bit memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the music (by Galt MacDermot, libretto by William Dumaresq) -- 
which consists mostly of full-cast numbers and a few more intimate songs -- is 
as uneventful as the plot, which you can pretty much scope out by the end of 
the first few scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Director David Gately gives the production a Thomas Hart Benton-lite look. 
He's also done a passable job with traffic control, shuttling an energetic if 
uneven cast around the multileveled playing area. Yet he hasn't added any 
layers to a musical that's ultimately as flat as the Central California valley 
in which it's set. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Human Comedy," West Coast Ensemble, 6240 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood . 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Runs indefinitely. $15. (213) 
871-1052. Running time: 2 hours, 25 minutes. Talent Wasted on This 'Cabaret' 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Any lingering doubts that there are some first-rate stage talents in L.A. 
who've got a bit too much time on their hands should be dispelled by "An 
Off-Broadway Cabaret." The first production at the new 60-seat Tonto & Dietz 
cabaret is an expertly crafted if ill-conceived evening of songs that's got 
everything going for it except a reason to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The charismatic and amply talented Bonnie Franklin, Byron Nease, Teri Ralston 
and Gary Sandy wend their way through a pastiche of show tunes compiled by 
Marilyn Shapiro (the venue's titular Tonto). The songs range from classics such 
as "Threepenny Opera" to duds like "Godspell" and even "You're a Good Man, 
Charlie Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Lara Teeter's seamless direction is both precise and inventive, although he 
tends to go heavy on the cutesy stuff. The program, however, lacks a conceptual 
core, swinging as it does between, say, Sondheim's provocative ambiguity and 
Maltby and Shire's drivel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, it makes you wonder why pros like these would bother with such an 
iffy vehicle. Surely there's not that little work out there. But then again, 
maybe there is. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Chambers Stevens' "Desperate for Magic" at Theatre Geo may not be a killer 
show, but the dude is worthy. Way. 
</P>
<P>
 A personable guy dressed in clean blue jeans, Stevens is a pre-pre-boomer's 
dream of what a Gen Xer should be. His show is a breezy one-man monologue in 
which Stevens portrays more than a dozen characters, including a string of 
Southern twentysomethings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the guises are underdeveloped, the setups are familiar and there's not 
much of a through line. But there are several turns within this rapid-fire 
chain of personas, cleanly directed by Betsy Sullenger, that give you a glimpse 
of this young actor's considerable presence and potential. 
</P>
<P>
 When he appears as a white guy who wants to be black, for instance, Stevens 
segues into a surprisingly lithe dance sequence. And in another compelling bit, 
he plays a deaf man who speaks both aloud and in sign language. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece is bracketed by Stevens' autobiographical narrations, which tend to 
be cloying -- even when he's talking about his mother's death. But then again, 
Stevens is so unaffected that he almost gets away with it.

 How do you spell "Twin Peeks: Two One-Act Comedies"? S-h-o-w-c-a-s-e -- as in 
a play that's staged just because some actors figure it's a good way to get 
themselves seen during pilot season. This bill at the Court isn't the worst 
case of audition theater ever, but it doesn't have much inherent dramatic value 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 In Peter Tolan's "Pillow Talk," two guys on a road trip find themselves forced 
to share a bed for the night. Pleasantly unflashy Joshua Malina is an effective 
comedian who makes the most of a limited role. Tom Gallop, on the other hand, 
is a bundle of twitchy mannerisms who mugs his way through the entire piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Aaron Sorkin ("A Few Good Men") earns a couple of chuckles with 
"Hidden in This Picture," an attenuated one-liner about a novice film 
director's hubris as he's shooting the final shot of his first film. Malina 
acquits himself decently here too, playing an insecure screenwriter to Gallop's 
director, but Gallop simply reprises the grimaces he used in the first play.

DANCE REVIEW; MORRIS PLUS BEETHOVEN WREAKS 'MAELSTROM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Choreographer Mark Morris has abandoned his recent irony and returned to his 
unique sense of musicality to create "Maelstrom," which is receiving its 
premiere performances this week by the San Francisco Ballet at the War Memorial 
Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
 Only this time, as seen Wednesday, his much-admired musical talents have 
turned out an odd and unsatisfactory work, although the company dances it well. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris sends seven couples surging in various plotless combinations and 
permutations to Beethoven's Piano Trio No. 4, Opus 70, No. 1 ("Ghost"). He 
again spices balletic technique with folk motifs and gymnastic movements. Again 
he finds movement motivations in the rhythmic subdivisions of measures, a 
mosaic technique of construction that worked so wondrously for him when he 
applied it to Vivaldi and Handel. 
</P>
<P>
 But against Beethoven's longer lines and contrasting themes, the results often 
looked busy, fussy, arbitrary and insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The recurring disjunctive patterns -- dancers running in and out or making 
dead stops, flexing a foot or hand to break the line or push the air or 
accentuate a musical pause -- best fit the musical starts and stops in the 
final presto, but did not reveal anything about them. In the other two 
movements, the choreography appeared even more disassociated from the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Maelstrom, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 James Ingalls created the moody lighting and the cloud backdrops. Martin 
Pakledinaz designed the ruby, bare-shouldered gowns for the women, and the 
matching romantic outfits for the men. 
</P>
<P>
 Violinist Roy Malan, cellist David Kadarauch and pianist Roy Bogas played the 
Beethoven score with reasonable sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from Helgi Tomasson's overwrought pas de trois love triangle 
"Forevermore" (Dvorak) danced lyrically by Sabina Allemann and dutifully by 
Rodolphe Cassand and Yuri Zhukov, the rest of the program provided two related 
examples of other plotless responses to music. 
</P>
<P>
 The kaleidoscopic neoclassical symmetries of Lew Christensen's "Vivaldi 
Concerto Grosso" looked less taxing to the dancers than did such obvious 
inspirational sources as those found in Balanchine's "Symphony in C," which 
closed the program. Still, Allemann brought Swan Queen amplitude and stillness 
to the Second Movement, in an otherwise decidedly uncrisp performance of the 
work. CHRIS PASLES

MUSIC REVIEW; SOME HIGHS AND LOWS WITH MOSCOW VIRTUOSI IN CERRITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still on the road, still all-male, still often living up to its immodest name, 
the Moscow Virtuosi remains a viable musical ensemble worthy of its good 
reputation. Vladimir Spivakov leads the group he founded 15 years ago; these 
days, its headquarters is not the capital of Russia, but the Northwest region 
of Spain: Asturias. 
</P>
<P>
 Between East Coast and Northern California dates this week, the 22-member 
orchestra stopped in Southern California for a single concert at the Cerritos 
Center for the Performing Arts -- and reminded veteran watchers that when it is 
alert, it plays wonderfully well, but when it is not interested, its 
performances can become boring. 
</P>
<P>
 Both kinds of playing characterized its Wednesday night concert at the 
Cerritos showplace, arranged on this occasion in that configuration, which 
holds 960 listeners. There was a Mozart symphony, two concertos by Haydn and 
Shostakovich's Chamber Symphony in F -- a generous program not truly engaging 
until its last half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the orchestral version of Shostakovich's Third String Quartet, a work 
that begins in empty-headedness and ends in poignancy, having passed by that 
time through melancholy, irony and bitterness. The performance emerged 
emotionally pointed, perfectly gauged dynamically and texturally transparent. 
</P>
<P>
 All members seemed to participate in the success and integration of this 
reading, but two soloists in particular contributed most strongly: 
concertmaster Arkady Futer and principal cellist Mikhail Milman. 
</P>
<P>
 What preceded this programmatic climax was a series of incomplete starts: 
Mozart's Symphony No. 29 in a dutiful run-through clearly unconnected with its 
true greatness; Haydn's C-major Cello Concerto, a fine showcase for the 
unfolding talents of the 20-year-old American soloist, Wendy Warner, and 
Haydn's C-major Violin Concerto, in which Spivakov again revealed his steely 
brilliant technique, tight control and abundant skills as a fiddler. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra mustered a mediocre accompaniment for the guest soloist, a more 
careful musical collaboration with its violinist-leader.

REELS FROM THE RIM; THE FILMS IN FESTIVAL HONG KONG, AT GLENDALE'S REGENCY ONE, 
DELIVER A KARATE CHOP TO THE STEREOTYPICAL KUNG FU FLICK.

 What a way to toast a new year. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chinese New Year accompanied with Chinese films representing some of the 
best in classic and modern Hong Kong action-comedy thrillers. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts today -- this second day of the Chinese lunar calendar's Year of the 
Dog -- as the Pacific Regency One Theatre in Glendale embarks on a two-week run 
of the Second Annual Festival Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, which received positive reviews and netted nearly $50,000 in 
ticket sales last year at the Santa Monica 4-Plex and Burbank Media Center's 
AMC Theatres, features 14 films dating as far back as 1978 and as recent as 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer just stereotypical kung fu flicks, these Hong Kong imports have 
attracted a growing non-Asian audience in various cities across the country, 
said Tom Gray, festival brainchild and president of Rim Film Distributors Inc. 
Gray has made a one-year commitment to show only Asian films in Glendale's 
Regency One. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal of the Hong Kong films stems not only from the upgrade in story 
lines -- action mixed with drama, romance, sex and humor -- but also from some 
of the talented actors themselves, considered throwbacks to such handsome and 
dashing Hollywood characters as Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Gray and 
critics have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the films' original Chinese titles have been changed for Western 
distribution, some of them spiced up with allusions to American movies 
("Robotrix," an erotic movie, for instance, from "RoboCop"). English subtitles 
also have been added, for audiences that may not understand the mainly 
Cantonese-speaking characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these films are now getting a wider acceptance that would not exist 10 
years ago," Gray said. "Really, the Hong Kong films are covering every single 
genre. . . . We've become an alternative to the basic bland Hollywood movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Browne, professor of critical studies at UCLA's film and television 
department, has become an Asian film buff himself, and he agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hong Kong cinema, seems to me, has crossed over and has found a general 
American audience," Browne said. "It's gone way beyond a kung fu movie. This is 
very sophisticated action drama." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne, one of the authors in a recently published book on "New Chinese 
Cinemas," particularly lauds the directing of John Woo, whose 1991 hit "Once a 
Thief" plays Feb. 21-22 and epitomizes the enhanced Hong Kong style of 
filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once a Thief" is actually about a trio of international art thieves -- Joe 
(Chow Yun-Fat), Cherie (Cherie Chung) and Jim (Leslie Cheung) -- trained to 
steal valuable paintings for their cruel, selfish master-teacher (Kenneth Tsang 
Kong). 
</P>
<P>
 For an hour and 46 minutes, they laugh, smile, cry and grit their teeth 
through a series of cunning heists, shootouts and slapstick and romantic 
interludes, including a hilarious scene in which Joe maneuvers a wheelchair 
along the ballroom dance floor with the grace of Fred Astaire. All the while, 
he's smiling as if he's disco dancing a la John Travolta. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, also surprisingly, opens in Paris, with French dialogue, in the 
first couple of minutes before the action moves on to the Riviera, Hong Kong 
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "(It's) cleverly constructed and entertainingly told," Browne said. "There's 
humor and action that goes beyond any Chinese context. It's something that an 
American audience can recognize and appreciate right away." 
</P>
<P>
 "Chow Yun-Fat seems to me a kind of a Hong Kong Cary Grant," he added. "He's 
suave, romantic and has a good sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 One half of today's double feature is Kirk Wong's "Crime Story," starring 
Jackie Chan as a Hong Kong police inspector who tries to solve the kidnaping of 
a businessman, a story based on a real case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray likens Chan, who does his own stunts, to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie Chan is a combination of all the great action stars of America," he 
said. "He's been the No. 1 action star in Japan, for example, in the last seven 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing outside the Pacific Regency last week, the tall, gray-haired film 
distributor and producer embodies the spirit of a Chan character, who usually 
defies the odds and comes out a winner in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray first did it when he formed Rim Film in September, 1992, and three months 
later experimented with the first two-week Festival Hong Kong at Santa Monica's 
Nuart, taking in $30,000 in ticket grosses, which he considered successful. He 
has since moved the film showings to the Santa Monica 4-Plex, where he leases a 
movie screen that attracts an 85% non-Asian audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of skepticism, even in Hong Kong," he said. "They said it would 
never play." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the producer who played a role in bringing the "Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles" to the big screen hopes to see Santa Monica's success duplicated in 
Glendale -- a city of 180,000 that is trying to strengthen its arts and 
entertainment offerings, as seen in the recent reopening of the Alex Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Regency One, faced with slumping ticket sales, had shut down at 
the end of July, 1993. Between August and December, the 600-seat movie house 
featured commercial hits for the hearing impaired, shown with subtitles, said 
Bob Baron, theater manager. (That service has since moved to another site, the 
Pacific Roxy Theatre, 417 1/2 N. Brand Blvd., Baron said.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gray saw an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at the demographics of Glendale and surrounding areas," Gray said. 
"We thought it was a nice place . . . for us to build a circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not catering to an Asian audience. We're catering to wide masses -- 
people who want to see the best in Asian cinema." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Glendale Mayor Larry Zarian: "I think it would be a plus for the city. 
Any time that you bring in arts to the city, it's a plus. Art is something that 
you don't (always) need to understand in words." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled by it," said Browne, of UCLA. "It means that it's not confined 
to the Chinatown cinemas. It's going mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Hong Kong festival ends Feb. 24, Gray plans to continue showing 
films from various parts of Asia, including Japan, Korea and the Philippines, 
at the Regency One. He said he is also looking into stretching the Asian film 
circuit to theaters in Pasadena, Gardena and possibly the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And he insists that American interest in Asian films will not fade like 
yesterday's fad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see it as an ongoing venture. . . . We're going to do a lot of 
experimenting with films, festivals, retrospectives of some of the great 
(Asian) directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole goal is to keep it fresh." Festival Hong Kong in Glendale

 The Second Annual Festival Hong Kong will play at the Pacific Regency One 
Theatre, 210 S. Brand Blvd., Glendale, today through Feb 24. Tickets are $6 for

HAPPY WITH THE BLUES; AFTER 30 YEARS PERFORMING AND RECORDING, JOHN MAYALL IS 
FINALLY GETTING SOME INDUSTRY RECOGNITION. BUT DURING HIS CAREER, HIS FANS HAVE 
GIVEN HIM ALL THE SUPPORT HE NEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Steve Appleford writes regularly 
about music for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 British blues man John Mayall has rarely depended on recognition to fuel his 
music. He's yet to earn a gold record and has never appeared on the cover of 
Roll ing Stone. Mayall says the passion of his chosen musical genre has been 
enough to keep him going all these decades. 
</P>
<P>
 So how is it that in March the 60-year-old singer-musician will find himself 
in appropriate attire at the New York ceremonies of the Grammy Awards? Mayall's 
recent "Wake Up Call" album is nominated for best contemporary blues album. 
</P>
<P>
 He laughs. "That's a first, isn't it? It only took 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
 None of Mayall's nearly 30 other albums have received any acknowledgment from 
the Grammys, American Music Awards, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, etc., etc. 
Mayall says he's never felt much frustration over any of this, or over the 
lesser priority some of today's major labels give the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout my career I have always gone my own way anyway," says Mayall, who 
now lives in Los Angeles. "I haven't really had to be influenced or that much 
involved with what they thought. My career has always been totally secure and 
supported by the fans, who have been legion over the years and continue to 
grow." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the man's significant contribution to the development of rock and 
blues music was established almost from the beginning of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, that contribution has been simply to create a fertile environment for 
other musicians to develop their own careers. Years before their own music took 
them to various degrees of pop stardom, such players as Eric Clapton, Mick 
Taylor (later of the Rolling Stones), Peter Green (co-founder of Fleetwood Mac) 
and Jack Bruce (Cream) performed some of their earliest gigs in Mayall's 
Bluesbreakers band. Mayall launched the band in 1963, helping spark the blues 
scene in London. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Rolling Stone Album Guide" said Mayall's albums "provide fascinating 
glimpses of talents not yet fully developed, and they certainly testify to 
Mayall's industry and influence." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the Bluesbreakers quartet includes Mayall on keyboards, harmonica 
and guitar, Rick Cortes on bass, drummer Joe Yuele and lead guitarist Buddy 
Whittington (who replaces Coco Montoya, now a solo artist). And it is that 
lineup that will perform Saturday night at the Palomino in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Wake Up Call," released in 1993, the Bluesbreakers were joined by a number 
of noted players, including Taylor, Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples and the late 
Albert Collins, in one of his last recorded performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are friendships that go on and on forever," Mayall says of the 
musicians he's played with over the years. "It just depends on the geographical 
location. But in the course of our work around the world, we do 120 shows every 
year in 15 countries, so we're bound to run into people on the festivals and 
things. The blues community is usually a pretty tight-knit family." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayall says he hopes that for his next album he will work again with the 
production team of R.S. Field and Dave McNair that helped create "Wake Up Call" 
and 1990's "A Sense of Place." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the latest stage of a musical career Mayall didn't begin until he was 30, 
inspired by the old records of such blues pioneers as Big Bill Broonzy and 
Sonny Boy Williamson. "That was my creative outlet," Mayall says. "I played 
guitar and piano, and it was something I never thought would be fit for public 
consumption." 
</P>
<P>
 And like the older players that inspired him, Mayall sees his own years behind 
the microphone as a preliminary stage for a talent that continues to develop. 
"The maturity in the singing and playing is something that a blues man is 
always developing. That's really what it's all about. The longer you play the 
more you learn." Where and When What: John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, with 
Blackberry Jam. Location: The Palomino, 6907 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood. 
Hours: 9 p.m. Saturday. Price: $15. Call: (818) 764-4010.

SONGS OF THE HEART; JEANNE AND JOHN PISANO, A.K.A. THE FLYING PISANOS, SEEM 
PERFECTLY MATED IN MARRIAGE AND IN THEIR BAND. BUT MUSIC WASN'T WHAT BROUGHT 
THEM TOGETHER.

 Jeanne and John Pisano have a wonderful aspect to their thriving, 18-month 
marriage: The singer and guitarist, calling themselves the Flying Pisanos, have 
a tidy little band offering everything from originals in the Brazilian mode to 
natty versions of classic standards such as "My Ship." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny thing, though. The Pisanos didn't really investigate their potential for 
musical affinity when they were falling in love. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first there were so many pluses," says John Pisano, the gifted jazz 
guitarist who composed a few hits for Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass, of which he 
was a long-term member. Then he found out how good a singer she is, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "John knew I was a singer, but I didn't make a big thing about it," says 
Jeanne Pisano, a professional vocalist for more than 20 years who has spent 
much of her career as a teacher. "I didn't want to. It was about us as people 
first." 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the scary part," says John Pisano at the couple's home in Studio 
City. "She was so perfect" as a mate. "Supposing she's a bad singer. What do 
you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 So their musical relationship blossomed very naturally and relaxedly. "He'd be 
noodling on a tune, and I'd kind of fall in, and he'd say something like, 'Hey, 
you've got great pitch,' " Jeanne says. "Then we started doing standards around 
the house. We started working on music because it was fun and felt good." 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians decided they wanted to perform, but not a lot. "We didn't want 
to set the world on fire," John says. "We just wanted to do some fun gigs." The 
couple have appeared at Lunaria in West Los Angeles, done a 10-day stint in 
Hong Kong, and will perform Sunday at the Room Upstairs at Le Cafe in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's complete freedom for us," he says. "This girl is a marvelous musician. 
She has a fantastic range, and great musicality. I can get lost, and she goes 
straight ahead. Nothing throws her." 
</P>
<P>
 Heard on a demo tape, the Pisanos sound special. Jeanne's alto voice is clear 
and warm, and she sings with feeling and panache. John Pisano, long regarded as 
one of the top jazz guitar players, supports his wife's vocals with delicately 
placed chords and solos with ringing, melodic lines that please the ear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pisanos say they were in love from their first meeting, in 1990 -- at a 
party given by Heather Gold, a former student of Jeanne Pisano's -- Gold had 
planned to introduce them. And at Le Cafe, they'll offer plenty of songs of the 
heart, including, it goes without saying, "My Funny Valentine." 
</P>
<P>
 "How could we not?" asks Jeanne rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple also will offer some of their piquant originals, many in a 
Brazilian or Latin vein, and equipped with lyrics by Jeanne Pisano, who has 
devised words for songs recorded by Cleo Laine and Dianne Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne says she's been writing lyrics off and on for many years, adding that 
she works in a completely intuitive manner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "For 'Awake, My Love,' written for Cleo, I just heard the music, and it was 
like a movie unfolded before my eyes," she says. "I don't even feel like I 
wrote it. It just flowed through me." Another lyric, written recently, came to 
her while she was ironing, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 John says he has had similar experiences as a composer. "I just sit there and 
wait for these things to come," he says. "I'll put a fragment on tape, then 
another, and one day they'll all fit together. Where does it come from? I can't 
explain it." 
</P>
<P>
 The name "the Flying Pisanos" arose as a gag from a friend, the keyboardist 
Edward del Barrio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeanne and John sounded so corny we couldn't stand it, and Eddie suggested 
the name as a gag," says John Pisano. "It seemed silly enough to make it. It's 
now the name of our publishing company as well, and maybe one day we'll get in 
a circus." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Pisanos are hoping to do an album, maybe make some commercials, 
they'd really like to find a hotel bar in a place like Italy, and work there 
for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our fantasy," John says. Where and When What: The Flying Pisanos, who 
appear with Brian Kilgore, percussion, Matt Harris, keyboards, and Ken Wild, 
bass. Location: The Room Upstairs at Le Cafe, 14633 Ventura Blvd., Sherman 
Oaks. Hours: 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. Sunday. Price: $5 cover, two-drink minimum.

CAMERA OF RECORD; GENE BARNES WAS PRESENT AT THE CREATION OF TV NEWS. HIS 
DOCUMENTARY STILLS ARE HAVING THEIR FIRST EXHIBIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 When Gene Barnes went to work for NBC News in Los Angeles as an apprentice 
cameraman in 1952, he probably gave little thought to the fact that he was 
joining an enterprise that would contribute to changing the way most Americans 
receive their news. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone had a television set then. Many people still saw filmed news 
stories only in movie theaters, where newsreels were shown before the feature. 
But theatrical newsreels were dying as television brought news into our living 
rooms and made household names of broadcast journalists such as John Cameron 
Swayze, Chet Huntley and David Brinkley. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes' first job at NBC was with Swayze on the "Camel News Caravan." He also 
shot the first pictures of Huntley that were shown on television, when Huntley 
was working in Los Angeles. Soon after, NBC moved Huntley to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1952 and 1965, Barnes was assigned to shoot film stories of everything 
from hard news and politics to science, art and entertainment. He always took 
two cameras with him -- a motion picture camera for NBC News, and a still 
camera for his personal edification. 
</P>
<P>
 His stills have never been exhibited, until now. The Orlando Gallery is 
presenting 86 of his compelling 16-by-20-inch black-and-white prints in the 
show, "I, Witness, Documentary Portraits of the '50s and '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 A picture of Nikita Khrushchev during his 1959 visit to Los Angeles shares 
gallery space with a pensive Maurice Chevalier near the end of his life; Nehru, 
prime minister of India, on a tour of Disneyland, and Walter Winchell at work. 
Winchell sits at a typewriter before a row of photographs of strippers, part of 
the Los Angeles' Federal Building's press room scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes captured the likes of Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. 
Johnson and Richard M. Nixon, as well as the Atlas missile launch in 1955 and 
an atom bomb explosion in 1957. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright, Watts Towers 
creator Simon Rodia and Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller also came before his 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very important and impressive collection of photography," said 
gallery director Bob Gino. "It's a documentation of a time and an era that is 
very significant to our world in all aspects, especially about California. 
There is so much about California here." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes learned to take pictures in the Navy during World War II. "You had to 
shoot everything -- stills, motion pictures, aerial photography, whatever 
photography had to be done on board a carrier or a base," said Barnes, 67, a 
Studio City resident. "And you had to be able to process it whether it was 
motion pictures or a still, color or black and white." 
</P>
<P>
 As an apprentice cameraman in the early '50s, Barnes "had the pleasure" of 
working with many of the theatrical newsreel cameramen, he said. "They taught 
me so much." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of the images in the show are of people behind the camera. Barnes 
said they are "the hardest subjects in the world to photograph. And they were 
not just a challenge, they were friends, and I wanted to see if I could capture 
the essence of the people who show everybody else what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1957, Barnes altered the nature of film coverage of news events when he 
took his 16-millimeter sound camera off its tripod and put it on his shoulder 
to grab an exclusive interview with killer Steve Nash in Los Angeles. Nash had 
been convicted and sentenced to death, and was on his way to San Quentin's 
Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd killed 11 people. He was scary. I could only cover the man silent, and 
yet his vocabulary, the stories and things he would tell, were so gruesome. I 
thought the public has to hear this man as well. They wouldn't let us in the 
jail anywhere with a sound camera," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still pictures of Nash, as well as statements he made on his way to Death Row, 
are included in the exhibit. Where and When What: "I, Witness, Documentary 
Portraits of the '50s and '60s." Location: Orlando Gallery, 14553 Ventura 
Blvd., Sherman Oaks. Hours: 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays. Ends 
Feb. 26. Call: (818) 789-6012.

LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP; 'WOMEN OF MANHATTAN,' FROM THE SHANLEY SCRIPT, EXAMINES 
WOMEN'S MIXED EMOTIONS ABOUT MEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Women and men, men and women. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about three women, talking about hating men, loving men -- and the 
difficulties in opening their hearts, taking risks with relationships," says 
Lisa Lund, who's producing and co-starring in John Patrick Shanley's 
five-character comedy "Women of Manhattan," which begins previews tonight at 
the Little Victory Theatre. The trio of females includes married Billie, loner 
Judy and Lund's Southern belle Rhonda Louise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her outlook's a lot like mine," Lund says. "She's the rock of the group, the 
common thread, maintaining control, gentle, always the lady. She tries to find 
the bright side of love, though she has a little bitterness and insecurity in 
her heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "My (former) partner and I read a million scripts, but this one stuck out. 
Shanley writes highly textured characters, lots of colors. The message is, 
we're all different -- and that's OK. It's OK for you to handle life 
differently than I do." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Fresno -- where she appeared in productions of "The Importance of 
Being Earnest" and "Butterflies Are Free" -- Lund graduated from Cal State 
Fresno with a degree in journalism, detoured to Europe for six months, and 
settled in Los Angeles 5 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Women," the maiden vehicle for her Curly Two Productions, Lund hopes 
also to strike a happy blow for feminism. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it should never have been The Year of the Woman," she says 
matter-of-factly. "They should all be years of women." 
</P>
<P>
 Play director Katherine Huston has the advantage of knowing her actresses 
well: They've also been her students at Film Industry Workshops in Studio City, 
where Huston has taught acting and directing for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three of them popped right into my head," she notes of the casting. 
"They're all very talented; each fits their part perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her fondness for her cast, Huston -- who also works at the 
Costume Collection in North Hollywood, and is an actress and screenwriter -- 
sings the praises of playwright Shanley ("Danny and the Deep Blue Sea," 
"Moonstruck"). 
</P>
<P>
 "You know when you read a piece of material and you recognize it, recognize 
the people and the things in it -- when you say, 'I've done that' or 'I've said 
that'?" says Huston. "That's good writing, when you have that kind of 
recognition -- and I really felt that here." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Texas, Huston says she knew what she wanted to do since she played the 
front end of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer in a first-grade play. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation from West Texas State University, she headed straight to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out here to be Frank Capra," the director says, only half kiddingly. 
"I grew up watching the old movies. Film is wonderful to me, pure magic. It's 
one of the reasons I like working in this theater: It's so intimate. You can do 
the big moments, and the small moments too." Where and When What: "Women of 
Manhattan." Location: Little Victory Theatre, 3326 W. Victory Blvd., Burbank. 
Hours: 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 7 p.m. Sundays. Ends March 27. Price: $15.

AL CAPONE MUSICAL DRAMA MISFIRES; THE OVERWROUGHT PLAY ABOUT THE NOTORIOUS 
GANGSTER TAKES ITSELF TOO SERIOUSLY AND LACKS FOCUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Ray Loynd writes regularly about theater

<TEXT>
<P>
 A musical about Al Capone, including Big Al cooing love ballads through the 
bars of his cell, sounds like a promising idea if it were staged in the wicked 
spirit of "Springtime for Hitler" (the Broadway show that's so bad it's a smash 
within Mel Brooks' movie "The Producers"). 
</P>
<P>
 But staged largely with a straight face, the Al Capone musical comedy-drama 
"Knockin' 'em Dead," at the West End Playhouse in Van Nuys, is merely 
bewildering. And disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a show you want to love. Twelve years in the making, Mike Reynolds' 
score, lyrics and book feature a 25-member cast performing 60 characters and 15 
musical numbers spanning song styles from 1919, when Capone first hits Chicago, 
until he expires in 1947 after his release from Alcatraz. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides coping with that large stretch of musical and gangster territory, 
director David Cox had to find a new space when the quake shattered his 
theatrical home, the American Renegade Theatre in North Hollywood, only four 
days before the show was to open. The production-salvaging switch to the West 
End has worked out fine (the seats are cushiony, but beware the cramped leg 
room). 
</P>
<P>
 Told in flashback, the show opens with a ragtime beat in a Wabash Avenue 
Italian joint brimming with vivid Jazz Age characters in shimmering gowns, 
camel's-hair coats, fancy fedoras and double-breasted suits. There's even a 
scruffy street urchin with a shoeshine box (Linzi Wittmack) straight out of a 
Jackie Coogan movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Your anticipation is high. Right off, the show looks smart, with one of the 
most ambitious costume designs (credited to Jessica Hall, Kathleen Demor and 
Butterfly Chief) you will ever see in a 99-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than two hours later, the striking clothes are essentially about all 
that's left to croon about. 
</P>
<P>
 This despite colorful acting turns (notably the well-cast Josh Cruze as 
Capone), a Gilbert and Sullivan-inspired courtroom trial number, and staccato 
bursts of gunfire so muffled and soft they amount to theater's first 
politically correct machine-gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The hoods include Bugs Moran (played by the versatile Clancy Halsey, who 
produced the show and ably portrays five, count 'em, five characters) and the 
red-headed gangland florist Dion O'Bannion (sweet-sounding tenor Bart Sumner, 
warbling a lovely Irish ballad before being shot and crumbling into a basket of 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The production's overriding, numbing problem is its unfocused tone, which 
takes itself too seriously. The show veers from a "Guys and Dolls" swagger 
(albeit without the humor and crispness) to ragged melodrama to misty-eyed love 
songs that appear ludicrous coming from Al Capone. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the feeling Reynolds almost loves this guy, perhaps because, according 
to an anecdote the playwright likes to tell, the real Capone once gave 
Reynolds' mother a $5 gold coin at a cigar counter, a gesture that inspired 
this musical decades later. 
</P>
<P>
 This is certainly the most audience-friendly Capone in the history of mobster 
lore. Miraculously, despite the odds stacked against him, the ruggedly 
attractive Cruz almost pulls it off. What kills the actor (not to mention 
Capone) is a weepy deathbed scene played alongside Capone's grieving wife Mae 
(the pearly voiced Cheryl Cameron). 
</P>
<P>
 If you didn't know any better, you would swear Mel Brooks had a devilish hand 
in this unending deathbed scene -- it's that incredible. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there's a sensual dance number symbolizing the Capone couple's mutual 
romantic love (and sensually danced by Darlene Colaiuta and Kevin J. O'Neill). 
But it's entirely played out on a stage so irritatingly dark and artsy-moody 
that you can't see the dancers' bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if only Capone's safe would show up, we could have a sequel. Where and 
When What: "Knockin' 'em Dead." Location: West End Playhouse, 7446 Van Nuys 
Blvd., Van Nuys. Hours: 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 7 p.m. Sunday, 
indefinitely. Price: $12 to $15. Call: (818) 763-4430.

BEATING HIMSELF UP; 'FREAK OF NATURE' CHRONICLES ONE MAN'S JOURNEY TO FIND 
SELF-WORTH. PART OF THE PROCEEDS WILL BENEFIT A HOMELESS SHELTER.

 Jo-Jo thinks of himself as a freak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fictional play, based on a friend I knew when I was getting my MFA in 
Indiana," says Ken Hanes, whose dark comedy "Freak of Nature" premieres at the 
Road Theatre, beginning previews Wednesday. "This guy was extremely smart, 
extremely athletic, extremely good-looking -- the kind every girl would want to 
take home to mom," adds the playwright. "But he was the most tortured person I 
ever knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanes' friend had been a model; when the writer met him, he'd given that up to 
go back to school. Yet the distorted self-image was deeply entrenched. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the late 19th Century, there was a popular freak in the circus, Jo-Jo the 
Dog-Faced Boy," Hanes says. "Jo-Jo the character really identifies with him. 
The real guy I knew would do things like shave half of his head, get into 
bulimic stuff and self-flagellation, have dreams about disfiguring himself. As 
a writer, I loved the image of someone who has what most people want -- and he 
doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The piece, which Hanes quips is set alternately "in heaven and hell, New York 
and L.A.," employs seven actors in 25 roles, including angels, God and a 
priest. 
</P>
<P>
 Each production at the Road Theatre benefits a different charity. This time 
out, a portion of the show's proceeds will go to Women's Care Cottage, a San 
Fernando Valley shelter for homeless women and children. (Not coincidentally, 
Hanes' mother also serves on the shelter's board.) 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles native, the 34-year-old writer received his undergraduate degree 
in linguistics from UC Berkeley and a master of fine arts in playwriting from 
Indiana University in Bloomington. Also, he says, "I bummed around, put myself 
through school as a chef, wrote a novel, participated in the Bay Area 
Playwrights Festival." Two of his six plays have been done locally: "Family 
Chills" (The Complex, 1991) and "Lives on the Line" (Celebration Theatre, 
1993). 
</P>
<P>
 Director Che'Rae Adams first came to the Road Theatre in 1992 as the producer 
of Ric Krause's "Why Things Burn," a project she had been involved with as an 
assistant producer in the Mark Taper Forum's Mentor Playwriting Series. Adams, 
who describes herself as a "baby 25," grew up in Encino and graduated from Cal 
State Northridge in 1991; she made her directorial debut in 1992 with Steve 
Simon's "Back Bar" at the Lee Strasberg Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The development of "Freak" -- which included several readings, rewrites and 
improvisational work with the cast -- has stretched out almost a year. "I adore 
Ken," Adams says firmly. "I never had a writer this open to working on a play." 
</P>
<P>
 She describes the story as "a journey one man takes to find self-worth, 
self-esteem. I related to the idea of suppressing feelings so long, and 
learning not to do that anymore. Structurally, it's half-fantasy, half-reality. 
And it's funny. It's hysterical." Where and When What: "Freak of Nature." 
Location: The Road Theatre Company, 14141 Covello St., No. 9-D, Van Nuys. 
Hours: Previews Wednesday and Thursday; opens Feb. 18 and plays Thursdays 
through Sundays at 8 p.m. Closes March 26. Price: $12.50. Call: (818) 785-6175.

 Neighborhoods, crammed from dawn to dusk with traffic, slowly transform by the 
middle of the night into ghost towns, one as gloomy as the next. Mini-malls and 
evening hangouts, noisy and crowded just a few hours earlier, now look sad and 
neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 It must be bedtime for the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time -- midnight to 6 a.m. -- life is unofficially handed over to 
those who make their own rules. Because they work late hours and need somewhere 
to unwind before heading home or because they simply can't fall asleep, the 
night becomes their time to play, relax, hang out. (Nationally, according to 
the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington, about 15 million people 
work at any point between 5 p.m. and 6 a.m. And about 35 million across the 
country suffer from chronic insomnia, the American Sleep Disorders Assn. in 
Rochester, Minn., reports.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have the Kiwanis Club," said Colin Liebich, whose flexible hours 
as a classic car builder allow him time to hopscotch from one early morning 
coffeehouse to another. "These people have the night." 
</P>
<P>
 And not much else. The Valley, reflecting most of America, is partial to 
people with 9-to-5 routines. Most restaurants and nightclubs close by 2 a.m. -- 
the law prohibits the sale of liquor any later. Darkness precludes most leisure 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 But, insomniacs and swing-shifters, rejoice! The Valley does show a pulse in 
the middle of the night. Almost every intersection, it seems, has either a 
24-hour doughnut shop, a convenience store or a Kinko's, and some restaurants, 
such as Denny's and Jerry's Famous Deli, maintain a consistent following 
throughout the night. Plus, pool halls stay open well past midnight. Here are a 
few other signs of after-hours life: Newsstands 
</P>
<P>
 Even brisk winter temperatures can't keep the night owls away from one of 
their most cherished pastimes -- browsing through all-night newsstands. Patrons 
often linger for hours, shuffling from one magazine to another, which doesn't 
escape the perturbed proprietor when he fails to make a sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really resent it when people come who clearly don't have money and aren't 
going to buy anything," said Ron Royce, who works the Friday and Saturday 
graveyard shift at the 24-hour newsstand at Van Nuys and Ventura boulevards in 
Sherman Oaks, a Valley institution since 1948. "And you can just tell who these 
people are." (The Valley's only other all-night newsstand operates at Van Nuys 
and Victory Boulevard in Van Nuys.) 
</P>
<P>
 Royce isn't fazed by anything that happens at his corner. One night, Sly 
Stallone dropped $140 on a few dozen magazines. Royce offered to give Stallone 
the publications free if he could guess the exact total price. He couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't make a big deal out of the celebrities who come here," Royce said. 
"We try not to be star-struck." 
</P>
<P>
 One early morning regular, if no star, is Pete Demetriou, a radio news 
reporter for KFWB (980-AM) in Hollywood. Demetriou, who usually finishes work 
about 12:30 or 1 a.m., sees the newsstand as an ideal spot to gauge subtle 
shifts in public opinion. He'll hang out for several hours, debating topics 
ranging from gun control to fiber optics. Royce warns not to get Demetriou 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a magical place," Demetriou said. "I always get into some great 
conversations here. I've started with someone at 1 a.m. and, suddenly, it's 4 
a.m. The people are very intelligent and very eclectic." 
</P>
<P>
 They are also, apparently, very interested in sex. Pornography dominates as 
the most popular early morning purchase, Royce said. He said he is always 
amused by the not-so-secret strategy of the embarrassed buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll place the porno magazine on the bottom of the stack they buy," Royce 
said. "Or they'll say they're getting it for someone else. . . . I really don't 
care." Bowling 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a free lane during late afternoon or early evening hours is difficult; 
the Valley is flooded with leagues. By the time a lane opens, the alley is 
about to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Not at Canoga Park Bowl, which never closes. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what attracted Dennis and Kay Shawe one recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were up and we wanted to bowl, and this is the only place," said Dennis, 
38, of Century City. The Shawes arrived shortly before 1 a.m., and bowled five 
games apiece before going home nearly three hours later. "I guess we wanted to 
do something crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Montoya doesn't think that it's so crazy. Working the desk from 1 to 9 
a.m., he said he is never surprised by the steady flow of bowlers paying $2 a 
game to attack the helpless pins. Some mornings, half the alley's 32 lanes are 
occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people get off work at 2 or 3 in the morning," Montoya said, "and 
there's not much else to do at that hour. The bars are closed, so why not bowl 
a game or two? . . . I get all kinds of people here, from the clean kind who 
have real jobs to the scuzzballs who only come out at night. Some people come 
here at midnight and don't leave till 4 or 5." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 5 a.m., there's a shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "For serious bowlers, that's a good time to practice," Montoya said. "They'll 
come in here early before they go to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowling isn't the only option at Canoga Park Bowl. The pool tables and pinball 
machines are often just as popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got seven pool tables and usually at least three or four are being 
used," Montoya said. "Tonight, some guy spent hours pouring quarters into the 
pinball games. He kept coming here for change." Exercise  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Sasevich, a USC senior, detests the noisy, early evening workout scene 
at most Valley fitness centers, each body trying to outperform the next. So, 
several times a week, he visits Nautilus Aerobics Plus in Studio City shortly 
before 2 a.m. to jog on a treadmill for half an hour and to lift weights. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great time for me to be with myself," he said, "instead of being 
distracted by all the people who come to clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't the only one who has discovered the best time to build up the body. 
Bob Clinton, a North Hollywood mortgage banker, said the early morning workouts 
blend perfectly with his work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to fight for equipment if you're here much earlier," said Clinton, 
35, who stops at the club three times a week between 2 or 3 a.m. He then goes 
home to sleep, and starts work about 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The after-hours scene is primarily made up of men. Women, club workers say, 
don't feel comfortable about going on the streets during those times. When they 
do show up, an employee makes sure they get to their cars safely. 
</P>
<P>
 The club slows down significantly after 2 a.m., but by 4:30, the first sign of 
serious activity emerges. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get all these stockbroker types who bring their garment bags with suits 
in them," said Randy Buenaflor, who works at the club. "They go right from here 
to work. At 5 a.m., everything starts to fill up as the aerobics crowd gets 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, on the roof, the club also offers a T-shaped Jacuzzi. Despite the 
cold breeze during the winter, "you'd be amazed at how filled it can get," 
Buenaflor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, however, closes at midnight Friday and Saturday evenings, figuring 
that most people prefer more traditional forms of night life on weekends. Even 
exercise fanatics need somewhere to show off their hard work. Coffeehouses  
</P>
<P>
 Until 2 a.m., the Valley boasts plenty of clubs offering musical alternatives, 
from bluegrass to blues. Once the clubs close, however, especially on Friday 
and Saturday nights, the coffeehouses become more crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 Most prominent among the late-night crowd is the Insomnia Cafe in Sherman 
Oaks, open till 3 a.m. weeknights, and 4 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Until 
closing, the place is usually packed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where they come to sober up," a cafe employee said. "A double shot of 
espresso will wake them up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Insomnia is no palace. The grungy couches and chairs look as if they were 
imported from Goodwill; the artwork on the walls -- paintings depicting scenes 
of poverty -- isn't quite ready for the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crowd, mostly in their 20s and 30s, has no complaints with the 
atmosphere. The idea is to relax, not revere. 
</P>
<P>
 On most nights, they remain isolated in their own cliques, absorbed in casual 
conversation or intense competition. The cafe supplies such games as Monopoly, 
chess, backgammon and Scrabble. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kris Sanchez, revenge was his top priority one recent night. Sanchez, 18, 
had lost a Monopoly game to his girlfriend, Stephanie Levinson, a week earlier 
and was determined to make up for the disgrace. "I'm killing her," said 
Sanchez, staring at his impressive row of hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez and Levinson, 19, said Insomnia is the perfect environment to cap an 
evening. Both go to college during the day and work at night. After hours are 
just about their only hours together. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one bothers anybody else here," Levinson said. "It's not like a club. I 
wish it were open 24 hours. We'd probably be here all morning." 
</P>
<P>
 The Iguana Cafe in North Hollywood, open till 3 most mornings, enjoys a 
similarly devoted clientele. Poets and musicians experiment with their latest 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you find yourself stuck," poet Erica Erdman said, "you book a show. It 
forces you to write." 
</P>
<P>
 Erdman says Iguana is a convenient place to stop on her way to work at Federal 
Express at Los Angeles International Airport, where her shift starts at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know each other here," Erdman said. "We're up at crazy hours, and this 
gives poets a place to hang out." 
</P>
<P>
 Another favorite is the Boom Boom Room in North Hollywood. Dimly lighted, the 
cozy interior also showcases old and used furniture. Soft jazz sets a relaxed 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Louis Strangis and Rick Kaylor sit in the corner, reading newspapers and 
planning their breakthrough on the Hollywood scene. They have been working on a 
screenplay, a psychological thriller that takes place in a bomb shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are under pressure all week long," Strangis said, "you need 
somewhere to relax in the middle of the night. You can talk to people here, or 
just sit alone and do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The partners meet frequently at Boom Boom to tinker with the script, although 
they insist that they are not pretentious. Unlike other aspiring writers, they 
don't bring their laptops to the cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people come here so they can be seen to be writing," Kaylor said. "You 
wonder what they're really typing." Tanning  
</P>
<P>
 Who needs the sun, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly not the tan-seekers who make regular visits in the middle of the 
night to the always-open Supertans in Canoga Park. Indulging in either 10- or 
20-minute sessions, customers pay $2 a crack -- the shop calls it the "Happy 
Hour" special -- to recline to music of their choice as the Bellarium bulbs tan 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some come to tan and some come just to relax," said Jeff Haldorson, who works 
the counter five nights a week. Typically, from midnight to 3 a.m., several 
dozen show up. "They listen to the music and tune out the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lombardi and his girlfriend, Lisa Hantgin, take nightly treks to 
Supertans. Lombardi, who plays guitar at the Stovepiper Lounge in Northridge 
until about 1 a.m., said he uses his tanning time as a way to calm down after 
an intense night on stage. He feels guilty when he misses one evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very addicting," said Lombardi, 29, of Reseda. "If I don't go for two or 
three days, it feels like you are losing your tan, although that's not really 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, women don't feel threatened by either the late hour or the potential 
clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like anyone will get hurt here," said Jennifer Fuglevand, 20, of 
Woodland Hills. "The tanning makes you feel good about yourself. It's a lot 
like laying in the sun, and it's cool to be here in the middle of the night."

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: RESALE AVENUE TO FASHION; NOW MALE CLOTHES HOUNDS CAN 
JOIN WOMEN IN THE SAVINGS AT THE PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Many fashion-conscious women on limited budgets probably know about The Place, 
one of the pio neer resale stores in Southern California. For more than 30 
years, those who want to look richer than they are have ridden the resale 
avenue to fashion success. The Place is one of the best consignment stores in 
town, with a vast collection of the top names in haute couture, along with some 
new merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 While checking out their sale (which goes through the end of February) and 
seeing their new men's department, I couldn't resist a foray through a rack of 
new Judith Ann heavily beaded jackets and coats. One three-quarter-length 
jacket in a spectrum of subtle blues and greens was originally $600. The 
regular price at The Place was $325, but on sale, it's $160. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the inventory has been previously owned, meticulously maintained 
and divinely priced. A stunning suit by Moschino (size 10) -- a red wool jacket 
with a black velvet collar, cuffs, buttons and skirt -- originally listed for 
$2,500. The before-sale resale price was $395, but on sale, it's $230. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Joyce Brock says male clothes hounds or their significant others have 
been asking her for years to open a men's resale department. When Jay Leno 
offered his wardrobe (size 44 long), Brock decided to take the plunge. She 
bought liquidated new stock from Ron Ross and Fred Hayman, and started building 
the men's department. She is adding resale wardrobes from celebrities every 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Not too much is left from Leno's offerings, although a cashmere sport coat 
from Fred Hayman that Brock says was Leno's was marked $150. It sold new for 
around $900. 
</P>
<P>
 Only top designer names grace the labels. Armani heads the parade with pieces 
from Zegna, Hugo Boss, Canelli, Ralph Lauren Polo, Gucci, Valentino, Ungaro and 
Lanvin that are in perfect shape and a fraction of the original cost. Offerings 
from such pricey retailers as Bijan, Brooks Brothers, Carroll & Co. and Fred 
Hayman are also here. 
</P>
<P>
 Suits and sport coats fill most of the racks, and I was particularly impressed 
with the shirt selection after spotting a $150 Turnbull & Asser shirt in a fine 
cotton that looked new for $45. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a great way to own a man's handsome double-breasted, 100% wool Ungaro 
sport coat featured in a fashion ad for $1,400. Here, it's $250. 
</P>
<P>
 The styles for men and women are current. Except for a few Brooks Brothers 
suits, expect pleats in the pants, gentlemen. Where and When What: The Place. 
Location: 8820 S. Sepulveda Blvd., Westchester. Hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.

RELUCTANT NOVICE: STAMP OF CREATIVITY; A CRAFTS CLASS OFFERS TIPS ON USE OF INK 
PADS AND HOW TO 'CARESS THE PAPER.' NON-TRADITIONAL DESIGNS INSPIRE THE 
TEACHER'S REMARK OF 'INTERESTING.'

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some guys are born with the craft gene, some aren't. I got mine from my 
mother's side. So did my sister, who has done enough crafts to stock a chain of 
Moskatels from here to Kentucky. So when I heard of a stamping class held at 
Stamp Into Burbank, I felt my DNA whir at the prospect of getting my 
fingernails inked. 
</P>
<P>
 I took along my friend Larry Nichols, an artist who makes jewelry. My stamping 
experience is limited to stamping "Third Notice Past Due" on invoices for 
magazines I write for. Larry once stamped his footprints on a birth 
certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ooooh! A couple of stamp virgins!" Shop owner Lynne Lacy is eyeing Larry and 
me with the sort of look that tells us we'll be buying $287 worth of stamps 
before the night is over. Lacy seats us at a cramped table with six other 
virgins, and the stamping begins. 
</P>
<P>
 First we make a border of leaf stamps around blank postcards. I look around 
the room, imagining that the home down the street has given us passes to attend 
this craft class -- along with making us take our medicine, of course. Then 
Lacy bursts out with a chipper, "Clean rubber is happy rubber!" to explain how 
to clean our stamps. Fantasy quickly turns into reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacy explains that it's OK to "beat your pad to death" with the stamp to get 
it really inked up. "But you must caress the paper lovingly with the stamp," 
she says. "Besides, what's the worst thing it ever did to you? Give you a paper 
cut?" I look over at Larry, who's not caressing his paper. "Caress your paper!" 
I hiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubber stamping, I later learn, has been around for about 100 years, back when 
Goodyear discovered a technique for stabilizing rubber. A quick check in the 
phone book reveals that there are six art stamping stores in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacy stocks a selection of 5,000 stamps and manufactures about 900 of her own 
designs at another location. The store carries seasonal stamps, including 
valentines, baby chicks, flags, turkeys, Santas and menorahs. Lacy also stocks 
the most popular designs -- paw prints and cat stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamping postcards and envelopes is quite popular, I'm told. Stamps also are 
used on invitations, fabric, T-shirts, tote bags, greeting cards, place cards, 
gift bags, place mats -- the list is endless. Stamp Into Burbank even sells 
stamped birdhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacy tells me that stamps also can be made into 3-D cut-outs and worked into 
pop-up designs. She also gives stamp parties at people's homes, sort of a craft 
version of Tupperware gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the craft table, Larry has created a collage of black, gray and green 
valentines that belong in a David Lynch flick. "Aaaah. That's interesting," 
says Lacy. "That's really different." (Read: Who let you out of the home?) 
</P>
<P>
 I've moved on to making a collage out of raffia, cardboard and netting as the 
background for a multicolored stamp of Edvard Munch's "The Scream." It's for a 
gift bag. To put the hundreds of valentines I'll no doubt receive. I think the 
women at the table think Larry and I are gathering material for the next 
"Addams Family" sequel. But I've taken Lacy's advice of "the less you plan it, 
the better" to heart. She says people pay $8 to $10 for these kinds of gift 
bags in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 I grow frustrated because there is one glue gun among the eight of us and 
Larry is hogging it. But I'm patient as I rub colored markers onto stamps to 
prepare other designs. It's OK if the ink dries because you can spritz it with 
water to bring it back to life. And the water can add a watercolor effect that 
looks arty. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I lose my cool: "Larry! Give me the damn glue gun! You've been hogging it 
for the last 20 minutes!" Larry shoots me the kind of look that says he's ready 
to pound a huge cat stamp on my forehead (I hate cats) if I don't pipe down. He 
finally hands it over. I forget why I needed it. 
</P>
<P>
 We also learn how to make embossed stamps by rubbing a special embossing 
pigment onto a stamp and then cooking the stamped design with a dryer. The 
finished product is shiny and can be colored in. Larry says mine looks a bit 
girlish. I tell him that sometimes the craft gene mutates at birth, creating a 
class of people that are despised simply because they are unable to hold glue 
guns properly. Such people, I add, often criticize the gifted. Where and When 
What: Stamp class. Location: Stamp Into Burbank, 3009 W. Magnolia Blvd., 
Burbank. Hours: 6 p.m. Mondays. Price: $16 for one class. Call: (818) 845-8180.

 Madelon Rowen remembers being 15 and struggling to recall everything that had 
been lost in her bedroom in the 1961 Bel-Air fire. When her parents were making 
their insurance claim, it was hard to remember just what she had owned. 
</P>
<P>
 With thick smoke in the air as the fires raged last fall, Rowen made a 1 
1/2-hour item-by-item videotape of her Woodland Hills house. Her house was 
spared that disaster, but she was glad she had the video after she lost 
hundreds of dollars worth of china and art objects in the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 As a partner in Continental Video, a Woodland Hills production firm, Rowen 
encourages others to capture as much as possible on film, with detailed 
narration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The video reminds you of what you had, shows that it was together and in what 
kind of condition, and can be used to help you describe other details, such as 
your drapes, or your roof line, or landscaping," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While homeowners can take their own pictures or videos, some experts recommend 
hiring a professional video production firm because the quality of the 
photography -- especially lighting and detail -- is typically far better. 
Professionals usually charge about $100 an hour to film a home inventory tape; 
most homes will not require more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies suggest people take a complete home inventory, including 
detailed lists, photographs and, if possible, a well-narrated videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a photograph or a videotape, there's no guesswork involved. If 
something's broken in a million pieces, it's pretty hard to estimate its value 
without documentation," said Mabel Yosifi, public affairs manager of State Farm 
Insurance in Westlake Village. A videotape is more effective than still 
photography because it can offer a more three-dimensional view and also provide 
narrative descriptions for each item, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yosifi suggests people shoot as much as they can, including anything unique to 
their home, such as special tile work, expensive carpets, woodwork, staircase 
and architectural details. 
</P>
<P>
 Video experts also recommend including not just the furniture, appliances, 
china, jewelry, clothes, computers, framed photographs and art, but also the 
landscaping, pool and any other structures on the property. Special collections 
-- such as figurines, records, old trains, stamps and coins -- can be 
photographed close up, with detailed narration describing their age, 
characteristics and value. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Bigilen, owner of A-Stephens Video Production in Agoura Hills, said 
many of his clients opt for video inventories because the film shows the actual 
condition of the item, a factor that can be important in estimating its worth 
later. Bigilen urges clients to get at least two copies of the video, putting 
one in a safe-deposit box or in a relative's home across town. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare to have a home inventory video shot, experts suggest planning what 
must be included in the film and jotting down notes about particular items, or 
even writing a script. For some shots, it may be helpful to include the brand 
name or an engraved serial number, Rowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Small items can be gathered to speed the filming. Jewelry can be laid out on 
one table, for example, or cupboard doors can be opened to show dishes, 
glassware and small appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Bercovici of B & B Video Productions in Encino suggests having a video 
production firm superimpose titles and serial number over the visuals of 
particular items. For those without a camcorder or the budget to hire a video 
firm, he recommends renting a video camera, which costs about $50 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Bigilen warned that, as memories of the 6.6 quake fade, the risk of 
procrastination becomes greater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody keeps putting off doing a home inventory until it's too late," he 
said. "My best advice: Just do it." Where and When What: Video production firms 
that make home inventories. Price: Varies, depending on time involved, but 
averages $100 to $400 a home. Call: A-Stephens Video Productions, (818) 
703-0336; B & B Video Productions, (818) 705-5945; or Continental Video, (818) 
705-0123.

RESTOCKING KITCHEN SHELVES; QUAKE VICTIMS MAY FIND RESTAURANT SUPPLY STORES A 
WAY TO BUY LARGE QUANTITIES OF GOODS AT LOW PRICES. 
</P>

 Hand-me-downs and paper plates may tide some folks over temporarily, but 
people who lost kitchenware in the earthquake eventually will want permanent 
replacements. Turning to unorthodox sources may make the replacement experience 
a bit easier, since buying everyday china, bake ware and glasses doesn't have 
to be a bank-breaking experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my own house, I think I have maybe three drinking glasses left," says Les 
Birken, owner of Star Restaurant Equipment & Supply in Van Nuys. Although the 
store specializes in selling to the restaurant trade, it regularly sells to 
area residents who appreciate industrial-strength gear at affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
 At restaurant supply stores, not only is everything cheaper by the dozen, it 
is the only way to buy, since minimums of 12 are enforced. For instance, sets 
of 12 microwaveable dishes at Star start at $20. Matching serving bowls, cups 
and saucers are available in lesser increments within many of the patterns 
featured. Glasses (minimum of 12) range in price from $7 to up to $25 a set for 
some of the premium designs. For San Fernando Valley residents gun-shy of 
breakables, melamine dinnerware is also available at the Van Nuys facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley residents have been pouring through the doors at the Dish Factory in 
Woodland Hills. Commercial business accounts for about 60% of sales, but those 
in the know flock to the store's vast inventory -- thousands of dinnerware 
patterns are featured, again in sets of 12. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to plates and glassware, the store also sells coffee-makers, 
commercial blenders, portable fryers, chafing dishes and pizza stones. Prices 
range from $19.99 to $49.99 for a set of 12 dinner plates. Water glasses are 
$5.99 to $9.99 per dozen. A dozen wine glasses start at $14.99. 
</P>
<P>
 People who need fewer than 12 of everything might find what they are looking 
for at Ikea. The Media City Center store in Burbank offers several Start Box 
packs of essentials for the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The 44 pieces in one Start Box include a set of white porcelain dinnerware 
consisting of four each of dinner plates, soups, side plates, cups and saucers. 
Also included are four wine glasses, four juice tumblers, four white place mats 
and four place settings of flatware. The $89 price for the Start Box is $10 
less than the cost of buying the pieces separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Ikea Start Box features 50 items that sell for $195, which is $40 less 
than the price when purchased separately. Included are non-breakable mixing 
bowls, strainers, storage containers, cutting board, cooking utensils and other 
kitchen gadgets, plus a set of pots and pans. For $6.75, shoppers can get six 
wine glasses; a set of six beer glasses is $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills resident Cathy Gelfand believes in plastic dinnerware, although 
she admits her passion is part of her business. An employee of Limelight Sales, 
an authorized Tupperware dealer, Gelfand suffered extensive damage to her home, 
but her company's plates, cups and tumblers survived unscathed.  
</P>
<P>
 Gelfand, who arranges Tupperware parties, has been busy selling unbreakable 
kitchenware and teaching people without gas to cook in the microwave with safe 
containers.  
</P>
<P>
 Valley residents who give a Tupperware party are eligible for up to $100 worth 
of free Tupperware. Less sociable souls may prefer to fork over $13.50 for a 
set of six square luncheon plates, among the most affordable of the dinnerware 
that Gelfand sells. Clear acrylic tumblers sell for $12.70 for a set of four. 
Gelfand says if Tupperware ever cracks, chips or peels, the company will 
replace it free. Where and When

3-HOUR TOUR: TARZANA'S SHOPPING RENAISSANCE; SMALL BUT BUDDING BROWN CENTER 
OFFERS FASHION BOUTIQUES, TRENDY SALONS AND CHIC EATERIES. 
</P>

<P>
 At the corner of Yolanda Avenue and Ventura Boulevard in Tarzana, a kind of 
renaissance is occurring at Brown Center. 
</P>
<P>
 This little U-shaped enclave of shops is home to fashion boutiques, coffee 
emporiums, trendy salons and cutting-edge restaurants. If you want to indulge 
in an afternoon of shopping and dining, it's the perfect place. Admittedly, the 
shopping area is in transition. There are some empty storefronts, but it's only 
a matter of time before they join the new kids on the block. There also are 
some boutiques just across the street that are worth careful perusal. Metered 
and free parking is available in the back lot, just behind Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon: The skinny on the Thin's In Cafe, prominently located in the center, is 
that the size of all the portions on the menu are controlled, based on the 
dietary guidelines of the American Heart Assn. Though calories are not listed 
on the menu, dieters will be familiar with the "exchanges" featured there. 
Chicken Salad, for instance, consists of two protein exchanges and one-half of 
a fat exchange. The restaurant features a generic Marie Callender-style 
ambience that offers a perfect opportunity for a tete-a-tete with friends or 
loved ones -- so much so that many diners actually whisper their way through 
lunch. There are several tempting "desserts without guilt" that are made in 
such a heart-healthy manner you won't even feel compelled to share. 
</P>
<P>
 Thin's In Cafe, 18706 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana, (818) 776-0229.  
</P>
<P>
 1 p.m.: Walk to the end of the block and cruise through The Gap, dedicated not 
only to adults, but children and even babies. Aside from the indigo and 
brightly colored denims you've come to expect on the shelves and in the racks 
of this store, with its white walls and hardwood floors, there are also 
backpacks, belts, roomy sweaters and great-looking yet sturdy stuff for 
park-bound kids and industrious infants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gap, 18728 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana, (818) 343-2671.  
</P>
<P>
 1:20 p.m.: Work your way back toward Appassionata, a veritable treasure-trove 
of body-conscious lingerie and at-home ready-to-wear that manages a tasteful 
balance between really sexy and ultra-sophisticated. Elegant chemises, cotton 
bras, dainty panties and fitted tops and pants line the walls of this compact 
yet luxe boutique. Prices range from $10 for underwear to $160 for a French 
bodysuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Appassionata, 18678 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana, (818) 774-1210.  
</P>
<P>
 1:45 p.m.: Inside Laurie Weir, shoppers will find versatile separates, jeans, 
dresses and unusual accessories. Overall, the looks featured are funky yet not 
too way-out. Names you'll know -- not often found in San Fernando Valley 
boutiques -- include Betsey Johnson, Mica and Laundry. Prices range from $26 
for a T-shirt to $195 for a dress. Best of all, owner Weir offers a 30-day 
layaway, which few stores do anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Weir, 18664 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana, (818) 708-9124.  
</P>
<P>
 1:30 p.m.: Don't skip The Basketmaker even if you are not in the market for a 
gift. The shop sells original, fabulously priced home accessories and personal 
luxuries individually. There are cow-printed ceramic garden pots starting at 
$5.95. In addition to the Seinfeld calendars and mugs, there are 
miniature-chair candleholders, temporary tattoos and a variety of edibles (ever 
try watermelon or kiwi jelly?) 
</P>
<P>
 There are items for the kids too, such as a book called "Kids Shenanigans." It 
comes with a real live whoopee cushion for those n-yuk n-yuks your kids may 
need but you would just as soon the grandparents didn't see.  
</P>
<P>
 The Basketmaker, 18666 Ventura Blvd., (818) 996-9900.  
</P>
<P>
 2 p.m.: Few boutiques personify California chic as a.b.s. designer boutiques 
do. The casual ready-to-wear collections designed by Allen Bruce Schwartz (note 
the store carries his initials) are affordable takes on the elegant 
Armani-esque style worn by Hollywood celebrities and Beverly Hills socialites. 
Prices range from $40 for some of the accessories to more than $300 for some of 
the jackets. Another of the boutique's pluses: The shop is as beautiful to 
behold as the merchandise inside, and the service is friendly and helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 a.b.s., 18660 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana, (818) 343-8770.  
</P>
<P>
 2:20 p.m.: Walk across the street and into another world, namely that of 
Kirsten of Copenhagen. The bubbly owner's love of her homeland is reflected in 
the collectibles and gifts that line the walls in this quaint shop. There are 
Scandinavian modern teak salad bowls, Kosta Boda crystal goodies, Royal 
Copenhagen collectibles, Farmers' Rose dinnerware from Norway and Arabia 
dinnerware from Finland. And just so you know what to put on the plates, the 
owner also stocks cookbooks and edibles, such as cloudberry preserves. Items 
range from $2.50 for a kitchen magnet to $300 for a crystal vase.  
</P>
<P>
 Kirsten of Copenhagen, 18663 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana, (818) 996-2147.  
</P>
<P>
 2:40 p.m.: Buffalo Too is one of the Valley's oldest designer boutiques 
dedicated to outfitting men and women. If you haven't been inside in a while, 
you'll notice many changes -- especially in the price structure -- since it 
opened in the mid-'80s. Today shoppers can find skirts for as low as $45 and 
embellished designer suits for $495. Men will find a wealth of trendy casual 
sportswear and dress suits as well.  
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo Too, 18663 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana, (818) 345-5526.

DIVINE DAILY BREAD; FAR NIENTE IN GLENDALE IS KNOWN FOR ITS OVEN-FRESH 
FOCACCIA, BUT ALSO SERVES FINE SOUPS, RISOTTOS AND PASTAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Friday in Valley Life!

<P>
 Nothing satisfies hunger quicker than a good hot hunk of bread. Far Niente's 
focaccia is an extreme example -- an amazing oven-fresh bread, puffed up like a 
volleyball, that comes to the table scant seconds after you sit down. Another 
arrives just about as soon as the first one has been divvied up. No wonder the 
restaurant has steadfastly remained one of Glendale's most popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Far Niente is also known for its huge, ambitious menu of risottos, pastas and 
seafoods, but let me get back to that focaccia , because before you can even 
think about the appetizers, you're going to have to deal with it. Far Niente's 
focaccia has the texture of the puffer-fish-shaped poori bread that you get in 
some Indian restaurants, even though it's baked in a pizza oven (rather than 
deep-fried, like a poori ). The bottom tends to be flat and crusty like matzo; 
the top is soft, generously rubbed with olive oil, and sprinkled with plenty of 
fresh rosemary. The result is unmercifully seductive. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two separate dining rooms here, one perfect for a lively lunch, the 
other more appropriate for a quiet dinner. The right-hand room is a cheery, 
sun-splashed trattoria dominated by a series of oil paintings depicting 
close-ups of the Coliseum in Rome. The other half of the restaurant is a dark, 
elegant, russet-colored room that reminds me of fall in Tuscany. 
</P>
<P>
 If this helps, most tables in the autumnal room afford a full view of chickens 
rotating on a back kitchen spit. But no matter where you sit, the smell of the 
roasting chickens is never far away. 
</P>
<P>
 I profess a weakness for hot soups, especially when they are paired with a 
great bread. Far Niente's minestrone is powerful -- thick, heavily reduced and 
full of good peasant vegetables such as beans, celery and carrots -- but it's 
the fancier soups I really crave. Some days the kitchen puts out a dark, 
creamless lobster bisque heady with the concentrated essences of the sea and 
loaded with big chunks of soft lobster meat. Even better is the simple mushroom 
onion soup, a truly spectacular broth with layer upon layer of subtle flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the menu is perfectly good, even if nothing on it quite measures 
up to the soups. The kitchen makes an excellent calamaretti fritti , the crisp 
pieces of baby squid deftly fried in light batter. It's a nearly greaseless 
preparation, and the oil you do taste is light and fresh. Arancini con pesto is 
a more whimsical dish of deep-fried rice balls with a touch of cheese in them, 
ready to dip into an intensely green pesto sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 If arborio rice appeals to you, there are six different risottos to choose 
from, from the well-known porcini mushroom version to a drop-dead-fancy model 
made with Maine lobster and sweet red pepper. Risotto Milanese con sugo di 
vitello is deliciously simple, nothing more than rice with saffron and a deeply 
flavorful sauce made from veal pan juices. One note: Many people like risotto 
to be slightly chewy. I wouldn't call Far Niente's style mushy, but they 
definitely cook the rice beyond the al dente stage here. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastas, on the other hand, are resolutely prepared al dente . Penne puttanesca 
comes in a Neapolitan sauce made with olives, hot peppers, capers and a good 
dose of anchovies. Many kitchens leave the anchovies out, but this version uses 
anchovies to subtle perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 Fettuccine boscaiola (literally "from the woods") features lots of meaty 
porcini mushrooms and a light tomato cream sauce. Spaghetti clams (also known 
as spaghetti vongole ) gets better as you head toward the bottom of the bowl, 
where all the clam flavor seems to be concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've made it through the appetizers (and the focaccia ), that roasted 
chicken you've been smelling will be hard to resist. Like the focaccia , it has 
been rubbed with olive oil and rosemary, and like the risottos, it tends to be 
a touch overcooked. The grilled veal chop with sweet onions and balsamic 
vinegar sauce, however, is first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Far Niente takes the dessert course seriously. Unfortunately, there probably 
won't be much of a choice at lunch, because that's when the pastry chef is 
making the cakes and pies served at dinner. But at dinner, the warm apple tart, 
the pear-almond tart and the macadamia nut pie all have a flaky short crust and 
wonderful toppings. 
</P>
<P>
 Or hey, you could just ask for one more focaccia for the road. Where and When 
Location: Far Niente, 204 1/2 Brand Blvd., Glendale. Suggested Dishes: soup du 
jour, $4.50; risotto Milanese, $10.50; penne puttanesca , $10; veal chop, $18, 
pear-almond tart, $4.50. Hours: Lunch 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Monday through

COLUMN ONE; NO LETUP IN WINTER OF DISCONTENT; HOW COLD IS COLD? TRY A WINDCHILL 
OF 92 BELOW. SALT MINES ARE RUNNING NONSTOP TO CURE SLICK ROADS. A BANK ROBBER 
EVEN USES A SNOWMOBILE. MUCH OF THE U.S. IS IN SHOCK AFTER FIVE MILD YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even in a land where heated dipsticks, thermal underwear and glove liners are 
routine, this has been a winter to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Coast Guard has broken more Great Lakes ice so far this season than 
in the last three previous winters combined. All-time low temperatures have 
been recorded in 16 American cities. 
</P>
<P>
 So much snow has fallen in both the Midwest and the East that salt mines are 
operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to supply road crews with the 
ice-melting mineral. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people have had only four days off since Thanksgiving," said Bruce 
Higgins, manager of an Akzo Salt Inc. plant that mines deposits under Lake 
Erie. 
</P>
<P>
 His is important work. In the metropolis where a mayor who couldn't keep the 
streets clear lost his job in 1979, a Chicago Tribune headline writer declared 
a "salt crisis" Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 While aldermen complain about the cost of replenishing stockpiles, Mayor 
Richard M. Daley proved he knows his history. "The people want their salt," he 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of Pennsylvania even sent its National Guard to a mine in Upstate 
New York to speed the precious stuff on its way. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter's clamp extends to regions unaccustomed to its sway. After five 
relatively mild years, "this is a real winter, and we're just going to have to 
suffer it," said Chester Ropelewski, a National Weather Service meteorologist 
in Washington. "But it sure is a pain to get back to it." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a bad shot of cold air," said John Christy, an atmospheric scientist 
at University of Alabama in Huntsville. "But it's nothing more than chaotic 
random nature." As he spoke, he gazed out his office window at an ice-entombed 
tree. "I don't know," he sighed, "how to get home." 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, winter's full-scale return is good for the art of 
conversation. For years to come, the local raconteurs will tell of the "igloo 
effect" in Bethlehem, Pa.; the run on groceries in Louisville, and the 
practical man in Antioch, Ill., who robbed a bank and escaped by snowmobile. 
</P>
<P>
 The winter of '94 was the season a Chicago woman was found frozen, kneeling, 
but alive, on her floor. Temporary dams of ice chunks on rivers in West 
Virginia and Ohio created frigid floods -- there will be more, hydrologists 
promise, with the advent of the thaws. More than 100 deaths, from 
snow-shovelers' heart attacks to cases of exposure suffered by the homeless, 
have been blamed on this year's onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 Some portions of the country have actually enjoyed milder weather than usual. 
The Pacific Northwest, for example, is in the midst of its second warmest 
winter ever. The West and southwest temperatures have been pleasant as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the last month, a goodly section of the nation has been shivering, 
slipping and sneezing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday alone, the storm line stretched from the Gulf Coast to New 
England, with ice-slick roads delaying the proceedings in two widely-publicized 
Texas cases: the Branch Davidian cult trial in San Antonio and selection of a 
jury in Ft. Worth to hear the ethics charges against Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to four inches of ice coated north and east Texas roadways, virtually 
paralyzing the Dallas-Ft. Worth area and snarling traffic as far south as San 
Antonio and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 New York City feels particularly beleaguered, with 11 snow storms so far. (The 
Northeast winter is the third coldest in history, as well). The Dakotas have 
been hit hard too. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the future, Weather Service meteorologist David Miskus predicts "no 
real letup this month." He expects temperatures near normal on the East Coast 
but below normal in the Midwest and Upper Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst freeze hit in mid-January, when a reading of 27 degrees below zero 
in Indianapolis broke a record set in 1894. 
</P>
<P>
 That may sound impressive, particularly to Californians. But at Devil's Lake, 
N.D., technically two degrees warmer, the torrents of whipping air made for an 
inhuman windchill reading of 92 below. 
</P>
<P>
 The town of 9,500 is 100 miles west of the state border with Minnesota and 
close to the geographic center of North America. But it felt more like the 
furthest reaches of the Arctic.

<P>
 At the Devil's Lake fire station, Chief Bill Oehlke took it all in stride. 
"It's not a big hassle," he said. "Everyone knows what to do here." 
</P>
<P>
 That day, responding to a water main break, firefighters mummified themselves 
inside face masks, Air Force-style flight suits and Gore-tex parkas. The freeze 
rendered their water gauges inoperable. "The nice thing about having to go out 
in this kind of weather," Oehlke said, "is you don't hang around the scene once 
you're finished." 
</P>
<P>
 In more temperate climes, no one was nearly as blase. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, D.C., shut down for several days last month, as the federal 
government told all non-essential employees to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 Power companies in the East, unused to the huge demand for heat, struggled to 
keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 Maple Glen, an affluent subdivision north of Philadelphia, was one place where 
the electric utilities failed. On two different weekends, Sue Klauder, her 
husband and her 3-month-old felt like pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their house has gas heat -- but electric thermostats. They went through half a 
cord of firewood in a few days, but the blaze kept only their living room warm. 
They had a kerosene heater, "but my husband had to drive four places to get 
kerosene," Klauder said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the refrigerator out of commission, they stored their meat in coolers out 
in the snow and their milk and eggs in the ground. At night, retrieving the 
makings for a meal, they could watch blue flashes -- power surges -- spark from 
the transformer boxes in their neighbors' yards. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, 600,000 out of 1.5 million Philadelphia Electric Co. customers 
were blacked out. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather problem in Bethlehem, further north, was dubbed the "igloo 
effect," after the shiny surfaces formed inside the ice domes when cook fires 
melt the interior walls, leading to drips. When the roofs are made of shingle, 
not of ice, and the warmth penetrates through attic insulation, the damage can 
be permanent. Melting snow and ice, blocked from running off the roof by more 
snow and ice, sink in. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Murphy thought one of his water pipes had burst and called a plumber. "He 
told me we needed a roofer," Murphy said. Water had picked up the shingles on 
his seven-year-old roof, buried under 18 inches of snow. He had to drill holes 
in his ceiling and walls to let the moisture out. His roofer told him to call 
back for repairs after the snow was all gone. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why, all over town, hand-scrawled signs now advertise: "Will Shovel 
Snow Off Roofs." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Louisville reeled from an 18-inch snowfall. It was not the first 
time; 16 inches dropped on the city in 1978. But the region was unprepared 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Normal car traffic was impossible. With most supermarkets closed, customers 
besieged any outlet where they could find basic supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 300 calls in one day asking if we were open," said Larry McCandless, 
who owns a gasoline station and grocery on Louisville's west side. "They 
completely ravaged our store, took everything -- bread, milk, chips, you name 
it. We did four times the amount of business we've ever done in a single day." 
</P>
<P>
 In Antioch, Ill., a man on a snowmobile pulled up to the drive-in window at a 
bank on Tuesday, displayed what appeared to be a pipe bomb, and demanded cash. 
He roared off into blizzard conditions after scooping up an undetermined amount 
of money put in the drawer by the frightened teller. By the time police 
negotiated snowbound roads in response to the alarm, the robber was long gone, 
his tracks disappearing under new snow. "He was just an opportunist," groused 
Lake County Sheriff's Lt. Chet Iwan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, a bastion of cold weather, the veterans of winter are better 
equipped. Letter carrier Kevin Henaghan trudged his 13-block route through the 
western suburbs swaddled in every piece of clothing the U.S. Postal Service 
issues except the summer shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 He wore long thermal underwear, pants, a shirt, a lined jacket, a down parka, 
regular socks, thermal socks, lined boots and a regulation ski mask. All that 
could be seen of his features were pale blue eyes through puffs of frozen 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
 On his rounds on a recent day where the wind chill plunged to minus-60, he 
declined the coffee that his customers kept offering. Like his car, which he'd 
left running, he said, "If I stop, I won't start again." 
</P>
<P>
 All around Chicago, hardware stores know to stock a variety of gadgets to 
combat the freeze. Starting fluid to thaw out engine blocks. Gasoline 
anti-freeze to keep the fuel lines clear. Heated dipsticks -- plug them in and 
keep them in the crankcase overnight to keep the engine oil from sludging up. 
</P>
<P>
 Lock de-icer is a staple. Plastic double-face tape keeps the chill from 
creeping past the window's edge. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dressel's Ace Hardware store in Oak Park, Ill., owner Ron Rogers watched 
the merchandise move with satisfaction during the worst of the cold. Behind the 
steamed-up windows, a cashier near the door wore gloves while she worked the 
register. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much," Rogers said, "for the greenhouse effect."

 PARTY FAVORITE: Saturday marks Abraham Lincoln's 185th birthday, a day of 
special significance to local Republicans. Lincoln was the first Republican 
President and Ventura County remains a GOP stronghold. . . . "He believed in as 
little government and as little taxing as possible," said Ventura County GOP 
Chairman Bob Larkin, charter president of the county's Lincoln Club. "As long 
as Republicans focus on the message so well delivered by Lincoln, we can again 
become the majority party in this country."

 GONE FISHING: As many as 60 sea lions may be relocated to the waters off 
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties in an effort to prevent them from devouring 
large numbers of steelhead trout at their spawning grounds in Washington state 
(B1). . . . The National Marine Fisheries Service has proposed the relocation 
in an effort to keep the trout population from being fished out. . . . Local 
fishing enthusiasts oppose the move: "It's not right that one state's problems 
are being dumped on another," fisherman Brian Jension said.

 UNEASY CALM: Sarajevo fell quiet Thursday as a cease-fire between Serb and 
Muslim factions forged a fragile peace (A1). . . . But Ventura neurosurgeon 
Melvin Cheatham has seen too many cease-fires to believe this one will hold. 
Cheatham and other doctors recently spent time in central Bosnia treating war 
victims. . . . "If you look at past patterns," he said, "the possibility of 
things flaring up all over again seems fairly great."

SLOPPY CONSTRUCTION BLAMED FOR DAMAGE; QUAKE: TOUGHER SEISMIC STANDARDS AND 
BETTER EDUCATION OF BUILDERS ARE NEEDED, ENGINEERING EXPERTS TELL STATE BOARD. 
SOME RETROFITTING WAS DONE IMPROPERLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Structural engineering leaders told the California Seismic Safety Commission 
on Thursday that sloppy construction techniques and poor engineering of seismic 
safety features were to blame for considerable damage in the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some buildings that were retrofitted before the Jan. 17 quake still failed 
because builders had forgotten to secure walls to foundations, according to 
Rawn Nelson, the president-elect of the Structural Engineers Assn. of 
California. In some cases, he said, the bolts were sitting alongside the plates 
they were supposed to secure. 
</P>
<P>
 As the commission began a three-day hearing near the Van Nuys Airport, an 
emissary from Gov. Pete Wilson gave the panel its marching orders: Report back 
to Wilson by Sept. 1 on the adequacy of current seismic construction standards 
in the state's many quake-prone areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is vital that we learn all we can from this tragedy and, if possible, 
improve building seismic standards to protect life and property in future 
quakes," Wilson declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, leading structural engineers had admonished the commission, 
chaired by Caltech engineering professor Wilfred D. Iwan, that it must look 
immediately at setting higher construction code standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said he and his colleagues had found damage in every kind of building, 
including the modern steel-reinforced structures that had been thought most 
resistant to earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not always evident at first, but when you strip off the fireproofing, 
you find some of these steel buildings have heavy damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current president of the Structural Engineers Assn., Arthur E. Ross, added 
that inflexible or non-ductile concrete buildings often shattered instead of 
absorbing the force of the earthquake, and he termed these buildings perhaps "a 
larger threat (to safety) than (is found) in unreinforced masonry buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 The vertical force of the Northridge earthquake also called into question the 
effectiveness of base-isolation construction techniques meant to absorb 
horizontal shaking without damage to medium high-rises, the engineers said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for seismic retrofits that had been undertaken in many buildings, Nelson 
said, "There has been good performance in most cases with all these retrofits, 
if they were properly designed and constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That last issue is very important," he said. "One of the items that we have 
commonly found is there has been some poor methods of construction as well as 
some engineering done that did not understand the basic principles of 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have found anchor bolts not screwed to plates, but simply lying beside 
them," he said. "That doesn't do any good at all. And there has often been 
improper bracing." 
</P>
<P>
 So, Nelson and Ross suggested, the Seismic Safety Commission must consider new 
means of educating builders in how to retrofit and new requirements for more 
rigid inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Mayor Judy Abdo also expressed consternation that even some 
retrofitted buildings had not stood up well to the earthquake. "Retrofits did 
work in that buildings didn't collapse and people didn't die," Abdo said. "But 
many buildings which had been retrofitted still sustained serious damage." 
</P>
<P>
 L. Thomas Tobin, the staff director of the commission, said that "without 
question" the commission "will recommend both upgrades and reinforcement of 
present codes" to make buildings safer in quakes, although he and other 
speakers cautioned there is no such thing as making a structure 100% safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the witnesses were Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and the director of 
the state Office of Emergency Services, Richard Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
 Both indicated that the authorities had been hard-pressed to perform all 
essential services in the immediate wake of the earthquake. Noting that his own 
cellular phone did not work at first, Riordan said that emergency 
communications need to be improved. He said he had to find a police station so 
he could establish communications with emergency coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews warned that if the quake had occurred later in the day, or been just a 
little more powerful, there would have been so many people trapped in damaged 
buildings and parking structures that it would have exceeded the capacity of 
available rescue teams to tend to them. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there had been a plan in such emergencies to fly in additional urban 
search and rescue task forces from the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the morning of the quake, many Eastern airports were snowbound.

ALLERGIC GIRL, 8, DIES OF FUMES FROM GARBANZOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fumes from a pot of cooking garbanzos killed an 8-year-old girl who was 
allergic to the beans, her doctor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nita Sekhri was at a friend's house Sunday when she inhaled mist from across 
the kitchen, Dr. Mark Goetting said.She had many food allergies and the beans 
were on her list of items to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fluke," Goetting said. "It's something no one could have predicted." 
</P>
<P>
 Nita's medicated inhaler was not enough to combat the reaction, he said. She 
went into a coma and died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Yunginger, an allergies expert and pediatrics consultant at the Mayo 
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said fatal reactions from allergies are rare and 
death by fumes happens even less often. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, about 50 to 100 people in the United States die from allergic 
reactions, mostly from foods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garbanzo beans are tossed in salads and are often ground into a paste for 
hummus, a popular Middle Eastern dish.

SHUTTLE PREPARES FOR LANDING; BAD WEATHER MAY CHANGE PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crew of the space shuttle Discovery packed Thursday to come home after a 
mission that made history with its U.S.-Russian partnership but achieved mixed 
results on the science front. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad weather threatened to disrupt NASA's landing plans. Forecasters were 
calling for possible rain, low clouds and high winds at the Kennedy Space 
Center, any one of which could prevent the shuttle from landing there as 
scheduled at 9:44 a.m. PST today. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight directors said they would consider sending Discovery to Edwards Air 
Force Base in California later in the day if necessary. Another option would be 
to keep the shuttle up an extra day. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery's five American astronauts and cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, the first 
Russian to fly on a U.S. shuttle, have been in orbit since Feb. 3. During the 
past week, the crew completed its chores inside Spacehab, the small commercial 
laboratory in the cargo bay. Only one of the 12 Spacehab experiments -- a 
cell-separation test -- encountered major trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew also finished all four joint U.S.-Russian experiments. Researchers 
from both countries will share the results of the medical and radiation 
measurements and Earth observations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crew achieved only two of three planned satellite releases. The most 
important, deployment of the Wake Shield Facility, failed due to problems with 
the satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 The steel, saucer-shaped Wake Shield remained aboard instead of flying free 
for two days as intended. Physicists wanted to avoid shuttle contamination 
while developing semiconductor film on the Wake Shield; the film, if pure, 
could have led to faster computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronaut Ronald Sega, a physicist and engineer who spent years working on 
Wake Shield, said the experiment at least verified that thin semiconductor film 
can be produced in the vacuum of space. The Wake Shield is supposed to fly 
again on the shuttle next year. 
</P>
<P>
 A German science satellite released Wednesday circled Earth, as did six metal 
balls ejected as part of a study on space debris. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew took time Thursday to chat via ham radio with students at James Bean 
School in Sidney, Me., and Krikalev tried, without success, to contact the 
three cosmonauts aboard Russia's Mir space station.

TEXAS PLANS TO TRANSFER WELFARE BENEFITS THROUGH BANK-STYLE CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Texas plans to begin providing welfare benefits electronically this year with 
bank-style cards that take the place of paper coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system is designed to reduce administrative expenses, fraud and theft. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the rest of the country is still talking about welfare reform, Texas is 
implementing it," state Comptroller John Sharp said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, called electronic benefits transfer, is slated to begin in two 
counties this fall and be expanded statewide by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Texas program, people who receive food stamps and Aid to Families 
With Dependent Children will be given a "Lone Star Card" instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The card works much like a bank debit card. 
</P>
<P>
 In a grocery store checkout line, for example, the new card will be processed 
through a computer terminal, the cardholder will enter a four-digit personal 
identification number, and the cost of the items being purchased will be 
deducted from the cardholder's food stamp account. 
</P>
<P>
 The cards will eliminate the costs of printing, warehousing and mailing 
coupons. And with no paper coupons to steal, incidents of theft should decline 
dramatically, Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also is aimed at discouraging fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "No cash will change hands," said Andy Welch, a spokesman for the 
comptroller's office. Under the current system, Welch said, change from food 
stamp purchases is sometimes given in cash, which then can be used to purchase 
alcohol, cigarettes or other non-food items. 
</P>
<P>
 The card system will debit only the purchase of food items. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that once the system is implemented statewide, cards will be 
provided for some 2.7 million needy Texans. By 1996, the state plans to have 
16,000 retailers lined up to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan still needs final approval from the U.S. Departments of Agriculture 
and Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agriculture Department has established federal regulations for electronic 
benefits transfer programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other states -- Minnesota, New Mexico and Delaware -- have tried pilot 
programs, but Texas is the first state to attempt to implement a program 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lone Star Card will make food stamp coupons obsolete," Sharp said.

SACRAMENTO FILE: RESOLUTION ALLOWS DONATIONS TO ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A resolution allowing the Assembly to accept private donations of money, goods 
or services to help Speaker Willie Brown stage his education summit next week 
in San Francisco has been approved by the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, authored by Rules Committee Chairman John Burton (D-San 
Francisco), was approved by a 58-7 vote. It does not require a further Senate 
vote or gubernatorial action. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly action was required to put the policy in writing because of 
regulations by the Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy states the donations must go through the Assembly Rules Committee 
and must be made public within 10 days and cannot be used by an individual 
legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton said the policy will allow the Assembly to accept donations to defray 
expenses for such events as next week's education summit. He said it would also 
allow the Rules Committee to receive and distribute items such as large 
donations of blankets for disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
 An opponent, Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Arcadia), said he voted against 
the resolution because it "will allow special interests to have too much input 
into the legislative process." 
</P>
<P>

LT. GEN. EUGENE F. TIGHE JR.; HELD TOP INTELLIGENCE POSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Air Force Lt. Gen. Eugene F. Tighe Jr., a former director of the super-secret 
Defense Intelligence Agency, has died. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
 Tighe died Jan. 29 of prostate cancer, said Gwen Tighe, his wife of 43 years. 
</P>
<P>
 President Jimmy Carter named Tighe to the DIA post in 1978, where he served 
until 1981. He had been acting director for two years before, and in his 
39-year military career, he held the senior intelligence positions at the 
headquarters of the Air Force, Strategic Air Command, and Pacific Command. 
</P>
<P>
 Tighe was perhaps best known to the public for his work on the question of 
American prisoners of war in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, he headed a Pentagon panel that concluded that U.S. prisoners of war 
were still alive in Southeast Asia, the first time in years that a Defense 
Department investigation found that Vietnam might be holding U.S. troops. The 
report prompted dissent from many in the military who believed that Tighe was 
too zealous on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, his wife said, the general began to doubt that any POWs were 
still alive and being held against their will. "He didn't know if they could 
survive that long in captivity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At his death, Tighe was a member of the board of regents for his alma mater, 
Loyola Marymount University, and a board member of the Chicago-based gambling 
conglomerate, Bally Manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, three sons, three grandchildren and six sisters.

LOUIS KAUFMAN; VIOLINIST HEARD IN 400 FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Louis Kaufman, internationally lauded violinist who made about 125 classical 
recordings over half a century and was heard on the soundtracks of 400 films, 
including "Gone With the Wind," has died. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman died Wednesday at his Los Angeles home of congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 1920s to the 1970s, Kaufman recorded for 30 labels, earning such 
recognition as the French Grand Prix du Disque in 1950 for the first recording 
of Vivaldi's "Four Seasons," which was little-known at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman was also known for his concerts and for championing new music, 
including works by Aaron Copland, William Grant Still and Robert Russell 
Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an artist of exceptional good taste who carefully refrains from any 
playing which smacks of showing off," a Times reviewer wrote of Kaufman in 
1947. "And he has an ear for new compositions, which makes his concerts an 
evening of eager exploration among new works. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "His technique, which is virtual perfection, scintillates but never blinds," 
the reviewer wrote. "Always one feels that he plays with his head without ever 
neglecting to speak from the heart. The result is an equation which is 
musically perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman was born in Portland, Ore., and studied with Franz Kneisel at New 
York's Institute of Musical Art. He graduated with highest honors, winning the 
Loeb Prize in 1927. A year later he made his U.S. debut at Town Hall in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 With his wife, pianist Annette Leibold, he moved in 1933 to Los Angeles, where 
the couple broadcast recitals over radio station KFI. Ernst Lubitsch heard them 
and hired Kaufman to perform the violin solos in the 1934 film "The Merry 
Widow." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kaufman later joked to The Times that his edited contribution was so 
small he felt like "the little man who wasn't there," he went on to play and 
serve as concertmaster for hundreds of soundtrack orchestras. He provided the 
sound of Pinnochio sliding down the fiddle strings in the Disney animated 
feature and was the concertmaster for the soundtrack orchestras in "Gone With 
the Wind," "Wuthering Heights," "Cleopatra" and "Magnificent Obsession." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kaufmans frequently performed concert tours, and when they were labeled 
one of "the happiest married couples in Hollywood" in 1945, they attributed 
their bliss partially to their busy dual career. Mrs. Kaufman is her husband's 
only survivor.

TIMELY PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It was hard to ignore the irony of your lead editorial, Jan. 28, 
"Government: When It Works Well and When It Doesn't." The Times was critical of 
an apparent lack of urgency in the city's public works construction and 
modernization programs which, you opined, may have left us more vulnerable than 
necessary to the impact of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand on Nov. 16 and 17, exactly two months prior to the 
Northridge quake, The Times published a series of articles criticizing the Rail 
Construction Corp.'s management of the Metro Rail subway construction for, 
among other things, being in too much of a rush to complete the project at the 
earliest possible date. The Times questioned the decision to use expedited 
competitive contracting methods to complete the Metrolink terminal at Union 
Station many months sooner than would otherwise have been possible. The story 
implied that RCC's "high urgency" management approach might have resulted in 
increased project costs. 
</P>
<P>
 While those of us who have spent our careers managing large construction 
projects would argue that our successful early completion efforts, in fact, 
saved millions of dollars, in the harsh reality of late January, 1994, marginal 
cost differences hardly seem worth discussing. Today it would be difficult to 
put a price tag on the value of the operating Metrolink system and Metro Red 
Line for the tens of thousands of commuters who are relying on these newly 
completed facilities or for the millions who have indirectly benefited from the 
safe and reliable transportation services which they are providing in this time 
of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't have it both ways. Either we are going to get behind the efforts of 
those dedicated professionals who are building our future with a sense of 
urgency and commitment that is not government business-as-usual; or we can 
second-guess and criticize their every action until the typical government 
overreaction concocts a cure that is far worse than the purported ailment, and 
our mass transit program becomes mired in layer upon layer of bureaucratic 
oversight and review and is run by people whose primary objective is to not 
make a mistake, rather than by people who have the courage to act and are 
mission-focused and results-oriented.

NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "North Korea Plays a Dangerous Game" states your Feb. 7 editorial, which 
goes on to remind us "how great a worry North Korea's nuclear program has 
become." You are right, there is no greater worry than a global body politic 
diseased by the cancer-like spread of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, largely ignored by our news media, is that since the dawn of the 
nuclear age we have been guilty of a demeaning double standard: While preaching 
nuclear abstention to others, we ourselves have been practicing precisely the 
opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 While serving on our country's delegation to the 1978 U.N. Special Session on 
Disarmament, I was told by a delegate from Pakistan that the leader of her 
nation had recently expressed his determination to obtain nuclear weapons "even 
if our people have to eat grass." She followed this with a question: How can 
the United States and the Soviet Union be too blind to see that their senseless 
competition for so-called nuclear superiority creates powerful pressure upon 
others to become "nuclear-haves"?  
</P>
<P>
 Let me stipulate to simplistic sloganeers that we can't put the genie back in 
the bottle. Should we therefore permit the genie to multiply to a point at 
which nuclear catastrophe becomes a question of when rather than if? In Cold 
War competition the focus was on bombs. If we can now shift to brains, there 
surely exists sufficient human intelligence to construct a political pathway 
that leads, incrementally, to non-proliferation which is internationally 
accepted and enforced. The first step must be ours -- a determined effort by 
President Clinton to speed up and strengthen negotiations to ban all nuclear 
testing, everywhere, by 1995.

LUCAS' TRAVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * With reference to "State Chief Justice Lucas' Travels Did Not Violate 
Ethics, Panel Says" (Jan. 29), I am outraged and dismayed with the finding of 
the California Commission on Judicial Performance that there is no basis for 
disciplining Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas for accepting reimbursement from a 
subsidiary of a corporation that has had cases before the court. It is 
immaterial and irrelevant that Lucas may have voted against the corporation's 
interests after the trips for which he had received payment. 
</P>
<P>
 It stretches credulity to accept the commission's finding that this did not 
create even an appearance of impropriety. Of all people, the chief justice 
should recognize that indeed, in the eyes of the average person, to accept 
reimbursement from a corporation for trips to conferences does not only give a 
strong indication of impropriety but is in fact more than appearance, it is 
improper. What would the chief justice say of a legislator or of a judge on a 
lower court who did the same thing? 
</P>
<P>
 And one more thing: Who composes the commission that made the favorable ruling 
for the chief justice? Aren't the members of the commission judges themselves, 
who have reason to defer to the chief? As a citizen and retired attorney, I am 
ashamed of the commission and vastly disappointed in Justice Lucas.

DRUG WATCH; TREATMENT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's new $13.2-billion drug initiative, unveiled 
symbolically at a prison in suburban Washington, signals a much-needed shift of 
priorities for a national drug policy that had placed too much emphasis on law 
enforcement and not enough on treatment and education. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, announced Wednesday, the share of funds dedicated to treatment 
and prevention programs will grow by nearly 20% -- to $5.4 billion.Monies 
allocated to combatting drug production at its sources also will increase, in 
large part at the expense of cross-border anti-smuggling programs, which will 
be reduced 7.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 These changes come at a time when many of the punitive measures advocated 
fervently by the Bush Administration during its war on drugs are being called 
into question. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state prisons are filling up with drug offenders as a result of 
longer mandatory sentences. In 1980, 4,898 prisoners served time for violating 
federal drug laws. By 1993 federal prisons were bursting with more than 32,000 
drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 However, those policies failed to substantially affect drug prices or supply. 
If anything, a recent study of high school students showing increased drug 
abuse could be a signal that the problem is again on the upswing.  
</P>
<P>
 So while the Clinton plan isn't likely to have a great impact right away, it's 
targeting the right areas. With thousands of people already on the waiting list 
for drug treatment in Los Angeles the new money can't get here soon enough.

TIME FOR THE TWO TO GET REAL; TOKYO, WASHINGTON HEADING FOR DEEP TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S.-Japan summit is a ritual that has become tiresome in its ceremony and 
virtually meaningless in its results. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little reason to expect at this point anything hugely better from 
today's first summit between President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. But to allow the summit to end with nothing more than the usual vague 
promises and photo opportunity with smiles and handshakes would set back 
U.S.-Japan relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is taking an uncharacteristically firm line with Japan under 
the Clinton Administration, which is seeking a results-oriented trade policy. 
U.S. rhetoric has been screechy chalk on the blackboard at times, but 
Washington's rising frustration with Japan is shared by many American 
businesses and Japan watchers. After the signing of nearly 30 U.S.-Japanese 
trade agreements since 1980, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan is up to an 
intolerable $60 billion. Will this gap never lessen? 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for Clinton and Hosokawa is to move trade relations beyond the 
traditional papering over of differences. The two men thrive on political 
brinkmanship and pride themselves on being agents of change. Now's the chance 
to achieve change. 
</P>
<P>
 The "framework" agreement signed last July by Clinton and then-Prime Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa calls for the President and the prime minister to meet every 
six months to review progress in trade talks. Today's meeting is on automobiles 
and auto parts, medical equipment, telecommunications and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The impasse in the series of talks is over the definition of "objective 
criteria" for measuring imports into Japan. The Japanese contend that 
Washington is demanding specific, numerical targets for imports -- in other 
words, managed trade. That should not be U.S. policy; the idea is contrary to 
free trade principles. American trade negotiators repeatedly claim that they 
have not used the terms numerical targets or managed trade. Therein lies the 
wiggle room for a compromise that saves face on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-Japan relations may not have advanced during Hosokawa's roller coaster 
first six months in office, but he did win important political reforms, lift 
the rice import ban and wedge open the construction market. He got the 
Parliament to enact an economic stimulus plan, though the $140-billion program 
was far from everything he and Clinton wanted. The reformist Hosokawa favors 
deregulation, open markets and a more consumer-oriented economy -- all of which 
serve both U.S. interests and Japanese consumers' interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton may not be taking the best, most coherent approach to this divisive 
issue, but it should now be clear to the Japanese that he means business. Tokyo 
should not underestimate the new American resolve.

LAST CHANCE FOR RLA?; TWO TOP PROSPECTS IN LINE TO BE THE NEW HEADS OF REBUILD 
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two fine Los Angeles civic leaders -- Arco Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer Lodwrick M. Cook and businesswoman and former Deputy Mayor Linda Griego 
-- have been tapped to head Rebuild Los Angeles, now known as RLA. Word of 
their appointments, expected to become official next week after a vote by the 
RLA's 96-member board, is being greeted with enthusiasm. Continuing concerns 
about RLA lie not with its new leaders but with RLA itself -- how it is 
structured and its controversial past. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA, brought together a few days after the 1992 riots by then-Mayor Tom 
Bradley, was an attempt to get the city back on its feet after the nation's 
worst urban riots of the century. It was a time of great confusion and angst 
for Los Angeles, and the after-effects of that wrenching time continue today. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA, originally headed by former Olympic czar Peter V. Ueberroth, was in many 
ways based on the private-enterprise model that made the 1984 Games a success. 
But the task of rebuilding Los Angeles proved far more daunting than organizing 
a two-week international event. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even objected to the original name, Rebuild L.A., arguing that the city 
needed to do much more than merely replace structures and institutions that had 
not served all of its diverse populations very well. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon criticism mounted, some of it stemming from unreasonable expectations 
that RLA somehow was supposed to cure all of the region's social and economic 
ills. 
</P>
<P>
 As new leaders assume the RLA mantle, now is an excellent time for a redoubled 
effort toward what RLA is best suited to do -- economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also time for government officials at every level to pick up the ball in 
their areas of responsibility: They must create social and economic policies 
that facilitate RLA's work. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first few days after the devastating Northridge earthquake most of the 
walls that mark political turf in the city, county and state dropped. People 
were focused on surviving or helping. If the politicians can find a way to 
recapture that spirit of cooperation, RLA and all of Los Angeles will have a 
better chance this time around.

DEADLY SHELLING IN SARAJEVO

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your "sensible middle ground" option for the siege of Sarajevo is neither 
sensible nor effective (editorial, Feb. 8). 
</P>
<P>
 Committing U.S. forces, in the air and on the ground, in an attempt to lift 
the siege would unnecessarily risk American lives. The mortar shell that 
provided the latest atrocity in Sarajevo (Feb. 6) was fired by a highly 
portable weapon that is extremely difficult to spot from the air. Pinpointing 
mortar and small artillery positions in the rugged hills above the city would 
be nearly impossible, and extremely hazardous for the air crews. Our troops on 
the ground provide additional targets for these mobile mortar crews hidden in 
the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 I question whether this once-gracious city can be saved, short of a massive 
military intervention by the U.S. and NATO. Such an intervention would insert 
the U.S. in the middle of a regional conflict stemming from racial and 
religious hatreds that are older than America itself.

Sarajevo. One caveat: Basic morality and international law clearly indicate 
that a people have a right of self-defense. The U.S. must lift the embargo and 
sanctions preventing defensive arms from reaching the legal government of 
Bosnia.

on civilians in the Sarajevo central market. For over two years, the presence 
of U.N. forces has instead been a barrier to stopping the killing, as the Serbs 
use U.N. troops as hostages in their deadly genocide against Bosnian Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 If the West is reluctant to act because U.N. soldiers might bear the brunt of 
a Serb reprisal, then either remove the U.N. troops entirely, reinforce the 
units to a level sufficient to repulse Serb reprisals, or redeploy U.N. 
soldiers to secure areas where they can effectively defend themselves. Then use 
air strikes and cruise missiles to strike Serb heavy artillery positions around 
Sarajevo and other endangered Bosnian cities and give the Bosnian government 
the weapons to stop the Serbs' murderous aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 You can be sure that Sarajevans and residents and refugees in other Bosnian 
cites would prefer the risk of possibly dying from a misplaced NATO missile 
than the certainty of eventually expiring at the hands of Serbian ethnic 
cleansing.

 On one hand they say that the French and British are urging the U.S. to bomb 
Serbs, and in the next breath they say that countries that have troops on the

might put their troops in danger.

 The latest massacre in Sarajevo is blamed on Serbs, even though the United 
Nations cannot confirm who did it. The media will not speculate whether the 
Muslims could have done such a thing. The media know that the Muslims have done 
this kind of thing in what was called the "bread line massacre," which brought 
on sanctions on Serbia.  
</P>
<P>
 Who would have benefited from this latest incident? Not Serbs, for the outcry 
of intervention only helps the Muslims!

courageous women, Tansu Ciller of Turkey and Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, showed 
their concern for the tragic situation of the Bosnian people.

 It is very interesting that female heads of government, including former 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, show more compassion for the 
suffering people of Bosnia than their male colleagues. Mrs. Thatcher herself 
has been consistently criticizing the U.N., NATO, and the world governments for 
their lack of effective action to stop the killing and suffering in Bosnia.

U.S. MEDDLING IN RUSSIAN POLITICS MUST END; FOREIGN POLICY: REFORMS MUST BE 
GRADUAL AND DIRECTED FROM MOSCOW, NOT WASHINGTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN F. COHEN, Stephen F. Cohen is a professor of politics and the 
director of Russian Studies at Princeton University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The worst and most predictable American foreign-policy failure of the late 
20th Century has been unfolding in post-communist Russia ever since the Soviet 
breakup in 1991. All the outcomes we want in a country that remains so 
essential to our security -- democracy, a prospering economy, a political 
Establishment friendly to the West, major reductions and safeguarding of 
nuclear weapons and other devices of mass destruction -- have been undermined 
by U.S. government policy. 
</P>
<P>
 At fault is the basic premise that has guided American policy since 1991: that 
the United States can and should intervene deeply in Russia's internal affairs 
in order to transform that nation into an American-style system at home and a 
compliant junior partner abroad. A preposterously missionary idea, it is in 
almost total conflict with Russia's historical traditions, present-day 
realities and actual possibilities, and thus dangerously counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, the United States said to the new Russian leadership: If you 
follow our "free market" prescriptions for economic reform, a 
leap-to-capitalism "shock therapy" and our lead on international issues, we 
will give you ample financial aid, on-site adviser-therapists and a place by 
our side (or in our shadow) in world affairs. For his own complex reasons, 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin accepted -- or pretended to accept -- the 
offer, immediately anointed as a "strategic partnership and friendship." And on 
that romantic assumption, the Clinton Administration, with even more 
ideological gusto and less restraint than its predecessor, has stuck to Yeltsin 
like Krazy Glue, at least until very recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider how badly this missionary American policy has failed: 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects for peaceful development toward stable markets and democracy in 
Russia are worse today than they were two years ago and much worse than they 
were when President Clinton took office. The economy is in free fall, ravaged 
by a multiple collapse of production, capital investment, consumption, legal 
transaction and the ruble. Moreover, Russia has had no real political system at 
all since Yeltsin destroyed the constitutional order by force last fall, only 
his current efforts to create a personal regime of power. As a result, 
anti-democratic, military and other security forces now play a much larger role 
in domestic and foreign politics than they did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has Russia's foreign policy conformed to U.S. prescriptions, as evidenced 
most recently by its opposition to moving NATO eastward and to Western action 
against Serbia. Still worse, nothing much has been done to reduce the various 
nuclear threats on former Soviet territory, which are greater today than they 
were under the Soviet regime. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the U.S. wager on Boris Yeltsin as the popular instrument of the 
American crusade, 85% of voters in December voted against his policies and 
party. A significant part of that anti-Yeltsin vote was an anti-American 
backlash.  
</P>
<P>
 It is said that the United States must support Yeltsin because he is Russia's 
elected president. But Clinton and his aides have gone far beyond that norm of 
international relations, becoming Yeltsin's cheerleader, accomplice and spin 
doctor, thus implicating America in some of his most ill-advised and wicked 
deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand our complicity, look at Yeltsin's leadership through the eyes of 
a great many Russian citizens. For them, he has been an extremist leader 
imposing from above exceedingly radical policies for which they never voted. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's most extreme measures came as three still-traumatic shocks to 
society. In 1991, he suddenly abolished the Soviet Union, the only country most 
Russians had ever known. In 1992, his economic "shock therapy" took away the 
life savings and living standards of most Russian families. And in 1993, his 
tanks overthrew the elected Parliament and constitutional system that had been 
presented to citizens as the legitimate post-communist order. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Yeltsin's shock leadership utterly polarized Russian 
society, devastating all varieties of moderation and centrism in political 
life. Extremism always begets extremism. Yeltsin's extremist policies led to 
the victory of the extreme nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky in the December 
elections and to the sea changes under way in Russian politics today. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall now the American role in those events, even leaving aside any covert 
involvement. The U.S. government applauded Yeltsin's precipitous abolition of 
the Soviet Union without real concern for its impact on ordinary citizens. When 
his "shock therapy" then impoverished tens of millions of Russians (including 
prospective middle-class investors in economic privatization), our government 
urged him to do more of the same, scorning other pro-market but anti-Yeltsin 
economists for not being "real" reformers. When parliamentary opposition to 
Yeltsin grew in 1992 and '93, the U.S. government echoed his charge that it was 
a "citadel of Red-Brown reaction," helping to undermine what Russian 
democratization needs most -- an established parliament and accepted 
opposition. The Clinton Administration supported Yeltsin's first attempt to 
shut down the elected Parliament last March, shunned Russian moderates who 
tried to prevent a more fateful confrontation and cheered even more loudly when 
Yeltsin finally resorted to a tank-backed coup, thereby endorsing Russia's long 
anti-democratic tradition of unfettered executive power. And now that Yeltsin 
has contrived a new "constitution" without an authentic separation of powers, 
the Administration heralds it as a "democratic breakthrough," evidently unaware 
that Russia has had many constitutions but never any sustained 
constitutionalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the United States' crusade to macromanage Russia's present and future 
must end, but what kind of policy should be adopted? The answer must be found 
this time in Russia, not in Washington, world banks or American universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Deeply wounded, polarized and angry, Russia desperately needs moderate, 
consensual, gradual reforms. More shocks will almost certainly send some rough 
beast slouching toward the Kremlin. A coalition of Russian moderates -- 
"centrists" who see themselves trapped between Yeltsin and Zhirinovsky -- is 
struggling to emerge as a political force capable of reshaping the reform 
process, with or without Yeltsin. Some such moderate bloc is Russia's best 
hope, and possibly last chance, for democratic and market reform. If so, it is 
also our only hope for a Russia engaged in progressive change at home rather 
than a pursuit of lost power abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, until now an opponent of moderation in Russian 
politics, must adopt a new and moderate principle of its own: that the United 
States does not have the wisdom, right or power to intervene so deeply in 
Russia's internal affairs; all attempts to do so will backfire perilously. On 
that principle, the United States will withdraw its excessive presence in 
Russia, cease its dogmatic sermons and dollar-laden ultimatums and encourage 
Russia to find its destiny, as it must, within its own circumstances and 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 And when -- or for pessimists, if -- Russia finds its own way toward political 
and economic reform, even if it is not ours, the Clinton Administration will be 
able to give generous financial assistance, as it must, that is both productive 
and honorable.

PERSPECTIVE ON POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION; IT WAS ISRAEL'S OPTIMISTS, NOT ITS 
CYNICS, WHO CHANGED HISTORY; THE BUDDING MIDEAST PEACE CAN TEACH SOMETHING TO 
THE PESSIMISTS WHO PREVAIL IN AMERICAN POLITICS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LERNER, Michael Lerner is editor of Tikkun Magazine: a Bimonthly 
Jewish Critique of Politics, Culture and Society, published in New York. His 
book, Jewish Renewal, is to be published by Putnam in August. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not only Jews should celebrate the latest breakthrough toward Middle East 
peace. The accord signed by Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat is one more proof that the cynical realism and 
sophisticated pessimism that are the hallmarks of American political debate are 
often unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Moral passion and prophetic vision can sometimes break the stalemates imposed 
by our stereotyped fears of "the other." When anybody tells you that the 
selfishness and cynicism that dominate American politics cannot be broken, that 
it's "common sense" for people to refuse to move beyond narrow self-interest to 
embrace larger ethical concerns, tell them about the remarkable transformation 
that is going on inside Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the Israeli peace movement and its supporters in the United States 
have been maligned as naive optimists who did not understand that "the Arab 
mentality" only wants war and conquest. For years the vocal minority of 
American Jews who control the institutions of the organized Jewish community 
have denounced as "self-hating" or "disloyal" the tendency of the American 
Jewish majority to support the exchange of land for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Jews have been told that the biblical injunction to "Remember what 
was done to us by Amalek," (the biblical tribe that attacked us in the Sinai 
when we were vulnerable escapees from Egyptian slavery but later applied to all 
those who threatened Jewish extermination, from the prime minister of 
Ahasuerus' Persia to Hitler) should be applied to the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry that Israel has one of the most powerful and sophisticated armies 
in the world, while the Palestinians have none and live under occupation -- the 
terrible enemy would reassert itself, putting Jews into great danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish fears were understandable. It's only 50 years since one out of every 
three Jews alive in the world were murdered. But one of the many terrible 
consequences of this trauma is that it paralyzed us and made us exaggerate the 
power of our enemies and made us so distrustful of our potential allies that at 
times Jewish paranoia became self-fulfillingly true. The obsession with our 
vulnerability made it difficult to imagine that anyone was really our friend or 
that anyone could ever be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jewish life increasingly focused on self-defense, Jewish commitment to the 
poor and the oppressed was replaced with a narrow focus on "is it good for the 
Jews?" No wonder, then, that so many younger Jews began to seek spiritual and 
moral truths outside of their Jewish heritage: the Judaism they had encountered 
in the organized Jewish community was dominated by pain, a manipulative use of 
the Holocaust to generate big bucks and blind loyalty to Israeli policies, and 
a suspicion of anyone who thought that Jewish values implied caring about the 
poor or the oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has now begun to chart a courageous new direction for Jewish life. 
Mutual recognition, validating the rights of "the other," recognizing the 
humanity of our enemies -- these are steps that break the pattern of mutual 
hostility that has too often dominated our history. 
</P>
<P>
 If the inevitable escalation of provocative acts, both by Palestinian 
terrorists and by Israeli settlers opposed to the accord, does not succeed in 
derailing the peace process, we might see an escalation of trust that would 
provide a basis for the creation of a Palestinian state living in peace with 
Israel. But if Israeli settler violence and civil disobedience plus Palestinian 
terrorism succeed in frightening Israel back into policies that deny 
Palestinians the dignity and self-determination that they deserve, we could yet 
see a disintegration of all that has been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is the real point: Cynicism and pessimism are never just a 
description of reality; they create the reality. Conversely, the degree to 
which we reach for our highest vision and highest hopes makes it more likely 
that some of that vision will be realized. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a moment when all the world should be proud of the state of Israel. 
It's never a surprise when those who have been victimized become scared and 
distrustful. But what the Jewish people have done is to provide a different 
model -- a model of hopefulness and trust. Though the cynics will certainly 
jump on every setback as "proof" that the hopefulness is "unrealistic," the 
Israeli government has shown that sometimes the best Realpolitik is to reject 
the pessimism and narrow self-interest that pass for common sense in American 
life, and instead embrace a politics of morality, hopefulness and idealism -- 
what I call the politics of meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 If America would allow itself to learn this lesson from Israel, the whole 
world would benefit.

UNTIL JAPAN REINVENTS ITSELF, ONLY A RESULTS-ORIENTED POLICY WILL WORK; TRADE: 
CRITICS OF THIS APPROACH ARE WORKING UNDER THE FALSE PREMISE THAT IT HAS A 
STANDARD MARKET ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLYDE PRESTOWITZ, Clyde Prestowitz is president of the Economic Strategy 
Institute in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With today's summit between President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa in mind, several editorialists and academics have attacked 
the Administration's results-oriented "framework" negotiations as protectionist 
managed trade and have called instead for reliance on traditional macroeconomic 
tools to solve the trade problem with Japan. They couldn't be more wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 These commentators begin from the dual premise that Japan's is a normal market 
economy and that the problem is the size of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. 
They make four major points: 
</P>
<P>
 * In a world of multilateral trade, bilateral balances are unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
 * The size of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan is due to high consumption and 
low savings rates in the United States coupled with the reverse in Japan. In 
particular, the trade deficit is largely a reflection of the U.S. budget 
deficit, which by stimulating the economy sucks in imports. 
</P>
<P>
 * The solution is not sectoral negotiations over such things as auto parts and 
insurance, but stimulation of the Japanese economy (so that it will suck in 
imports) coupled with deficit reduction here.  
</P>
<P>
 * Management of the exchange rate to strengthen the yen and weaken the dollar 
should reduce the deficit by making U.S. goods less expensive in Japan and 
Japanese goods more expensive in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 While superficially convincing, under closer examination this analysis is 
misleading. The fact that Japan's most powerful politician, Ichiro Ozawa, has 
written a book urging Japan to become a "normal country" is a powerful 
indication that Japan's is not a standard market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The editorialists' criticism that the Administration's insistence on 
measurable results in various industries will lead to heavy-handed management 
or cartelization of the economy is valid only if such management does not 
already exist. But recent scandals in Japan have demonstrated that despite 
years of insistence by top Japanese leaders that such industries as 
construction and finance were completely open, in fact they were completely 
rigged. Indeed, in some cases, the same bureaucrats who insisted that Americans 
should just try a little harder were precisely the ones who winked as Japanese 
brokers guaranteed their major corporate clients profits on their stock-market 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the Japanese do import, as in the case of coal or agricultural 
commodities, the importers form a buying monopoly to exert maximum downward 
pressure on prices. This in not exactly what Adam Smith had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Japan's is not a standard market economy, so the problem is not merely 
the size of the trade imbalance. Among the most important U.S. exports to Japan 
are unprocessed logs, scrap aluminum and waste paper. Theoretically, we could 
cut down enough trees and gather up enough empty soda cans and scrap paper to 
balance these accounts. But doing so while being locked out of Japanese markets 
for telecommunications equipment, medical devices and sophisticated services 
would not be acceptable to most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 While bilateral imbalances are not normally cause for concern in a 
multilateral system, our deficit with Japan is so large, has persisted for so 
long and is so similar to imbalances Japan maintains with its other trading 
partners as to suggest something amiss in the trading system. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings and budget-deficit arguments are also misleading. Although 
overall, savings and investment rates and budget deficits dictate the size of a 
nation's trade balances, these factors have nothing to do with the size and 
shape of a particular bilateral balance. Factors such as trade barriers, 
collusive business arrangements and regulatory strictures predominate here. 
</P>
<P>
 The proof of this is the fact that Japan has a trade surplus with countries 
such as Singapore, which have higher savings rates and even greater budget 
surpluses than Japan. But the U.S. budget deficit has fallen by nearly $100 
billion in the past year, yet the trade deficit with Japan has soared. 
Obviously the conventional explanation doesn't work in a bilateral context. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will the conventional prescriptions of fiscal stimulus and exchange-rate 
manipulation work either. The structural factors that make Japan's economy 
unique also result in a low propensity to import. This and the large gap 
between export and import levels means that an impossibly large stimulus would 
be necessary to reduce the trade surplus significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also limits to the potential effect of a stronger yen. Based on 
current propensities to import in both the United States and Japan, an exchange 
rate of 60 yen to $1 would be necessary just to halve the current bilateral 
U.S. trade deficit. But at such a level, world financial markets would be in 
chaos, and it is extremely unlikely to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 The only real solution is to change the propensity to import in Japan, and 
that means changing the structure of its economy. While it would be nice if the 
Japanese government and industry would recognize this and act accordingly, 
until they do, the Clinton Administration has no choice but to keep pressing 
for concrete structural changes that yield measurable results.

PURTZER SWINGS INTO LEAD; GOLF: FORMER L.A. OPEN WINNER SHOOTS 64 FOR TWO-SHOT 
ADVANTAGE AFTER FIRST ROUND AT RIVIERA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's difficult to imagine that Tom Purtzer has ever had a problem with his 
golf swing. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it was only a couple of years ago that his peers voted his swing 
"the sweetest" on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked as sweet as ever Thursday at Riviera Country Club, where he shot a 
seven-under-par 64 for the first-round lead in the $1-million Nissan Los 
Angeles Open. 
</P>
<P>
 He holds a two-stroke edge over Chip Beck and Jesper Parnevik of Sweden. Fred 
Couples birdied the last hole and finished another stroke behind at 67, along 
with Corey Pavin, Jay Delsing, David Frost, Fuzzy Zoeller and Nolan Henke. 
</P>
<P>
 On a cool day with a gentle breeze, most of the low scores came during the 
morning rounds when the greens were soft and free of spike marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus, an afternoon starter playing Riviera for the first time since 
1985, was back in the pack at 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Tom Kite also had problems in the afternoon and shot a 72.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was really difficult making four- and five-foot putts in the afternoon," 
said Couples, who started on the back nine and was three under par after a 
birdie-eagle start. "The greens were extremely bumpy, but it's going to be that 
way for the leaders, who have to play it in the afternoon (today)." 
</P>
<P>
 Purtzer was among the early players, but he didn't really take full advantage 
of the smooth greens. He hit his irons close enough to make seven birdies, but 
it could have been better. He missed a three-foot putt at the 10th hole and 
eight-foot putts on 17 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he's complaining. It has been a while since Purtzer has played this 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Purtzer, 42, is beginning his 20th year on the PGA Tour and has not won since 
the World Series of Golf in 1991. That was also the year he finished fourth on 
the money list and was looking forward to bigger and better things. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had back problems the next year and tried to change his swing to ease 
the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really like to make excuses, because everybody out here plays with 
some kind of injury," Purtzer said. "I tried to compensate for it, and it just 
made things worse." 
</P>
<P>
 He slumped to 93rd on the money list in 1992, then to 136th last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My real problem was in not understanding what I was supposed to be doing," he 
said. "Instead of turning my hips, I was sliding them and hitting a lot of 
shots to the right, or pulling them left. I was hitting some shots I had never 
seen before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really was bothering me because the problems started after such a great 
year in '91. I was really looking forward to '92. I was so full of confidence, 
but when things started going wrong, it was a real setback." 
</P>
<P>
 He was also beginning to doubt his ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mental part of this game is everything," he said. "It's the difference 
between a top-10 player and someone who's 60th on the list. The top 10 players 
can talk themselves into good shots." 
</P>
<P>
 All Purtzer was doing was talking himself out of a career. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching video of himself did little to help, but he studied still photographs 
of his swing during the Phoenix Open last month and they revealed the flaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The hips started turning, shots started flying in the right direction and his 
scores started coming down. He shot a 68 in the first round at Phoenix and 
finished 39th. Although he missed the cut at Pebble Beach last week, he kept 
working on what he knew was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't hit the ball this well in four or five years," Purtzer said. "This 
is the kind of round I needed to turn this thing around." 
</P>
<P>
 It helps that he's at Riviera, where he won his first tournament in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember every shot I hit that year," Purtzer said. "It's fun to 
reflect on it. I remember how scared I was on the first tee in the final round. 
It was the most scared I have ever been, standing on the first tee with with a 
million people out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Purtzer wouldn't mind having that feeling again Sunday. But if not, he's at 
least satisfied with knowing he has that sweet swing under control again. Golf 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Some people are calling Corey Pavin the best player never to win a major 
championship, and it bothers him. "It makes me more determined to finally win a 
major," he said. "I have played well in some of them, but until I get a 'W,' I 
won't be satisfied." Pavin, already considered one of the game's top players 
around the greens, says he will work even harder on that part of his game. "I 
am also going to focus more on getting off to a better start," he said. "I've 
had a fourth (in Hawaii) and a second (at Pebble Beach) already this year, but 
I've come from pretty far behind to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chip Beck, who won this tournament in 1988, is impressed by the poise of Phil 
Mickelson. "Nothing seems to bother him," Beck said. "A bad shot, a bad putt, 
his reaction is the same. With his talent, he's going to go a long way." 
Mickelson opened with a 70. . . . Ted Oh of Torrance, one of two amateurs in 
the field of 144, shot a 75. He played his way into the tournament last year 
and was given an exemption this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Barber, who still puts in some time as the pro at Griffith Park when he 
isn't playing on the Senior PGA Tour, bettered his age by one shot with a 76. . 
. . Jesper Parnevik of Sweden was paired with Gary Nicklaus, Jack's son, and 
marveled at the way the young man handles the pressure. "That has to be so 
difficult," Parnevik said. "I kind of know what it's like because my father is 
a famous comedian and impersonator in Sweden."

BRUINS SNOOZE, DON'T LOSE; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: IN ANOTHER WAKE-UP CALL, EDNEY'S 
13 FREE THROWS HELP UCLA PULL OUT 79-76 VICTORY OVER WASHINGTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What do you call it when you take winning ugly to the next level? UCLA calls 
it winning gruesome, which is what the Bruins did Thursday night at Pauley 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA somehow managed to keep a grip on the basketball just long enough to 
defeat Washington, 79-76, and narrowly avoid losing to a team that is now 3-16. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Bruins, 16-2 and 9-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference, it was not the type 
of performance you want too many people to know about. 
</P>
<P>
 But right now, the message is out. UCLA simply isn't playing very well with 
two defeats in its last four games and a slim victory over a 1-9 conference 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 It was left to Tyus Edney to sort it all out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a wake-up call," said Edney, who had 22 points, 13 of them at the 
free-throw line to rescue UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Notre Dame was a wake-up call, Cal was a wake-up call," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It sure seems like UCLA has been getting a lot of wake-up calls lately. They 
sure should be up and about by now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't pretty from our standpoint," Coach Jim Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it wasn't. UCLA's biggest problem was holding on to the ball. When the 
Bruins had 20 turnovers at Notre Dame, they promised not to do it again. They 
didn't. They threw the ball away 23 times against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Shon Tarver said it was an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're going to come out every game and dribble it off our knees 
like tonight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins perfected that move against the Huskies, an overachieving team if 
there ever was one. When Amir Rashad scored with 4:13 left, Washington led, 
71-68, and Bruin palms were getting pretty sweaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Edney free throws tied the score, the last two coming after Rashad had a 
basket taken away when he committed an offensive foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more free throws by Ed O'Bannon gave UCLA the lead for good, 73-71, with 
2:06 to go. Tarver stole a rebound from Rashad, then scored in the lane as the 
shot clock expired, 75-71. 
</P>
<P>
 That was just about enough points, which was fortunate because UCLA's vaunted 
offense produced only four field goals the last 11:34. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver pitched with in 20 points, George Zidek had 16 and Ed O'Bannon 13, 
enough to offset 21 points from Rashad, as the Huskies drilled a season-high 10 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 And as is their custom, the Bruins shot poorly from long-distance -- one for 
seven. Against Cal, Notre Dame and Washington, UCLA is two for 42 from 
three-point territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Things will get better Saturday afternoon against Washington State, won't 
they? 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure hope so," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, there wasn't much room for hope. In the first half, the Bruins 
showed how to commit 15 turnovers, go more than seven minutes without a hoop, 
get three fouls on a key starter and still finish with a lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy. As Charles O'Bannon watched from the bench because of foul 
trouble, UCLA fell behind, 29-22, on a three-pointer by Jason Tyrus, who was so 
wide open he was probably lonesome. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver inspired a 15-2 run in the last 3:20 to close the half, beginning with 
a muscle drive through the middle that produced his first basket of the game, 
not that surprising since it was also his first shot. 
</P>
<P>
 That run gave the Bruins a 37-31 lead at the break, which they lost in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the sign of a good team," Washington Coach Bob Bender said. "You may 
not play a perfect game, but you find a way to win."

PURTZER SWINGS INTO LEAD; GOLF: FORMER L.A. OPEN WINNER SHOOTS 64 FOR TWO-SHOT 
ADVANTAGE AFTER FIRST ROUND AT RIVIERA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's difficult to imagine that Tom Purtzer has ever had a problem with his 
golf swing. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it was only a couple of years ago that his peers voted his swing 
"the sweetest" on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked as sweet as ever Thursday at Riviera Country Club, where he shot a 
seven-under-par 64 for the first-round lead in the $1-million Nissan Los 
Angeles Open. 
</P>
<P>
 He holds a two-stroke edge over Chip Beck and Jesper Parnevik of Sweden. Fred 
Couples birdied the last hole and finished another stroke behind at 67, along 
with Corey Pavin, Jay Delsing, David Frost, Fuzzy Zoeller and Nolan Henke. 
</P>
<P>
 On a cool day with a gentle breeze, most of the low scores came during the 
morning rounds when the greens were soft and free of spike marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus, an afternoon starter playing Riviera for the first time since 
1985, was back in the pack at 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Tom Kite also had problems in the afternoon and shot a 72.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was really difficult making four- and five-foot putts in the afternoon," 
said Couples, who started on the back nine and was three under par after a 
birdie-eagle start. "The greens were extremely bumpy, but it's going to be that 
way for the leaders, who have to play it in the afternoon (today)." 
</P>
<P>
 Purtzer was among the early players, but he didn't really take full advantage 
of the smooth greens. He hit his irons close enough to make seven birdies, but 
it could have been better. He missed a three-foot putt at the 10th hole and 
eight-foot putts on 17 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he's complaining. It has been a while since Purtzer has played this 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Purtzer, 42, is beginning his 20th year on the PGA Tour and has not won since 
the World Series of Golf in 1991. That was also the year he finished fourth on 
the money list and was looking forward to bigger and better things. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had back problems the next year and tried to change his swing to ease 
the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really like to make excuses, because everybody out here plays with 
some kind of injury," Purtzer said. "I tried to compensate for it, and it just 
made things worse." 
</P>
<P>
 He slumped to 93rd on the money list in 1992, then to 136th last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My real problem was in not understanding what I was supposed to be doing," he 
said. "Instead of turning my hips, I was sliding them and hitting a lot of 
shots to the right, or pulling them left. I was hitting some shots I had never 
seen before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really was bothering me because the problems started after such a great 
year in '91. I was really looking forward to '92. I was so full of confidence, 
but when things started going wrong, it was a real setback." 
</P>
<P>
 He was also beginning to doubt his ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mental part of this game is everything," he said. "It's the difference 
between a top-10 player and someone who's 60th on the list. The top 10 players 
can talk themselves into good shots." 
</P>
<P>
 All Purtzer was doing was talking himself out of a career. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching video of himself did little to help, but he studied still photographs 
of his swing during the Phoenix Open last month and they revealed the flaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The hips started turning, shots started flying in the right direction and his 
scores started coming down. He shot a 68 in the first round at Phoenix and 
finished 39th. Although he missed the cut at Pebble Beach last week, he kept 
working on what he knew was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't hit the ball this well in four or five years," Purtzer said. "This 
is the kind of round I needed to turn this thing around." 
</P>
<P>
 It helps that he's at Riviera, where he won his first tournament in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember every shot I hit that year," Purtzer said. "It's fun to 
reflect on it. I remember how scared I was on the first tee in the final round. 
It was the most scared I have ever been, standing on the first tee with with a 
million people out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Purtzer wouldn't mind having that feeling again Sunday. But if not, he's at 
least satisfied with knowing he has that sweet swing under control again. L.A.

ANTEATERS COME CLOSE, BUT LOSE TO UTAH STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine Coach Rod Baker benched senior point guard Lloyd Mumford during 
crunch time Thursday and reserve Zuri Williams came in to block what might have 
been the winning layup at the end of regulation and then hit a three-pointer 
with 11 seconds left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like he was destined to be the hero," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irvine's only heroes -- actually two plates of submarine sandwiches -- 
ended up on the floor outside the Anteaters' locker room after assistant Greg 
Vetrone knocked them to the floor and kicked them down hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters, who blew a 12-point second-half lead, lost to Utah State, 
79-77, in front of 1,723 in the Bren Center. The defeat was Irvine's seventh in 
a row and dropped the Anteaters (5-14 overall and 2-9 in the Big West) into 
last place in conference. 
</P>
<P>
 It was their third overtime loss and third two-point defeat of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for Rod," Utah State Coach Larry Eustachy said. "He's just lost 
so many close ones like that. He's just snakebit." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' three-pointer with 11.6 seconds left in overtime had pulled Irvine 
into a 77-77 tie, but forward Jerome Avie obviously didn't realize Williams' 
shot was a three-pointer and he immediately fouled Junsie Cotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotten made both free throws with 9.6 seconds remaining. Irvine's final 
desperation shot -- a three-point attempt by Chris Brown who was juggling the 
ball on the way up -- had no chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Avie declined comment, but Williams said his teammate was unaware that he had 
tied the game with a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, maybe somebody up there is trying to tell us we need to work on 
something else," Williams said. "We just keep making that one mistake that 
costs us the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters didn't lose this one in the final minutes of regulation or 
overtime, however. They lost it when they failed to hold a 55-43 lead with 8:59 
to play. The Aggies (9-11, 6-6) put together a 15-4 run that cut the Irvine 
advantage to one with 3:52 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 During the stretch, Brown missed three three-pointers, forward Khalid Channell 
missed a layup and a four-foot bank shot, Mumford missed a three-pointer and 
Avie missed a short baseline jumper. Irvine made only eight of 23 second-half 
shots from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their zone bothered us," Baker said. "We were getting it into (center) Dee 
(Boyer) and then they packed it in and we missed five or six straight jumpers. 
They were all good shots, they just didn't go in." 
</P>
<P>
 Eustachy wasn't ready to label himself a coaching genius for the move, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went into the zone because we couldn't guard Boyer," he said. "It was no 
great strategy, just a desperation move or we were going to lose by 30." 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, Utah State had a chance to win in regulation when Roddie Anderson, 
who was able to drive to the hoop at will most of the night, got stuffed by 
Williams then got the ball back and put up another errant shot. Eric Franson's 
tip-in attempt trickled around the rim and fell off. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who made a school-record 10 three-pointers Saturday, made his only two 
of the night early in overtime to put Irvine ahead, 71-67, with 2:57 remaining 
in overtime. But Franson, who finished with a game-high 26 points, made two 
scoop-shot layups around Boyer and Anderson, who had 21, scored on three 
consecutive drives and a pair of free throws, to give the Aggies a 77-74 lead 
with 20 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard," Baker said, his voice barely audible. "It's very difficult to get 
into these situations and not come out victorious. Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Forward LaDay Smith and guard Todd Whitehead were in street clothes Thursday 
night, serving a one-game suspension for "violating team rules," according to 
Coach Rod Baker. Whitehead was suspended for two games earlier in the season 
after being cited for shoplifting.

USC FINDS A WAY TO WIN AT HOME; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: PLAYING AT SPORTS ARENA FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN ALMOST FIVE WEEKS, THE TROJANS END THEIR SIX-GAME LOSING 
STREAK, 70-64, OVER WASHINGTON STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the last seven days, USC Coach George Raveling listened to all kinds of 
suggestions on how the Trojans could end their six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 From installing a passing offense to playing more zone defenses, Raveling 
heard them all only to find the answer close to home at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing at home for the first time in nearly five weeks, the Trojans returned 
to their winning ways with a 70-64 Pacific 10 Conference victory over 
Washington State before 2,748 Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the trick," said Lorenzo Orr, who led the Trojans (11-8, 4-6) with 19 
points and nine rebounds. "We were back home at the Sports Arena, where we 
always play better." 
</P>
<P>
 Since March 1990, USC is 48-5 at the Sports Arena, including a 28-2 record 
against Pac-10 teams. The Trojans, however, had not played at the Sports Arena 
since Jan. 8 because of damage caused by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, and 
lost home games at the Forum and Lyon Center on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening tipoff, the Trojans played like a different team from the one 
that had struggled through six consecutive losses. With point guard Burt Harris 
playing his best game of the season, USC controlled the flow of the game 
against the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who has struggled this season, finished with 16 points and five steals 
in 38 minutes, his season-high. Harris also played effective defense and turned 
the ball over only five times. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was Burt's best all-around game of the season," Raveling said. 
"Offensively, defensively and leadership-wise." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris and Orr combined for 18 points in the first half and the Trojans 
committed a season-low three turnovers to take a 34-32 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State (15-7, 5-5) had entered the game by winning five of its last 
six games but had problems against the hustling Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars would have been behind by more with sophomore Mark Hendrickson 
limited to 10 minutes because of a stress fracture to his left leg, had it not 
been for the play of Fred Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, a 6-foot-11 senior, was nearly unstoppable in scoring 23 points and 
grabbing a game-high 17 rebounds. He, along with Isaac Fontaine, who came off 
the bench to score 15 points, kept Washington State in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, you can see how much Hendrickson means to this team," Washington 
State Coach Kelvin Sampson said. "Losing him is really difficult, especially at 
this time of year. But, I can't say enough about Fred Ferguson. He cares about 
one thing and that's to play as hard as he can all of the time. He was the best 
player on the floor tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 USC clicked on all cylinders in the second half with guard Brandon Martin (11 
points) scoring from the outside and Orr controlling the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a big win for us but we now have to build on this," Harris said. 
"Its good that we're back home. Hopefully, we'll start to turn things around, 
but you never know." 
</P>
<P>
 After losing by 30 points to the Cougars last month at Pullman, Wash., the 
victory was special for the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 "USC is a lot different team in this gym," Sampson said. "They have a lot of 
good pieces. They haven't always played well as a team this year but they 
played well in stretches tonight."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; REEVES FINDS ZONE, SHOOTS ARIZONA PAST STANFORD

 Khalid Reeves scored 33 points and made six three-point shots as 16th-ranked 
Arizona held Stanford to a season-low in scoring in a 77-60 victory Thursday 
night at Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebounding from last Saturday's stunning 74-69 loss to Washington at Seattle, 
Arizona claimed a 13th consecutive victory over the Cardinal, which lost for 
only the second time in 11 home games this season. The other loss was to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats, 18-4 overall and 7-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference, made 11 of 18 
three-point shots after making only four of 28 against Washington.

 Dion Cross scored 16 points to lead Stanford (13-6, 6-4). 
</P>

 No. 18 California 95, Arizona State 78 -- Lamond Murray, held scoreless while 
the Golden Bears fell behind by 20 points in the opening 10 minutes at 
Berkeley, finished with 19 points as they won their sixth straight and avenged 
an earlier 63-60 loss to the Sun Devils. 
</P>

 Cal (16-4, 8-2), which got 25 points from Monty Buckley, erased a 34-14 
deficit to trail by 50-46 at halftime. The Golden Bears scored the first eight 
points of the second half to take a 54-50 lead and never trailed the Sun Devils 
(11-8, 6-4) again. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 North Carolina 95, Maryland 89 -- Point guard Derrick Phelps scored nine 
of his 21 points in the final 2:12 to help hold off a furious rally by Maryland 
(12-7, 5-5) in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps also had eight assists, seven steals and five rebounds for North 
Carolina (20-3, 8-2), which has won at least 20 games 24 seasons in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 7 Louisville 65, South Florida 50 -- Clifford Rozier scored 25 points and 
keyed a 17-6 run down the stretch in a Metro Conference game at Tampa, Fla., as 
the Cardinals (19-2, 8-1) won their ninth game in a row. The Bulls (9-11, 2-5) 
entered the game with a 10-game home winning streak, eight this season. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 8 Temple 51, Duquesne 49 -- Eddie Jones scored 24 points and Jason Ivey 
made a short bank shot with six seconds to play for the Owls in an Atlantic 10 
game at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Duquesne (11-8, 5-5) tied the score with 15 seconds to play on a jump shot by 
Kenya Hunter. Rick Brunson then found Ivey for the short shot and the victory 
for Temple (17-3, 10-2). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 13 Massachusetts 70, Rhode Island 64 -- Derek Kellogg scored 13 points, 
seven in the final two minutes, and Lou Roe overcame an early injury to add 11 
as the Minutemen (18-4, 9-0) won at Providence, R.I., to remain undefeated in 
the Atlantic 10. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 22 Marquette 61, Cincinnati 60 -- Jim McIlvaine blocked eight shots, 
scored 18 points and made two free throws that gave the Warriors a Great 
Midwest victory at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 McIlvaine's free throws with 2:20 to play put Marquette ahead, 61-60, and both 
teams went cold the rest of the way. Marquette (16-6, 7-1) missed three free 
throws, and Cincinnati (15-7, 3-4) missed twice in the final nine seconds. 
OTHER GAMES Randolph Childress scored 33 points and Wake Forest (15-7, 5-4) 
destroyed the zone defense of Florida State (10-9, 3-7) with 14 three-point 
goals in a 77-69 ACC victory at Winston-Salem, N.C. . . . Utah (11-10, 5-7 WAC) 
got into overtime with Jimmy Carroll's three-pointer with 36 seconds, then -- 
with Coach Rick Majerus in the hospital for what is termed a minor cardiac 
procedure -- held on for an 81-74 victory over Hawaii (12-11, 8-4) at Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Russell Larson scored 30 points to lead Brigham Young (16-5, 9-3 WAC) to 
a 101-87 victory over San Diego State (9-10, 4-8) at Provo, Utah.

 Yount, 38, was the American League's most valuable player in 1982 and 1989. He 
chose to end his career rather than return as a reserve outfielder and 
designated hitter in 1994. He finished with a .285 average and 3,142 hits, 13th 
on the career list.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE'S ALREADY A MASTER OF $45-MILLION EXCUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stereotype of the overpaid, ungrateful pro athlete appeared to have been 
taken to the next level this week by Juan Gonzalez, recently given a 
$45.45-million contract by his employer, the Texas Rangers.  
</P>
<P>
 A few days after signing the contract, Gonzalez didn't show up at the Rangers' 
awards banquet, where he was to have received his team's player-of-the-year 
award.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who was to have presented the award: "Give 
me the $45 million and I'll stay here all week." 
</P>
<P>
 Club President Tom Schieffer said: "We're disappointed the fans won't have a 
chance to congratulate him. Leadership is by example. To be a leader, you need 
to show leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 The club located Gonzalez at his Puerto Rico home. He said a traffic jam 
caused him to miss his flight.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am very sorry that I did not make it to Arlington, and I apologize to the 
Rangers organization, to Reggie Jackson, to Tony Perez, to my teammates, and 
most of all, to all the fans," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Name any of the seven athletes who have been awarded the Medal of 
Freedom, America's highest civilian honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Quakery: Is this an indicator of the level of interest in Southern California 
major league baseball? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the Class-A California League held their second 
annual Winter Warm-up dinner in Ontario recently and drew a crowd of 600. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles/Anaheim Chapter of the Baseball Writers Assn. of America 
called off its off-season dinner this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Reason: Lack of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Quakes: The minor league team had one of the worst records in baseball but 
drew 331,000 fans, breaking the old California League record by 110,000. The 
team sold out 46 of its 68 home games and generated $500,000 in revenue from 
sales of Quake caps alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, an affiliate of the San Diego Padres, plays in a new 5,100-seat 
stadium named the Epicenter, has a mascot named Tremor and sends out a 
newsletter called The Rumblings. It outdrew 11 of the triple-A teams in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Play it again: Tragic but spectacular accidents, such as the one that killed 
Austrian skier Ulrike Maier, are a part of the sport's attraction, the 
defending Olympic men's downhill champion said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do people watch on television?" Austrian Patrick Ortlieb asked. "The 
most spectacular accidents are repeated five times in a tape loop." 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case with the Jan. 29 death of Maier, killed in a downhill race 
in Germany. Some critics charge that the International Ski Federation has 
approved courses that are too dangerous. But Ortlieb said this is necessary to 
hold the public's attention, adding: "In boxing they show the KO, in skiing the 
accidents. The fans want it, and sports needs fans. Nothing dangerous happens 
in Ping-Pong, but no one's interested in it, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Lighten up, Avery: Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Sun, commenting on TonyaGate, 
recalled the famous 1936 incident in which U.S. Olympic swimmer Eleanor Holm 
drank champagne on the Olympic team's ocean voyage to Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old despot, Avery Brundage, tossed her off the team without so much as a 
how-do-you-do," Jackman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncle Milty denies all: Comic Milton Berle: "Buddy Hackett is telling 
everybody that George Burns got whacked on the knee with a metal baton the 
other day and that the cops are investigating me." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Bob Kiphuth, Jesse Owens, Joe DiMaggio, Paul (Bear) Bryant, 
Jackie Robinson, Earl (Red) Blaik, Ted Williams.

OUT-OF-GAS LAKERS SPUTTER IN BLOWOUT; PRO BASKETBALL: LOS ANGELES' FOUR-GAME 
WINNING STREAK HALTED BY KINGS, 103-84, IN THIRD GAME IN AS MANY NIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laker Coach Randy Pfund detected early in Thursday night's game against the 
Sacramento Kings that his team, playing its third game in three nights, wasn't 
ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 And Pfund's analysis proved correct as the Lakers sleepwalked through a 103-84 
loss to the Kings before an announced crowd of 10,785 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "About halfway through the second half the only thing left for me to do was to 
try to embarrass them into a performance," Pfund said. "I just basically told 
them in the huddle, 'You guy's aren't going to get it done. You can decide what 
you want to run yourself.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I (played) a lot of people, but nobody seemed to have much energy. We didn't 
play with any force, and it almost seemed to get worse as the night went on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the (regular Laker beat) writers weren't here tonight, not many fans 
were here tonight and thank heavens none of my management was here tonight. I 
really hope Dr. (Jerry) Buss (Laker owner) wasn't here tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers, who were beginning to look like a playoff team after winning four 
games in a row and seven of their last 10, looked like a lottery team against 
the Kings, falling behind by 20 points with six minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 They got no closer than 15 points afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Lionel Simmons scored 32 points as the Kings (15-32) beat the Lakers 
(18-29) for the third time in three games this season. It's the first time in 
Sacramento Kings' history that they've won a season series from the Lakers and 
the second time that the Kings have won at the Forum since the 1974-75 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not seemed to find the answer to that team and we certainly didn't 
tonight," Pfund said. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a makeup of the Jan. 17 contest postponed because of the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers, coming off an emotional 103-96 win at Utah on Wednesday, looked as 
if they needed a night off, shooting only 33.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Vlade Divac missed 10 of 16 shots, guard Nick Van Exel missed 13 of 19 
shots and forward James Worthy missed 10 of 12 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to have back-to-back games," Divac said. "But to have 
back-to-back-to-back games is really tough." 
</P>
<P>
 But overwork wasn't a valid excuse because the Kings, who beat the Clippers, 
105-95, Tuesday night in Sacramento, were also playing their third game in 
three nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, who shot 50% and outrebounded the Lakers, 48-43, outworked the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 All-Star guard Mitch Richmond had 19 points, eight rebounds and eight assists 
and forward Wayman Tisdale had 18 points, 10 in the fourth quarter, and six 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers couldn't stop the Simmons in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, who scored a season-high 33 points and had 10 rebounds in 
Sacramento's 112-101 win over the Lakers on Nov. 10, scored 20 points, 
including 16 in the first quarter, in the first half as the Kings took a 49-43 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, who made his first eight shots, wound up making 13 of 32 shots and 
six of eight free throws in 38 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of his best performances of the year," King Coach Gary St. Jean 
said. "I thought he was terrific in the first half and he really got us off to 
a great start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he had it going tonight, so I don't care if he had his tongue hanging 
down to his knees, I wasn't going take him out tonight." Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Coach Randy Pfund said the club will make a decision this weekend on 
whether to sign Reggie Jordan for the rest of the season. Jordan, whose second 
10-day contract expires today, had 28 points, five rebounds and three assists 
in last Sunday's 107-90 win over Utah. . . . King guard Walt Williams missed 
his second straight game because of a bruised toe.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: MILLER'S COMEBACK IS OVERSHADOWED BY TV EXPERTISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are two things wrong with this week's Nissan L.A. Open: (1) Johnny 
Miller is announcing rather than playing, and (2) there's no cable coverage of 
the first two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's candor makes him the best golf commentator on television, but after 
his improbable victory at Pebble Beach last weekend, it would be better if he 
were playing again this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave Miller an automatic two-year qualifying exemption for all PGA 
tournaments, but he told NBC Monday that he had made a number of commitments 
this week, including one to announce the L.A. Open, and he planned to honor 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had played competitively only five times in four years before Pebble 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't playing in the L.A. Open, but he says he will play in the Masters. 
And how does he expect to do at Augusta? 
</P>
<P>
 "Those greens will kick my butt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 You've got to like that candor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Golf fans have come to expect seeing the first two rounds of golf tournaments 
on either ESPN or the USA network. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the 36 televised PGA Tour events get early-round cable coverage 
-- including all of the big ones. USA did nine last year, ESPN seven. 
</P>
<P>
 The USA network televised the early rounds of the L.A. Open in 1993, but 
passed this year because of the February sweeps rating period. Entertainment 
programming generally gets higher ratings than golf. 
</P>
<P>
 A deal for ESPN to carry this year's early rounds fizzled when a sponsor 
package couldn't be put together to defray production costs, said John Evenson, 
the PGA's vice president of broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Open is on NBC instead of CBS this year because of the Winter 
Olympics. But CBS -- and USA -- will be back in the fold next year, Evenson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and partner Jim Lampley will be joined by on-course reporters Roger 
Maltbie, Bob Trumpy and Dan Hicks for NBC's weekend coverage of the L.A. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Ditka will also be on hand to offer tips on golf etiquette. Now there's a 
twist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Radio talk: It started out as just another call to a sports-talk show. Nancy 
of Malibu was calling KMPC's Joe McDonnell to talk about Rick Neuheisel, UCLA's 
receivers coach who got passed over in favor of Bob Toledo for the offensive 
coordinator job. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy said she thought Neuheisel got a raw deal, but then explained she might 
be a little biased because her last name was also Neuheisel. Turns out she was 
Rick's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rick feels as if he has been kicked in the stomach," Nancy said. "He thought 
he would be at UCLA forever, and this is how he is treated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is Rick's birthday, and how is he spending it? He's teaching the 
offense to Bob Toledo." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Neuheisel, a cheerleader at Arizona when Rick was a quarterback at UCLA 
in the early 1980s, went on to tear into Coach Terry Donahue, speculating that 
he didn't promote her brother because he was afraid of him. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell had earlier said it was a no-win situation for Donahue. If he 
promoted Neuheisel and the Bruins won, then Neuheisel would get the credit. If 
they lost, then fans would want Neuheisel to replace Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Neuheisel agreed with McDonnell's theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Rick know she was calling? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said, "and he might not be too happy about it, either." 
</P>
<P>
 That would seem to be a safe bet.

EMPIRE LEAGUE GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; CYPRESS BEATS EL DORADO FOR THIRD 
TITLE IN FOUR YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BARZILAI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a one-year hiatus, Cypress returned to capture its third Empire League 
title in four years by beating visiting El Dorado, 51-43, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado (17-7, 7-3), which tied Katella for the co-championship last season, 
was looking to gain another co-championship by beating the Centurions. However, 
Jessica Eggleston's 34 points prevented that. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a career game," Cypress Coach John Selbe said. "Jessica rose to the 
occasion tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The third quarter proved to be the difference, as Cypress (23-3, 9-1) opened 
the half with a 7-0 run and outscored El Dorado, 12-4. Eggleston scored eight 
points in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eggleston owned the second quarter, scoring 15 points and leading the 
Centurions back from a 17-13 first-quarter deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teammates did a great job of getting me the ball," Eggleston said. "They 
were always looking to get the ball to me and they did a good job of it." 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado controlled much of the first quarter, breaking Cypress' full-court 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a real good job of attacking our press," Selbe said. "They got some 
easy early baskets off the press." 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Hawks forced Cypress into five first-quarter turnovers and four in 
the second, but the Centurions tied the score at halftime, 31-31. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, El Dorado double- and triple-teamed Eggleston and Julie 
Adams down low in an attempt to force Cypress into outside shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt as though we were better off trying to get the ball down low," Selbe 
said. "We did have to force it at times, but once they got into foul trouble, 
it became a little easier." 
</P>
<P>

CENTURY LEAGUE GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; VILLA PARK DEFEATS CANYON FOR SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michelle Miyake saw the ball's trajectory. Most of the time, she knows when 
she's on the money. This time, she didn't. She had made only one of 15 shots to 
that point. She had her doubts all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miyake's three-point shot was true, giving Villa Park a three-point lead 
with 1 minute 22 seconds left, and helped the Spartans (21-3, 9-1) to their 
second consecutive Century League title and third in 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park's 51-48 victory against Canyon (14-9, 7-3) didn't come without 
controversy and a clutch performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter came from Maureen Skehan, who had 21 points, seven rebounds and six 
steals. She did most of her damage in the second half after sitting out half 
the second quarter with three fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was definitely the difference," Canyon Coach Nelson Herrera said. "She 
had a lot of poise with three fouls." 
</P>
<P>
 Skehan had 13 points, seven rebounds and three steals -- each leading to a 
layup for her -- in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Foul trouble plagued both teams, and Villa Park's 25% shooting (13 of 52) 
through three quarters set the stage for a dramatic finish. Skehan's second 
consecutive steal and layup gave the Spartans a 34-33 lead with 31 seconds left 
in the third quarter; they had held a 20-12 lead in the second before going six 
minutes without a field goal. There were eight ties or lead changes in the 
fourth quarter, the final coming when Miyake's three-pointer made it 47-44. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 47-46 with 1:01 to go, the timekeeper errantly ran 12 seconds off the 
clock after Villa Park's inbounds pass was knocked out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 12 seconds the home team needed after pulling within three points at 
the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was asking the ref about it but he just waved me off," Herrera said. "I 
can't control that. We wanted a timeout and to put on the full-court press. We 
just ran out of time. You've got to give Villa Park credit; they came in here 
and won the game outright." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena 48, Foothill 33 -- Norah Mariner had 17 points and 14 rebounds and 
Jamie Shine added 13 points and 13 rebounds to lead El Modena (11-10, 7-3). 
Katy Steinle scored 10 points for Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley 57, Orange 45 -- Velina Gibson had 19 points and Marie Pulu 
had 15 points and 16 rebounds for Santa Ana Valley (8-14, 4-6). Anita Brown had 
13 for Orange (4-17, 1-9).

SEA VIEW LEAGUE WRESTLING; IRVINE SENDS NINE TO FINALS TO WIN EASILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK HAMILTON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irvine dominated the Sea View League finals, sending nine of its 13 wrestlers 
into the finals with five winning titles Thursday at University High. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a relief from the pressure," Irvine Coach John Phillips 
said."Our guys wanted to have a good showing at this meet, and they certainly 
did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine finished with 208.5 points. University was second with 124, followed by 
Woodbridge (96), Tustin (85), Saddleback (67), Newport Harbor (60), Santa 
Margarita (53) and Corona del Mar (42). 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the finals, sixth-ranked Irvine (13-2-1, 6-0-1) was tied with 
University (12-13-1, 6-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "When we tied Uni back in January, that was our wake-up call," Phillips said. 
"Since then, we have won two tournaments and took second in another. We wanted 
to show some people that we didn't roll over and die." 
</P>
<P>
 For Irvine, Peter Hamilton (103), Justin Meier (125), Chris Testerman (130), 
Lambert Lo (140) and Doug Reid (152) won their championship matches and will 
advance to the Southern Section individual championships. 
</P>
<P>

Santa Margarita's Andy Vander Ahe (135), University's James Stephenson (145),

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; ECLIPSE AWARD'S SHORTCOMINGS ARE ALL TOO 
REAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A not-so-funny thing happened to Kotashaan on his way to the 1993 
horse-of-the-year title. 
</P>
<P>
 The French-bred horse almost blew the election. 
</P>
<P>
 What looked like a shoo-in for Kotashaan turned into a tight vote. In 
balloting for the divisional awards, Kotashaan swept to the male grass title, 
receiving the support of all three voting groups while outpolling Lure, 
150-107. But then when horse-of-the-year ballots were counted, only two of the 
three groups favored Kotashaan, and he wound up edging Lure, 116-101. 
</P>
<P>
 Had four track racing secretaries voted for Lure instead of Kotashaan, racing 
would have faced an embarrassing result: Lure would have won the 
horse-of-the-year title even though he finished second in the grass division. 
And Lure would have been the champion even though Kotashaan had polled the most 
votes. Neither of those aberrations has occurred in the 23-year history of the 
Eclipse Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Eclipse Voting is unlike most sports elections, resembling the Electoral 
College system that determines the nation's President. Total votes mean less 
than a horse's ability to dominate at least two of the three voting groups. 
Theoretically, a horse could win a title without finishing first in total 
votes. The system was established when the Eclipse program began in 1971. There 
is a significant disparity in the number of voters within each sponsoring 
group, and the National Turf Writers Assn., the Daily Racing Form and the 
racing secretaries from Thoroughbred Racing Assns. tracks all wanted equal 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 They are blameless for that, but the system's shortcomings almost came into 
play this time. To make an analogy with college basketball, Kotashaan losing 
out to Lure for horse of the year would have been like a school winning the 
NCAA tournament and not being voted No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotashaan lost the Daily Racing Form's vote to Lure, 41-38, but won the title 
when the turf writers voted for him, 65-53, and the racing secretaries 
supported him, 13-7. Thirty-four of the voters that supported Kotashaan for 
male grass horse didn't like him for horse of the year. At best, their 
reasoning is puzzling. At worst, it is unbelievable. Perhaps they didn't think 
the grass division was that formidable, even though many veteran horsemen have 
said this was the best collection of turf horses in racing history. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their reasons, 49 of the 266 voters, or 18%, didn't like Kotashaan or 
Lure for horse of the year. Now that's astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of them voted for Star Of Cozzene, and they deserve the benefit of the 
doubt because Star Of Cozzene beat Kotashaan and Lure twice each. Overall, Star 
Of Cozzene paid the penalty at year's end for not running in the Breeders' Cup 
and then finishing fifth in the Japan Cup while Kotashaan ran second. 
</P>
<P>
 Improbably, 20 voters liked Bertrando for horse of the year. Bertrando was the 
best horse North America had on dirt in 1993, but won only 33% of his starts. 
Had he won the Breeders' Cup Classic instead of finishing second, his 
supporters could have made more of a case,. 
</P>
<P>
 There were seven votes for Hollywood Wildcat, the 3-year-old filly. Once she 
became trainer Neil Drysdale's responsibility in California last summer, 
Hollywood Wildcat went undefeated, but never ran against males, and in the 
balloting within her division, 65 voters thought that Sky Beauty, the New York 
filly, was the better horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcangues, Paseana and Sea Hero each received three horse-of-the-year votes. 
Arcangues won the Breeders' Cup Classic, at 133-1, but won only one other race 
all year. Paseana, a two-time Eclipse divisional winner, couldn't outfinish 
Hollywood Wildcat in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, and was beaten in three of her 
last four races. Sea Hero, winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Travers, was 
winless in seven other starts and finished second to Prairie Bayou, a horse 
that died in June, in the voting for best 3-year-old colt. 
</P>
<P>
 Peteski, Dehere, Brocco and Holy Bull received one horse-of-the-year vote 
apiece. Did those voters tune out around the first of October? Peteski was 
Canada's horse of the year, but couldn't win in this country. The 2-year-old 
colts Brocco and Holy Bull didn't even win their division, Brocco because he 
was beaten in the Hollywood Futurity after winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, 
and undefeated Holy Bull because he didn't run in the Breeders' Cup. Dehere, 
the juvenile champion in a split vote with Brocco, finished eighth in the 
Breeders' Cup by 12 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 This was only the third time that there was a split among the voting groups 
for horse of the year. In 1984, John Henry edged Slew O' Gold. In 1982, in the 
closest election of all, the turf writers liked Conquistador Cielo; the Racing 
Form favored Lemhi Gold, and the racing secretaries went for Landaluce. At that 
time, voters listed first, second and third choices on their ballots, and 
Conquistador Cielo won the championship because he fared better in the 
runner-up spots.

CHEVALIER, CSUN DON'T SLIP AT END; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: GUARD'S FREE THROWS KEY 
89-84 VICTORY.

<P>
 As if to answer a challenge from his coach, Andre Chevalier showed in the 
final seconds of a 89-84 win over Northeastern Illinois on Thursday night just 
how valuable he is to the Cal State Northridge basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 With a little more than two minutes left in the game, the Matadors' senior 
point guard let the ball slide off his hand, resulting in a turnover and a 
Northeastern Illinois basket that trimmed Northridge's lead to four points. 
</P>
<P>
 As Matador players went to their bench for a timeout, Chevalier responded to 
Coach Pete Cassidy's glare by muttering, "It slipped." 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling ever so slightly, Cassidy shot back, "We don't pay you the big bucks 
to let the ball slip." 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier did not reply, but it wasn't too much later that he offered the 
final word on the matter. In the final 26 seconds, he sank four consecutive 
free throws as the Matadors held on for the victory in front of 128 at 
Pepperdine University's Firestone Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was played at Pepperdine because Northridge's gym will not open until 
Monday because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he was ready to adopt the place after Northridge improved to 5-15, 
Cassidy replied, "Well, I'm undefeated here." 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier, who scored 18 points, said he wasn't quite ready to abandon the 
Northridge gym. However, he did enjoy putting on a home, white jersey for the 
first time in five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just felt good to be in these uniforms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But was the white too bright? Cassidy, after watching the Matadors open the 
game with five consecutive turnovers, was seeing road red. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the brightness of the uniforms was in their eyes," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Northridge, the problem seemed only to affect the starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 2 minutes 12 seconds into the game, Cassidy replaced his entire starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got to the fifth (turnover), that was it. Get out," Cassidy said. "It 
was a message." 
</P>
<P>
 And it came through loud and clear. The Northridge bench restored order and 
five Matadors ended up scoring in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Micelli had 16 points and Brooklyn McLinn scored 15 among the starters. 
Coming off the bench, Brent Lofton added 14 and Robert Hill had 10. Shawn Stone 
added nine points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The balanced scoring effort helped Northridge overcome a 33-point effort by 
Northeastern Illinois forward Reggie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who came in ranked 11th in the NCAA with a 24.2 scoring average, made 
five three-point shots and scored 18 points in the second half. Despite Smith's 
efforts, the Golden Eagles shot 39.2%. However, they also outrebounded 
Northridge, 47-35. 
</P>
<P>
 Northeastern Illinois (13-9), which has been outrebounded only four times this 
season, had 29 offensive boards -- 18 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Shannon Greene, a powerful 6-foot-7 senior, had 10 offensive rebounds 
among his 15 boards. He also scored 14 points. Ulyses Moran, a 6-8 senior, had 
19 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our big bodies didn't jump with their big bodies," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge doesn't have a shooter like Smith, either, but the Matadors 
survived on balance. Lofton was particularly effective. In addition to his 14 
points, Lofton grabbed seven rebounds. In his past four games the senior from 
El Camino Real High has come off the bench to score 48 points and take down 28 
rebounds.

MATHEWS IS UPBEAT AFTER LOSS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: VENTURA COACH, WHOSE TEAM'S 
29-GAME WINNING STREAK WAS BROKEN IMPROBABLY BY CUESTA, WOULD RATHER TAKE 
DEFEAT NOW THAN IN THE PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The morning after is never easy for a coach whose team inexplicably drops a 
game it had no business losing, but Ventura College's Philip Mathews was 
surprisingly upbeat Thursday, only hours after his Pirates absorbed perhaps 
their most improbable defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, ranked No. 1 in the state, saw its school-record 29-game winning 
streak snapped, 72-71, by Cuesta in a Western State Conference North Division 
game Wednesday at Ventura. Mathews assumed a philosophical stance in the 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 "No loss is ever good, but this one might be good for us," said Mathews, whose 
team had a 21-game winning streak last season. "Better now than in the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates (29-2, 5-1 in conference play) hadn't lost since a season-opening 
setback to Kings River, 63-61, and they had never lost to Cuesta (20-8, 2-3) 
since Mathews took over the program in the 1985-86 season. In fact, Ventura 
hammered the Cougars, 105-62, nine days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 After that game at Cuesta, second-year Cougar Coach Rusty Blair called the 
Ventura coaches, the players and even their fans "arrogant." The comments, 
Blair said, fueled the rematch Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very high for the game and so were they," Blair said. "Our kids 
played the best game of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The same apparently could not be said for Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates, playing without injured point guard Joey Ramirez, trailed by as 
many as 17 points and committed 20 turnovers. They had opportunities to win at 
the buzzer but failed to convert several tip attempts after a missed shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had second chances to win," Mathews said. "We missed shots. We didn't 
rebound. It was a total collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair noted that Ramirez's absence contributed to the ragged play. The 
sophomore from Santa Paula High underwent arthroscopic surgery Monday for 
damaged cartilage in his right knee and probably won't return until the 
Southern California regionals Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last time we played, we went to a box-and-one (defense) with Ramirez," Blair 
said. "With him out, we could go back to our normal man to man and not have to 
worry about his ballhandling."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, Blair said Ventura should be ranked No. 1 in the state in 
the next poll. "In my estimation, they are still the best team in the state," 
he said.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: SCC'S BORDERS CONCENTRATING ON GAME, 
NOT HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California College freshman Ila Borders will make history when she 
takes the mound for the Vanguard baseball team, but she is more concerned with 
getting outs. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders, expected to start the Vanguards' home opener Tuesday against 
Claremont-Mudd and become the first woman to pitch in a college baseball game, 
is trying to avoid thinking about the attention she is attracting. The college 
has alerted national and local media, and ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Collegiate 
Baseball magazine and local television stations appear to be interested, 
according to Pat Guillen, SCC sports information director. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Borders: "I tell (SCC Coach) Charlie (Phillips), 'You take care of it 
all, because all I want to think about is pitching.' 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm thinking about other people in my surroundings, I'm not going to do 
good at all. I'm just concentrating on the catcher's mitt. Everything else is 
on Charlie's hands, which I really like." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, who offered Borders a partial scholarship before her senior season 
at Whittier Christian, has had to answer some skeptical questions about 
Borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ask whether signing Borders, who was 16-7 with a 2.31 earned-run average 
at Whittier Christian, was a publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'Why did you recruit her?' " Phillips said. "I recruited her 
because she can throw strikes, and how many times do you find a left-hander who 
can throw strikes?" 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said Borders, who is 5 feet 10, 165 pounds, proved she could be an 
effective pitcher in preseason scrimmages against community college teams. Last 
summer while experimenting with a split-finger fastball, she was hit hard, but 
she adjusted and in 18 innings after Christmas, she gave up only four earned 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Borders says she has made the transition to college life easily. She's a 
psychology major but plans to switch to physical education. 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, she's having the time of her life. High school practices were 
limited to about three hours; at SCC, she often stays on the field for six 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just having a blast playing ball all day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said there is more camaraderie on this team than in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we're all together, especially the pitchers," she said. "It's like 
a family. I hang around with them at school. It's really nice that way. I'm not 
putting down Whittier Christian, but I just get along with the people here a 
lot better." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 SCC, which plays at Cal State Dominguez Hills Saturday and Redlands Monday, 
has lost its first three games of the season -- 7-3 to Cal State San 
Bernardino, 17-9 to Cal Poly Pomona (after leading 8-0 in the fourth) and 3-2 
to UC Riverside. The Vanguards have only six pitchers, including senior 
shortstop Jason Brissey, who will be used as the closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Beckley, a 6-4 senior left-hander, is expected to be the ace. The other 
pitchers are Paul Gutierrez, a 6-3 right-handed transfer from San Joaquin Delta 
College, Rick Homutoff, a sophomore returner, and Augie Pena, a senior who was 
a reliever last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Zitterkopf, a senior center for the Southern California College women's 
basketball team, was named the Golden State Athletic Conference player of the 
week. Zitterkopf averaged 20.5 points and 12 rebounds as the Vanguards beat 
Point Loma Nazarene and lost to Azusa Pacific. She scored 28 points against 
Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman baseball game against Cal Baptist Wednesday was suspended because 
of darkness after nine innings with the score tied, 2-2. . . . Southern 
California College's top scholar athletes were honored Wednesday at a banquet 
at Newport Rib Company in Costa Mesa. They are: Christine Ackerman (women's 
volleyball), Jason Allen (men's soccer), Ross Andel (men's tennis), Wendy Andel 
(women's tennis), Cheri Mills-Bowling (women's cross-country), Tina Demarsh 
(women's basketball), Joel Kuipers (men's basketball), Content Lyke (women's 
basketball), Tedla Mekonnen (men's cross-country), Carrie Nelson (softball),

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; BUENA BY 89, AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Vaughan has seen a lot of blowout games in his 18 years as coach of the 
Buena High girls' basketball team. He's seen his Bulldogs score more than 100 
in games during seasons that produced Southern Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
 But he doesn't remember Buena ever winning by 89 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs did just that Thursday, beating Oxnard, 98-9, in a Channel League 
game at Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 "That might be a school record for margin of victory, I'm not sure," Vaughan 
said. "We pressed for a quarter and a half, then we backed off. It could have 
been worse, but we weren't running the break anymore. We were trying not to run 
it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs (20-2, 12-1 in league play) outscored Oxnard, 29-0, in the first 
quarter. Five of Buena's seven scorers reached double figures. Eboni Conley, 
Michelle Giordano and Kori Sebek each finished with 18 points. Nicole 
Greathouse added 16 and Kara Newman posted 14. Sebek also had nine steals.

League game at Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 No Simi Valley player scored more than seven points.  
</P>
<P>
 Sara Griffin, the Pioneers' leading scorer who missed most of the first half 
because of foul trouble, scored two. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park 58, Royal 51 -- Panther forward Kara McKeown scored 10 of her 17 
points in the second half as Newbury Park (21-4, 12-2) withstood a Highlander 
comeback in a Marmonte League game at Royal (14-7, 7-6). 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders trimmed an 11-point halftime deficit to a point at the end of 
the third quarter by outscoring the Panthers, 15-5. Merilee Lewis scored six of 
her 14 points in that span.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins moved into the top 10 among the NBA's all-time scorers, then 
spent a moment making some people feel old. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins scored 33 points to surpass Elgin Baylor as the 10th-leading scorer in 
NBA history and lead the Atlanta Hawks to a 114-98 victory over the Miami Heat 
Thursday night at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moving into the 10th spot ranks pretty high," Wilkins said. "It's really 
special. I never saw Elgin play, but I know I'm in good company. He's on most 
of the all-time all-star teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins passed Baylor, the former Laker who had 23,149 points, by scoring his 
11th point in the first quarter. Wilkins has 23,172 points and is five behind 
Adrian Dantley, who is ninth on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Willis added 24 points and 22 rebounds for the Hawks, who won for the 
ninth time in 12 games and improved their home record to 22-3. Atlanta is 10-0

 Golden State 113, New York 105 -- Latrell Sprewell scored a career-best 41

PREP WRESTLING ROUNDUP; CAPISTRANO VALLEY WINS SOUTH COAST TITLE OF ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, someone did teach Capistrano Valley wrestlers the beauty 
of sharing. But Thursday night's South Coast League finals at El Toro High was 
hardly the time for benevolence. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, they shared last year. San Clemente won the 1993 dual-meet league 
title, only to have the Cougars win the league meet, which resulted in a 
co-championship. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Capistrano Valley won the regular season and needed to win the 
league finals to claim the championship by itself. The Cougars did, barely. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente made a valiant run, but the Cougars wrestled out of their minds 
to take the title, outscoring the Tritons, 185-175. Mission Viejo was third 
with 103 points  
</P>
<P>
 "Capistrano Valley was awesome tonight," San Clemente Coach Mark Calentino 
said. "I mean, we had 13 kids place in the top four, we had five or six kids 
exceed their seeds and we had a lot of pins earlier in the day. When you do all 
that, and you still get beat, what are you going to do? Capistrano Valley 
deserves to be champion." 
</P>
<P>
 Cougar Coach Joe Zeller said he wouldn't have minded sharing the title, but 
"it's nice to have it all to yourself, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, six Cougars won weight class titles, compared to San Clemente's 
four. El Toro, Mission Viejo and Mater Dei picked up one divisional winner 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 For two of Capistrano Valley's winners, juniors Mark Stephenson (135) and 
Scott McConnell, their first individual league titles are nice, but it's the 
team victory that mattered most. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a pulling together of the whole team," said Stephenson, who won by a 
technical fall, 18-3, over San Clemente's Justin Fallon. "Some of the guys who 
weren't expected to do that well wrestled their hearts out. And it's nice not 
to have to share it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said McConnell, a 6-4 winner over El Toro's Greg Banducci: "It feels great." 
</P>
<P>
 Repeat league champions for Capistrano Valley were Alec Laidlaw (160), who 
pinned San Clemente's Dylan Newman at 1:40, and Terry Tuzzolino (171), a 9-0 
winner over El Toro's Mike Pope. Other first-time winners for the Cougars were 
Scott Elliott (103) and Jose Pedraza (112). Second-seeded Elliott pinned 
top-seeded Triton Chris Sayer at 5:59, and top-seeded Pedraza was a 13-3 victor 
over Dana Hills' Jeff Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pacific Coast League: 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills wins -- The Hawks had wrestlers reach 12 of 13 finals, winning 
nine to take the league title with 197 points. It was the seventh consecutive 
league title for Laguna Hills, the third-ranked team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Greco (130 pounds) and his twin brother, Mike (135), won for Laguna 
Hills. Scott Morinoue had a pin in three minutes and heavyweight Mark Zolikoff 
won, 7-5, in overtime for Laguna Hills.

NHL ROUNDUP; PENALTY SHOT FAILURE COSTLY IN BRUIN-SABRE TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a night of penalties -- the first two periods began with fights on the 
faceoffs -- a missed opportunity on a penalty cost the Buffalo Sabres in a 3-3 
tie with the Bruins Thursday night at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Presley, awarded a penalty shot when he was tackled by Boston's Ray 
Bourque on a breakaway with 5:25 gone in the game, never got off a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried following him as much as possible," Boston goalie Vincent Riendeau 
said. "He tried to fake the shot, and I closed my legs, so he changed his mind 
and lost the puck. I never touched it. He just lost control of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 20 penalty shots so far this season, only eight have resulted in goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 4, St. Louis 3 -- Defenseman Al Iafrate scored twice and Rick 
Tabaracci made 32 saves for the Capitals at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capitals won their third consecutive game to improve to 6-2-0 since Jim 
Schoenfeld was named coach on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 7, Vancouver 3 -- Valeri Zelepukin scored a goal and set up two by 
Bill Guerin as the Devils tightened the race in the Eastern Conference at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the third in a row for New Jersey and moved the Devils within 
six points of the idle New York Rangers in the conference and the Atlantic 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 5, Pittsburgh 3 -- Derek King ended an eight-game scoreless 
streak and Vladimir Malakhov had three assists for the Islanders at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Penguins have lost three consecutive games for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 6, Ottawa 2 -- Chris Gratton scored twice as the Lightning won at 
Ottawa, Tampa Bay's sixth victory in a row over its expansion colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Gratton's line dominated all night as Tampa Bay outshot the Senators, 36-18. 
Petr Klima and Danton Cole each scored as the threesome rolled up eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 4, Florida 3 -- Eric Lindros scored 50 seconds into overtime for 
the Flyers at home.

DUCKS-KINGS RIVALRY DRAWING BAD BLOOD; HOCKEY: UNFRIENDLY FOES, BATTLING FOR 
THE FINAL WESTERN CONFERENCE PLAYOFF BERTH, PLAY TONIGHT AT ANAHEIM ARENA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether Wayne Gretzky was really bleeding -- on the gum? on the tip of his 
nose? -- after the controversial high-sticking call against the Mighty Ducks 
the last time these teams met, one thing is certain: 
</P>
<P>
 There's bad blood now. 
</P>
<P>
 A rivalry has come to life, and tonight's game between two teams fighting for 
the final Western Conference playoff spot might cause more sparks in Anaheim 
Arena than anything since opening night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks played one of their most brutishly physical games of the season Jan. 
29 in their 5-1 loss to the Kings at the Forum, but the game turned on a call 
by referee Kerry Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
 Or actually, linesman Shane Heyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, according to the Ducks, the Great One himself. 
</P>
<P>
 With the game scoreless, Gretzky skated over to Heyer, and Heyer made a late 
call against Duck defenseman Don McSween, assessing him a high-sticking major 
-- usually assessed when blood is drawn -- and an automatic game misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings scored twice during the five-minute power play, and that was the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that the NHL later rescinded the penalty to McSween, meaning he 
won't be fined and it won't count toward an automatic suspension after two 
stick-related majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel a little vindicated," McSween said. "It doesn't change the fact that 
we lost the game, probably because of that incident." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks weren't the only ones who were huffy after the game. The Kings sent 
a videotape to the league complaining about Duck enforcer Stu Grimson's rough 
play against Tim Watters but got no results. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Ducks -- namely Terry Yake and Todd Ewen -- claimed their team is 
better than the Stanley Cup finalists "five-on-five" -- in other words, only 
the Kings' potent power play has beaten them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings have been baited, but they aren't biting. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got great players on a great team," Coach Barry Melrose said in a 
deadpan so careful it was comical. "We won the first three games, we've got to 
beat this team out for a playoff spot, we've got three games left with them. 
They're very big games." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gretzky: "Every game's become so important. We can't have off nights. 
Every game means the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The last game is past, but the Ducks haven't dropped it. They're still miffed 
over Gretzky's gamesmanship -- he has been accused of using his standing as the 
greatest ever to play the game to advantage with officials before. 
</P>
<P>
 "He cries all the time," said club president Tony Tavares. "He has influenced 
more calls than any other player probably in the history of sports. It's to his 
credit and his team's benefit. I wish I had somebody who could get away with 
what he gets away with." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they have a grudging regard for Gretzky's ability to blow a whistle 
from afar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you're out there, you want to do anything you can to win, bend the 
rules as much as you can," McSween said. "The position he's in, he's respected 
by everybody. If he can use that to help his team win, I have no problem with 
that. I'd do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did make him look kind of bad. People back home who were watching, not too 
many of them like Gretzky now, not in my family." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an unusual position for Gretzky, one of the most widely admired people 
in sports and the three-time winner of the Lady Byng trophy, given to the NHL 
player who best combines sportsmanship and playing ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whiner Byng, that's about all he's going for now," Ewen said.

NHL ROUNDUP; FAILURE TO CONVERT PENALTY SHOT COSTS BUFFALO IN TIE WITH BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a night of penalties -- the first two periods began with fights on the 
faceoffs -- a missed opportunity on a penalty cost the Buffalo Sabres in a 3-3 
tie with the Bruins Thursday night at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Presley, awarded a penalty shot when he was tackled by Boston's Ray 
Bourque on a breakaway with 5:25 gone in the game, never got off a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried following him as much as possible," Boston goalie Vincent Riendeau 
said. "He tried to fake the shot, and I closed my legs, so he changed his mind 
and lost the puck. I never touched it. He just lost control of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 20 penalty shots so far this season, only eight have resulted in goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 4, St. Louis 3 -- Defenseman Al Iafrate scored twice and Rick 
Tabaracci made 32 saves for the Capitals at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capitals won their third consecutive game to improve to 6-2-0 since Jim 
Schoenfeld was named coach on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 7, Vancouver 3 -- Valeri Zelepukin scored a goal and set up two by 
Bill Guerin as the Devils tightened the race in the Eastern Conference at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the third in a row for New Jersey and moved the Devils within 
six points of the idle New York Rangers in the conference and the Atlantic 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 5, Pittsburgh 3 -- Derek King ended an eight-game scoreless 
streak and Vladimir Malakhov had three assists for the Islanders at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Penguins have lost three consecutive games for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 6, Ottawa 2 -- Chris Gratton scored twice as the Lightning won at 
Ottawa, Tampa Bay's sixth victory in a row over its expansion colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Gratton's line dominated all night as Tampa Bay outshot the Senators, 36-18. 
Petr Klima and Danton Cole each scored as the threesome rolled up eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 4, Florida 3 -- Eric Lindros scored 50 seconds into overtime for 
the Flyers at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindros poked in a rebound of Garry Galley's shot under Florida goaltender 
Mark Fitzpatrick.

DOW FALLS 36.58 ON COMMENTS BY ANALYST; BOND YIELDS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * Blue-chip stocks dropped sharply on fears that the market 
might still be on shaky ground after last Friday's dizzying plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bond market's preoccupation with inflation sent yields rising, 
overshadowing strong demand at the Treasury's first auction in six months of 
new 30-year securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished off 36.58 points at 3,895.34. In the 
broad market, declines led advances 1,305 to 811 on heavy volume of 325 million 
shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Wall Street was shaken by Lehman Bros. analyst Elaine 
Garzarelli's comments on CNBC-TV. She said that, while she remains bullish on 
the market, she sees a correction of perhaps 4% to 7% coming at any time. 
Garzarelli is well known for having predicted the 1987 stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said investors also took profits ahead of today's release of the 
producer price index for January. 
</P>
<P>
 And they said the market's fall stemmed from computer-generated "sell" 
programs, weakness in utility stocks and the failure of General Motors' stock 
to rally after the company posted strong earnings for the last quarter and all 
of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the trading highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Shares of Detroit's auto makers were under pressure after GM's earnings 
report. GM fell 1 3/4 to 62 1/2, Chrysler dropped 1 5/8 to 59 3/4 and Ford 
dipped 2 1/2 to 66. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other economically sensitive cyclical stocks slipped on profit taking. Deere 
dropped 1 3/4 to 79 5/8; DuPont fell 1 to 54. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among utility stocks, Houston Industries shed 7/8 to 43 3/8 and American 
Electric Power dropped 3/4 to 33 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Broderbund surged 4 5/8 to 45 7/8 and Electronic Arts leaped 3 1/2 to 29 
after the two software companies said they were merging in a $400-million stock 
swap. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas trading, London shares closed lower, with the Financial Times 
100-share index down 22.1 points at 3,407.0. In Frankfurt, the German DAX index 
ended at 2,118.96, up 33.67 points on the day. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average 
closed up 149.32 at 19,990.70. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit  
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, the price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond had fallen 9/16 
point, or $5.63 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.45% from 6.40% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices were slightly lower in cautious, early trading ahead of the 
afternoon auction of $11 billion in new bonds, the third and final leg of a 
Treasury refunding that started Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the auction showed strong demand for the new securities from Wall 
Street firms, which underwrite the sales. The bid-to-cover ratio, a measure of 
demand comparing the number of bids offered to those received, was 2.78 to 1, 
up from the average of 2.23 to 1 in the previous 12 auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts attributed the strong sales in part to the fact that the Treasury 
last spring reduced the frequency of 30-year auctions from four times to twice 
yearly as part of a shift toward shorter-term securities. That has created a 
higher perceived value for the bonds, since fewer bonds are offered for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Currency  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar finished mixed against other major currencies in light, technically 
driven trading, as investors awaited the outcome of a tense standoff in the 
U.S.-Japan trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar finished at 108.25 yen, down from 108.35 on Wednesday. 
The British pound rose to $1.4625 from $1.4615 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other dollar rates in New York, compared to late Wednesday: 1.7535 German 
marks, down from 1.7590; 1.4798 Swiss francs, up from 1.4765, and 5.9570 French 
francs, down from 5.9685. 
</P>
<P>
 Commodities  
</P>
<P>
 Near-term heating oil deliveries rebounded strongly from Wednesday's decline 
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as bitterly cold conditions returned to 
the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Light, sweet crude oil fell 4 cents to $14.56 a barrel; March heating oil rose 
0.91 cent to 50.31 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 Precious metals weakened on New York's Commodity Exchange, following the stock 
market. February gold dropped $2 to $382 an ounce; March silver slipped 1.5 
cents to $5.32 an ounce.

SCREEN STYLE / BETTY GOODWIN: SCHINDLER'S FINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Movie: "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Steven Spielberg directs the story, filmed in black and white, of 
Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson, pictured), an avaricious member of the Nazi party 
who made a fortune off war goods while sparing more than 1,100 Jews in his 
factory from death camps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Anna Biedrzycka-Sheppard, a Warsaw native who has 
designed costumes for about 20 Polish films. She received an Oscar nomination 
for her work on the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: Photographs of Schindler in the Historical Museum of Krakow, as 
well as conversations with people who knew him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Schindler's almost unbelievably polished and urbane-looking dress 
contrasts sharply with the forbidding SS uniforms and with the haunting images 
of incarcerated Jews. A small-town boy with a weakness for expensive and 
fashionable things, Schindler is no commoner when it comes to clothes. He 
preens in tall riding boots, jodhpurs and hacking jackets, and in handsome, 
tailored suits with silk crepe de chine shirts and polka-dotted ties. 
</P>
<P>
 High Impact: As conditions worsen for the Jews, Schindler's fortune multiplies 
and his wardrobe becomes finer. Biedrzycka-Sheppard's scrupulous eye for detail 
and authenticity -- 14 coats, 15 pairs of period '40s gold cuff links, two 
pairs of velvet slippers, six pairs of handmade shoes, one made-to-order tuxedo 
-- erases the concept of costume entirely, and the images set forth seem as 
genuine as old photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: To gather period clothing for about 20,000 extras in a scene at 
Plaszow, the designer advertised in newspapers in Krakow, where filming took 
place. The ads brought forth mint-condition women's hats, bags, gloves and 
evening clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "The real Oskar Schindler was actually rather vain about his 
appearance. He sometimes changed his suits three times a day. He loved 
beautiful clothes and beautiful women," Biedrzycka-Sheppard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Except for several contemporary Ralph Lauren neckties and a Lauren 
camel's hair coat, most of Neeson's clothes and shoes were custom-made by 
tailors in Poland. His cuff links are from Alfie's, a London antique market 
specializing in '30s and '40s goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the women's costumes and furs were original period pieces rented from 
Morris Angel's costume house in London and then distressed, shredded and 
stained. Angel's also provided replicas of military uniforms.

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: MODEL SPORTING SPIRITS -- IN 
TRIPLICATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oh, those wacky caption writers at Sports Illustrated. No pun is too strained, 
no entendre too double for the magazine's annual swimsuit issue, which went on 
sale this week. Our favorite blurb accompanies a shot of bountiful model Stacey 
Williams, wearing nothing but a sopping wet T-shirt: Waiting for a warm breeze 
to get that pesky dampness out, Stacey stands out in an after-swim dress by 
Michael Kors . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what do you expect? 
</P>
<P>
 What we didn't expect was the eerie tripletness of the cover's winsome 
threesome. An alien -- or anyone unfamiliar with the current crop of calendar 
girls -- might think that Rachel Hunter, Elle Macpherson and Kathy Ireland are 
one and the same, in their matching black bikinis, honey-blond hair and 
honey-blond skin. (And can someone tell us the difference between Vendela and 
Rebecca Romijn?) 
</P>
<P>
 The real winner in Sports Illustrated's annual hoopla could be the sexy 
Mossimo bikini worn by Ireland in the cover shot. Underwired and lined with 
fiberfill, they don't call it the 3-D suit for nothing. Look for it at a beach 
near you -- without Kathy Ireland, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody Must Get Styled: That was Bob Dylan exiting JonValdi last week 
wearing a super-cool patent leather trench coat. The singer -- stylist in tow 
-- turned up at the Melrose Avenue store to scout apparel for his Japan tour. 
"This jacket has a really good vibe," he said, sounding pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, so did a velvet, six-button tuxedo jacket and a painted 
pin-striped suit. Dylan liked the patent leather trench so much he wore it out 
the door. "He was like a blur," said the store's Jonathan Meizler. " . . . He 
had the Afro thing -- kind of flat on top -- happening. He was . . . Bob." An 
hour and several garments later, Bob was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Manifest Destiny: Jose Eber closed his Beverly Center salon last week and 
moved its 20-member staff to the palatial shop at Two Rodeo. Consolidating in 
L.A. fits into Eber's three-year plan to open salons elsewhere. There's already 
a Jose in Houston. To come this year: Washington, D.C., and Las Vegas. "I know 
some people think it's tacky," said Eber, referring to L.A.'s new 
home-away-from-home, "but with all the lights and stuff, we Europeans love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Eber expects to launch other salons in Scottsdale, Ariz.; Atlanta; Miami, and 
San Francisco. Although he still coifs Elizabeth Taylor, Eber's expansion mode 
and his volunteer work with battered women leaves him little time for anything 
but consultations. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time I thought I'd rather stay an artistic person, let someone 
else do the business part. But now I'm doing both and enjoying it, 
surprisingly." 
</P>
<P>
 Fully Furnished: The tiny new French costume jewelry store Bijoux-Bijoux got 
some surprise attention from an unusual place. Costume designers from "Star 
Trek: The Next Generation" expressed interest in its custom pieces, 
particularly the eccentric, futuristic necklaces designer-owner Alexis Minard 
(rhymes with Picard ) does in metal and crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthlings might like other items, namely the miniature chair, candelabrum and 
Versailles chandelier brooches and pins ($60 to $230) Parisians are so mad for 
right now. Jewelry with a home-decor motif is especially appropriate here, 
because the store is on the western end of Melrose Avenue, in the furniture 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Support Group: Ten Hollywood costume designers are getting a well-deserved pat 
on the back. They are nominees for the first Re-Style L.A. Costume Designer of 
the Year awards, announced at a news conference late last week at the Bel-Age 
Hotel. Re-Style L.A., you'll recall, was created by members of the local 
fashion and beauty industry after the riots. The group, which provides high 
school students with college scholarships in the arts, will hold its gala 
benefit March 18 at the Universal Amphitheatre.  
</P>
<P>
 "Since this is the first year they've been given, the awards are for a body of 
work rather than one specific project," said Costume Designers Guild President 
Robert Turturice. This might explain why the Academy Award nominees for Best 
Costume Design, announced Wednesday, don't match -- or even overlap -- the 
honorees nominated by Re-Style L.A. Also, Oscars frequently go to designers 
outside the United States who aren't guild members. 
</P>
<P>
 For film, the nominees are Milena Canonero, Ruth Carter, Richard Horning, Bob 
Ringwood and Albert Wolsky. In television, the nominees are Robert Blackman, 
Jean-Pierre Dorleac, Bill Hargate, Brad Loman and Bob Mackie. 
</P>
<P>
 Love Shack: Mr. Inside Out knows the way to our heart. Skip the Godiva. Gimme 
shelter. As in real estate. Being in escrow is our idea of a particularly 
blissful way to spend Valentine's Day. Plenty of local merchants, however, 
would have us settle for more sentimental expressions of love. Bridging the gap 
between the practical and the romantic are T-shirts, pins and an 
earthquake-ready candy-striped nightshirt emblazoned with our favorite cartoon 
hunk, Pepe Le Pew, sold at the Warner Bros. Studio Stores. L'amour.

INK / PAUL D. COLFORD: KERRIGAN, HARDING BOOKS READIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 And the winner is . . . "The Kerrigan Courage: Nancy's Story," by Randi 
Reisfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 Reisfeld's effort appears to be the first of four instant books on the Nancy 
Kerrigan-Tonya Harding drama to take a bow. The Ballantine paperback will be 
vying for cash-register intake with "Dreams of Gold: The Nancy Kerrigan Story," 
by Wayne Coffey and Filip Bondy, published by St. Martin's Press, and "Nancy 
Kerrigan: Heart of a Champion," by Mikki Morrissette, which BDD Books for Young 
Readers is aiming at kids 8 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth contender as the Winter Olympics get under way this weekend in 
Norway is "Thin Ice: The Complete, Uncensored Story of Tonya Harding -- 
America's Bad Girl of Ice Skating," (Pinnacle) by Frank Coffey and Joe Layden. 
</P>
<P>
 With each of the paperbacks getting ambitious six-figure printings, some 
stores may face the challenge of finding adequate space to display four stacks 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there have always been instant books on curiosities ranging from the 
Warren Commission's report to the Amy Fisher case to President Clinton's 
proposed health-care reforms. But the clubbing of Kerrigan on Jan. 6 and the 
subsequent revelations about the Harding camp provided only the first impetus 
to line up instant books; the other was a wish to have books within reach once 
heightened public attention turns to the skaters' performances in Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Reisfeld, editorial director of 16 Magazine, has passed this way before. In 
1990, she had an uncredited hand in the writing of "Our Story: New Kids on the 
Block" (Bantam), one of several quick hits that tapped into the short-lived 
teen craze over the singing group. 
</P>
<P>
 Reisfeld says Ballantine called her Jan. 14 about doing a Kerrigan biography. 
"I thought it was a great idea, and within four hours a deal was done with my 
agent." 
</P>
<P>
 After phoning, interviewing and poking around Kerrigan's hometown of Stoneham, 
Mass., Reisfeld says she believed that she had the goods to turn in a 
manuscript of about 40,000 words on Jan. 31. Finished books were delivered to 
Ballantine three days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Revelation: "Nancy was so focused on skating from such a young age," Reisfeld 
says. "It's unusual for a kid to give up her entire social life. She really had 
no friends. She really did nothing but skate." 
</P>
<P>
 As well as these four books may sell -- and they are competing with saturation 
coverage in newspapers and magazines, including Newsweek's special Olympics 
issue featuring Kerrigan on the cover -- the real prize may await the publisher 
that acquires Kerrigan's own story. 
</P>
<P>
 Word is that Hyperion's children's-book division will have an announcement in 
that regard. The book deal apparently would be in tandem with an authorized TV 
movie planned by Hyperion's parent company, the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who buy books on Monday will also come away with a pamphlet 
written by novelist Don DeLillo that reflects on the death sentence imposed by 
Iranian religious leaders on Salman Rushdie, author in hiding. Monday marks the 
fifth anniversary of the fatwa provoked by publication of Rushdie's "The 
Satanic Verses." Four thousand bookstores plan to distribute the pamphlet, 
endorsed by the Rushdie Defense Committee USA. 
</P>

<P>
 What's interesting about the arrangement to publish Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's memoir of the past three years is that Times Books will be doing so 
in conjunction with Belka Trading Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Belka, which has offices in New York and Moscow and counts major oil companies 
among its clients, acquired the U.S. publishing rights to "The President's 
Journal" from Yeltsin's London-based literary agent, Andrew Nurnberg.  
</P>
<P>
 By insisting that it be a co-publisher of the book, Belka will forgo the more 
typical cash advance against future royalties. Instead, Belka will share in the 
production costs and the profits, which could be significantly higher under the 
co-publishing setup. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Books Publisher Peter Osnos, who envisions an initial printing of 75,000 
copies, says Yeltsin won't be making the "Live at Five" rounds in these parts 
when the book is published in May. But Yeltsin has agreed to do "major 
television interviews" in Moscow.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; TO BE YOUNG, GIFTED, BLACK -- AND IN LOVE; URBAN ROMANCE: 
A NOVEL OF NEW YORKIN THE EIGHTIES, BY NELSON GEORGE , G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS; 
$23.95, 284 PAGES

<P>
 It's the most famous line in Satchel Paige's "How to Stay Young": "Don't look 
back. Something might be gaining on you." That's not the only bit of advice the 
great ballplayer imparted, however, for immediately preceding that passage he 
suggested readers "Avoid running at all times" (Paige, remember, was a 
pitcher). 
</P>
<P>
 Dwayne Robinson, the music-critic hero of this first novel by music and 
culture critic Nelson George, would have done well to heed Paige's lesser-known 
admonishment, for he isn't prepared for the emotional state to which his 
hurried ambition leads. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwayne ultimately learns that lesson in "Urban Romance" -- but belatedly and 
ironically, while interviewing an old blues player for the book Dwayne has 
dreamed of writing. "I used to walk fast, just like you," says the musician. " 
'Cos I thought if I didn't, the world would get away from me and I'd always be 
behind. Now I walk slow. Know why? . . . 'Cos I know now it's always gonna be 
ahead of me and there's not a damn thing I can do about it. Now I enjoy the 
view." 
</P>
<P>
 Dwayne, deep down, would like to slow down, but he can't, for all kinds of 
reasons -- because he wants to be a famous writer, because he fears deep 
emotional contact, because he hates the idea of falling into black yuppie 
("buppie") passivity. 
</P>
<P>
 And in any case, his ambition has helped him escape the Brownsville projects, 
go on to college, and -- by the time this novel takes place in 1982 -- publish 
his work in such national publications as Rolling Stone, Musician and Essence. 
He's wrestling, in short, with ambivalence, caught between the promise of 
mainstream success and pride in his ghetto roots, and he sees no easy 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwayne has gravitated to writing about music because it promised him the 
chance to have things both ways -- to give respect to African American music, 
as well as to get respect for writing seriously about it -- but in search of 
that grail he has put his personal life on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwayne's ambivalence is brought to a crisis by his romance with Danielle, a 
middle-class, Yale-educated editor who believes Dwayne can indeed write a book 
but who wants more from him emotionally than he is able to give. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwayne's personal and journalistic history bears more than a passing 
resemblance to Nelson George's life, so it's fair to say that "Urban Romance" 
is at least semi-autobiographical. That's the novel's strength as well as its 
weakness: George certainly has close personal knowledge of his material, yet 
inevitably tells a familiar story of a young man caught between love and work. 
</P>
<P>
 George outfits the novel with a number of auspicious subplots -- the illicit 
affair between a prominent radical judge and Danielle's law student roommate, 
the making and marketing of club-scene music acts, the emergence of African 
American neoconservatism in Harlem -- but in the end they highlight the limits 
of the novel's central plot rather than shore it up. 
</P>
<P>
 A black "Bonfire of the Vanities" this is not: Considering Dwayne's interest 
in rap, one expects George will eventually force his hero to confront the issue 
of whether the personal is indeed the political, but in fact he sidesteps the 
question. Dwayne and Danielle emerge from the novel essentially unchanged, 
wiser no doubt but ready to pick up their lives at the very place we met them 
at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Novels that don't quite work are often more interesting than those that do, 
mainly because they are not seamless and seductive: Their fault lines and 
miscalculations are easier to spot and appraise.  
</P>
<P>
 "Urban Romance" is such a novel, an entirely likable book that suffers, at 
bottom, from too little authorial ruthlessness. "The Bonfire of the Vanities" 
is a classic because Tom Wolfe knew his characters in such depth and detail 
that he could pass judgment on them with conviction and credibility; "Urban 
Romance" is not because George gives almost all of his characters the benefit 
of the doubt, leaving us with no one to root for, no one to condemn. 
</P>
<P>
 George is too good a writer to fall into portentousness, a typical problem in 
first novels, but he's also too much of a newsman to provide the sort of 
dramatic punch and structure that the most effective novels need.

MOVIE REVIEW; JAZZY PLOT AND NICE 'ROUND' NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Director Bertrand Tavernier's greatest inspiration in making "Round Midnight" 
was casting Dexter Gordon as Dale Turner, an American sax man riffing through 
the highs and lows of be-bop in Paris during the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, as jazz fans know, was one of jazz's top saxophonists, a lyrical 
breeze of a musician who first made his reputation with Billy Eckstine's band 
in the '40s. He also faced the cruelties of jazz -- like the character he 
embodies in Tavernier's 1985 movie, Gordon was a little too familiar with booze 
and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Tavernier said in an interview that Gordon was frequently in trouble 
during the shooting of "Round Midnight" (screening at Golden West College today 
as the final feature in a free, weeklong series of jazz films). 
</P>
<P>
 He drank often and a lot, the director said, but it gave the movie 
authenticity and a rough spontaneity. Gordon's performance earned him an 
Academy Award nomination as best actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Tavernier pointed out that Gordon (who died in 1990 of kidney 
failure) began his own alcoholism recovery during the project, as Dale Turner 
does in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 When we see Dale play his sax, he's the artist resting sublimely in a huge, 
comfortable body. He looks on top of the world, as if nothing could knock him 
down. But when he's offstage, cadging drinks or otherwise trying to get by, 
Dale seems like a crumbling ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 He has dignity, but it comes from knowing himself and how bad life can be. You 
get the feeling that Gordon is replaying his own history, that Dale is just a 
stand-in for him, and that gives "Round Midnight" conviction. Because of that 
kind of honesty, this may be the best jazz movie ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the title is properly grounded. Taken from an old Thelonious Monk 
composition, "Round Midnight," with a screenplay by Tavernier and David 
Rayfield, is based on the true-life relationship between late pianist Bud 
Powell and Francis Poudras, a young French jazz fan who tried to change 
Powell's self-destructive ways. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tavernier's version, Dale meets Francis (Francois Cluzet) after a session 
one night. Francis has been listening outside the nightclub because he doesn't 
have enough money for a ticket. When Dale walks by, Francis impetuously tells 
him that his music changed his life. Dale lets himself be taken in by Francis, 
who commits to him completely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Round Midnight" lacks the usual storytelling thrust of many movies. Despite 
the compelling plot, the narrative glides along a muted path, not unlike a good 
jazz number that takes delicately unexpected turns. Watching Dale and Francis 
grow close is a subdued experience that evolves in quiet ways. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tavernier cleverly avoids any heaviness, even when Dale stumbles during his 
rehabilitation. Whenever a maudlin threat rises, the film moves back to the 
nightclub where Dale plays. There's no forced sentimentality on stage, just 
Gordon and his music, with nothing getting in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bertrand Tavernier's "Round Midnight" screens today at 3 p.m. at Golden West 
College's Forum II theater, 15744 Golden West St., Huntington Beach. Free.

 Gunfights between rival tribes Thursday killed at least 12 people in the 
southwestern province of Baluchistan, government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the 12, including a government official and his son, were killed in a 
gunfight between Tarin and Nasar tribes near the northern Baluchistan town of 
Ziarat, the officials said in the provincial capital Quetta. In Baluchistan's 
tribal society, feuds are often settled violently.

MORE DAMAGE DISCOVERED AT COLLEGE LIBRARY; QUAKE: SERIOUS STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS 
WILL DELAY REOPENING OF THE CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE BUILDING. SOME BOOKS ARE 
DAMAGED BY RAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In twin jolts to earthquake-battered Cal State Northridge, engineers Tuesday 
discovered serious structural damage that will probably delay the reopening of 
the Oviatt Library, the school's centerpiece building, and administrators 
discovered rain damage to some of the library's prized books. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials had been talking of reopening the 230,000-square-foot 
library on a limited basis by mid-March, only a month after resumption of 
classes, which is planned for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 After the latest damage discovery, however, Dean of Libraries Susan Curzon 
said the reopening probably will be delayed indefinitely and she will explore 
alternate means of providing library services. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before engineers working for the school declared the building off-limits 
to all occupants at midday Tuesday, a group of a dozen university library 
workers and students succeeded in removing about 15 boxes of water-damaged 
books from the library's special collections area, which houses old and rare 
books, scripts and pamphlets. 
</P>
<P>
 The books were damaged by rainwater coming through the building's 
quake-damaged roof in the storms Friday and Monday, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The curator of the special collections, Tony Gardner, said he believes the 
materials can be restored by freeze-drying, as was done to save books damaged 
by water from firefighters' hoses at the Los Angeles Central Library in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-story Cal State Northridge library has been closed to the public and 
students, as has the rest of the 353-acre campus, since the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. Although portions of its roof overhang collapsed in the quake and 
other unstable portions have since been removed, university officials 
previously had considered the building's core to be stable. 
</P>
<P>
 However, engineers discovered Tuesday that the quake snapped the welded 
connections anchoring some of the building's vertical steel frame supports to 
its foundation. The breaks were discovered in the library's east and west 
wings, said Mike Devlin, a structural engineer with Law/Crandall Engineering of 
Los Angeles.

MIKE PENNER: SLAPSTICK MEETS SLAP SHOT IN GOALIE'S DOUBLE LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He does volunteer work for the Kings because, well, somebody has to, and he 
has been on call for 15 years, ready and willing to take a puck in the teeth at 
a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 But a man's also got to eat, so on this afternoon in a Hollywood sound studio, 
Harris Peet sets aside his 44-ounce "Super Tanker" of diet soda, clears his 
throat and bellows into a microphone, letting loose a foghorn blast that 
rattles the window separating him from the director. 
</P>
<P>
 "LET 'ER RIP, CHOLLY!!" 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the door, a few feet away, stands a rack of film canisters bearing 
such titles as "No Pants Today," "Ren's Pecs" and "To Salve Or Salve Not." 
</P>
<P>
 Peet tries another line. 
</P>
<P>
 "YOUR HEAD IS DUE . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "FOR DEMOLITION!" 
</P>
<P>
 For 40 minutes, Peet sweats and sips and screams and tries to please a 
demanding director who is intent on making this episode the "Citizen Kane" of 
"Ren & Stimpy," no small task. "Ren & Stimpy," the cartoon tale of a psychotic 
Chihuahua and his fat, bloated "eediot" of a sidekick, has been grossing out 
parents and teaching kids the difference between "nose goblins" and "underleg 
noises" for three years now. 
</P>
<P>
 Peet, who provides the voices for Muddy Mudskipper, Fire Chief and Bus Driver 
From The Black Hole, is proud just to be a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they showed me the pilot and I saw stains in the toilet," Peet says, "I 
knew these people had something." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an odd job, the work comes and goes, and sometimes Peet will go months 
between readings. But then, Peet's entire adult life has been one odd job after 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 For 17 years, he has struggled to make a go of it as a stand-up comedian. "An 
unblemished record of failure," Peet quips. 
</P>
<P>
 He pops up with an occasional cameo in the occasional box-office flop -- "Duck 
Factory," "The Five Heartbeats." 
</P>
<P>
 And since 1980, he has served in the unpaid capacity of practice goalie for 
the Kings, which is basically hockey's version of the blocking sled, except 
blocking sleds never require hospital care after a workout. 
</P>
<P>
 Peet, 40, has been hospitalized twice for his work with the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I sprained a knee. Al Sims crashed into me," Peet says. "Another time, I 
broke a finger. Marcel Dionne." 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, Peet is sporting a softball-sized shiner on his right bicep, 
another practice mishap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brent Thompson," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it welt association. "Hardest shot I've faced?" Peet says. "Richard 
Martin, Jerry Korab, Bob Kudelski, Randy Holt, Tomas Sandstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martin and Korab were probably the worst. Most people, the puck might hit you 
here (Peet pokes his breast bone) and drop to the floor. But Martin and Korab 
would hit you and the puck would keep biting you, like a Pac Man. They'd put so 
much torque, so much spin on the puck, that it would hit you here and then 
squirt over there." 
</P>
<P>
 Peet takes this abuse, several times a week during hockey season, and refuses 
to take a cent for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "No money's involved," Peet says, laughing at the very idea. "If Bruce 
(McNall) realized, he could charge goalies to do it. He could make money that 
way. A cottage industry with practice goalies . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to do it. I have canceled work to do it. I'd rather do it than do 
anything in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Why? It's the perks, Peet says. 
</P>
<P>
 As practice goalie for the Kings, Peet has met Wayne Gretzky and been allowed 
into the inner sanctum, permitted, even, to baby-sit The Great Infants. Peet 
has eaten dinner at Marty McSorley's house, vacationed with Dean Kennedy and 
hung out with Tiger Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 He has "gotten to see a side of the game I never would have seen before. Now, 
it would be hard to go back to being just a fan. I wouldn't enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Peet is loyal, too, the first truly interactive Kings fan, but he's also a 
businessman and not above accepting a modeling job with the enemy, if the 
money's right. 
</P>
<P>
 In the top-floor restaurant inside Anaheim Arena, there's a hologram of a 
Mighty Ducks goalie making a sensational diving save. The man behind the mask 
is Peet, who was paid $350 to don a Ducks uniform and pose for the Disney 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "The photographer gave me some Polaroids," Peet says, "so I stuck some up in 
the Kings' dressing room and wrote, 'Do you know who this is in a Ducks 
uniform? Hey, hey, that's Harris Peet, long-time hanger-on and ass-kisser of 
the Kings. What's he doing in a Ducks uniform? Has he flown the coop? Has he 
become a trendie? Don't let him squirm his way out of this. Ask him.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So they all asked me. Until I told them I got $350, they were upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Peet latched onto the Kings in 1980 when he was working The Comedy Store on a 
sold-out night and spotted Murray Wilson, a Kings left winger, outside the 
door. Peet got Wilson a table, for free, comped him some drinks and "he told 
all the other Kings. So, if you want hockey players to be your friends, just 
give them free drinks." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Peet was showing up at King practices and talking about his days as a 
goalie for tiny Nassau Community College in Garden City, N.Y., and talking the 
Kings into making him their practice goalie. What a deal: no salary, no 
insurance and a promise from Peet that "I wouldn't sue 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Peet has been cracking them up ever since, sometimes intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
 His comedy act draws from "my experiences driving my motorcycle all over North 
America, what's in the news and the idiocy of everyday life. I used to say that 
I was like Jay Leno, only not as good. Now I say I'm like Jay Leno, but a lot 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 And his goaltending act? 
</P>
<P>
 "Cap (Raeder, King assistant coach) has critiqued me," Peet says, "and has 
told me I'm pretty lousy." Peet has his own word for his style: 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Peet's closest brush with celebrity was brushing with the 
celebrities who skate for Bruce McNall, but thanks to "Ren & Stimpy," that is 
beginning to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year-and-a-half ago, I went to visit my nephew, who was 5 or 6 at the time, 
and the kids at the playground would say, 'Hey, Aaron, who's that guy?' " Peet 
says. "And Aaron would tell them, "He's my uncle and he's on 'Ren & Stimpy.' ' 
</P>
<P>
 "When they heard I was Muddy Mudskipper, these kids would line up and I would 
have to call each of them 'ya lousy bum,' like in the cartoon. And then they'd 
go to the back of the line. It would take all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Peet met some of the parents of those kids, who informed him, 
earnestly, that "This cartoon you do, we don't believe it's right for children. 
But we let them watch it because Aaron's uncle is in it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ren & Stimpy" regular. Comedy Store veteran. Motorcycle maven. Practice 
goalie for the Kings. Hologram model for the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris Peet, Renaissance man for our times.

HARDING STRATEGY ON TRACK; FIGURE SKATING: BUTCH REYNOLDS' SUCCESSFUL SUIT 
AGAINST IAAF IS A MODEL FOR PART OF HER ACTION AGAINST USOC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND and RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The legal strategies of Tonya Harding and the U.S. Olympic Committee became 
clearer Thursday as debate over the figure skater's participation in the Winter 
Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 In more than 90 pages of documents filed Thursday in Clackamas County Circuit 
Court, Harding's attorneys appear to have modeled their challenge in part on 
Butch Reynolds' successful 1992 litigation against the International Amateur 
Athletics Federation. Reynolds, world record-holder in the 400 meters, won a 
$27-million judgment against the IAAF after he challenged a suspension for a 
positive drug test. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds' case was a success, his attorneys say, because IAAF administrative 
hearings could not withstand the scrutiny of the American judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the legal obstacles, USOC officials have concentrated on the 
acknowledged lie Harding told FBI agents after she was named to the U.S. 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding admitted that she lied to the FBI during the first part of her 10-hour 
interrogation on Jan. 18 -- "a mere nine days after promising to conduct 
herself in conformity with the traditions of the Olympic Games," the USOC 
contended in an answer to the complaint filed just before the court closed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's legal team will argue before Circuit Judge Patrick D. Gilroy today 
that the USOC's disciplinary hearing is unfair, and that if Harding is not 
permitted to compete at Lillehammer she would suffer irreparable harm. 
</P>
<P>
 In an affidavit filed with the court, Harding, the U.S. national champion and 
1992 Olympian, said she had done nothing to warrant her expulsion from the U.S. 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding came under scrutiny after the Jan. 6 attack on rival skater Nancy 
Kerrigan. Although she acknowledged she had learned afterward that her 
ex-husband was involved in planning the assault, Harding denies any 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jeff Gillooly, Harding's ex-husband who has pleaded guilty to 
racketeering, has implicated her. So has alleged conspirator Shawn Eckardt, 
Gillooly's boyhood friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding also said in the affidavit that she does not have time to prepare for 
the USOC's Games Administrative Board hearing, scheduled for Tuesday in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot afford to pay the expenses of attorneys and witnesses to appear . . 
. and as a result will not have the opportunity to be assisted in the 
presentation of my case," she said in the sworn testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Schiller, USOC executive director, said U.S. officials were not 
surprised by the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been making some preparations in case of that," he said, adding that 
the USOC has spent $200,000 in legal fees thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 In filing more than 100 pages of documents Thursday, the USOC contended a 
court order -- Harding has requested a temporary restraining order and 
preliminary injunction against the USOC -- would require the court to exercise 
a far-reaching power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly there are enough facts available to call into question whether 
Harding has conducted herself as befits a member of the Olympic team," the USOC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also contended that the Supreme Court has held that the USOC is not subject 
to constitutional guarantees of due process in determining eligibility matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC disputed Harding's claim that she was not given enough time to defend 
herself at next week's hearing. It said she was given "reasonable notice and an 
opportunity to be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee further contended that selection to the U.S. team "is an honor 
and a privilege" and not a right enforceable by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 If Harding is barred from the Games, the suit seeks $20 million in punitive 
damages and at least $5 million in compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memorandum filed with the court, Harding's attorneys contended that the 
USOC administrative board would not conduct an impartial hearing. The attorneys 
cited a comment by USOC President LeRoy Walker that appeared in Sports 
Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make a decision without the consideration of whether or not her 
rights have been abridged," Walker was quoting as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, Gillooly's lawyer, Ron Hoevet, withdrew a motion in 
Portland court Thursday that sought permission for his client to travel to 
Norway to appear before the USOC panel. Gillooly is free while awaiting an 
April sentence hearing. The USOC had requested that Gillooly testify at next 
week's Oslo hearing, but said Thursday that no witnesses were needed because of 
the pared-down focus of its case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They apparently have trouble speaking with one voice," Norm Frink, deputy 
district attorney in Multnomah County, said at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Frink told The Times: "I can only hope this show will move on to 
Norway." 
</P>

PIAZZA'S SIGNING SETS A RECORD; BASEBALL: DODGER CATCHER'S THREE-YEAR, 
$4.2-MILLION CONTRACT IS THE MOST FOR A SECOND-YEAR PLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers broke policy Thursday, signing catcher Mike Piazza to a 
three-year, $4.2-million contract, the largest guaranteed contract in baseball 
for a second-year player. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first multiyear contract offered by the club to a second-year player 
and will pay Piazza $600,000 in 1994, $900,000 in 1995 and $2.7 million in 
1996, when he would have been eligible for arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for the Dodgers and good for Mike for a number of reasons: One, 
because we have Mike under contract for three seasons and won't be discussing 
contracts every year," said Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president. "And 
from an economic factor, we bought out a year of arbitration. If Mike continues 
to put up the type of numbers that he did, and I have no reason to believe he 
won't, then when he enters the arbitration year, the Dodgers will have a pretty 
attractive contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza and his agents, Dennis Gilbert and Dan Lozano, have been negotiating 
with the Dodgers since late January, when the Dodgers initially offered Piazza 
a one-year, $500,000 deal, using as a comparable contract the $435,000 they 
paid Eric Karros after he won the 1992 rookie-of-the-year award. 
</P>
<P>
 That offer disappointed Piazza, who believed that his National League 
rookie-of-the-year numbers should be rewarded with a one-year deal worth at 
least $1 million. Piazza hit .318 with 35 home runs and 112 runs batted in in 
149 games. Karros hit .257 in 149 games with 20 homers and 88 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Negotiations) really weren't going too well and it happened rather quickly, 
and I'm glad it did," Piazza said from Boca Raton, Fla., where he is escaping 
the cold of his home in Philadelphia. "It's a nice honor to be awarded the 
first multiyear contract and, like I said, I'm glad the club made that 
exception and recognized that beside any numbers, I also put my heart and soul 
on the field for the Dodgers and will continue to do so. I can relax now." 
</P>
<P>
 All along, Gilbert kept comparing Piazza to Chicago White Sox first baseman 
Frank Thomas, who hit .318 in 158 games with 32 homers and 109 RBI in his first 
full season of 1991 and was given a three-year contract guaranteed for $4 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we wanted a multiyear deal for reasons like security, and the 
highest deal was Thomas at $4 million for three years," Gilbert said. "But the 
Dodgers told us from inception that they weren't doing a multiyear deal, they 
had never done one, and then they made us a one-year offer. And that's where 
they were." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza earned $126,000 last season, and the Dodgers had the option of renewing 
his salary, raising him or even cutting him 20%. All Piazza could do was not 
report to spring training when pitchers and catchers report next Thursday, an 
option he was considering. But Claire said the club's change in philosophy is 
indicative of the direction the organization is heading. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a part of a transition of the Dodgers that is pretty evident," Claire 
said. "When you look at Piazza, Delino DeShields, Eric Karros, Pedro Astacio 
and the young outfielders we have, we are building for the future while trying 
to be competitive for the present. There is a change, as there always is, that 
is taking place." 
</P>
<P>
 The most the club had ever paid a second-year player previously was $485,000, 
to Ramon Martinez after he won 20 games in 1990, after one-plus years of 
service.

MARC OF EXCELLENCE GIRARDELLI, THE ONE-MAN GANG FROM LUXEMBOURG, SAYS WORLD CUP 
TITLES MEAN MORE THAN OLYMPIC GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Smaller than our Rhode Island, that speck of a state, Luxembourg measures 999 
square miles and asks that you consider every square inch. 
</P>
<P>
 It boasts a 100% literacy rate and one of the world's highest standards of 
living. What it can't produce, it imports, from commodities as varied as alloys 
to Alpine skiers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the map, Luxembourg looks like an ink splat on the borders of Belgium, 
Germany and France. Yet, the nation of 400,000 is fiercely protective. 
</P>
<P>
 And no subject is touchier than that of its most beloved sportsman, Marc 
Girardelli, the greatest Alpine skier in the world today, perhaps ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the flag of Luxembourg, the five-time World Cup overall champion has won 
everything there is to win in skiing except an Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli is the Winter Olympics in Luxembourg. He is the nation's only 
representative here, where he will try again to become the first gold-medal 
winner from Luxembourg since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 If a man was ever a country, it is Girardelli. In last year's final Nation's 
Cup, he finished seventh in the men's overall division, totaling more World Cup 
points than the countries of 
</P>
<P>
 Canada, Germany and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It matters not that there are few mountains to speak of in Luxembourg, no ski 
academies or, for that matter, much recreational interest in skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 It matters not that Girardelli lives in Switzerland, not Luxembourg, and does 
not take his Luxembourg citizenship all that seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 It is enough for Luxembourg that Girardelli stops by to pick up his mail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You will never have visa problems in Luxembourg as long as you never mention 
that Girardelli is Austrian born. 
</P>
<P>
 Do so in a public arena and you will probably receive correspondence on 
premium bond stationary and embossed letterhead from Alphonse Berns, ambassador 
of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Berns is protector of Luxembourg's interests abroad; that is, protector of 
Girardelli. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take exception that people continue to mention that he is Austrian born and 
runs for Luxembourg," Berns said from his offices in Washington. "In fact, 
Girardelli went through the whole procedure to become a Luxembourger. It was 
pretty tough. We consider him a true Luxembourger. I have never heard in this 
country the reference to the 'Czech-born Martina Navratilova.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli did not dock in Luxembourg with grand designs to bolster its 
international image or GNP. The motivation to move was the scheme of Marc's 
cantankerous father, Helmut, who wanted the best for his talented skier-son, 
even if it meant pulling up stakes at the greatest ski academy in the world -- 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 When Marc was 11, he was defeating all comers in ski races in and around his 
hometown of Lustenau. 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli had spunk. When asked as a child if he wanted to meet David 
Zwilling, the 1974 world champion in downhill, Marc declined, saying he 
preferred to wait until Zwilling asked for his autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Austrian ski officials got wind of kid wunderbar and insisted he enroll in a 
special boarding ski school in Schruns, 30 miles from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli's father preferred that Marc stay home. Helmut, a hotel owner, had 
been training Marc himself with techniques that later some would consider 
revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
 After a last-straw dispute with the Austrian ski federation, Helmut decided in 
1976 to take his 12-year-old and leave home. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland seemed nice. Germany, perhaps. But Helmut didn't know anyone in 
those countries. 
</P>
<P>
 He did have a government contact in Luxembourg, though, Aime Knepper, who 
arranged for Marc to ski there. 
</P>
<P>
 With one considerable snag. 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli would be welcome as a racer, but not as a citizen, making him 
ineligible to compete for Luxembourg in Olympic or world championship 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli established residence in Luxembourg but the citizenship process 
took nearly 10 years, depriving him of opportunities to compete in the 1980 and 
1984 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Girardelli says he has never regretted leaving his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was necessary," he says. "I'm not such a nationalist. The color of the 
passport is not very important." 
</P>
<P>
 There were discussions in Luxembourg about exempting Girardelli from the 
normal citizenship process, but the government ultimately denied him any 
special favors. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I hate the implicit references of his Luxembourg nationality as 
something you just have to show up in some office and you get," Ambassador 
Berns says. 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli, renouncing his Austrian birthright, became a citizen of Luxembourg 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 While Luxembourg hangs on his every turn, Girardelli maintains that winning an 
Olympic gold medal is not important to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 1984 Sarajevo Games, in which he could not participate, Girardelli 
won five of eight World Cup slaloms and would have been a favorite for the 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was right," he says of his exclusion. "1984 was one of my 
best seasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries before the 1988 Calgary Games doomed his medal chances there. 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli did win two silver medals, in giant slalom and super-G, at the 1992 
Albertville Games. 
</P>
<P>
 He says winning World Cup overall titles are the true indicator of his 
dominance. As is his custom, Girardelli started slowly this season but has come 
on strong of late and ranks third in the World Cup overall behind Norway's 
Kjetil Andre Aamodt and Italy's Alberto Tomba. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Lillehammer Games, Girardelli will resume his chase for an 
unprecedented sixth overall title. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the Olympics, Girardelli scoffs that his silver medals aren't 
even made of silver. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least the World Cup bowl is made of real glass," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, he reiterated those feelings in statements reprinted by Ski Racing, 
the International ski journal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are there Olympics this year?" Girardelli was quoted as saying. "The athletes 
are not very important in the Olympics or World Championships. What is 
important is the opening ceremony, the closing ceremony, the lodging of the 
journalists and some parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Olympic chip for that shoulder, Marc? 
</P>
<P>
 Within the sport, Girardelli is considered by many the greatest all-around 
skier in Alpine history. Not only does he ski all four disciplines -- slalom, 
GS, super-G and downhill -- he is a threat to win any race he enters. 
</P>
<P>
 Included among his 43 World Cup victories are three downhills, 16 slaloms, 10 
giant slaloms, seven super-Gs and eight combined events. 
</P>
<P>
 With his super-G victory at Wengen, Switzerland, in January, Girardelli moved 
into second place on the all-time World Cup victory list behind Sweden's 
Ingemar Stenmark, a slalom specialist who retired with 86 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ranks up there with the best in the world, all time," longtime skiing 
analyst Bob Beattie says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in some minds, Girardelli's place in history will be judged by his 
Olympic success. 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie, who knows the skier well, says one should not put much stock in 
Girardelli's bad-mouthing of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great protection for racers," Beattie said. "Very few of them say, 'This 
is my dream, to win the medal,' because they know it's so tough, a crapshoot. 
It's great to say the goal is the World Cup because they have so many shots at 
it. I've heard this story so many times, and I don't buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dare we guess what a gold medal would mean to Luxembourg? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli, 30, is running out of runs. His body has more bumps than a mogul 
course, yet he keeps coming around the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there should never have been a ski star named Girardelli, and thus, 
none of this political wrangling. His should have been the story of the 
promising career cut short in 1983 when, after a crash, his left knee was all 
but reduced to hamburger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people told me to look for another job," Girardelli says now. 
</P>
<P>
 He tore every ligament in the knee, the tendon that extends through the knee 
and cartilage on either side. The famed surgeon to the skiers, Richard 
Steadman, who performed the four-hour operation, says he has never seen 
anything quite like Girardelli's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an understatement," Steadman said. "No one has ever come back to the 
level he's come back with that kind of injury. Nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after surgery, Girardelli hobbled away from Steadman's office on 
crutches. Steadman told Girardelli he could do some light knee bends. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Girardelli returned and reported to Steadman that he had been 
doing 100 half knee bends daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, Girardelli phoned Steadman and wondered if he could begin 
skiing on his good leg. Steadman gave him the OK. Soon after, Steadman received 
a picture in the mail of Girardelli skiing on the surgically repaired leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't disregard it," Steadman says of the rehab program he designed for 
Girardelli. "He just carried it to the extreme. He stayed within the 
guidelines, but he pushed it pretty far." 
</P>
<P>
 Steadman says that Girardelli is one of the finest athletes he has ever 
encountered. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very powerful. He would have made a fantastic running back in the NFL. 
There are two things that set him apart: His ability to focus is as good as 
anyone I've ever seen in sports, and his power." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a career beset with injures, Girardelli keeps plowing back. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, he dislocated his shoulder so severely he thought his career might be 
over. He made it through the World Cup season only with the help of an Egyptian 
nerve specialist, Mohamed Khalifa. 
</P>
<P>
 With the bum shoulder, Girardelli still managed to win gold in combined at the 
world championships. After the season, Steadman performed a five-hour operation 
to repair the damage Khalifa could not. 
</P>
<P>
 The hit parade: In 1988, Girardelli damaged ribs. In 1989, he injured his 
kidney and bruised his right knee and suffered a concussion. In 1990, he 
underwent surgery to repair torn muscles and internal bleeding in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Girardelli raced the last eight races with a torn knee ligament. 
Like the Buffalo Bills, Girardelli keeps coming back, like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli's workout regimen is legendary. Beattie says American skiers should 
take notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy is so tenacious," Beattie said. "He's one of the strongest kids I've 
ever known. Last year, at the end of the season, he took 10 days off, then went 
back to training. There is a lesson there for everybody. The one thing you can 
do something about is conditioning. He does everything possible he can do to be 
as good as he can be."

 There is no telling how Girardelli might have fared had he stayed in the 
Austrian system. He certainly would have been a star, but, given the fierce 
competition and plethora of Austrian specialists, you wonder if he could have 
fought through the crowds to win five overalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Girardelli says. "Maybe I would have won seven or eight. I won 
many races when I was still with the Austrians." 
</P>
<P>
 Girardelli doesn't know how much longer he can keep going, but if he happens 
to claim a gold medal for Luxembourg, you can bet a certain Washington 
ambassador will be scanning the news services to make sure Luxembourg -- all 
999 square miles -- gets its due. 
</P>
<P>
 Berns says, "Contrary to other sportsmen who have changed nationalities, it 
has to be said that Girardelli has never competed in an international event for 
any other country than Luxembourg." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been said.

MIKE DOWNEY: SARAJEVO'S TROUBLES MAKE ANY OTHER STORY LOOK SILLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six chilling days ago, mortar shells tore through Sarajevo's teeming 
marketplace, killing scores, scaring thousands half to death. On Tuesday, to 
commemorate the 10th anniversary of the opening of the Winter Olympics in what 
once was a city of gaiety, tranquillity and charm, hundreds of sympathizers 
stood together silently in quaint and quiet little Lillehammer, at the steps 
outside the town hall. 
</P>
<P>
 In a demonstration of solidarity with Sarajevo's living and dead, they struck 
matches to illuminate 200 candles, arranged in five circles like Olympic rings. 
The candles continue burning here, day and night. 
</P>
<P>
 While the siege of Sarajevo raged and government officials of the United 
States were weighing whether to intervene, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the 
president of the International Olympic Committee, made a public plea: "Please 
stop the fighting. Please stop the killing. Please drop your guns. We shall not 
give up our efforts to contribute, as it is stipulated in our charter, to 
building a more peaceful and better world." 
</P>
<P>
 And all the while, 14 terrified athletes, all skiers and sledders, were making 
a daring escape through Bosnia-Herzegovina's bloody snow. 
</P>
<P>
 I think of these people and I cannot take the plight of Tonya Harding or Nancy 
Kerrigan very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 I think of these people and I think back to the Sarajevo that I found so 
enchanting 10 years ago, and what remains of it. 
</P>
<P>
 I think of these people and I must redefine my ideas of what constitutes a 
crisis in the life of an Olympian, of what counts as actual courage. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in another far-off hemisphere, there are Americans distressed by the 
condition of a figure skater's bruised kneecap and by the bitter dispute over 
whether another figure skater was culpable for this vicious "attack." In the 
capital city of the former Yugoslavia, there are athletes whose rivals and 
relatives are fighting for their lives, athletes who could only sigh and 
fantasize that their troubles were no more disturbing than Kerrigan's or 
Harding's. 
</P>
<P>
 These are individuals who have shared little else in recent days but a 
destination and a determination to get there in one piece. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of them took refuge in tanks. Others traveled through the war-ravaged 
Bosnian countryside by car, working their way toward the border, looking 
anxiously over their shoulders around every turn. The airport at Tuzla was 
closed. The one at Sarajevo sat uncomfortably in the line of fire of heavily 
armed Serbs in the hills, of cannons and mobile mortars and hundreds of pieces 
of artillery. So no, air travel was not an acceptable risk. These athletes had 
to find some other safe passage to the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 In age they ranged from Zdravko Stojnic, a bobsledder of 36, to Sakib Birdio, 
a cross-country skier of 15. Three were women. There was Verona Marjanovic, 20, 
a luger who loved heavy-metal music and longed to be able to listen to some in 
peace. There was Samira Radaca, 21, who missed the golden mornings in Pale, 
Yugoslavia, when she could cross-country ski along roads without seeing armed 
soldiers, and Ariana Boras, 17, who was born in Konjic and became a skillful 
Alpine skier in the actual Alps. 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother, Igor Boras, had his 26th birthday Tuesday. He spent it 
successfully escaping Sarajevo and reaching his ultimate destination of Norway, 
where he will be a member of a bobsled team that will represent 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in these XVII Winter Olympics. He and his brother 
bobsledders made it safely to Lillehammer, leaving only one important piece of 
equipment behind. 
</P>
<P>
 All they need now is a sled. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a growing commitment here in Lillehammer to help these people and 
those they left behind, in any way possible. Funds are being raised and 
donations accepted by a volunteer Olympic aid committee, not only for Bosnians 
but for victims of carnage in Guatemala, Lebanon and Afghanistan as well. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 people have signed a document that has been designated as "a 
protocol of solidarity," among them the mayor and members of the city council 
of Lillehammer, officials of their Olympic committee here and representatives 
of the Norwegian Church. This scroll will be presented to the mayor of Sarajevo 
when he arrives here next week. The Bosnian athletes themselves were asked to 
put their signatures to it, and gladly obliged. 
</P>
<P>
 Samaranch, the IOC chief, found himself thinking back wistfully to the 
Sarajevo he had visited in 1984. It was his first Olympic Games as their 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, "Ten years ago, the youth of the world was gathered there to 
celebrate in a spirit of friendship, solidarity, fair play and the commitment 
of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 I remember. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember shy and smiling schoolgirls in lederhosen carrying trays of plum 
brandy, greeting travelers in Zagreb on their way to the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember Gypsies serenading patrons of a hilltop restaurant, strolling with 
accordions and mandolins, flirting with the women. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember plumes of cigarette smoke, floating above the heads of pedestrians 
as though from locomotives, and fresh oxygen in the mountains, exhilarating and 
pure. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember being behind a rope at the finish line when skier Bill Johnson came 
rocketing down the hill, and sitting beside Pat Lafontaine's parents as their 
son stick-handled a puck, and feeling goose bumps while the limbs of 
Christopher Dean and Jayne Torvill intertwined during an erotic interpretation 
of Ravel's "Bolero" on ice. 
</P>
<P>
 And I remember a party in the streets when a slalom skier named Jure Franko 
took second place, when around his neck was draped the only Winter Olympic 
medal that any Yugoslav had ever won. They put his face on a postage stamp for 
doing that. They danced and drank and laughed long into the Yugoslavian night. 
</P>
<P>
 And now their country isn't even there any more. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding doesn't have trouble. Nancy Kerrigan doesn't have trouble. These 
people have trouble.

OKLAHOMA FOOTBALL 'ARCHITECT' WILKINSON DIES; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: EX-COACH BEGAN 
SOONER GREATNESS WITH THREE NATIONAL TITLES IN THE 1950S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the legendary Bud Wilkinson died of congestive heart failure late 
Wednesday, a little bit of Oklahoma died with him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Wilkinson, 77, the soft-spoken architect of a Sooner football dynasty, 
who led Oklahoma to its first national championship in 1950, another in '55 and 
still another the next year. By the time he retired from Oklahoma in 1963, 
Wilkinson's record was nearly untouchable: three national titles, the longest 
victory streak in NCAA football history (47), 14 conference championships, a 
145-29-4 record -- and all of it done with class and elegance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made this what it is," former Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer told the 
Associated Press. "I think he was truly not only a great coach, but a fine 
gentleman and a guy who touched a lot of people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson, who died at his St. Louis home after a long illness, underwent 
recent heart surgery. Three months earlier, he suffered the last of a series of 
strokes that ultimately left him without much of his sight. 
</P>
<P>
 At his bedside Wednesday night were wife Donna and youngest son Jay. A funeral 
service is planned Monday at a St. Louis church. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson's legacy is visible nearly everywhere on the Oklahoma campus. The 
Bud Wilkinson House is the school's football dormitory. A stadium scoreboard 
includes his three national championship teams. In the Sooner locker room is a 
sign touched by every player as they make their way toward the field. "Play 
Like a Champion Today," it reads, and during Wilkinson's tenure the Sooners did 
just that. 
</P>
<P>
 So dominant were Wilkinson's teams of the 1940s and 1950s, the Sporting News 
later compiled a list of the 25 most powerful squads in NCAA history. 
Wilkinson's 1955-56 team was ranked third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnny Majors (the 1956 Heisman Trophy runner-up from Tennessee) couldn't 
have made our team," said Jimmy Harris, the Sooner quarterback that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his many successes at Oklahoma, Wilkinson distanced himself from the 
program upon retiring. In 1989, when Wilkinson House was the site of a rape and 
a shooting, the former Sooner coach told The Times: "It's something that you're 
not in any way pleased to be associated with." 
</P>
<P>
 After his initial departure from coaching, Wilkinson, a Republican, ran for 
the U.S. Senate. He lost but by only 20,000 votes. In contrast, 1964 Republican 
presidential candidate Barry Goldwater's defeat in the state was significantly 
greater. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years later, Wilkinson returned to football, this time as coach of the 
St. Louis Cardinals. In less than two NFL seasons, Wilkinson lost 19 games, 
after losing only 29 during his college career.

MARYLAND GOVERNOR TALKS TO DAVIS ABOUT MOVING RAIDERS TO BALTIMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer has spoken by phone to Raider owner Al 
Davis about moving the team to Baltimore, and on Thursday, asked the state 
General Assembly to set aside next Monday's deadline to buy time for 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Parties trying to get an NFL team for Baltimore had agreed to the deadline to 
have a team demonstrate definite interest in moving there.Otherwise, $160 
million earmarked for a stadium might pass into the hands of other state 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Oriole owner Peter Angelos has emerged in the quest as a potential bidder for 
the Rams or Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is activity, real strong activity," Schaefer said of the city's NFL 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, Schaefer spoke for about 30 minutes by telephone with Davis. 
Raider spokesman Al LoCasale said Thursday that he would neither confirm nor 
deny the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators have said they have mixed views of the governor's maneuvering, 
with one side agreeing with his wait-and-see stance and another fearing that a 
delay could prompt Washington Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke to withdraw his 
plan to finance and build his own $160-million stadium in Laurel, Md.

GRANATO IS SUSPENDED FOR SLASHING; PRO HOCKEY: KING WING WILL MISS AT LEAST 
THREE GAMES FOR HITTING CHICAGO'S WILKINSON OVER THE HEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Granato of the Kings has been suspended for at least three games and 
perhaps longer for slashing defenseman Neil Wilkinson of the Chicago Blackhawks 
at the Forum on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 League officials will not decide on the full terms of the suspension until 
Granato receives a hearing Tuesday. But he can't play until a review of the 
case is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What am I going to do?" Granato said after learning he will be a spectator 
when the Kings play the Mighty Ducks at Anaheim Arena tonight and Washington 
and Boston Saturday and Monday, respectively, at the Forum. "I'll do what I 
have to do and, hopefully, we'll win the games." 
</P>
<P>
 The slashing incident occurred with 4:57 left in the Kings' 4-2 victory. 
Granato and Wilkinson collided along the sideboards and Granato went down. 
Wilkinson stood over Granato and appeared to taunt him, though Granato later 
said he heard nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wilkinson turned to skate away, Granato arose, gripped his stick with both 
hands and brought it down on Wilkinson's helmet.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson fell to the ice, appearing to be seriously hurt. But he eventually 
arose and even got back in the game. Afterward, Wilkinson had a swollen jaw and 
said he had a ringing in his ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Granato, who was given a match penalty for a deliberate injury of an opponent, 
appeared to be in shock, telling teammates he wasn't even sure what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, he still wasn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember it," Granato said Thursday. "It all happened so fast. I know 
I hit my head on the ice and I got up. But when I looked at the film, I 
couldn't believe what happened. I'm just glad (Wilkinson) was not hurt 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 After Wednesday night's game, Coach Darryl Sutter of the Blackhawks said 
Granato should be suspended for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly don't know what will happen," Coach Barry Melrose of the Kings 
said. "There were extenuating circumstances that I hope the league takes into 
account. I hope Brian (Burke, the NHL's director of hockey operations) takes a 
look at the whole incident. The tape shows everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Like what? 
</P>
<P>
 "The hits and the taunting," Melrose said. "(Granato) got hit hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose even found some good coming out of this for Granato, who has been in 
and out of the lineup because of a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest might do him good," Melrose said. "His back has been sore but he has 
been playing through it. That's the way he is." 
</P>

ALPINE SKIING PREVIEW; DON'T LOOK FOR AMERICANS TO CRASH MEDAL PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Sun Valley to the Seine, Picabo to Piccard, the world's greatest Alpine 
racers gather in the global village here to compete in an Olympic battle of 
wills. 
</P>
<P>
 Will home-country hero, Kjetil Andre Aamodt, turn two weeks of Alpine into a 
Norwegian cruise? Will Italy's Alberto Tomba make headlines and history? If 
Marc Girardelli, Luxembourg's one-man band, wins his first gold medal, will he 
admit that he wanted it all along? 
</P>
<P>
 Will the recent death of Austria's Ulrike Maier shake skiers to the core at 70 
m.p.h.? 
</P>
<P>
 Will the U.S. team dust off the cobwebs of controversy and rekindle those warm 
and fuzzy medal days of 1984? Or will they come up with another Calgary goose 
egg? 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks of sharp turns and story lines begin Sunday with the men's downhill 
at Kvitfjell and end two Sundays later with the great Tomba and the men's 
slalom at Hafjell. 
</P>
<P>
 America first? Not in this space race. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. ski team has its share of stars -- some rising, some fading -- but 
are Shawn Bradley-thin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten American men have found their way to Lillehammer, yet if you lined them up 
and asked the medal contenders to step forward, only Tommy Moe and AJ Kitt 
would have the right to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt, accustomed to the spotlight, fielded most of the questions at a recent 
news conference, when in fact Moe, seated to his left, has surpassed him this 
season as America's best downhill racer.  
</P>
<P>
 Moe, from Palmer, Alaska, ranks ninth in current World Cup standings in both 
downhill and super giant slalom, and also figures to be a medal contender in 
combined, a run of downhill one day and two slalom runs the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kid is really good, and he doesn't really know yet what he can do," Bob 
Beattie, the veteran ski analyst and former U.S. Alpine coach, said of Moe. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt, the only American to have won a World Cup downhill since Bill Johnson in 
1984, began the season as a strong Olympic medal hope but has fallen out of the 
podium picture, currently ranking 22nd in downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 Theories? Some think Kitt over-trained last summer, doubling his on-snow 
workouts. The tabloid angle is that he has fallen hard for Nancy Elder, the 
reigning Miss Canada, and love has cost him his edge. Kitt met Elder last 
summer while judging the Miss Universe contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't come to the conclusion why I haven't had a good season so far," 
Kitt said. "I'm trying to put the struggle out of my mind and trying to ski 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not as though Kitt has been crossing his tips. He finished 12th in the 
last downhill he raced, at Wengen, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beattie thinks he has too much ground to make up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a great believer that if you don't start cracking the top 10, you 
shouldn't think about winning a medal," Beattie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's technical team? The Jamaican bobsled team has a better chance to win 
a medal. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. women are, again, intriguing at best. Last weekend, as the U.S. ski 
team read about its failures in a magazine story that flogged the American 
Alpine program, Hilary Lindh won the downhill at Sierra Nevada, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one way to silence your critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindh, the defending Olympic downhill silver medalist, is hot on the comeback 
trail, having missed most of 1992-93 while recuperating from knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, she has rounded into form in the critical days before the 
Olympic downhill, Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Valley's Picabo Street, last year's silver medalist in combined at the 
World Championships, started slowly but recently started breaking into the top 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Voelker and Eva Twardokens have medal shots in giant slalom. Voelker 
currently ranks sixth in the world in the event, Twardokens 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there are the unsolved mysteries. Diann Roffe-Steinrotter, the 1992 
Olympic GS silver medalist, has fallen to 30th place in her best event and 
appears to have run out of gas at 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Parisien, who missed the bronze in slalom at Albertville by 
five-hundredths of a second, is a skier in crisis, still torn emotionally by 
the death of her brother in December of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the world's top-ranked slalom skier, Parisien has fallen out of the top 
20. Paul Major, the U.S. Alpine director, says she can still work some Olympic 
magic, but that is not the prevailing wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Other skiers to watch: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Girardelli. The five-time World Cup overall champion, arguably the best 
all-around skier ever, seeks his first Olympic gold. In what might be a ploy to 
relieve himself of the pressure, Girardelli has spent the pre-Olympic weeks 
bad-mouthing the importance of the games. He's 30, though, and this could be 
his last chance not to give a hoot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tomba. He will try to become the first skier to win gold in three 
consecutive Olympics. Tomba swept slalom and GS at Calgary in 1988, then 
followed with gold in GS at Albertville. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning only one World Cup race last year, he was castigated by the 
Italian press. Tomba has since returned to dominance and -- ominously for the 
competition -- won the last two slaloms leading to the Games and currently 
ranks second in the World Cup overall, quite a feat considering Tomba does not 
ski downhill or Super G. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Aamodt. Simply, the best skier in the world, and the heir apparent to 
Girardelli's throne as all-around champion. The 22-year-old Norwegian is the 
reigning Olympic champion in Super G, and defending world champion in slalom 
and GS. Putting his mind to downhill this year, he won that World Cup event at 
Chamonix, France, on Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 As for being the home favorite, Aamodt responds, "Everybody expects, and wants 
Norway to win. That can be an advantage or a disadvantage. If you think the 
people believe in you, it could be an advantage. If you think of the 
expectations people have of you, it might not be an advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the races: WOMEN'S SLALOM 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic champion: Petra Kronberger, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup champion: Vreni Schneider, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Fab five: Schneider, Urska Hrovat, Slovenia; Anita Wachter, Austria; Pernilla 
Wiberg, Sweden; Morena Gallizio, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: Kronberger, a three-time overall champion, retired last year at 23. 
Schneider, 29, shows no signs of slowing. She is the current World Cup leader 
in overall and slalom. Parisien remains America's best medal hope. WOMEN'S 
GIANT SLALOM 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic champion: Wiberg. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup champion: Carole Merle, France. 
</P>
<P>
 Fab five: Wiberg, Wachter, Deborah Compagnoni, Italy; Christine Meier and 
Martina Ertl, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: Wiberg, who has rebounded wonderfully from Achilles' tendon surgery 
in 1992, is stronger in slalom this season. This is the best event for Wachter, 
the defending World Cup overall champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans swept the GS on the Hafjell Olympic course during a World Cup stop 
last March, with Meier winning. America's Heidi Voelker could sneak up and 
surprise. WOMEN'S SUPER-G 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic champion: Compagnoni. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup champion: Katra Seizinger, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Fab five: Seizinger, Wiberg, Compagnoni, Bibiana Perez, Italy; Katja Koren, 
Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: The late Ulrike Maier would have been a medal contender here. 
Seizinger rules as the world's top woman in super-G and downhill. Megan Gerety, 
the top U.S. hope at the beginning of the season, ranks 33rd in the world. 
Hilary Lindh ranks 20th. WOMEN'S DOWNHILL 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic champion: Kerrin Lee-Gartner, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup champion: Seizinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Fab five: Seizinger, Lee-Gartner, Kate Pace, Canada; Veronika Stallmaier, 
Austria, and Lindh. 
</P>

<P>
 Comments: This hasn't been Tomba's best event this year, but it is hard to bet

 Comments: Heinzer was the best downhiller going until he suffered a concussion 
while training for Kitzbuehel race in January. Alarm bells rang concerning his 
condition when he missed his own country's downhill at Wengen. Heinzer appeared 
fine in Thursday's training run here, however, finishing ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortlieb proved his Olympic victory was no fluke when he won his first two 
World Cup downhills this year, at Val Gardena, Italy, and the famed Kitzbuehel. 
</P>
<P>
 Aamodt finished fifth on the Kvitfjell course last year.

</P>
<P>
 Comments: Don't be surprised if Norway goes 1-2 here. Girardelli would be more 
of a favorite, but he is not skiing as well in slalom.

WINTER OLYMPICS / NOTEBOOK; U.S. TEAM PICKS MYLER TO CARRY THE FLAG

 Cammy Myler of Lake Placid, N.Y., three-time Olympian in women's luge 
competition, will carry the flag for the U.S. team Saturday in the opening 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Myler was elected by her American teammates Thursday. Others nominated were 
speedskaters Bonnie Blair, Kristin Talbot and Dan Jansen, and mogul skier Donna 
Weinbrecht. Blair and Weinbrecht are former gold medalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is really special, that the athletes, my peers, elected me to be 
the one to embody the Olympic spirit at the opening ceremony," Myler said. 
"It's extra-special because my brother (Tim) is in the hospital (with cancer) 
and my entire family won't be able to be here, but they will definitely see me 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ole Gunnar Fidjestol, a Norwegian who was to have sailed off the ski jump 
carrying the Olympic torch during the opening ceremony, was injured in practice 
and will miss what would have been his big moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidjestol suffered a concussion and a twisted neck when he fell and was 
hospitalized for observation. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve jumper Stein Gruben will take Fidjestol's place in the opening 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vegard Ulvang vs. Juan Antonio Samaranch and the International Olympic 
Committee continues, on a less acrimonious note. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulvang, Norwegian cross-country skier and national hero, had criticized 
Samaranch on Norwegian TV for his ties to the old Franco government of Spain 
and ripping the IOC for what Ulvang said was a lack of democracy. This sparked 
a rumor that Ulvang would not be reciting the Olympic oath on behalf of the 
athletes at the opening ceremony, as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent developments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ulvang's critical statements were taped more than a month ago, six days 
before he knew he would be giving the oath. He did know, however, that the 
interview was being taped and would be shown on Feb. 8, according to Norwegian 
TV2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was not Ulvang's intention to attack Samaranch personally, but rather to 
criticize the IOC, according to Gerhard Heiberg, president of the Lillehammer 
Olympic Organizing Committee. Heiberg also said he accepted responsibility for 
the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ulvang apologized to Samaranch at a meeting Thursday and invited Samaranch 
to dinner. Samaranch, in turn, invited Ulvang to discussions on the work of the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No one, other than rumor mongers, has said that Ulvang will not be allowed 
to deliver the oath. MIKE KUPPER

 Rejected previously by the American Arbitration Assn. and a state court in 
Chicago, bobsled driver Bruce Rosselli has now filed suit in an Indianapolis 
federal court, charging there was a conspiracy against him in the Olympic 
trials and asking the court to order new trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli's suit names driver Brian Shimer and the U.S. Skeleton and Bobsled 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heart of his conspiracy case is his contention that the federation 
favored one team over another (during the trials) because of friendship," 
Executive Director Matt Roy said from Lake Placid, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's so ridiculous the arbitrator didn't even ask to hear our side of it 
(during the Jan. 29-30 hearing). He told Bruce he had heard enough and that he 
hadn't proved there was conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli asked a state court to vacate the ruling on Feb. 4, but was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 His contention is that driver Jim Herberich, who qualified for the Olympic 
team along with Shimer and Randy Will, should not have been allowed to use the 
steel runners off the sled of injured driver Chuck Leonowitz because Leonowitz 
had entrusted the equipment to the federation. Rosselli charges that the 
federation turned it over to Shimer, who turned it over to Herberich. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic bobsled competition begins Feb. 19, and Roy said it is too late to 
hold new trials and too late to change a roster submitted on Jan. 31. ROSS

 Hannes Trinkl of Austria posted the fastest time, 1 minute 45.55 seconds, in 
the first training run on the Kvitfjell downhill course. 
</P>
<P>
 Men's Alpine skiing begins Sunday with the downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 American Tommy Moe was 11th, teammates Kyle Rasmussen and AJ Kitt 16th and 
29th, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt and Moe are among the many fans of the course, designed by Bernhard Russi 
of Switzerland, who won the gold medal in the 1972 Olympic downhill and took 
the silver medal behind Austrian Franz Klammer in '76. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in comparison to the last two (Olympic courses), this one is the best 
for sure," Kitt said. "This course offers the most diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Moe: "I think this is the best course Russi has designed yet. It took him 
three times to get it right, but this is the best one." 
</P>
<P>
 There were concerns that, with so much snow, the course might be too slow. But 
Russi does not think that will be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The icy areas will make the course just as difficult as it was during last 
year's World Cup race," he said. "I would not make changes in the course, even 
if I could. It is exactly the way I wanted it to be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is some concern among athletes that the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan 
saga will overshadow other Olympic events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what happened is unfortunate," Rasmussen said. "But if the skating 
controversy is what's important to the press and they feel the public wants to 
read about it, then I guess we have to take a back seat. In my opinion, if you 
want to experience the excitement of the Olympic Games, then come watch the 
downhill." CHRIS DUFRESNE

 The U.S. hockey team arrived, its confidence boosted by a 2-2 tie with Sweden 
in its pre-Olympic finale. "It was a moral victory," defenseman Brett Hauer 
said. "We did a good job shutting Sweden down in the neutral zone, and that's 
what we have to do against puck-control teams." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. opens play Sunday against France, and Coach Tim Taylor said his team 
is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, 51 and on leave from his coaching job at Yale, isn't sure whether he 
will return there after the Winter Games. "I've been at Yale 17 years, maybe 
it's time to move on," he said. "I like to coach. It's the only option I have 
right now, but I'm not ruling out other options." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Center Todd Marchant of Williamsville, N.Y., a seventh-round choice of the New 
York Rangers last June, was the top U.S. scorer in pre-Olympic play. Marchant 
had 67 points, including 28 goals, in 59 games, three points more than right 
wing Peter Ferraro, also a Ranger draft pick. Ferraro was the team's top goal 
scorer, with 30.

<P>
 Russia's hockey team, one of the favorites, will have to make do without 
forwards Viacheslav Bykov and Andrei Khomutov, whose Swiss League team wouldn't 
release them for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian team has been together only since Jan. 27, a departure from 
previous years when the players trained together for several months. Players 
are now permitted to play in European leagues, which means that their clubs 
won't let them go until the last minute -- if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was definitely the most difficult team to put together," said assistant 
coach Igor Dmitriev, the heir apparent to longtime Coach Viktor Tikhonov. "We 
have many candidates . . . but we have no one with outstanding skills. No 
leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that left wing Valeri Karpov, the Mighty Ducks' third pick and 
56th overall in last June's entry draft, had fully recovered from the broken 
arm he suffered in December, but is "not in the right condition." HELENE

DELSING SHOWS NO FEAR IN A 67; GOLF: FORMER UCLA STANDOUT THINKING LESS AND 
ENJOYING IT MORE AS HE GOES FOR FIRST VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jay Delsing, a 30-something who has never won in 10 years on the PGA Tour, has 
it figured out. He believes he knows why he has never done better than a 
distant second in the New England Classic, an event the week after the British 
Open. He says he realizes why he's the least celebrated alumnus of a UCLA golf 
team that featured Corey Pavin, Steve Pate and Duffy Waldorf. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Delsing was afraid. Afraid of his talent. Afraid of his surroundings. 
Afraid of being afraid. He also didn't want to kill anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to learn that everyone hits a snap hook or a hard slice," Delsing said 
after shooting a four-under-par 67 in the first round of the L.A. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "In college, we played in front of a few people, but nothing like out here on 
a Sunday afternoon," Delsing said. "It can be dangerous when a shot gets away 
from you and goes into the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Delsing, 33, wasn't playing in front of a lot of people Thursday, teeing off 
in the first group at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Delsing's round at Riviera, three strokes behind leader Tom Purtzer's, along 
with a strong showing at Pebble Beach last week, seems to indicate a shift in 
his success. He says he no longer is afraid and has learned how not to think, a 
trait that comes remarkably easy to many people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to think a lot less," Delsing said. "I just didn't trust that my 
talent was enough. I was into mechanics and all of that. . . . I used to get 
distracted easily. (My biggest distraction was) that my head was on my 
shoulders. And visually, there was so much to get distracted by. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I believe that if I do my stuff, I can play with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The "don't think" axiom was first introduced to Jay by his father, Jim, a 
former major league baseball player remembered as the person who pinch-ran for 
Eddie Gaedel, the dwarf who had one at-bat for the St. Louis Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what you tell all athletes," Jim Delsing said from his home in St. 
Louis. "Don't think, you'll hurt the team. . . . You have to learn to relax." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay's parents saw him last year in the L.A. Open, but he didn't make the cut. 
This year, the trip to California was canceled, partly because of the flood 
that devastated the Midwest last summer. While the Delsing homestead was a mile 
from the floodwaters, Jim and his wife adopted a family that did lose its home 
and have spent the past several months helping the family rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Riviera is familiar territory for Jay. While at UCLA, the team 
occasionally practiced at the course. "We could practice on Thursday afternoons 
after 1:30," Delsing said. "And with the number of people that play this 
course, it meant we never saw the last four holes." 
</P>
<P>
 That can be used to explain Delsing's final hole Thursday. He three-putted for 
a bogey on the 18th, a 447-yard up-the-hill monster that has an appetite for 
errant shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, it was a chance for him to relax. Don't worry, be happy. He strolled 
into the interview room with a big smile, and when a reporter put the 
obligatory tape recorder in front of him, Delsing asked if he could have it. He 
asked a couple of times. The reporter said no. When Delsing's microphone slowly 
fell to the table, he made a joke about it. "Reminds me of my 18th hole." 
</P>
<P>
 From there, he was off and rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played a really solid round of golf today," he said. "I had a lot of 
opportunities for birdies, but anytime you can get around Riviera in four 
under, you're satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago, I would have been very upset about (the bogey on 18). But 
you have to find optimism in everything, otherwise it'll beat you." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is hoping to beat other players. It's something his father believes 
might happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's got it all together," Jim Delsing said. "We think he'll do well 
the entire week. We're confident of that." 
</P>
<P>
 We'll find out more about Jay Delsing's confidence in the next three days.

A BIG FIND; SONORA BASKETBALL COACH DISCOVERED CRAIG CLARK, AND CLARK HAS 
DISCOVERED HE CAN PLAY THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Craig Clark, all 6 feet 7 inches of him, was standing in line, just minding 
his own business. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a freshman at Sonora, waiting to register for classes. He wasn't 
looking for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 It found him, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just standing there and this guy came up to me and said, 'Do you play 
basketball?' " said Clark, now a junior. "I told him no. He said, 'You are 
now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The "guy" was the Sonora basketball Coach Mike Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 The next thing Clark knew, he had signed a bunch of papers and was standing on 
a basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy was throwing the ball to Clark, who had never played the game. 
</P>
<P>
 This was trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what to do," Clark said. "I caught the ball, turned around and 
threw up a shot. It didn't hit the rim. It didn't even hit the backboard. The 
look on his face said, 'Oh my gosh. ' " 
</P>
<P>
 All his life, people had been pushing Clark to get on a basketball court. He 
fought it. Sure, he's big -- a 7-footer these days -- but he wasn't going to be 
a stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's Clark who does the pushing. He strains and strives to improve in a 
game that he once hated out of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 True, opposing teams don't exactly quake in his presence. But they don't 
snicker, either. Not any more. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark is averaging nearly 12 points and 10 rebounds. Modest numbers, but light 
years away from last season's. He has improved to the point that Division I 
colleges are starting to show interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me happy to see how far I've come," Clark said. "I've worked hard at 
it and improved a lot. Now, it's kind of funny to look back at my freshman 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 He certainly wasn't laughing then. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a basketball rim in Clark's bedroom; it's old, worn out and a little 
bent. It used to hang on a wooden backboard in the driveway. He tore it down 
with a dunk a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The basket was there when his family bought the house, but Clark had never 
used it. He didn't even own a basketball. He couldn't dunk one if he did. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't that Clark disliked basketball; he just wasn't very good at it. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Clark didn't play any sports while growing up. Instead, he immersed 
himself in school work, the Bible and those Hardy Boys mystery novels. 
</P>
<P>
 Who had time for sports? Who wanted to make time? 
</P>
<P>
 "I once tried out for basketball when I was in the eighth grade," Clark said. 
"I didn't want to, but my friends were asking me and the coach was telling me I 
had to do it. It was a two-day tryout and I embarrassed myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Enough of that, he thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he made the mistake of being that tall guy in line. Murphy zeroed in on 
him immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if he was coming out for basketball and he said he didn't think 
so," Murphy said. "I just went and got all the necessary papers and said, 
'Here, sign these.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy literally took him from the line to the gym. He placed Clark in the low 
post and fed him a pass. Yes, the shot was atrocious, but Murphy saw some 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had a doubt in my mind, because he could catch the ball," Murphy 
said. "He couldn't dribble. He couldn't shoot. But he had great hands and he 
was a very good passer." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has built his game around that, working nonstop since the end of his 
freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer after his freshman year, Clark played at least two games a day, 
five days a week. He'd play with the varsity, then the junior varsity and, 
sometimes, even with the sophomores, all in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark began working with a strength coach and has added 30 pounds, beefing up 
to 235. He also works with a shooting coach. He'll do 200 hook shots with his 
right hand and 200 with his left, not to mention hours and hours of layups. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most effective teacher was Chris Campbell, the team's center last 
season. His rammed his 6-8 frame into Clark day in and day out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris didn't show him any mercy," Murphy said. "He shoved him and pushed him. 
It was really brutal. But it toughened Craig up." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Clark: "Yeah, Chris beat on me a little bit. But it showed what I had to 
learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark's freshman season was a mixture of frustration and embarrassment. He 
went from the varsity to the junior varsity to the sophomore to the freshman 
team, all in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on that level, he wasn't exactly needed. About all he was asked to do was 
win the opening tip. In fact, Clark won the jump ball, then was replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a struggle," he said. "I remember my first game, we were up by about 
25 points, so they let me go in. I took a shot and missed and turned to run 
back up court and tripped over my own feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, and my uniform was so small, it looked like I was wearing underwear." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark was so embarrassed that he didn't even attend varsity games. But Murphy 
had faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always let him know he was doing fine," Murphy said. "I always let him know 
that he was going to be a player." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark is one now. 
</P>
<P>
 He has shown flashes of what he can be this season. He had 16 points, 15 
rebounds and eight blocked shots against Santiago. He had 19 points and 14 
rebounds against La Mirada. He scored seven points in the first two minutes 
against Troy, forcing the Warriors into a zone defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it never seems to be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair sometimes because people look at Craig's size and expect so 
much," Murphy said. "There are games where he's scored 10 points, grabbed 15 
rebounds and maybe blocked four or five shots and someone will say, 'Why 
doesn't he score every time he gets the ball?' They expect him to get every 
rebound and block every shot. I even catch myself thinking that sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair just to judge a kid by his size." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Murphy did, and Clark has measured up.

MATER DEI'S COTTON INJURED, MISSES GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mater Dei forward Schea Cotton missed Wednesday night's South Coast League 
game against Mission Viejo because a slight muscle pull in his back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schea's been taking it real light in practice and we decided to rest him for 
the playoffs," Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, a freshman, averages 19.6 points and 9.4 rebounds. He was hardly 
missed by the Monarchs, who defeated the Diablos, 104-52. McKnight said Cotton 
would play tonight against Capistrano Valley in Mater Dei's league final.

FUNICELLO SHOWS THAT BASKETBALL IS CONTACT SPORT; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: 
ALEMANY CENTER BLOSSOMS AFTER DISCARDING HER HORN-RIMMED GLASSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Melissa Hearlihy was asked to pinpoint the key moment in the development 
of sophomore center Carly Funicello, the Alemany High girls' basketball coach 
plucked a photograph from the bulletin board in her office, slapped the picture 
on her desk and drew attention to Funicello's image. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look at the glasses," Hearlihy said. "That symbolizes how she started." 
</P>
<P>
 In the photo taken during her freshman season, Funicello stands out -- not 
because she is the tallest player on the team at 6-foot-3, but because of the 
outlandish horn-rimmed glasses she wore. 
</P>
<P>
 Funicello's debut at Alemany was inauspicious. She was too aggressive on 
defense, picking up unnecessary fouls, and not aggressive enough on offense. 
She fumbled away passes and appeared lost at times in the Indians' offensive 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 The glasses didn't help. Funicello constantly worried they would break. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game against St. Bernard last season, they did break, right down the 
middle, and had to be fixed with white tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that game I had to switch to contacts," Funicello said. "It was just 
too much to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hearlihy, the glasses became a symbol. When Funicello shed the glasses, a 
lot of her tentativeness went with them, Hearlihy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once those glasses came off, she blossomed," Hearlihy said. "It's tough being 
six-foot-three without having also to wear glasses. Her self-esteem and 
confidence went way up once those glasses came off." 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start as a freshman, Funicello finished the season strong, 
averaging 12.5 points and nine rebounds. In her second season, she is averaging 
14 points, 10 rebounds and one blocked shot. The Indians are 22-0, including a 
season sweep of St. Bernard, Alemany's top rival in the Mission League. The 
Indians are ranked fifth in the state by Cal-Hi Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Eye problems haven't been the only obstacle Funicello has overcome to play 
basketball for the Indians.  
</P>
<P>
 When she tried out as a freshman, it was her first experience with organized 
basketball. Until then, Funicello played only soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 She was always tall for her age, but a growth spurt in eighth grade helped her 
consider a basketball future. After meeting with Hearlihy before her freshman 
season, the ninth-grader chose basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to play both soccer and basketball at the same time, but Melissa 
said just basketball," Funicello said. "Sometimes I think about what it would 
be like to play soccer, but I'm much happier playing basketball. I've got 
things to my advantage."  
</P>
<P>
 Funicello's success in basketball has erased any thoughts of returning to the 
soccer field. But six years of playing center halfback had its benefits. Her 
leg strength gives Funicello an athleticism many tall players envy. 
</P>
<P>
 But she wasn't adept at the game from a technical standpoint. Funicello 
followed instructions but didn't always comprehend the reasons behind the 
orders. "Why play with my back to the basket or front a defender," she 
wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really understand what I was doing my freshman year," she said. "I 
just kind of went with the flow." 
</P>
<P>
 Funicello is still working on her game, especially on her passing and 
upper-body strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope she'll be able to do 10 pushups by her senior year," Hearlihy said.  
</P>
<P>
 This season, Funicello has increased her awareness of the game. While her 
scoring, rebounding and blocked shots statistics are up only slightly, she has 
added to her skills. She has increased range as a shooter and added a 
left-handed shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got the shot in the paint, now we've moved to the free-throw line," 
Hearlihy said. "If she wants to, she could be a three-point shooter." 
</P>
<P>
 Her more experienced teammates also take extra time with Funicello, especially 
guard Samantha Rigley. After a season-and-a-half, Funicello is proud to point 
out she can finally catch Rigley's bullet passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never thought I'd be able to catch them," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Funicello still struggles with on-the-job training. In the first meeting 
with St. Bernard this season, Funicello was matched against two post players 
who have signed with Pacific 10 Conference schools. She had difficulty on the 
offensive end and got into foul trouble in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she fouled out midway through the final quarter, and had several 
shots blocked, Funicello persevered and finished with 12 points, eight rebounds 
and two blocked shots.  
</P>
<P>
 She also played well on defense. With help from teammate Zevette Mitchell, 
Funicello held the 6-4 tandem of Marte Alexander and Olympia Scott scoreless in 
the opening quarter and to 14 points between them in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, they met again. Funicello scored 13 points in a 52-45 victory. 
Alexander and Scott combined for 21 points.  
</P>
<P>
 Funicello credits part of her improvement to watching college basketball on 
television, both men's and women's. She looks at current collegiate stars Lisa 
Leslie of USC and Natalie Williams of UCLA as role models. 
</P>
<P>
 Both players possess the size to play center, but they have the athletic 
ability to play the forward position in college. Hearlihy envisions the same 
future for Funicello, who is still growing. 
</P>
<P>
 This past year, Funicello passed her mother in height. Katy Funicello is 6-2 
1/2 and played basketball at St. Genevieve from 1966 to 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball for Katy Funicello differed greatly from the game her daughter 
plays. The elder Funicello played "stationary guard" on a six-player team. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's 20 million times better than I ever was," Katy Funicello said. "Our 
goal is to get her a scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 But for this season, Funicello is worrying only about winning a Southern 
Section championship. Alemany was runner-up in the Division III-AA last season. 
</P>
<P>
 She has kept the horn-rimmed glasses as a reminder of her experience from last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have them," she said. "But I'll only wear them at home. . . . by 
myself. . . . at night."

STATE BOARD REJECTS CLAIM BY FORMER TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The State Board of Control has rejected a claim by a group of former Cal State 
Fullerton football players against the university for withholding work-related 
stipends, a spokesperson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Patel, spokesperson for the control board, said the claim lacked proper 
signatures.She said the board has contacted the football players' legal counsel 
to obtain the proper signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen former Titan players attempted to file the claim Monday,charging that 
the university unfairly withheld $500 in monthly stipends promised them after 
the school dropped the football program in December 1992. The plaintiffs are 
seeking damages of $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Their claim centers on an agreement between the university and the players to 
provide the players the stipend in exchange for a maximum 10 hours a week 
working for the university. The players charge that the agreement was unclear 
about the specified amount of hours required to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Athletic Director Bill Shumard said the university began withholding 
the athletes' stipend checks in November because the players weren't doing the 
work and the school "felt they (athletes) were in violation of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had signed an agreement in advance that they would have a commitment to 
work to earn their grant in aid," Shumard said. "We didn't make them work last 
spring because they had been through a tough time, and we wanted them to get on 
the same page academically. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the fall semester started, I was lenient at first, but the work 
commitment still had to be honored. As to my understanding, they feel it's 
unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard said the university hasn't officially been served notice on the claim, 
and that it might not arise until the next 30 to 45 days. MIKE REILLEY

EX-CHARGER ASSISTANT TO LEAD RAIDER DEFENSE; PRO FOOTBALL: JOHN FOX REPLACES 
GUNTHER CUNNINGHAM, WHO WILL COACH LINEBACKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders have hired John Fox, defensive backfield coach of the San Diego 
Chargers, to be their new defensive coordinator, replacing Gunther Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 "This does not in any way jeopardize Gunther Cunningham's position as a member 
of the Raider coaching staff," a Raider spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham is expected to continue coaching the linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another change will occur on offense. Joe Scannella, coach of the offensive 
backs, is retiring because of imminent replacement surgery on both knees. He 
has just completed his 41st year of coaching and has been with the Raiders 
since 1987 in this, his second tour of duty with the team. The Raiders are 
expected to shuffle the current staff to replace Scannella rather than hiring 
anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of Fox, 39, ends a search that had been going on since the Raiders' 
season-ending 29-23 loss to the Buffalo Bills in the second round of the NFL 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those reportedly considered was Richie Petitbon, who was fired at 
season's end as head coach of the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox has been coaching defensive backs in the NFL for the last five seasons, 
spending three years with the Pittsburgh Steelers before joining the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 His first full-time coaching job was in 1979 with U.S. International 
University, where he worked under then-athletic director Sid Gillman, a Hall of 
Fame pro coach, and Tom Walsh, then the head coach at USIU, currently offensive 
coordinator of the Raiders.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: AT ALEMANY, WRESTLERS ON DAWN PATROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the Army, the Alemany High wrestling team does more before 9 a.m. than 
most people do all day. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 earthquake damaged much of the Alemany campus, Coach Dennis 
Henderson had to scramble to find a suitable site for practice and matches. 
</P>
<P>
 He found one 14 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the earthquake, Henderson began holding practices in the old gym 
at Harvard-Westlake, where Alemany also holds dual meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a practice facility so far from school has its disadvantages. Because 
classes begin at 7:30 a.m., and Alemany has the use of the gym only in the 
early morning, practices start as early as 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably been a mental toll more than a physical one," Henderson said. 
After last week's meet against St. John Bosco, Henderson gave his team a break 
from the early, early schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Practice started at 5:30. MISSION LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Rigley Rises to Occasion Call her Miss Clutch. 
</P>
<P>
 When Samantha Rigley, Alemany's best girls' basketball player, steps to the 
free-throw line, Coach Melissa Hearlihy immediately thinks, "What are we going 
to do after we score two points?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rigley, a 5-9 junior forward, has made 86 of 110 free throws (78.2%). In 
crucial situations, she's nearly automatic. In Alemany's two games against 
league rival St. Bernard, Rigley made 13 of 14 the first time and 11 of 13 in 
the second game. Alemany won both games. 
</P>
<P>
 "My team has good foul shooters, and I have a lot of confidence in myself," 
Rigley said. "I know teams don't like to foul me at the end of the game." 
FRONTIER LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 The Streak Rolls On 
</P>
<P>
 With a 74-51 victory over Calabasas on Tuesday night, Santa Clara extended its 
league victory streak to 83. But the exceptional seems routine for the Saints, 
who are coached by Lou Cvijanovich for the 36th season. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara has been challenged -- the Saints had to work into overtime to 
beat Moorpark, 58-54, at home last week to keep the streak alive. But the 
Saints always answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They scored the first basket of the overtime, and the team that does that 
really sets the tone and puts pressure on the opponent, for some reason," 
Moorpark Coach Tim Bednar said. "Our guys were so focused on what they needed 
to do. But then we missed a short jumper and they just stepped up and hit the 
difficult shots in those situations. They just pour it on. They just do it when 
they need to." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Santa Paula Coach Tom Donahue, whose team has lost, 58-48 and 42-35, to 
Santa Clara: "That's how they've been winning. They've made runs. They're very 
confident. They make plays when they need to make them, and you can't get over 
the hump again." FOOTHILL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Hart-Canyon Redux 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's basketball team is ranked No. 1 in the area by The Times, has a 20-1 
record and leads the league with a 7-0 mark. But a loss in tonight's game at 
Canyon could leave a bitter taste. That's because Canyon (20-5, 6-1) would earn 
a share of the championship with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart Coach Mike May said it isn't necessary to apprise his players of the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the kids know that," he said. "They understand the nature of the 
rivalry. They understand the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon's only loss in league play is a 52-26 defeat to Hart last month. 
</P>
<P>
 If the teams should share the championship, both would enter the playoffs as 
league champions albeit in different brackets. Hart plays in Division I, Canyon 
in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians continue to rough it in the wake of the Jan. 17 earthquake. May 
commutes each day from Fontana because the house he's buying in Valencia is 
damaged and has not cleared escrow. Hart held practice on an outdoor court 
Tuesday because it couldn't find a gymnasium.

 How important is one player -- in this case Saugus point guard Jeff Rogers? 
Centurion Coach Eric Olsson thinks the absence of Rogers was the difference in 
a 35-34 setback to No. 1 Hart on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers has a spinal infection that will sideline him the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were without both our point guards in that game -- that should tell you 
something," Olsson said. "Rogers is very important to us. But the main thing is 
the doctors found out what was wrong with him. He had a high temperature and no 
feeling in his legs Friday, and nobody had a diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now he seems to be improving, but he still can't walk very well. It's good to 
know he's getting better."

 No Breaks 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive season, Pacific League coaches can make a strong 
argument that from top to bottom, theirs is one of the toughest leagues in the 
Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into the final regular-season games tonight, four of six teams have 15 
victories. Glendale has 19, while Crescenta Valley, Muir and Pasadena each has 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches in our league are the best coaches," Hoover Coach Kirt Kohlmeier 
said. "I think our league is the strongest, top to bottom, in the (Southern 
Section)." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, three teams made it to the semifinals in their respective 
divisions -- Pasadena in I-A, Muir in II-A and Crescenta Valley in II-AA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale (19-6, 7-2) needs a victory against Crescenta Valley tonight to win 
at least a share of the league title. The Dynamiters are tied with Muir, which 
plays fifth-place Arcadia. If Glendale secures at least a piece of the title, 
it would be the first time since 1988, when Glendale won the championship, that 
a team other than Pasadena or Muir finished first. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley (15-8, 5-4) needs a victory against Glendale to secure the 
final, automatic playoff spot in the league. Even with a loss, the Falcons are 
likely to receive an at-large berth. MISSION LEAGUE

 Today, the Spirits (9-12, 6-5) must beat league champion Desert to secure a 
playoff spot. If they lose, they could still advance to postseason play under a 
variety of complicated circumstances. Playoffs or not, this was not what Gavel 
expected.

 Joe Vaughan, Buena girls' basketball coach, wasn't laying it on thick -- but 
his team was thin. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of injuries and illness, the Bulldogs (18-2 and ranked fourth in the 
state) had only six players in uniform at the beginning of last week, forcing 
Vaughan to call up a junior varsity player. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone from the lineup were Michelle Giordano (who suffered strained ligaments 
in her right knee Jan. 25) and Eboni Conley (sick). Plus, guard Stephanie 
Kinnear has been sidelined for over a month because of a dislocated kneecap, 
and two other players, Laura Dahl and Nicky Hannah, were recovering from 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The shorthanded Bulldogs were upset by archrival Ventura, 39-37, Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss snapped Buena's 52-game league winning streak, dating to 1991.

 "Overall, I'm happy with our kids' effort, considering all that happened," 
Vaughan said. "It was a tough week."

 At this stage of the season, most improving basketball players increase their 
averages by a few tenths of a point. Not North Hollywood's Damon Ollie and 
Fantasia Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ollie, a 6-5 senior center, added 52 points, 42 rebounds and 15 blocked shots 
to his statistics. Ollie's rebounding average jumped one full point to a 
region-leading 16.7. His scoring average improved nearly a full point to 20.4 
points a game.

 "He's tremendous, what can I say?" North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller said. 
"He's twice the player he was last year. He's really demonstrating he can be a

<P>
 The Van Nuys gymnasium sustained damage in the earthquake, forcing the team to 
practice outside and play the rest of the season on the road.

 Lee wanted to cancel the rest of the season, but the Wolves wouldn't hear it.

sure. Most teams would have folded by now." DELPHIC LEAGUE

 This was supposed to be Campbell Hall's season.

 With four starters returning, including Alex Lopez, a 6-10 center headed for 
Washington, and with league power Crossroads appearing to be in a down year, 
Coach Jon Palarz thought 1994 would be a breakthrough year for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 The season started well but in the last week, Campbell Hall (16-7, 4-3) saw 
its hopes for a Delphic League title slip away in two close losses to 
Crossroads, which has lost only one league game in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Six missed free throws in one game and four turnovers in the final two minutes 
of the other led to 63-59 and 68-61 losses.

 "We're real disappointed," Palarz said. "We had a shot to win both games. One 
was to the last possession, the other the last two minutes." Around the Leagues

PURPORTED LYLE MENENDEZ LETTER SPARKS CONTROVERSY; COURTS: NOTE ALLEGEDLY GAVE 
ADVICE ON TESTIMONY. DEFENSE QUESTIONS THE DOCUMENT'S AUTHENTICITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Weeks after prosecutors promised that they would have new evidence for the 
retrial of the Menendez brothers, a potential piece of new evidence has 
surfaced -- and immediately generated controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a letter purportedly written by Lyle Menendez to a former 
girlfriend before she testified at the brothers' recently completed trial in 
Van Nuys Superior Court, which resulted in two hung juries. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an article in Vanity Fair magazine, published this week, the 
letter was sent from County Jail to advise the ex-girlfriend, Traci L. Baker, 
how she could help the defense by testifying about a dinner at the Menendez 
home at which family members seemed afraid that Kitty Menendez was trying to 
poison their food. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, 24, could not be reached for comment, and it is not known whether she 
actually received the letter, Vanity Fair reported. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense lawyers questioned the authenticity of the letter and the 
circumstances of its release. Leslie Abramson, the lead attorney for Erik 
Menendez, said she suspected that county prosecutors were leaking 
"pseudo-evidence" to the "sensationalist media . . . for the purpose of biasing 
prospective jurors" who might be seated for the retrial of the brothers accused 
of murder in the 1989 slayings of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne denied that prosecutors gave him the letter. 
"Absolutely not!" he said. "N-O-T." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, Sandi Gibbons, also said 
prosecutors had not leaked it. "That's ridiculous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to news reports that Abramson had questioned the ethics of 
prosecutors, Gibbons added: "I think Ms. Abramson knows better and is basically 
trying to put her own spin on something that's obviously harmful to her case." 
</P>
<P>
 After the first hung jury, Garcetti announced that his office already had new 
evidence to use at any retrial. Gibbons would not confirm or deny that the 
purported Lyle Menendez letter is among that evidence, but said: "We're aware 
of the existence of the letter." 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Lansing, Lyle Menendez's lead attorney, said the defense did not know of 
the document until this week. 
</P>
<P>
 While "some of the handwriting looks similar" to Lyle Menendez's, other words 
look nothing like his writing, Lansing said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that if this letter was real, (prosecutors) would have used it 
at the trial," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, however, apparently surfaced too late for prosecutors to attempt 
to introduce it at the trial that ended two weeks ago with jurors split over 
whether Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, should be convicted of murder 
or lesser manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In her Oct. 12 testimony, Baker, who dated Lyle Menendez for three months in 
1988, described an unsettling dinner at the Menendez home. After the food was 
served, she said, the brothers' father, Jose Menendez, stood up and said 
"something to (his wife) like, 'What did you do to this food? Why are you 
serving this food?' "  
</P>
<P>
 She testified that Jose Menendez then took her and his sons to dinner at a 
Hamburger Hamlet restaurant. "I found him to be a very charming man," Baker 
said of Jose Menendez.  
</P>
<P>
 The purported letter from Lyle Menendez -- dated Feb. 5, with no year -- 
contains suggestions about how Baker should testify about such a dinner, and 
says, "We will decide later around what date this incident occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter advises her to make notes, then "throw it away." 
</P>
<P>
 It says the events "may seem strange and irrelevant to my case but I assure 
you they will be very helpful. You'll just have to trust me on it. Later on I 
can explain why but for now I'll just lay them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it says the date of the dinner would be decided later, the letter 
says "it was a weekend," and "you and I had spent the day together. Mrs. 
Menendez had cooked dinner and it was served in the dining room. Everyone was 
seated except Mrs. Menendez. She was still bringing this and that in from the 
kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Vanity Fair, the letter goes on to tell Baker how Jose Menendez 
asked his wife "in a stern voice" if she had done something to the food. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also describes their departure for the Hamburger Hamlet, and says 
that after returning home, "you and I stayed out front and kissed for a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 "You really don't need to know any more detail than I've provided here," the 
letter says. "It was a long time ago. It would be strange if you remember 
things too well." 
</P>
<P>
 At the trial, Baker was called by the defense to bolster the notion that Kitty 
Menendez was an erratic woman who might have been trying to poison her family. 
During his testimony, Erik Menendez said, "I would normally eat the food unless 
I thought there was something wrong with my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors sought to portray the brothers as liars who fabricated the defense 
that they killed out of fear generated by years of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Lyle Menendez admitted that he offered one former 
girlfriend, Jamie Pisarcik, a bribe to testify falsely that Jose Menendez made 
a pass at her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garcetti's spokeswoman characterized the alleged letter to a second 
girlfriend -- Baker -- as "obviously harmful" to the defense, defense attorneys 
did not agree. "I think we need a lot more information before anybody can draw 
any conclusions from it," Lansing said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lansing would not discuss the substance of the letter, she 
acknowledged that if it was authenticated and admitted as evidence the defense 
conceivably could have a simple way of defusing it: by saying that it was 
merely a reminder of real events. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson questioned whether the letter could be evidence. She was quoted in 
the Los Angeles Daily Journal, a legal newspaper, as saying: "If this was 
authenticated or even capable of being authenticated, we would have heard about 
it, which makes me think it's a hoax, a forgery or illegally obtained, in which 
case it's inadmissible in court."

TERROR OF WOUNDED GIRL HEARD ON 911 TAPE; CRIME: 12-YEAR-OLD WAS ABLE TO CALL 
FOR HELP AFTER HER THROAT WAS SLASHED. HER MOTHER, DAUGHTER OF AN EL SEGUNDO 
CITY COUNCILMAN, WAS KILLED.

<P>
 Just as she had been taught, 12-year-old Ashley West called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've been robbed and I have a hole in my neck," she told a 
dispatcher, according to a dramatic tape of the frantic telephone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 12 years old," she said softly, her voice trembling. "My mom . . . she 
has blood all over her." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley, whose throat had been slashed as she slept, survived and was released 
Thursday from UCLA Medical Center. But her mother, Tairree Lynne West, 25, the 
daughter of El Segundo Councilman Alan West, died in the savage attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Tairree West's 6-month-old daughter, Carlie, was gagged by the attackers and 
left on a living room couch, police said. The officers said the infant, who 
apparently was not seriously injured, is being cared for by relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Tairree West was remembered Thursday as a generous young woman who adopted 
Ashley, her best friend's orphaned child, and who opened her El Segundo home to 
a homeless woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeless woman, Erica Olsen, 20, and Olsen's boyfriend, Robert Brendan 
Foster, 18, were arrested a few hours after the attack when they drove up to 
the Hollywood YMCA in Tairree West's car. Marcus Brewington, 19, and Linette 
Blocker, 18, were arrested early Thursday after extensive questioning by El 
Segundo detectives. All four were booked on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A bloody, eight-inch knife was found at the scene, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blade was in between the box spring and the mattress in Ashley's bedroom 
and the handle of the knife was found in Tairree's room," said Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier. "So they actually tried to conceal 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo police said they received a call about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday and 
heard the terrified voice of a whimpering child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been . . . been killed . . . I think I've been robbed and I have a hole 
in my neck and I'm 12 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're 12 years old?" a male dispatcher asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah. And see, my mom . . . she has blood all over." 
</P>
<P>
 A woman dispatcher broke in, speaking in gentle, reassuring tones. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, honey?" the woman asked. "How did you get the hole? Did somebody stab you 
or shoot you? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea. . . . My mom has blood all over her leg. And I remember 
somebody hurting me. . . . It hurts really bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman dispatcher quickly verified the child's address and phone number and 
told her that help was on the way. Then she asked Ashley if her mother was 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," the girl answered. "I'm scared to look. . . . And my baby 
sister, I don't know where she is, if she's OK. Where are you? Hurry!" 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," the dispatcher said, asking Ashley a moment later if she knew what had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just, I remember somebody choking me," Ashley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know who it was? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling it's Robert, this person my mom knows. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 A moment later, Ashley said she thought she was about to faint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hang on," the dispatcher said. "Can you do me a favor, sweetie? 
</P>
<P>
 "What?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this is really hard, but can you go check your mom? . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "No. I can't," the girl said, beginning to sob. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're gonna be all right," the dispatcher said. "I'm here with you, all 
right?" 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," Ashley said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few seconds later, the girl could be heard breathing heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatcher talked to her reassuringly, suggesting that she find a clean 
towel and hold it to her wound, which Ashley did. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK. Press on it," the dispatcher said. "And just keep it there." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a minute later, police arrived and a man's voice could be heard in 
the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is anybody else here?" the man asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley began to sob hysterically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is my mama, my mama . . . is she OK?" the girl asked him. "Is she OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they found Tairree West lying in a pool of blood in the ransacked 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tairree West was taken to Robert F. Kennedy Hospital, where she was pronounced 
dead about an hour later. Officials said that in addition to having slash 
wounds across her upper body, she apparently had been strangled. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley, a sixth-grader at El Segundo Middle School, was taken to the hospital 
with a nine-inch gash from the top of her cheek to the middle of her throat. 
Police believe that the attackers had left her for dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said robbery was one apparent motive for the crime, and a 
simmering dispute over Foster's spending the night at the West apartment was 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. West did not want Robert around. She did not like him," Ducoulombier 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently Robert was very upset about that, so they had been having an 
ongoing dispute about him being around," the deputy said. "He didn't like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the four suspects will be formally charged when they appear in 
Inglewood Municipal Court on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Olsen had been living at Tairree West's house in exchange for child care, 
investigators said. They said Foster and Brewington fit the description of men 
thought to be in the house at the time of the attack. The officers did not say 
how Blocker was connected to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman West said his daughter had been trying to help Olsen -- a recent 
dropout from El Segundo High School -- "get back on her feet." 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter was generous, he said, "sometimes to a fault." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was too gentle and too trusting of everyone," Alan West said. "She saw 
people down and out and she felt a strong need to help them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley and Carlie are now staying with the councilman and his wife, Alene. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her wounds, Ashley is "doing really well," according to Steve West, 
Tairree's brother. "She's talking and walking around and eating ice cream."  
</P>
<P>
 The girl's friends at El Segundo Middle School have been undergoing special 
counseling since the attack, school officials said.

QUAKE CLAIMS RICHTER MEMENTOES; DAMAGE: PERSONAL POSSESSIONS OF THE CO-INVENTOR 
OF THE SEISMIC SCALE WERE BURNED IN A FIRE STARTED AFTER TEMBLOR HIT HIS 
NEPHEW'S HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Charles F. Richter, whose name was once synonymous with Southern California 
earthquakes, was one of the victims of the Northridge quake, eight years after 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
 A fire triggered by the earthquake burned down a Granada Hills home where 
hundreds of Richter's personal belongings were stored, including books, home 
movies and diaries kept by the co-inventor of the earthquake measuring system. 
</P>
<P>
 The home -- which belonged to Richter's nephew, Bruce Walport -- was destroyed 
minutes after the Jan. 17 quake when the house next door caught fire and the 
flames quickly spread, sending Walport, his wife and 10-year-old son fleeing 
into the street. Although Richter's scientific legacy went to Caltech, the 
61-year-old Walport had inherited many of his uncle's personal possessions 
after Richter's death in September, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's devastating," said Walport, a retired heavy equipment operator who 
watched his home -- and the inheritance -- burn. "I just feel terrible that we 
lost all his stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Richter, along with Caltech colleague Beno Gutenberg, devised a standardized 
system for measuring earthquake magnitude in the early 1930s. In the years that 
followed, Richter catalogued the temblors that struck Southern California, 
creating an important foundation for modern seismic studies, though the famous 
Richter scale is no longer used in most current news reports of earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Richter donated more than 30 boxes of his scientific materials to Caltech, 
including lecture notes, manuscripts, letters, as well as his own poetry and 
prose. Caltech archivist Judy Goodstein said enough material remains to write a 
biography of Richter, who earned his Ph.D. in theoretical physics there in 1928 
and remained on the faculty for his entire career. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was obsessed by earthquakes -- he kept a seismograph in the living 
room of his Altadena home -- Richter had a range of other interests, reflected 
in the book collection inherited by his nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all that remains are the one-half-inch thick bolts that secured the 
floor-to-ceiling bookcases that once housed Richter's leather-bound volumes of 
art, botany, philosophy, poetry and science. Each had been marked in Richter's 
messy but legible scrawl, "C.F. Richter," Walport said. Lost with them was 
Richter's stamp collection, which he had started as a boy, his nephew said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walport said that as a child he was regular guest at his aunt and uncle's 
home, where the books were a prominent feature, filling every wall that did not 
have a window or a door, Walport said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I perused through some of the books but I never really read them; they were 
way over my head," said Walport, who graduated from Van Nuys High School but 
did not attend college. 
</P>
<P>
 Walport had also kept Richter's custom-built cherrywood desk. After it was 
delivered, he discovered it contained two volumes of Richter's diaries, 
spanning the 1920s to the mid-1950s. Walport said one entry was an account of 
Richter's meeting physicist Albert Einstein, who visited Caltech three times in 
the early 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, then the rain, turned the diaries and other books to dust and mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Also lost were about 3,000 feet of home movies that included footage of 
Richter and his wife, Lillian, hiking in the nude. "They were nudists and 
especially liked to walk naked," Walport said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richter was an avid backpacker who spent vacations in California's Sierra 
Nevada. On weekends, the Richters often took Walport and his sister for walks 
through Huntington Gardens in San Marino and nearby Descanso Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the time they spent together, not much of Richter's interest in 
science rubbed off, Walport said. Richter could always beat him in checkers, 
"but I could beat him arm-wrestling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Richter measured the movements of the earth, Walport has spent much of 
his life moving it -- operating earthmovers, including the monstrous, 
two-engined 657 Caterpillar Scraper: "He always told me to study hard but I was 
cut from a different mold." 
</P>
<P>
 He nonetheless stayed close to his uncle -- who was related by marriage -- 
even though Richter sometimes grew annoyed with Walport's children, whose 
rambunctious play would disrupt his living room seismograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Those and other memories make the loss of his effects especially sad, said 
Walport, who has rented a house in Panorama City while deciding whether to 
rebuild on his property. On Thursday, he surveyed the ruins with his insurance 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his home policy covers replacement of his house after the fire, 
Walport said he was uncertain whether he can collect anything for the loss of 
his uncle's collection because he never had it appraised. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always been prepared for an earthquake because of him," Walport said. 
"We had water and food, a trailer out back we could have stayed in. I've had 
earthquake insurance for years. But we didn't expect a fire to burn it all 
down."

CONFERENCE ORGANIZERS DRAW IRE OF CONSERVATIVE CATHOLICS; RELIGION: TWO ARE 
URGED TO QUIT AFTER FLAP ABOUT SPEAKER WHO BACKS ABORTION RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A simmering controversy erupted Thursday over the orthodoxy of speakers at a 
major Roman Catholic religious education congress in Anaheim next week, with 
demands from conservative Catholics for the resignations of a leading nun and 
the congress coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The demands followed an unusual public disclosure last week by Cardinal Roger 
M. Mahony that he had revoked an invitation to an abortion rights advocate who 
had been scheduled to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony's announcement and the resignation demands were the latest developments 
in a dispute over speakers at the nation's largest Catholic religious education 
congress. The meeting typically attracts more than 20,000 participants and is 
sponsored by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A small group of Catholics in Camarillo called the California Coalition of 
Concerned Catholics charged that the Los Angeles Archdiocese Office of 
Religious Education, which planned the education congress, has been "in the 
hands of dissenters." 
</P>
<P>
 They called for the resignations of Sister Edith Prendergast as the 
archdiocesean director of religious education, and of conference coordinator 
Adrian Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're demanding complete and immediate reform of the Religious Education 
Office," said Adria Laubacher of the coalition. "Sister Edith Prendergast and 
Adrian Whitaker must go." 
</P>
<P>
 Prendergast, director of the congress, and Whitaker declined to comment, but 
there was a sharp response from Father Gregory Coiro, the archdiocesan 
spokesman. Coiro said those calling for the resignations represent a very small 
but vocal minority of Catholics: "What they're doing by calling for the 
resignations of Sister Edith and Adrian Whitaker is just trying to impose their 
narrow-minded vision on others." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Mahony announced in the Feb. 6 issue of Tidings, the archdiocesan 
newspaper, that he had revoked a speaking invitation to Daniel Maguire of 
Marquette University, a former priest and an abortion rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not abide the presence of any speaker at our congress who teaches 
anything contrary to the full teachings of our Catholic Church," the cardinal 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony's office said Thursday that he withdrew Maguire's invitation in early 
November, before the controversy became public. 
</P>
<P>
 Maguire was one of several speakers who drew howls of protest from the editor 
of a national Catholic weekly newspaper, the Wanderer, and a little-known 
Tustin-based group called Catholics United for the Splendor of Truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanderer Editor Al Matt wrote two months ago that it was "mind-boggling" that 
the congress would welcome "this rogues' gallery of heresiarchs, apostates, 
schismatics, dissenters and New Agers" in light of last year's papal encyclical 
"Veritatis Splendor," in which Pope John Paul II exhorted bishops to uphold 
orthodox Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heat finally got to him," Matt said this week when told of the cardinal's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Maguire said in an interview that he has advocated abortion rights for years, 
"although only 3% of my published work concerns abortion." His scheduled 
workshops were on unrelated topics -- "The Moral Code of Judaism and 
Christianity" and "The Primacy of Joy." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't hold the line on the key issue (of abortion) -- what I call 
pelvic orthodoxy -- then you are not allowed to talk about anything else," 
Maguire said.  
</P>
<P>
 Coiro said that the Marquette professor's links to abortion rights groups such 
as Planned Parenthood and Catholics for a Free Choice made him an unacceptable 
speaker, even if critics of the congress had not raised the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony, chairman of the Pro-Life Activities Committee of the National 
Conference of Catholic Bishops, also dispatched letters to all other speakers 
insisting that their presentations be "in full harmony with the church's 
teachings." Mahony also telephoned another speaker, Father Michael Crosby of 
Milwaukee, seeking similar assurances. 
</P>
<P>
 An article in the Wanderer accused Crosby of comparing the Catholic hierarchy 
to the abusive parent in a dysfunctional family. Crosby wrote that the church 
is suffering the "disease of clerical and papal addiction," the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really respected him for calling me," Crosby said Thursday. "We had a good 
talk. He's getting a lot of flak." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony said that he was putting safeguards in place to ensure that speakers at 
all future conferences "meet the highest standards of orthodoxy."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; CHARGES 
AGAINST FUNERAL HOME OWNERS REINSTATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly three dozen criminal charges, dismissed five years ago in the trial of 
Lamb Funeral Home owners David, Laurieanne and Jerry Sconce have been 
reinstated by an appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision this week by the 2nd District Court of Appeal means that the 
Sconces, still awaiting trial on other criminal charges, could be tried on 34 
additional charges.They include unauthorized removal of body parts, 
falsification of death certificates, mutilation of human remains, conspiracy to 
obstruct justice and bribery. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges arose in 1987 after the Sconces were accused of illegal mass 
cremations and co-mingling of ashes. In 1988, Pasadena Superior Court Judge 
Terry Smerling dismissed more than half of the 67 charges. In reversing the 
dismissal, the appeals court indicated that Smerling overstepped his judicial 
authority by reviewing the factual basis for the charges instead of limiting 
his review to legal issues, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Dirk Hudson, who handled 
the county's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court ruling becomes final in 60 days, but the Sconces' attorneys 
can file an appeal to the state Supreme Court. However, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Robert Nishinaka said that the ruling leaves little room for an appeal. 
Attorneys for the Sconces either declined to comment or could not be reached.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; AIDS 
PATIENT SUES COUNTY, CITING MISTREATMENT IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Long Beach man with AIDS has filed a federal lawsuit against Los Angeles 
County and the Sheriff's Department, charging that he was denied crucial 
medication during a stint in County Jail facilities last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists and attorneys for Michael W. Kolcum, 38, maintain that the case 
represents a pattern of mistreatment of people with AIDS and HIV in the County 
Jail system."This is a concrete example of outrageous conduct on the part of 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department," said Lorri L. Jean, executive 
director of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, which 
demanded an investigation into the treatment of people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sheriff's Department spokeswoman declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolcum, who was in County Jail for about nine days in February, 1993, on a 
drunk driving charge, says county workers repeatedly ignored his requests for 
AZT and made disparaging comments about his homosexuality. He received only one 
AZT tablet during that time, when he should have received 54 tablets, according 
to the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE FOR 2 HOSPITALS TO BE NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two San Fernando Valley hospitals will soon be under the direction of a 
federal bankruptcy trustee, ending an increasingly acrimonious standoff between 
the hospitals' owner, Triad Healthcare, and Triad's largest creditor, the state 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Arthur M. Greenwald of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles on 
Monday ordered the appointment of a trustee after lawyers for Triad and the 
state agreed that they could not work out their differences.Greenwald also 
ordered that Alpha Partners, a management company at the center of the dispute, 
remain in charge of the hospitals until the trustee has a chance to review the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad owns Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center in Sherman Oaks and West 
Valley Hospital and Health Center in Canoga Park. The company filed for 
bankruptcy last week, listing, among other reasons, its desire to fire Alpha. 
The previous week, lawyers for the state had obtained a temporary restraining 
order from Superior Court barring Triad from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 The court actions follow Triad's default last summer on a $167-million loan 
insured by the state's Cal-Mortgage program. The default has forced state 
officials to halt issuance of loan guarantees.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
CONTRACT AWARDED FOR REBUILDING SIMI FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caltrans officials awarded a $9.7-million contract to a Fontana construction 
company Thursday to rebuild the eastbound quake-damaged portions of the Simi 
Valley Freeway in the north San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Brutoco Engineering and Construction is expected to reconstruct the underpass 
and the Bull Creek Canyon bridge on the freeway within 100 days.To meet the 
deadline, Caltrans officials say, crews will work 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 A bonus of $50,000 a day will be given to the construction company for work 
finished ahead of the deadline. If the deadline is not met, the contractor will 
be penalized $50,000 for each late day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the urgent need to put Los Angeles and its transportation system 
back on its feet, we expect to have this key project completed within 100 
days," Caltrans Director James W. van Loben Sels said. 
</P>
<P>
 The westbound lanes of the freeway will opened first, using the existing 
structure, which is being shored up. Once repaired, this will hold three lanes 
of traffic in each direction -- two mixed-flow lanes and one car-pool lane.

FATHER SUES OVER STORE'S DRESSING ROOM POLICY; LITIGATION: HE ALLEGES SEXUAL 
DISCRIMINATION AFTER BEING TOLD HE COULD NOT DRESS HIS DAUGHTER, 3, IN THE 
GIRLS FITTING ROOM. A SPOKESWOMAN SAYS MERVYN'S HAS NO OFFICIAL STAND ON THE 
MATTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three-year-old Katie Bernal was about to try on what her father describes as a 
winter ensemble -- long pants, a cute top and snuggly sweater -- when the door 
to the girls fitting room suddenly swung open. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must get out," Raymond Bernal says the clerk at the Mervyn's department 
store in Montebello ordered. "No fathers are allowed in here." 
</P>
<P>
 Katie began to cry and, her father says, asked, "Why are they kicking me out, 
Daddy?" Bernal was at a loss to explain, he says, especially after the clerk 
allowed him to dress Katie in one of the boys fitting rooms, where, he noticed, 
a mother was helping her son with his clothes in a neighboring cubicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I explain sexual discrimination to my child?" Bernal asked Thursday 
after filing a lawsuit against Mervyn's asking that fathers be allowed in girls 
fitting rooms. "I want Mervyn's to know that I am proud of being a father and 
not ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone calls to the Montebello store were referred to Mervyn's corporate 
offices in Hayward, Calif., where a company spokeswoman said she was not 
authorized to comment because of the litigation. Spokeswoman Kathy Blackburn 
said, however, that the 279-store company does not have an official policy on 
who is allowed in fitting rooms. "We do everything we can to serve our 
customers," Blackburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernal disputes the claim, saying he was told by managers at the Montebello 
store that they were following corporate policy allowing mothers in boys 
fitting rooms but banning fathers from girls fitting rooms. He said the company 
never offered an explanation for the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernal, 30, of South Gate, made his pronouncements during a news conference in 
the Wilshire Boulevard office of his attorney, Gloria Allred. Allred said 
Bernal was acting on behalf of the many young fathers "who do not want to be 
just weekend Disneyland dads, but who instead commit themselves to taking real 
responsibility in the lives of their children." 
</P>
<P>
 How dressing Katie in the girls fitting room rather than the boys fitting room 
establishes such a standard was not clearly explained. Bernal said he didn't 
mind using the boys fitting room, and despite the dispute with the clerk, spent 
about $120 on clothing for Katie that day last November. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernal said he filed the lawsuit as a matter of principle. A single parent 
with joint custody of Katie (he has been separated from his wife for two 
years), Bernal said he resented being treated differently than mothers, who he 
said would never raise the watchful eye of a department store clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am one of those fathers that knows what size socks my daughter wears, what 
dress size she is and how to do her hair," said Bernal, who works for UPS 
Airlines at Ontario Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the restriction might be justified if other customers felt 
uncomfortable with a man in the girls fitting rooms, Allred said such fears 
would not be enough to deny Bernal's rights as a father, particularly because 
each fitting room at Mervyn's has a door that can be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The argument (of privacy) falls where there are individual dressing rooms," 
Allred said. "There may be an underlying assumption that somehow fathers may be 
there to molest little girls. That is a very pernicious and unwarranted 
assumption." 
</P>
<P>
 Allred, who is host of a radio talk show and is also a television commentator, 
has gained widespread attention for building public spectacles around such 
apparent double standards. As in cases past, she attracted a slew of reporters 
and camera operators to the news conference, which featured Bernal holding his 
beaming daughter. The young father received two offers to appear on radio and 
television talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time for her part, however, the ponytailed Katie proved less than 
a star witness. She pulled on her father's ear, played with a stuffed animal 
and ultimately refused to tell her side of the story, despite coaching by 
Allred and leading questions from a baby-talking television cameraman. 
</P>
<P>
 "How did you feel when they kicked you out, were you happy or sad?" Allred 
asked Katie as the cameras rolled. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Katie said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sad?" asked Allred. 
</P>
<P>
 "No." 
</P>
<P>
 "Happy?" Allred continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes." 
</P>
<P>

'MUSHROOMED' BULLET FOCUS OF INVESTIGATION OF FATAL SHOOTING; VIOLENCE: SOURCES 
DENY REPORT THAT FOUR SLUGS WERE FOUND BENEATH THE BODY OF A WOMAN KILLED BY 
POLICE ON HOSPITAL ROOFTOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Investigators probing the fatal shooting by police of a woman on a hospital 
rooftop are focusing on at least one bullet that "mushroomed" inside the 
woman's body, a phenomenon that can indicate a person was shot while lying 
down, but also can be caused by other conditions, sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those same sources, however, vehemently denied a report in Wednesday's San 
Gabriel Valley Tribune, which stated that four slugs were found on the ground 
beneath the body of the woman, Sonji Danese Taylor, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 If that were true, it would strongly suggest that Taylor was shot while lying 
on the ground, but several sources familiar with the investigation said the 
newspaper report was incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there when they rolled the body over," said one source involved in the 
investigation. "There were no slugs found beneath her." 
</P>
<P>
 That account was confirmed by officials from two different agencies examining 
the Taylor shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht, a renowned medical examiner from Pittsburgh, 
was quoted by the San Gabriel paper as saying that the shooting sounded "savage 
and barbaric" and that finding four bullets beneath the body would strongly 
suggest that Taylor was lying down when the officers fired those shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday, Wecht stressed that he had only made those comments based on 
information supplied to him by the San Gabriel paper, not on official 
investigative documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual coroner's report, Wecht said, contained no information indicating 
that Taylor was shot while lying down. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the trajectories and the reports, I could not say whether she was 
standing, falling down, kneeling or anything else," Wecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor received 10 gunshot wounds in the Dec. 16 shooting, seven of them in 
the back. That fact has sparked the interest of at least three investigative 
agencies -- the LAPD, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the 
FBI. None of the investigations are complete, but the district attorney already 
has convened a grand jury, which has taken sworn testimony from five police 
officers and several other witnesses to the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 As they probe the circumstances of Taylor's death, investigators are focusing 
on one bullet that "mushroomed" inside her body and another that may have, 
sources said. A bullet generally mushrooms, or flattens out, when it hits a 
hard object as it is slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 One explanation for the bullets mushrooming could be that Taylor was on the 
ground when those shots struck her in the back of the shoulder, investigators 
said. But another explanation could be that the bullets struck bones -- most 
likely either in her shoulder or rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., the lawyer for Taylor's family, has not suggested that 
Taylor was shot while lying down, but he has said that at least one witness to 
the shooting will cast doubt on the Police Department's contention that Taylor 
lunged toward the officers.

VAN, INMATE BUS COLLIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department bus carrying jail inmates collided 
Thursday with a van, causing minor injuries to 40 prisoners and to five 
passengers in the other vehicle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wells, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman, said the accident occurred 
about 6:30 p.m. near Florence and Dalton avenues. Wells said the cause was 
unclear and under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said the van passengers were taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew 
Medical Center and to St. Francis Medical Center. The inmates, who mostly 
complained of neck and back pain, were taken to the Men's Central Jail, which 
was deemed a more secure location for treatment of their injuries, he said.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: FUNDS FOR LANDSCAPING LOOKED BETTER TO HAYDEN BEFORE QUAKE

 A CASE OF AMNESIA? In the weeks before state Sen. Tom Hayden was struck by a 
bolt of lightning and suddenly decided to run for governor, he busied himself 
and his staff by blowing the whistle on California's lack of earthquake 
preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 In news releases dramatically billed as "Faultline -- a series of earthquake 
investigative reports," Hayden staffers aired evidence that California is 
ill-equipped to weather big-time temblors such as the one that struck the San 
Fernando Valley last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulletin: Beverly Hills and Santa Monica are among the slowest cities to 
comply with a 1986 earthquake retrofitting law. Bulletin: California's state 
universities dedicate only meager sums to shore up buildings. Bulletin: 
Caltrans spends more on freeway landscaping than on seismic safety. 
</P>
<P>
 On the latter point, an outraged Hayden declared that "the state spent about 
$220 million on landscaping over the four years since the devastating Loma 
Prieta earthquake. Amazingly, during that same time frame, Caltrans spent only 
$175 million on making state highways safer from earthquake damage." 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. Back up a minute to Dec. 2, 1993. On that day, Hayden was on the 
other side of the fence. In a letter to Franklin E. White, the head of Los 
Angeles' Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Hayden spoke out in favor of a 
Caltrans plan to landscape a portion of the Ventura Freeway in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The landscaping project will greatly enhance the natural scenic views of this 
region which will be enjoyed by millions of travelers using the Ventura 
Freeway," Hayden wrote. "We wholeheartedly support the City's Freeway 
Landscaping project and urge the California Transportation Commission to 
approve the funding necessary to carry out the project." 
</P>
<P>
 The request apparently forgotten, the Santa Monica Democrat even brought up 
the issue Wednesday in his gubernatorial statement, again hammering away at 
Caltrans for spending more on landscaping than on seismic retrofits. 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesia, maybe? 
</P>
<P>

 IN A VACUUM: Although nearly half of the 41st Assembly District's electorate 
lives in the San Fernando Valley, no Valley champion has surfaced yet among the 
political wanna-bes looking to succeed state Assemblyman Terry Friedman 
(D-Brentwood) as he retires to seek a Superior Court judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, all the 41st District suitors hail from the Westside-Santa Monica end 
of Friedman's mountain-straddling bailiwick. 
</P>
<P>
 "It infuriates me that all the candidates are from the Westside," former Los 
Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus said this week. "This happens time and time 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 But the affront to her Valley sensibilities was not sufficient to goad Picus 
into running for the Friedman seat herself. "It makes me mad, but not enough to 
run," said Picus, who represented the West Valley for 16 years and made it her 
forte to complain about the Valley's disenfranchisement at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe what's needed, Picus ventured, is for a Valley civic group to begin 
grooming home-grown talent for public office. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, former Los Angeles school board member Roberta Weintraub added her 
name to the list of Valley residents with political experience who are not 
running for the 41st District seat. Weintraub said her own life was turned 
upside down by the recent earthquake -- which virtually totaled her Sherman 
Oaks home. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Thursday morning, the candidates for the Friedman seat -- all Westsiders 
-- were attorney Bill Rothbard of Pacific Palisades, a close friend of 
Friedman; attorney Roger Diamond, a homeowner activist in the 1980s campaign to 
block oil drilling in the Pacific Palisades; Santa Monica resident Sheila James 
Kuehl, attorney for the Southern California Women's Law Center who played the 
hapless Zelda in the 1960s sitcom "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis," and 
attorney Edward Z. Tabash of Malibu, a leading spokesman for the California 
Abortion Rights Action League. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CLOTHES HORSE: So what did the 1993-94 California Political Almanac, a 
production of the Sacramento Bee, have to say about state Sen. Herschel 
Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), who is now seeking the seat held by state Sen. David 
A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys)? 
</P>
<P>
 "Rosenthal is a horse racing fanatic who owns all or part of several horses. 
He even dresses like a racetrack tout in mismatched slacks and plaid jackets 
that look as though a horse once wore them." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Rosenthal said it has been years since he has owned any 
racehorses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FUNNY MAN: Attorney Bob Hertzberg, a close political associate of Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Gloria Molina and a leading light in Jewish community 
affairs, has pulled the plug on his candidacy for either the seat held by state 
Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-North Hollywood) or the one held by Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertzberg caused a bit of a stir during his brief, abortive political career. 
It started with a boasting Hertzberg flashing his $100,000 campaign fund 
around, telling three other candidates who also were eyeing the same seats that 
he had more political bucks and chits to call on than they did. "He was trying 
to intimidate," said one of those who was approached. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertzberg capped this performance by telling Los Angeles school board member 
Julie Korenstein, one of the other political hopefuls, that they were both so 
well qualified they really should flip a coin to decide who should run. 
According to her political consultants, a dumbfounded Korenstein declined the 
proposal. Hertzberg said later that he was not trying to intimidate anyone and 
as for the coin-toss -- "I was just joking." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 DISASTER EXPERT: U.S. Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon, whose district suffered 
the brunt of the earthquake damage, has been named to a bipartisan 
congressional task force on natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel will examine the federal response to such calamities and study 
alternate ways of paying for billions of dollars in emergency aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "California has seen its share of natural disasters in the last year and can 
better gauge the effectiveness of the federal emergency response system," said 
McKeon, a Republican from Santa Clarita. "There are many areas where we can 
improve." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 MAN WITHOUT A STAFF: Retired city firefighter Don Wallace will have to 
overcome a new obstacle in his bid to replace retiring county Supervisor Ed 
Edelman. Last week, Wallace learned that his opponent, Los Angeles City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, had amassed $700,000 to win the seat -- 70 times 
more than Wallace. With only $10,000 in his campaign coffers, Wallace said this 
week that he was been forced to lay off political consultant Kevin Harrop 
because he cannot afford another $30,000 to retain Harrop through the June 7 
primary. Wallace said he will run his own campaign and rely on volunteers to 
help him canvass the 3rd District, which includes Hollywood and portions of 
West Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley.

GUN CHARGES AGAINST PAIR ROCK LAPD; LAW ENFORCEMENT: OFFICERS ACCUSED OF FIRING 
ON PATROLMAN ARE FREED ON BAIL. THE CHIEF CALLS ALLEGED ACTIONS 'HEINOUS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two police officers accused of firing at a California Highway Patrol officer 
during an off-duty shooting rampage bailed out of jail early Thursday as their 
superiors grappled with the possible long-term fallout for the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "These men are charged with some of the most heinous criminal actions I have 
ever heard," Police Chief Willie L. Williams said at a news conference carried 
live by local television stations. The chief said the LAPD is cooperating 
"110%" with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigation of the 
shooting, which occurred in sheriff's territory near the Harbor Freeway in the 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams took pains to distance the rest of the department from the 
embarrassing spectacle. Mentioning two earlier public relations disasters -- 
the police beating of Rodney G. King and the department's response to the 1992 
riots -- Williams said: "It is time to stop painting this organization with 
that broad brush. . . . Let's take this incident as it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan, commenting briefly on the incident at an unrelated news 
conference, said: "As reported, it's reprehensible behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 As authorities sifted through the evidence in the case, they concluded that 
the officers did not, as originally suspected, fire at a Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority bus. Nevertheless, both officers, Michael V. Herrera 
and Ted S. Teyechea, were arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon 
on a peace officer, a charge that could carry a prison sentence and almost 
certainly will end their law enforcement careers if they are found responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're history," one police source said. "They might as well just resign and 
get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Sheriff's Department has yet to release official information 
regarding the officers' blood-alcohol level, sources say one officer refused to 
be tested and the other recorded a level of 0.14%, nearly twice the California 
legal driving limit of 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources said Teyechea fired at least five rounds during the 
shooting rampage, while Herrera fired at least four. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrambling to contain the damage caused by the incident, Los Angeles police 
officers who work with the pair drafted a letter to the Highway Patrol 
expressing regret over the incident and hope that the agencies can continue to 
cooperate. Williams also is writing a letter, which aides said he expects to 
mail today.  
</P>
<P>
 Herrera and Teyechea are LAPD veterans -- Herrera joined the force in 1984, 
Teyechea the next year -- and both worked in the 77th Street area, one of the 
most challenging in the city for a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny L. Staggs, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said 
they have outstanding reputations. Their boss, Capt. Larry R. Goebel, called 
them "hard-working officers who have not had any problems that would in any way 
indicate they would do something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera has never been punished by an LAPD board of rights, the department's 
chief disciplinary body. Teyechea, however, was given a 10-day suspension in 
1989 for striking a prisoner and using improper language. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are "not problem children, but not outstanding, either," one colleague 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Herrera and Teyechea were not at work Thursday, and Goebel said the two would 
be reassigned pending the outcome of the investigation. That reassignment will 
keep them out of the field while the Sheriff's Department conducts its criminal 
investigation and the LAPD pursues administrative charges.  
</P>
<P>
 Herrera and Teyechea were bailed out of jail about 1 a.m. Thursday. But the 
Police Protective League, which generally aids officers, did not post the bond 
or send a lawyer to meet with them.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were on their own," said Staggs, president of the league. "We will give 
them the courtesy of a one-hour legal consultation. That's something we give 
every member. But that's all we'll do." 
</P>
<P>
 David Davies, administrator for the county probation department's pretrial 
services division, said an on-duty bail commissioner approved a late night 
request from the patrolmen to lower their $25,000 bail to $5,000. Thousands of 
suspects ask for similar reductions; about 17% of such requests were granted 
last year.  
</P>
<P>
 After making bail, the two officers returned home, Teyechea to his residence 
in Monterey Park, Herrera to his house in West Covina. Neither could be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The bail reduction prompted some speculation that the officers were receiving 
special treatment, but Williams, in a rare display of anger, vehemently denied 
any such suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no special treatment. I'm the chief of police, take me at my word," 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to colleagues, Herrera and Teyechea went out drinking at the end of 
their shift, which ended Wednesday morning. The two reportedly visited at least 
two bars that are popular with police officers, the Shortstop on Sunset 
Boulevard and the Zebra Room in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until about 2 p.m., about six hours after the two officers had 
gotten off work, that they allegedly fired at a CHP officer who had stopped to 
write a ticket near the 190th Street on-ramp to the northbound Harbor Freeway. 
Authorities would not identify the CHP officer. 
</P>
<P>
 As Herrera and Teyechea passed, the CHP officer allegedly heard shots and 
turned to see the pickup truck. Although sheriff's officials said the CHP 
officer did not see Herrera and Teyechea fire at him, he concluded that they 
had and immediately set off after them on his motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers were arrested a few minutes later after being hung up in traffic 
on Vermont Avenue in Gardena. The arresting officers found two handguns and a 
number of spent shell casings in the truck, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports indicated that the officers also had fired at an MTA bus, but 
investigators now say that does not appear to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the incident rocked police administrators, police union leaders and 
other LAPD supporters -- all of whom had been basking in the accolades that the 
department received for its response to last month's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Most police officials declined to comment about the incident in detail, but 
several said they were concerned about the possible effect it would have on the 
department's standing with the public and with other police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Laura Chick, a member of the council's Public Safety 
Committee, said the incident and its aftermath had created "an exceptionally 
trying time for those of us who care about rebuilding the morale of the Los 
Angeles Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 She added, however: "It is very important that in our rush for quick justice 
in this case, we do not make the entire Los Angeles Police Department the 
suspect or scapegoat. The police cannot operate effectively in any community 
without citizen support."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; DOG GETS LAVISH MEDICAL CARE IN WAKE OF 
EXPLOSION; PETS: BURNED CANINE IS FLOWN TO UC DAVIS FOR DIALYSIS TREATMENT 
AFTER HER KIDNEYS FAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bimbo may be only a construction yard dog, but after her brief period of 
stardom in the Northridge earthquake, she's getting lavish medical treatment 
that a pedigreed show pooch could envy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bimbo was flown by helicopter Thursday from Van Nuys Airport to UC Davis, 
which has the state's only dialysis facilities for dogs. The 2-year-old German 
shepherd was burned over 50% of her body when a broken natural gas main erupted 
in a fireball around her master's truck in Granada Hills in a much-reported 
incident shortly after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 If treatment there is successful, she will be brought to the Sherman Oaks Burn 
Center for skin grafts by Dr. A. Richard Grossman, a top specialist and the 
center's director. Grossman said he will perform the grafts for free, and an 
anonymous donor will cover other expenses, expected to total $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be well beyond the financial reach of Bimbo's master, Jimmy Menzi, 
a Simi Valley mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 "That animal is just as important as anybody else who got hurt in the 
earthquake," said Grossman, who carried the bandage-swathed Bimbo onto the 
helicopter Thursday for the flight to Davis, as Menzi whispered words of 
comfort in her ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can relate to what they are doing to Bimbo," said Menzi, who is undergoing 
skin grafts for burns to 30% of his body, "because that is what they are doing 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman arranged for the flight after Bimbo's kidneys failed because of the 
burns, leaving her with only a 40% chance of survival. 
</P>
<P>
 A KNX radio station helicopter pilot, Bob Tur, offered his services for the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Tur reported to the station's listeners from mid-flight that Bimbo appeared to 
be enjoying the ride and appreciating the scenery below. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jim Walters, a veterinarian who first treated Bimbo, said the special 
attention could save her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, it is cost-prohibitive to treat dogs," said Walters, owner of Blue 
Cross Pet Hospital in North Hollywood. "Most of the cost has to come 
out-of-pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 "I found her at a construction yard," Menzi reminisced. "She kind of adopted 
me. She would commute back and forth with me, like she was going to work 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Grateful for the attention his dog is getting, Menzi made little mention of 
his own problems. "The earthquake came real close to doing me in, literally and 
financially," he said. "I lost my truck and tools (in the fire). But as long as 
she isn't in any pain, I'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 The morning of the quake, Menzi left his home, which was not seriously 
damaged, to check on his mother in Santa Clarita, accompanied by Bimbo and his 
other dog, Shep. As they passed through the area of Balboa Boulevard and 
Rinaldi Street, the gas main exploded under the truck, killing Shep. 
</P>
<P>
 Menzi and Bimbo both eased their burns by leaping into the water spouting from 
a broken hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Menzi, determined to see if his mother was OK, walked another 10 miles before 
his mother spotted him as she drove the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Bimbo, frightened, ran off after the explosion, but was later found by workers 
at a shelter for earthquake victims, who discovered Menzi's phone number on a 
tag around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an amazing dog," Menzi said. "She was tough enough to get out of the 
truck -- she'll get through."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; COMMUNITY FEARS LOSING ITS TORN HEART;

 It wasn't the hilly, tree-lined streets, the handsome two-story homes, or even 
the proximity to vast parkland that attracted William and Laura Adler to their 
quiet Granada Hills neighborhood five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They moved to the area so their children could attend Van Gogh Street 
Elementary School, a quiet, resource-rich campus that some people consider the 
best-kept secret in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Northridge quake tore open hundreds of crisscrossing cracks across 
the playground and through the main hallway of the campus, putting the future 
of the school and the tightknit community in jeopardy. Fearing that the ground 
under the school has become unstable after the Jan. 17 quake, the Los Angeles 
Unified School District is moving the students to nearby Frost Middle School 
until geological studies are completed that will determine whether Van Gogh 
will ever be reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather lose our house than the school," William Adler said. "If we'd lost 
our house, we could have rebuilt it. This is out of our control." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many parents with young children, the Adlers moved to the secluded 
neighborhood -- nestled in Bee Canyon near 714-acre O'Melveny Park at the 
northern edge of the Valley -- so their two daughters could attend Van Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard about it through friends and neighbors," William Adler said. "We 
picked that school and moved across the street from it." 
</P>
<P>
 With its active parent involvement and strong teacher commitment, the 
370-student school is the pride of the neighborhood. Parents boast when they 
talk about it, likening it to a private school in the public school system -- 
the shining star of the district. Principal Maureen Diekmann said the school 
consistently ranks in the top five in the Valley on the state Comprehensive 
Test of Basic Skills. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the recent quake damage at Van Gogh more significant is that 
similar cracks in the ground opened up after the 1971 Sylmar quake. A report by 
the California Division of Mines and Geology suggested that the ground 
displacement then might have been caused by liquefaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquefaction occurs in areas of loosely packed, fine-grain soil that become 
saturated by ground water in an earthquake. Lubricated by the water and hit 
with shock waves, the soil loses its cohesion, and turns into a fluid mass. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge quake, the Los Angeles Unified School District contracted 
with two private geotechnical engineering consulting firms to determine what 
caused the damage at Van Gogh. Law/Crandall Inc. of Los Angeles, after a 
preliminary examination of the ground cracking and a review of reports from the 
1971 quake, said that liquefaction did not occur. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jerry Kovacs and Associates Inc. of Studio City concluded that the school 
"may not be safe during an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 The experts are just beginning fuller investigations of the site, which will 
include mapping the cracks and boring for soil samples and water levels -- all 
important indicators of the soil's propensity to liquefy. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Brown, director of facilities for the district, said that if the new 
studies produce the same results as the preliminary investigations, he will 
hire another firm for a third opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is no common ground, I have to get another study," Brown said. "My 
same standard applies, I won't open it if I wouldn't put my children and 
grandchildren there." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts disagree about the dangers of liquefaction, and whether it is wise to 
occupy buildings on property where it has occurred in past earthquakes. Some 
say not enough is known about the seismic hazard to predict its precise effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1971 Sylmar quake, liquefaction damaged the Lower San Fernando Dam, and 
in 1989, the Marina District of San Francisco was devastated in the Loma Prieta 
earthquake when its solid foundations became fluid. The seismic hazard was 
first documented in Niagata, Japan, in 1964, where it caused buildings to sink 
several feet into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ronald Scott, professor of engineering at Caltech, said finding evidence 
that liquefaction occurred at a site during an earthquake is not necessarily 
cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've looked at a lot of buildings in sites that liquefied very thoroughly," 
Scott said. "What happens to buildings is extensive damage that is not 
necessarily life-threatening." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said homes located on soil that liquefied in a previous earthquake are 
at risk of damage in another one, but "not likely to be sucked into the soil." 
</P>
<P>
 But Edward F. Hill, a geotechnical engineer for Jerry Kovacs and Associates, 
said liquefaction can be very hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 "A house is a different animal than a school building," Hill said. "Houses 
will flex, but school buildings can crack and break." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said the final study will take six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what we've got up there yet," said Hill. "We're just getting 
started." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as neighborhood residents wait for the final analysis, they agonize 
about what impact that closing the school would have on their neighborhood, 
their children and their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim and Sherri Ramirez, who moved to the community from North Hills so their 
second-grade daughter could attend Van Gogh, said the prospect of the school 
closing its doors is frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We moved here specifically because of the school," Jim Ramirez said. "I don't 
know what I'd do if it closed. I'd be extremely upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez added that a decision to close the school might also have long-term, 
negative repercussions in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take the school out of our area, you lessen the value of where we 
live," Ramirez said. "And having the stigma of a school abandoned for 
geological problems. Who's going to want to move into that area?" 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Jones, a real estate broker who has been selling properties in the area 
for 23 years, said the school is a powerful magnet for parents with young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (closure) would destroy the community," Jones said. "But it 
would hurt because that school is a very important part of the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents worry about the potential impact on their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be traumatizing," said Debi Chesler, whose daughter attends fourth 
grade at Van Gogh. Chesler said she felt secure knowing that her daughter, who 
is diabetic, attended a small school where teachers and administrators knew of 
her condition. "Having her transferred to a larger school would be traumatic 
for all of us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For many residents, the possibility that liquefaction -- something most people 
know little about -- may have occurred in their neighborhood is equally 
unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are saying the ground at the school is unstable, what does that say 
for our homes?" said Peggie Needleman, who has an 8-year-old daughter at the 
school. "If you went to buy a house, are you really gonna buy a house across 
from the school? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Because so many factors -- including proximity to the epicenter, soil 
compaction, ground-water levels and underlying fault lines -- determine the 
damage caused by an earthquake, some experts say predicting whether one area 
will fare better than another is a shaky science at best. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the Southern California region is concerned, the hazards are the 
same everywhere," said Prof. Scott of Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, you'd be better off in Wisconsin."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; COLLEGE CHIEF'S CRITICS VOTE NO CONFIDENCE; 
EDUCATION: TEACHERS, STUDENTS UPSET AT PRESIDENT FOR OPENING VAN NUYS CAMPUS 
TWO DAYS AFTER QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Angered by a decision to reopen their campus just two days after the 
Northridge earthquake, Valley College faculty members agreed overwhelmingly to 
a vote of "no confidence" in the leadership of President Mary E. Lee, a faculty 
spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the only educational institution to open in the entire San Fernando 
Valley -- the only one," said faculty President Jack Sterk, a professor of 
speech communication and broadcasting. "If the argument is a return to 
normalcy, there is nothing normal about the worst natural disaster in the 
history of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 All but two of more than 90 faculty members at a meeting Wednesday voted to 
denounce Lee's decision to reopen the campus for the beginning of the spring 
semester two days after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Student Union also voted 16 to 1 in favor of the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the nine campuses in the Los Angeles Community College District 
resumed classes on time, but the reopening of the other two Valley campuses -- 
Pierce and Mission colleges -- were delayed until the week following the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee stood by her decision to begin classes according to the regular schedule 
of the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think legally I had a reason for not opening," she said. "We examined 
the buildings and determined they were structurally sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said she and plant facilities workers surveyed the campus for structural 
damage the day after the quake. Staff and faculty worked for hours to clean up 
classrooms, put offices in order and restock materials in the bookstore to open 
the campus on time. Phone systems were not functioning properly, but 
administrators relied on the news media and department chairmen to relay the 
message that the campus would reopen on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Education is not an optional thing," she said. "If your plant is safe, you 
open." 
</P>
<P>
 Sterk said faculty members were disturbed by what they interpreted as a lack 
of empathy for students, staff and instructors. In addition, he said, the lack 
of faculty and staff consultation in the decision was bothersome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where was shared governance?" Sterk said. "There were hundreds of students, 
faculty and staff who could not come in because their homes were in disarray, 
but Lee made the decision to open it herself after walking around the campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Early next week, the College Senate plans to present a list of demands to Lee 
related to the reopening, including that she agree to develop a plan for shared 
decision-making in future emergency situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very easy to second-guess when you don't have the responsibility," Lee 
said. "This is not a shared governance issue. . . . The decision was made by 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 For Donald Hayes, an associate professor of theater arts who lost his home and 
belongings when his Granada Hills townhouse was destroyed in the quake, the 
speedy reopening was an insult. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life was in total turmoil," said Hayes, who spent two nights sleeping in 
his car in the college parking lot after the quake. "They should have waited 
and opened a week or so later." 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty members estimated that only about 20% to 30% of their students showed 
up for classes two days after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of students on campus felt the school should have been closed," 
said Donald Graham, student body president. "People had to take care of their 
families, night classes were in violation of the curfew, and many people were 
still really shaken up."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; INVASION OF SKUNKS IRKS NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the last year, dozens of skunks have invaded a Studio City neighborhood, 
causing more than just a stench in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood joke has turned into an all out war against the 
black-and-white critters, with residents calling in a specialist to stop the 
migration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have a skunk burial ground or something," joked resident Bob Feiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or they just love the neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The brazen skunks have in the last year entered houses on Laurel Terrace and 
Viewcrest Road, crawling through doggie doors, eating pet food and basically 
stinking things up. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really stink," Feiles said. "You can tell for blocks that there is a 
skunk in here." 
</P>
<P>
 Les Mitchell, deputy director of Los Angeles County Animal Care and Control, 
said pet food left outside one or more houses might have attracted the skunks 
initially. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very inquisitive. It is easier for them to come into a house and eat 
the cat food than get their own food," Mitchell said.  
</P>
<P>
 Securing pet doors, he said, might help keep them out. 
</P>
<P>
 That tactic hasn't worked for Ron Oberman, who lives next door to Feiles.  
</P>
<P>
 Oberman has trapped numerous skunks in his home. "Several times, I have closed 
off the cat door, and they literally start banging on it," Oberman said.  
</P>
<P>
 "And you can't disturb them because they might spray you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The skunks usually enter the homes at night, Oberman said.  
</P>
<P>
 One evening, while relaxing in his den, Oberman said he heard chewing sounds 
and "looked around and saw this huge skunk eating the cat's food.  
</P>
<P>
 "He just looked at me and kept eating," Oberman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The skunks first appeared last February, then resurfaced in July and again in 
November.  
</P>
<P>
 Feiles hired a specialist who has caught 25 of the skunks in the last year, at 
a cost of $400. 
</P>
<P>
 "They live in a bad area," said John Gloske of Harns Termite and Pest Control 
in Reseda. "It is so unusual. I have seen skunks (in the Valley) before but 
never like that.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like (the skunks) are picking on this poor guy's home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a skunk enters a structure, Gloske explained, its scent stays and 
attracts other skunks. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as four skunks at a time lived under Feiles' house. "You would get rid 
of them and others would come right back," Gloske said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the winter months, it gets worse as the creatures search for shelter from 
the rain, Gloske said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Feiles has been able to curb the problem for the past week or so after 
Gloske advised him to place ammonia soaked rags in any crawl spaces around his 
home, which deters the skunks from entering.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Feiles, who lives at the base of the Santa Monica Mountains, has 
found many creatures crawling around his home, it never has been this bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "In two weeks, we caught a skunk almost every night," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is just unbelievable." JEANNETTE REGALADO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: TOPANGA CANYON; BOARD PUTS OFF CALL ON LUXURY PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The longest-running land-use dispute in Los Angeles County history dragged on 
Thursday as the Board of Supervisors delayed until March its decision on a 
luxury housing project and golf course proposed for Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to more than two hours of testimony, supervisors asked county 
planners to prepare a report explaining how current plans for Canyon Oaks 
Estates differ from a similar proposal the board rejected in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners will respond and public testimony will continue March 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers are seeking permission to build a private golf course and 97 custom 
home sites on 257 acres in the upper reaches of Topanga Canyon, about three 
miles south of the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Those plans were approved by the Regional Planning Commission in December but 
are now under final review by the supervisors.  
</P>
<P>
 Many environmentalists and residents of Topanga Canyon oppose the development, 
calling it inconsistent with the rural flavor of their community. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's hearing was the latest skirmish in a battle that began in 1978, 
when another developer proposed building a larger number of houses, a hotel, a 
shopping center and equestrian facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 That proposal was eventually scaled back but was nonetheless rejected by 
county supervisors in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, the board reversed itself and decided to reconsider the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, the project had been taken over by Sharon Disney Lund, daughter 
of Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 Lund died last year, and the development is now being steered by a family 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents argue that the project would degrade the water quality in Topanga 
Creek, require substantial grading, cut off a critical wildlife corridor and 
pose a fire hazard in the rugged terrain of the Santa Monica Mountains.  
</P>
<P>
 They want the golf course removed from the project and the number of home 
sites reduced.  
</P>
<P>
 Many advocate preserving the land as a park. 
</P>
<P>
 Project manager Charles McLaughlin said his development team is willing to 
sell the property to preservation agencies but never received a fair market 
offer.  
</P>
<P>
 He also argued that the project's flood-control and filtration systems would 
improve the quality of water in Topanga Creek and that the golf course would 
provide a natural break against wildfires. AARON CURTISS

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; VOLUNTEERS VISITED BY NAVAJO LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Delphina Yazzie's latest job has taken her far from the forests and grazing 
lands of her home on the Navajo Indian Reservation.  
</P>
<P>
 Since Feb. 1, she has been a Red Cross volunteer at a disaster center at 
Northridge Fashion Center, working 12 hours a day in a tent, filling out 
paperwork for earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-year-old high school student is one of 27 Red Cross volunteers from the 
reservation in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the group received an unexpected recognition for their efforts: 
Navajo Nation President Peterson Zah flew in to observe their work and offer 
encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit pleased Corey Johnson, a Navajo Nation employee who works alongside 
Yazzie in the Red Cross tent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, we just go and write reports and memos to him (Zah), and that's 
all," Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big excitement that he actually came and saw what we are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Zah, who heads the 200,000-member Navajo Nation, said he came to Los Angeles 
to praise tribal volunteers and also to extend a helping hand to an estimated 
20 Navajo families who were displaced by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County is home to the largest Native American population living 
off reservations in the country, said Alma Rail, an official of the Southern 
California Indian Center, who accompanied Zah on his tour of the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A large portion of this population are Navajos, and many were living in the 
Valley at the time of the quake, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Zah said he spoke in Navajo to a small group of displaced tribal members 
shortly after his arrival early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them we were there to listen and that we feel for what has happened to 
them," Zah said, adding that the Navajo Nation may consider sending additional 
aid to the earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 For Yazzie and Johnson, Zah's brief visit meant that for a moment they could 
step away from the folding chairs and lines of people, although Zah was barely 
out of the tent when they returned to their posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Zah "is a big deal where we come from," Yazzie said.  
</P>
<P>
 "When he goes elsewhere, like here, he is not the biggest. But to us, he is 
still a big person." JILL LEOVY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: GLENDALE; DISTRICT CANCELS AIDS AWARENESS PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale school district officials closed the curtains on an AIDS awareness 
play the day before its scheduled performance at Hoover High School, saying the 
production's message clashes with district policy. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they canceled "Secrets," a play produced by the Kaiser 
Permanente health care organization, because it discusses safe sex through the 
use of condoms.  
</P>
<P>
 District policy, said Gregory Bowman, director of instruction and student 
services, is to teach that abstaining from sex is the only way to avoid AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to call off Tuesday's and Wednesday's scheduled performances of 
"Secrets" sparked anger among members of Hoover's Parent-Teacher-Student Assn., 
which co-sponsored the event. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials and board members "have done a grave disservice to the 
children at Hoover High School," said PTSA President Susan Kussman. Kussman 
said the PTSA has planned to bring "Secrets" to the campus for nearly a year. 
Rick Burke, director of educational theater programs at Kaiser, said the play 
has been shown to 700,000 students over eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I interpret the policy is that you stress abstinence, but you teach 
what needs to be taught, which means safe sex," said Carolyn Crane, AIDS 
awareness chairwoman for the PTSA. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-minute play centers on a high school senior, Eddie, and his girlfriend, 
Monica.  
</P>
<P>
 Eddie learns he has tested positive for the HIV virus after sharing an 
intravenous needle twice with friends. Even before this discovery, Monica tells 
her friends that she will refrain from having sex with Eddie, said Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating district concerns, the PTSA asked Kaiser to drop a scene in which 
actors use a banana to show how condoms are worn. Still, condoms are discussed 
as a way to help prevent the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The philosophy of this district is that abstinence is the clear message we 
send to young people about sexual intercourse," said Bowman.  
</P>
<P>
 The play "doesn't always give the information that's required -- that condoms 
aren't 100% effective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 District spokesman Vic Pallos said the play was also canceled because parents 
were not notified in their respective languages, and because parents and 
district staff weren't given sufficient time to preview a tape of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Kussman of the PTSA said parent permission slips were printed in English, 
although an explanation of them was printed in Korean in a newsletter.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither permission slips nor explanations in the newsletter were printed in 
Armenian or Spanish, she said, even though students attend the school whose 
parents speak those languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was the scene in which the banana is used to demonstrate how to put 
on a condom eliminated, but a 10-minute discussion after the play was supposed 
to stress abstinence as the only foolproof method of preventing AIDS, parents 
said. TOMMY LI

 It's the ultimate in meals on wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving semi-trucks loaded with portable cooking gear and volunteers from five 
states have converged at the Van Nuys Airport to cook meals for earthquake 
victims and relief workers. 
</P>

 "By the end of this week, we'll have cooked more than 1 million meals," said 
59-year-old Jerry Bob "JB" Taylor of Stanton, Tex., who heads the Texas 
delegation for the Southern Baptist Convention Disaster Relief program. 
</P>
<P>
 The meals are picked up and delivered to Valley shelters by the American Red 
Cross, which also provides the food.  
</P>
<P>
 The meals, some of which are second helpings, are devoured by earthquake 
victims, volunteers and others who work to provide earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization whipped up nearly 4 million meals in parts of Florida and 
Louisiana in the two months following Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas delegation is working with volunteers from four other states -- 
Missouri, Mississippi, California and Oklahoma.  
</P>
<P>
 They have been cooking outside a hangar since Jan. 19, two days after the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu -- three meals a day -- tends to lean toward stews and one-dish 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we talk about meals, we're not talking about a meat, a vegetable, a 
dessert and a salad," said Taylor.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need to feed a lot of people in a little time," said Taylor, a 24-year 
veteran of relief efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can fix 2,000 meals in 40 minutes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To this end, the trucks are equipped with an armament of culinary aids for any 
disaster.  
</P>
<P>
 This includes water purification tanks, 28-gallon cooking pots, food storage 
containers that keep food hot, and even ham radios to take food orders when 
phone lines are down. 
</P>
<P>
 Like buses that carry rock stars on concert tours, the side of each truck is 
also inscribed with the locations of the disasters to which they have rushed.  
</P>
<P>
 There are 37 disaster locations on the Texas truck alone -- from the Paris, 
Tex., tornado in 1984 to the Mexico City earthquake of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 But each disaster requires a slightly different menu, Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, for example, the majority of people receiving food 
are Latino, so his crew of volunteers make the food somewhat spicy.  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Taylor said he has to keep an eye on volunteer Milton Schmidt of 
Irving, Tex.  
</P>
<P>
 The 65-year-old Schmidt, who sometimes carries a bottle of Texas hot sauce in 
a holster, often tries to sneak a little jalapeno and chili peppers into 
whatever he's cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to kind of hold him down a little bit during disasters," Taylor said, 
"so he doesn't make it too hot." JEFF SCHNAUFER

BUSINESSES MUST MOVE OR REMODEL DUE TO RAIL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Not everyone is finding the arrival of Metrolink service in the Antelope 
Valley to be a convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it's become a downright inconvenience for a number of businesses 
located along the railroad tracks in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink is installing 10 miles of train track between Lancaster and 
Palmdale. As a result, as many as five businesses nestled near the route along 
Sierra Highway between Avenues J and K will be forced to relocate or to remodel 
substantially to increase their distances from the new $12-million track. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time since Metrolink service was initiated in late 1992 that 
mandatory relocation of businesses has been required, said Cecilia Melanson, 
acquisition and relocation manager for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But knowing that doesn't make it any easier for owners of the affected 
businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 "They came in Tuesday and said it looks like we're going to be moving and 
they'd get back to us," said realtor Mark Troth, one of three owners of Troth 
Realtors, which has been in business at the same Sierra Highway location for 37 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 Crazy Otto's Diner, a landmark restaurant along the tracks, probably won't 
have to move, but may have to close down for a short while for some major 
remodeling. Co-owner Scotty Tranter said he will have to chop off about three 
feet from portions of the diner so that the building will be the required 10 
feet from the train tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink service to the Antelope Valley began on an emergency basis a week 
after the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. Executive Director Richard Stanger 
said that the service will continue for at least a year and that if ridership 
warrants, it will be permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension of the Santa Clarita line into the region had not been expected 
for at least a decade. But the collapse of a portion of the Antelope Valley 
Freeway during the quake temporarily left more than 40,000 commuters from the 
area without direct highway access to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan was that eventually, and eventually means nobody really knew when, 
we would be providing service to the Antelope Valley," said Metrolink's 
Francisco Oaxaca. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the earthquake, MTA, which already owns rail line between Santa 
Clarita and Palmdale, brought the service as far north as Lancaster by using 
Southern Pacific's freight track. Southern Pacific agreed to let Metrolink run 
commuter trains on the track for just 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink is now installing 10 miles of rail between the existing Southern 
Pacific track and Sierra Highway, within a 40-foot right-of-way corridor MTA 
purchased more than a year ago from Southern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected Metrolink extension especially surprised the Sierra Highway 
business owners. Although they lease land on a month-to-month basis from the 
MTA, they said they thought it would be years before track would be installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the owners question the need for continuing commuter train service in 
the Antelope Valley. Ridership, which soared to more than 20,000 daily after 
the line was extended, dropped to a low of 7,673 Wednesday, with only about 20% 
of the passengers boarding in Palmdale and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Tranter said he believes the service was extended only because the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency will pick up the bulk of the estimated 
$27.2-million tab. In addition to the new track, the MTA also is building 
temporary stations and making improvements in the existing track. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, business owners worry about what impact will be on their 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been at the (Sierra Highway) location more than two years," said Danny 
Levine, owner of All Valley Carpet & Upholstery Cleaning, which identifies 
itself as being next to Crazy Otto's. "We specifically moved there because of 
the high visibility. . . . To try and get people to find us again, it's going 
to be tough." 
</P>
<P>
 While Crazy Otto's can remodel, Levine has no choice but to move. "I'd love to 
stay right where we are," he said. "Unfortunately, we're going to have a 
railroad track running right through the bathroom."

RITTER RANCH WINS 3RD COURT VICTORY; DEVELOPMENT: FOES SAY MASTER-PLANNED 
PROJECT VIOLATES PALMDALE GENERAL PLAN. TWO OTHER SUITS HAD CHALLENGED 
ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The third time's the charm for Ritter Ranch, which scored another victory 
Thursday in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne issued a tentative ruling 
in favor of the developer of the 7,200-home Ritter Ranch master-planned 
community in west Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is Wayne's last in three lawsuits brought by the Leona Valley 
Town Council against Ritter Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ruling . . . sends a clear message that Ritter Ranch is one of the best 
examples of what a master-planned community should encompass -- a 
well-conceived, carefully planned and designed project," project general 
manager Peter Wenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Town Council member Paul Sloane said Wayne's most recent ruling, which 
rejected the council's claim that the project was inconsistent with Palmdale's 
General Plan, was expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became apparent to us after the first ruling, and particularly after the 
second one, that we (should have) no expectation of being victorious at all 
today," he said. "Our attorney made it clear to us from the very beginning that 
our chance of winning in Superior Court was very slim." 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, the Town Council filed appeals of the decisions in the first 
two suits, Sloane said. An appeal of Thursday's suit is likely as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we have very strong cases," Sloane said. "Our objective in this whole 
thing is to affect change. They want to do things that are not in the best 
interest of the region." 
</P>
<P>
 The Leona Valley Town Council filed three suits over a host of concerns 
involving Ritter Ranch. Sloane estimated that the suits have cost $20,000 in 
legal fees so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The first suit alleged that the environmental impact report prepared for the 
10,625-acre project failed to meet the requirements of the California 
Environmental Quality Act. Wayne dismissed that suit in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The second suit, filed by the Leona Valley and Antelope Acres town councils, 
argued that Los Angeles County Waterworks should have done an environmental 
impact report for a water pipeline that is to be built to serve Ritter Ranch. 
Late last year, Wayne ruled that the report the city of Palmdale did for the 
development had adequately addressed the impact of the 16-mile pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Rulings on any appeals are not expected for as long as six months.

BOARD OKS GAS STATION, MINI-MART ALONG FAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Thursday approved a Rosamond 
developer's application to build a gas station and mini-mart along the San 
Andreas Fault but denied him a permit to sell liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale officials had vehemently opposed the project, just outside the city 
on Avenue S near the Antelope Valley Freeway, saying that underground gas tanks 
along the fault could create a disaster in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale leaders also were concerned that the underground tanks would be 
upstream from Lake Palmdale, the main water source for east Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The board required that the tanks be located 100 feet from the fault. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony, developer Nick Vartanian said he was willing to do whatever the 
board required to get approval. After the ruling, however, Vartanian would not 
comment on whether he would build his mini-mart if he could not sell liquor.

GROUP URGES REDUCING SCOPE OF VENTURA BOULEVARD PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura Boulevard planning group recommended Thursday that city officials 
reduce the scope and cost of a plan to upgrade the San Fernando Valley's main 
commercial strip and guide its growth into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recommended that the focus not just be on road widening, as it seemed to 
be in the past, and that some more pedestrian enhancement be included as well," 
said Jeff Brain, chairman of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The group asked the city Planning Commission to revise the goals of the 
Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan and thus reduce costs from $220 million to 
about $100 million. The group also urged the commission to find other sources 
of funding for the plan, which was to rely heavily on fees levied upon 
businesses for traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain said that such "trip fees" -- or a charge to business owners for each 
afternoon car trip their property generates -- should be reduced and that a 
planned assessment district charge each business less. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked the Planning Commission that economic focus be more on outside 
funding," Brain said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a visit to Ventura Boulevard last week, U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald 
H. Brown promised that the Clinton Administration would facilitate grant money 
so businesses could get back on their feet quickly following last month's 
earthquake, which caused more than $41 million in structural damage to 
buildings along the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission agreed to consider the recommendations.

O.C. MAY ASK TO PUT JAIL ON TUSTIN BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY and ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite community opposition, the Orange County Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday will consider asking the U.S. Defense Department to allow detention 
facilities and a police training center at the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station 
after it closes in 1997, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we decided that these are facilities which we have a need for," 
said Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, adding that he has not 
decided how he will vote on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all part of what the public hearing process is all about," Riley 
said. "This is a county need, and certainly one that is appropriate, but, like 
everything else, a lot of times when such facilities are needed, the public 
where they're to be located has different views." 
</P>
<P>
 The county plan includes a jail for prisoners on daytime work furloughs, a 
second juvenile hall, an alcoholism rehabilitation center and a law enforcement 
training facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin officials were not pleased by the proposal, but most said they were 
neither surprised nor upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is asking for as much as they can, and hoping they'll get it," 
said Kathy Weil, a member of the Tustin Base Closure Task Force, which is 
gathering plans for the future use of the base. "If I were them, I'd do that 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Any kind of correctional facility or law enforcement training center had been 
rejected by the closure task force, composed of community, business and public 
agency representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county is represented on the task force, "it sounds like they're 
trying to make an end run around the committee," Weil said. "The county's 
proposed a regional park for this area. . . . But it sounds to me like the 
county wants to take over the whole base." 
</P>
<P>
 The key point to bear in mind, Weil said, is that "anyone can request anything 
they want," but the Department of Defense, which owns the 1,620-acre property, 
must make the final decision. "They take into consideration the plan that's 
finally presented by the community, and our plan doesn't include the 
crime-prevention stuff the county has presented," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the federal government prefers to work with a plan developed by a 
community, public agencies such as the county can apply directly for projects 
even if they have been rejected by local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 County Budget Director Ronald S. Rubino said Thursday that the proposed uses 
of the Tustin property were the result of a nearly yearlong review of future 
government needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We scrutinized all county programs, from A to Z, and we identified a number 
of different programs that could be referred to Tustin," Rubino said. "We are 
simply asking the (Board of Supervisors) for authority to present this 
application to the Tustin (officials) and notify the federal government of our 
proposals." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to gauge the community's reaction to the possible location of 
correctional facilities on the base, Rubino said: "We're working with the 
community and attempting to find a middle ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Mayor Jim Potts agreed that Tustin won't be blindsided. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like Tustin is going to wake up tomorrow, and residents are going to 
complain because we're getting stuff thrown at us on the base. . . . Our staff 
is negotiating with the county to bring about some things that will be 
beneficial to our community as well as the county," he said. "We're all working 
on this together." 
</P>
<P>
 Casper Kasperian of Tustin, a member of the Base Closure Task Force, said that 
"within reason, everything is viable. People don't want a dump or an 
incinerator there, but everything else is viable." 
</P>
<P>
 In February of 1993, the Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to ask the 
federal government for permission to use the base as a county jail site.  
</P>
<P>
 However, in December, a 17-member task force appointed by the Tustin City 
Council approved a range of uses for the base, including a mix of residential 
and recreational facilities, but clearly rejected any prison, substance abuse 
facility or law enforcement training facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because the training center would include a pistol range, the panel's 
report stated that a "law enforcement training facility (is) not compatible 
with surrounding uses." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin City Manager William A. Huston said the city's staff wants to be 
"responsible and fair, and not to get caught up in a not-in-my-back-yard 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Huston said he met Thursday with Christine Shingleton, Tustin assistant city 
manager, as well as County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider and 
Environmental Management Agency Director Mike Ruane to discuss compromises 
between the city and the county on the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be in a position where we have to bicker or squabble with 
the county," Huston said. "That means we have to give a little and the county 
has to do that, too." 
</P>
<P>
 About the juvenile hall, for example, Huston said that staff members of both 
governmental agencies will have to decide if it's an appropriate use for the 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there's a way that nonviolent juveniles can be channeled into job 
training programs there instead," Huston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston was amenable to county programs such as vocational training for people 
convicted of crimes other than serious felonies, and programs that help 
battered children and mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think those are the kinds of uses that can be worked into the plan," 
Huston said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that when Tustin representatives objected to the law enforcement 
training site, county officials suggested scaling it back from the proposed 
53-acre academy to one building for classrooms, and perhaps an indoor laser 
shooting range. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county's made a good-faith effort," Huston said. "We think there are 
elements in the county proposal that can be accommodated in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city and county are saying, 'Let's not butt heads or throw rocks at each 
other on this,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think both the city and county can come out a winner," he said. "That's not 
to say all their requests can be granted, but we've got it down to a list 
that's negotiable and we can talk about." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Richardson, a Santa Ana councilman and that city's representative to 
the task force, would not comment on the county's proposals beyond saying that 
some of them "could benefit every city in the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana is intensely interested in developments at the air base, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the city of Santa Ana point of view, we want to see some park 
development there and circulation measures," said Richardson, who works for 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force rejected a request by Santa Ana city officials and the Santa 
Ana Unified School District to use 70 acres for a high school. A similar 
request by a coalition of local school districts and colleges was partially 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 After that rejection, Santa Ana officials said they would appeal directly to 
the federal government for permission to use the acreage. The request by the 
group of school districts has already been sent to the U.S. Department of 
Health, Education and Welfare, and a decision could be made by March. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Bureau of Prisons did not follow through on its initial interest 
in the Tustin base because of early opposition by community leaders. However, 
it is considering using a portion of the nearby El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station.

 National Hockey League officials Thursday praised the Mighty Ducks 
organization for joining the gun-exchange movement and said the team's program 
should be adopted throughout the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "We applaud the Ducks for jumping in there and being the first team to do 
this," said Bernadette Mansur, an NHL spokeswoman. "If it's a good idea, like 
this one, it should be for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Los Angeles Kings are doing just that. The Kings confirmed Thursday 
that they, too, are planning a similar tickets-for-guns program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to implement it before the end of the season," said Rick Minch, Kings 
director of media relations. Details of the Kings program, he said, were not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Ducks officials said they are fine-tuning their program, and are 
planning to hold a one-day tickets-for-guns exchange on Feb. 19 at the Anaheim 
Police Department between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks will offer two tickets for every firearm surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 An official announcement by the team, with the full details, is expected 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Although community leaders and police widely hail gun buyback programs as a 
way to make the streets safer, some law enforcement authorities have questioned 
their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of them are a success," said Jim Fotis, executive director 
of the Falls Church, Va.-based Law Enforcement Alliance of America Inc. "The 
average age of the firearm being turned in is 50 years old (from) people who 
just have an old gun lying around the house."  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Fotis said, so-called "politically correct" trade-in programs 
actually create crime because people will steal guns that they can exchange for 
money, toys or even tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA has remained neutral on gun exchange programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our general position is that as long as it's voluntary, they can do whatever 
they want," said NRA spokesman Bill Powers. "I'm sure a lot of members don't 
like it, and I'm sure a lot of people who are not our members don't like it 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Local law enforcement officials generally welcome the Ducks program. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Police Capt. Stan Kantor said he thinks the gun exchange is a good 
idea, but he doesn't expect to "see any gangbanger handing over a gun for a 
couple Ducks tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said removing guns that could eventually end up on the streets was a 
worthwhile endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going into unplowed ground," Kantor said. "The program may not be as 
successful as we'd like, but it's worth a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan B. Hughes, executive director of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce, is 
supportive but aware that similar efforts nationwide have experienced problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard of some unhappy experiences where people buy cheap guns to get 
whatever the trade-in item is," he said. The value of a single Ducks ticket 
ranges from $16 to $125. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its potential flaws, Hughes said he thought an exchange program would 
benefit the community and local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel very strongly that crime is one of our major problems in the city, 
and if this can protect the police and make the community safer, we're all for 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Ducks spokesman Bill Robertson said the team has received numerous 
calls from the public about the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been mostly positive," he said. A couple callers, however, were 
concerned that the exchange would occur at the Anaheim Arena. But that is not 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansur, the NHL spokeswoman, said league officials have been encouraging teams 
to establish tickets-for-guns programs over the past several months, and many 
teams are interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kings are going to be right behind the Ducks," she said, adding that the 
Dallas Stars, Buffalo Sabres and other teams are currently considering gun 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for Hartford Whalers games were part of a statewide tickets-for-guns 
exchange program in Connecticut, a couple months ago, but Mansur said the team 
did not organize the event. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the Ducks are not the only ones getting into the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the cities of Costa Mesa and Orange joined in a carwash to offer 
automobile wash-and-wax jobs for guns. About a half a dozen guns have been 
turned in so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the owners of nine Orange County Aamco Transmission Centers 
announced they would give service vouchers worth $75 in exchange for guns. The 
program starts Monday and will continue for one week. One of the service 
stations is in Anaheim. The guns must be turned in to participating police 
departments in Anaheim, Brea, Costa Mesa, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Huntington 
Beach, Irvine, Orange, Santa Ana or Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Kantor said the Ducks and Aamco programs will probably overlap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it will depend on what the person wants," Kantor said. "Tickets or 
transmission service."

CSUN GARAGE NOT UP TO CODE, REVIEW WARNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The consulting firm hired to review plans for the new Cal State Northridge 
parking garage, which collapsed in last month's earthquake, warned Cal State 
system officials that the design did not meet seismic strength standards in the 
building code, public records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Esgil Corp. of San Diego told Cal State system officials in September, 1990, 
that the garage was designed for effectively half the seismic resistance the 
builder claimed, concluding that the interior columns were not adequately 
interconnected with the concrete slab floors and beams. 
</P>
<P>
 But system officials decided to go ahead with the project after the 
construction firm, A. T. Curd Builders of Glendale, solicited letters from five 
structural engineers supporting its interpretation of the building code, the 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State officials did not question the experts themselves but relied on Curd 
to contact them and relay their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 The garage, completed in July, 1991, partially collapsed during last month's 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the failed parking structure has further crumpled in the swarms of 
aftershocks, the slumping concrete-and-steel ghost -- its middle is still 
standing -- has become what Curd acknowledges is the "photographic icon" for 
destruction wrought by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Curd has stated that the structure met and exceeded all building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 W. Clifford Hahn, Cal State's principal engineer who supervised construction, 
defended the university's actions as prudent. Hahn works at the university 
system's construction management division, which is located in Seal Beach and 
is responsible for bidding and overseeing of major capital projects at Cal 
State's 20 campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said officials also had to balance earthquake concerns against project 
delays and the fear that the builder would file a monetary claim for holding up 
construction, which it ultimately did. He also said letters supplied by Curd 
from other structural engineers convinced him and his immediate supervisor -- 
John Stopforth, chief of the Cal State construction management unit -- that 
Esgil was being too conservative in its interpretation of the building code. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cal State project records show that Esgil -- hired specifically by the 
system to make sure building plans conform to building codes -- expressed 
strong misgivings about the garage's ability to absorb the seismic forces that 
builder Curd claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Esgil's objection was so serious that, at one point, foundation work was 
halted for 19 days and the construction firm was forced to lay off laborers 
before university officials persuaded the San Diego firm to modify its position 
and allow the project to resume, records show.  
</P>
<P>
 "We changed it because our client changed it for us," said Manuel Ainza, a 
former Esgil structural engineer who supervised the plan check of the 
Northridge garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ainza and Ali Sadre, the Esgil structural engineer whose name appears on 
Cal State plan check documents, said the firm's interpretation of the 1988 
Uniform Building Code would have required Curd and Cal State to strengthen 
interconnections among the interior columns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like designing a ladder for a 300-pound man, as the code requires, but 
you (actually) design it for a 150-pound man," Sadre said. "When a 200-pound 
man goes on it, it's going to break." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadre told The Times that he was so "stressed" about how his plan check was 
handled by Cal State that he refused to sign off on the project, leaving the 
matter up to Ainza and other Esgil managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had thought that if someday we had a major earthquake this would be 
a building that would be in trouble, but I never thought in my lifetime we 
would see something like this," Sadre said. "What are the possibilities that a 
building like this, so new, would be in the middle of a seismic event?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn now says he intends to relay Esgil's warnings to experts investigating 
the garage collapse, as well as supply them copies of documents obtained by The 
Times this week. It is up to them to determine whether the earthquake proved 
Esgil correct, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be raising the question," Hahn said. "Obviously, we need to know the 
answer." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there is divided opinion on what buckled the garage, on Zelzah Avenue 
about two miles from the earthquake's epicenter. Some believe it was the 
temblor's unusual up-and-down motion, virtually unanticipated by building 
codes, that crushed the precast concrete columns. Others say it was an 
earthquake's more typical sideways force that knocked the columns over like 
bowling pins. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Curd released a 20-page report blaming the vertical forces for 
"exploding" the columns, which were crunched three to seven feet and allowed 
the weight of the concrete walls to fall inward. President Andrew T. Curd wrote 
that the Cal State Northridge garage was built "to meet and exceed the 
standards established at the time of design and construction." 
</P>
<P>
 In a section entitled "New Design Measures," the Curd report says that further 
seismic bracing can be "achieved by adding vertical and horizontal reinforcing 
steel to the gravity (interior) columns." 
</P>
<P>
 Curd said in an interview Thursday that putting more steel inside the columns 
is different than the stronger connections that Esgil wanted at the joints of 
the interior columns. Esgil's measures would not have saved the structure 
because connections only absorb back-and-forth motions and not the vertical 
jolt of last month's earthquake, he said. The Curd report does not mention the 
warnings by Esgil. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State's handling of the Northridge garage project underscores what many 
engineers have said -- that the building code, contrary to public belief, is a 
minimal standard open to interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge garage history raises questions about a system that Cal State 
officials say guarantees that independent experts double-check their campus 
construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for such reviews was dramatically highlighted by the 1990 collapse of 
the 120-ton roof on Cal State Long Beach's music complex. A study found that 
the roof was constructed at a time when Cal State officials relied on project 
architects and engineers to find and correct their own mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1980s, Cal State has hired firms such as Esgil to serve as plan 
check consultants. The San Diego firm -- which also advises 71 other cities, 
counties and state agencies -- reviews construction plans for all but two of 
the university's Southern California campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, it fell to Esgil to review designs for the Northridge garage when 
officials elected to go through with the project at the burgeoning San Fernando 
Valley campus. In April, 1990, Whiting-Turner Contracting and its principal 
subcontractor, Curd Builders, won the bid with its proposal to build a 
2,646-stall structure for $11.3 million and in 374 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Curd said in an interview that his firm scored the most points in the 
bidding because of the garage design. He said the design called for tying 
together pre-cast concrete pillars and beams to form a three-dimensional box. 
</P>
<P>
 The design, he said, not only leaves no hidden corners in which attackers can 
lurk but also is "flexible in an earthquake." A steel-reinforced "ductile" 
frame is supposed to absorb shocks by bending but not breaking under stress, 
said Curd and structural engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of those qualities, Curd's company considered its garage to be what 
the building code calls a "moment resisting frame building" -- meaning that its 
joints were able to take that back-and-forth punishment, or "moments," expected 
from an earthquake. The 1988 building code gave such buildings a load-carrying 
capacity value of 12, a number that allows building materials to be lighter -- 
and less expensive -- because the structure is expected to bend. 
</P>
<P>
 But in August, 1990, Esgil's Sadre took exception to that, records show. And 
in his September, 1990, plan check report, Sadre assigned the garage a value of 
6, which is reserved for less flexible buildings, records show. The reason: The 
precast system did not have adequate ability to flex but not break where the 
interior columns met the beams and floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that Sadre based his interpretation, in part, on the so-called 
Blue Book commentary, written by the Structural Engineers Assn. of California, 
to clarify the intent of code provisions. By choosing a value of 6, Sadre 
asserted the building was only half the strength that Curd had claimed, and 
should be redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadre's objection caused immediate problems. In a Sept. 27 letter, Kent 
Jessen, an engineer for Curd, wrote that the issue "is of major significance, 
as this is how the code determines the magnitude of the design forces to 
account for earthquake loading." 
</P>
<P>
 "We respect Esgil's right to have their own in-house design criteria, no doubt 
based upon highly reputable sources, and we believe it is honorable that they 
use what they interpret is correct in the design of their own projects," Jessen 
wrote. "However, these interpretations, when not clearly defined in the code, 
cannot be forced upon other designers, who may very well have their own 
interpretations." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, Whiting-Turner -- the project's general contractor -- wrote to 
university officials complaining about Sadre's "unfair interpretation" and 
asked for a meeting. "As you are aware, the impact of this review comment is 
severe with respect to schedule delays and construction costs," wrote Paul 
Schmitt, Whiting-Turner's manager for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiting-Turner, Curd and its engineers argued that the design met the code and 
that the commentary, while it recommended stronger connections for the interior 
columns, did not impose any legal requirements, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Cal State system officials asked Esgil and the construction firm to 
resolve the dispute, but Sadre said it was impossible. "We could not come up 
with an agreement because it was black and white, there could be no 
compromise," Sadre said. "It was like we were calling it (the design) a car and 
they were calling it a boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the stalemate, Hahn said Cal State officials leaned toward Esgil's 
opinion but agreed with Curd's suggestion that the dispute be decided by other 
engineering firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no ax to grind," Hahn said. "We would have gone with our plan checker 
if they (Curd) had not sought the tie-break. . . . It was a reasonable way of 
breaking a tie; we've done it before." 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said such a peer review is not unusual on major construction projects, 
including disputes with Esgil, which he said is known to be conservative in its 
interpretation of the code. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that Curd provided Cal State officials with letters dated Oct. 3 
and 4 from five engineering firms. American Structural Engineers of Long Beach, 
Sven Sorensen Inc. of Blue Jay, and Johnson & Nielsen Associates of Los Angeles 
supported Curd's contention that its design rated a 12, files show. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Sven A. K. Sorensen, the company's president, said Curd solicited 
his opinion because they had worked together on a number of parking garage 
projects. Asked if he was paid to review the matter, Sorensen replied: "I can't 
comment on whether Curd paid a fee. . . . Obviously, I don't do something like 
that for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the dispute, Curd has also hired the Las Vegas affiliate of Martin & 
Associates to build the MGM Grand Hotel, and American Structural to design two 
parking garages Curd built in Las Vegas and in Los Angeles, said Curd vice 
president David Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said Cal State officials never contacted the firms directly, did not 
check to see if they had current or potential business ties with Curd and did 
not offer to pay for the opinions about the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that Esgil would not back down from its interpretation, however. 
Letters show that Esgil told Whiting-Turner on Sept. 17 that it saw the issue 
as "more than a code clarification and that they would insist on enforcing 
their position on the review comment." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State officials still had the responsibility to decide, and records show 
that Hahn and his supervisor, Stopforth, called Esgil on Oct. 16 to discuss the 
matter. In his handwritten notes, Hahn wrote about the conversation: 
</P>
<P>
 "Esgil will state (recommendation) to comply with Blue Book but agree design 
complies with code. CSU can then concur to not require additional 
(non-contractor design enhancement)." Nine days after the conversation, Esgil 
submitted a second plan check list that noted its original objection over the 
seismic rating had been "resolved by CSU/Esgil mutual agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our client said, 'We're going to go with the strict letter of the law.' We 
said, 'Well, you're the client. We'll do what you want to do,' " said Ainza, 
who was laid off from Esgil two years ago and now works for another structural 
engineering firm in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the firm was pressured into relenting, Esgil President Richard Esgate 
said, "Absolutely not." Esgate said his firm acts only in an "advisory role" 
and has no regulatory authority over Cal State. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said part of the reason Cal State officials eventually sided with Curd 
was that they did not want to risk further delay of the project, tempting the 
builder and its general contractor on the job to sue the university for 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not in our normal role to second-guess, to doubt that, make it stronger 
than code," Hahn said. "That's not something we normally do. You can 
second-guess this, you can Monday-morning quarterback it. You can be a whole 
lot smarter after an earthquake, but at the time we believe we acted 
prudently."

WILSON PROPOSES BORROWING TO PAY QUAKE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB and DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson proposed Thursday that California borrow money to pay most of 
its $1.9-billion share of the Northridge earthquake recovery costs to avoid 
raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's plan would manage the state's end of the recovery with a loan from 
the federal government, a state bond issue and unspecified cuts in existing 
state spending. The proposal attracted some initial support from legislative 
leaders but was harshly criticized by his Democratic opponents for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taxes should be a last resort and not a first response," Wilson told 
reporters in his office after a meeting with legislative leaders. "The facts 
show that the state's general fund exposure can be financed without raising 
taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said that, unlike after the Loma Prieta earthquake, which struck the 
San Francisco Bay area in 1989, the state's economy cannot absorb a tax 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators enacted a quarter-cent, temporary increase in the sales tax to 
raise $761 million after the Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really can't afford an earthquake recovery plan that threatens an already 
fragile economy," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the state's unemployment rate is nearly twice what it was in 1989 and 
that personal income, which was growing at a 7.7% annual rate then, is nearly 
stagnant today. Wilson also noted that both the sales and gasoline tax have 
been raised significantly since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's three-point plan includes elements that will need approval from the 
voters, the federal government and the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest part of it would be the proposed $1.05-billion bond issue, 
essentially a 20-year mortgage taken out by the state. Wilson wants to seek 
voters approval for the measure in June. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the amount raised by the bond issue would go toward costs that 
are already being incurred for the state's share of freeway repair and for the 
reconstruction of local government buildings and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The other half would be spent on low-interest loans to homeowners to 
supplement the program run by the federal Small Business Administration. That 
portion -- $575 million -- will not be spent unless the bond measure is 
approved, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second part of Wilson's plan calls for the federal government to allow 
California to delay payment of the estimated $334 million the state will owe as 
matching funds for federal disaster aid. The state would pay the money in three 
annual installments beginning on July 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said that he had spoken by phone with Leon Panetta, director of 
the federal Office of Management and Budget, and that Panetta said the Clinton 
Administration would be open to the idea of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "They certainly did not reject it out of hand," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The final part of the plan would require at least $290 million in cuts to the 
existing state budget to make up for the loss of tax revenue and to pay the 
state's share of grants to individuals and families. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $80 million would have to be cut to make the first of the annual 
payments on the bond measure if it is approved. Wilson did not say where he 
would make those cuts in a budget that already is $3 billion out of balance. 
"It is part of the challenge we will face in dealing with the budget gap in 
general," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state would lose another $225 million over the next 10 years as people use 
their property damage losses as deductions to reduce their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake caused an estimated $13 billion to $20 billion in 
damage. The tab for federal, state and local governments is estimated at $11.6 
billion. President Clinton has proposed that the federal government pay $9.5 
billion of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear Thursday how Wilson's plan would fare in the Legislature. But 
it seems certain that the alternative -- raising state taxes -- will not get 
the Republican votes needed for passage without a strong lobbying effort by the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, emerging from the meeting with Wilson and other 
legislative leaders, described the plan as a "rollover," and said the 
possibility of additional taxes remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go through all the drills and you hope you never have to come face to 
face with that issue," Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter asked the Speaker if the Wilson plan amounted to 
Washington-style deficit spending, Brown said: "We're trying to work together, 
and it's not helpful to put questions like that to me because I don't like to 
lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Republican Leader James Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, who also was at 
the meeting, said he will author the bill authorizing the ballot vote on the 
$1.05-billion bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer of Hayward refused to comment. Senate 
Republican Leader Ken Maddy was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Wilson's Democratic opponents in the upcoming race for governor 
criticized his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson has managed to confirm in broad daylight that he is truly a 
gutless wonder," said Darry Sragow, manager of Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi's gubernatorial campaign. "Apparently, Pete Wilson is paralyzed by 
taxaphobia." 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow pointed out that Wilson's bond proposal would raise about half the 
state's estimated $1.9-billion cost. By rolling over most of the cost into 
future years, he said, the governor is "putting the cost of repairing the 
damage of the 1994 earthquake on kids who aren't even born." 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow estimated that the costs could be paid by imposing gasoline and sales 
taxes totaling no more than $40 on individual Californians for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Behr, policy director for Treasurer Kathleen Brown's campaign, also said 
the plan lacked courage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This non-proposal is gutless and irresponsible," Behr said. "He's telling 
earthquake victims that they should sit tight and wait until June for voters to 
approve bond measures -- and we won't do anything else for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Behr said the governor's plan will require more than $300 million in budget 
cuts.

CHIEF DISTANCES LAPD FROM OFFICERS ACCUSED IN RAMPAGE 
</P>

<P>
 Two police officers accused of firing at a California Highway Patrol officer 
during an off-duty shooting rampage bailed out of jail early Thursday as their 
superiors grappled with the possible long-term fallout for the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "These men are charged with some of the most heinous criminal actions I have 
ever heard," Police Chief Willie L. Williams said at a news conference carried 
live by local television stations. The chief said the LAPD is cooperating 
"110%" with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigation of the 
shooting, which occurred in sheriff's territory near the Harbor Freeway in the 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams took pains to distance the rest of the department from the 
embarrassing spectacle. Mentioning two earlier public relations disasters -- 
the police beating of Rodney G. King and the department's response to the 1992 
riots -- Williams said: "It is time to stop painting this organization with 
that broad brush. . . . Let's take this incident as it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan, commenting briefly on the incident at an unrelated news 
conference, said: "As reported, it's reprehensible behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 As authorities sifted through the evidence in the case, they concluded that 
the officers did not, as originally suspected, fire at a Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority bus. Nevertheless, both officers, Michael V. Herrera 
and Ted S. Teyechea, were arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon 
on a peace officer, a charge that could carry a prison sentence and almost 
certainly will end their law enforcement careers if they are found responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're history," one police source said. "They might as well just resign and 
get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Sheriff's Department has yet to release official information 
regarding the officers' blood-alcohol level, sources say one officer refused to 
be tested and the other recorded a level of 0.14%, nearly twice the California 
legal driving limit of 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Bill Martin said that Teyechea appears to have initiated the 
shooting rampage, allegedly leaning out of the truck's passenger window and 
firing five rounds in the direction of the CHP officer. As the officer radioed 
for help, Herrera, who was driving, fired four more shots from the driver's 
side as Teyechea continued to shoot, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrambling to contain the damage caused by the incident, Los Angeles police 
officers who work with the pair drafted a letter to the Highway Patrol 
expressing regret over the incident and hope that the agencies can continue to 
cooperate. Williams also is writing a letter, which aides said he expects to 
mail today. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera and Teyechea are LAPD veterans -- Herrera joined the force in 1984, 
Teyechea the next year -- and both worked in the 77th Street area, one of the 
most challenging in the city for a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny L. Staggs, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said 
they have outstanding reputations. Their boss, Capt. Larry R. Goebel, called 
them "hard-working officers who have not had any problems that would in any way 
indicate they would do something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera has never been punished by an LAPD board of rights, the department's 
chief disciplinary body. Teyechea, however, was given a 10-day suspension in 
1989 for striking a prisoner and using improper language. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are "not problem children, but not outstanding, either," one colleague 
said. An officer who once supervised them said they are "average cops, not the 
kind of guys who stand out at anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two, officers generally spoke more highly of Herrera, a 
second-generation officer whose father is an LAPD detective. The younger 
Herrera, they said, is a quiet, mostly respected officer well-liked by many of 
his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera and Teyechea were not at work Thursday, and Goebel said the two would 
be reassigned pending the outcome of the investigation. That reassignment will 
keep them out of the field while the Sheriff's Department conducts its criminal 
investigation and the LAPD pursues administrative charges.  
</P>
<P>
 Herrera and Teyechea were bailed out of jail about 1 a.m. Thursday. But the 
Police Protective League, which generally aids officers, did not post the bond 
or send a lawyer to meet with them.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were on their own," said Staggs, president of the league. "We will give 
them the courtesy of a one-hour legal consultation. That's something we give 
every member. But that's all we'll do." 
</P>
<P>
 David Davies, administrator for the county probation department's pretrial 
services division, said an on-duty bail commissioner approved a late night 
request from the patrolmen to lower their $25,000 bail to $5,000. Thousands of 
suspects ask for similar reductions; about 17% of such requests were granted 
last year. Davies said he did not know why Los Angeles County Superior Court 
Commissioner Stanley Genser lowered the bail for the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I would assume he made the decision based on their community and family 
ties, their lack of a criminal record, their substantial employment record and 
the belief that they were good candidates to return and make their court 
appearances and who posed no risk for criminal activity while they were out of 
custody," Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
 After making bail, the two officers returned home, Teyechea to his residence 
in Monterey Park, Herrera to his house in West Covina. Neither could be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The bail reduction prompted some speculation that the officers were receiving 
special treatment, but Williams, in a rare display of anger, vehemently denied 
any such suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no special treatment. I'm the chief of police, take me at my word," 
Williams said. "We do not request nor do we condone nor would we accept special 
treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 According to colleagues, Herrera and Teyechea went out drinking at the end of 
their shift, which ended Wednesday morning. The two reportedly visited at least 
two bars that are popular with police officers, the Shortstop on Sunset 
Boulevard and the Zebra Room in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until about 2 p.m., about six hours after the two officers had 
gotten off work, that they allegedly fired at a CHP officer who had stopped to 
write a ticket near the 190th Street on-ramp to the northbound Harbor Freeway. 
Authorities would not identify the CHP officer. 
</P>
<P>
 As Herrera and Teyechea passed, the CHP officer allegedly heard shots and 
turned to see the pickup truck. Although sheriff's officials said the CHP 
officer did not see Herrera and Teyechea fire at him, he concluded that they 
had and immediately set off after them on his motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers were arrested a few minutes later after being hung up in traffic 
on Vermont Avenue in Gardena. A sheriff's spokesman said that as they 
surrendered at gunpoint to the CHP officer, Herrera identified himself as a 
police officer. The arresting officers found two handguns and a number of spent 
shell casings in the truck, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports indicated that the officers also had fired at an MTA bus, but 
investigators now say that does not appear to be the case. The MTA dispatched 
messages to its bus drivers Thursday asking them to report if any of them had 
been involved in the incident. Spokesman Jim Smart said that none had come 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers are likely to be arraigned March 3, and authorities said that 
additional charges could be added before that time. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the incident rocked police administrators, police union leaders and 
other LAPD supporters -- all of whom had been basking in the accolades that the 
department received for its response to last month's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Most police officials declined to comment about the incident in detail, but 
several said they were concerned about the possible effect it would have on the 
department's standing with the public and with other police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the Police Protective League were in a board meeting Wednesday 
evening when they got word of the incident. Directors, who are lobbying the 
city to give officers a raise, were dismayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tragic, and unfortunately casts a shadow over the whole department," 
Staggs said. "It's especially sad that this comes right after the earthquake, 
when our officers did such a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Laura Chick, a member of the council's Public Safety 
Committee, said the incident and its aftermath had created "an exceptionally 
trying time for those of us who care about rebuilding the morale of the Los 
Angeles Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 She added, however: "It is very important that in our rush for quick justice 
in this case, we do not make the entire Los Angeles Police Department the 
suspect or scapegoat. The police cannot operate effectively in any community 
without citizen support."

EX-SEN. CARPENTER FLEES BEFORE FRAUD SENTENCING; COURTS: A NOTE INDICATES HE 
HAS LEFT U.S. FOR TREATMENT OF TERMINAL CANCER. JUDGE ISSUES ARREST ORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Days before his sentencing on political corruption charges, former state Sen. 
Paul B. Carpenter has left the country to seek "a more adventuristic" treatment 
for terminal prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a handwritten note that reached federal Judge Edward J. Garcia on Thursday, 
the ailing Carpenter summed up his reasons for becoming a fugitive: "I find my 
drive for survival stronger than my sense of obligation to your legal system." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities first suspected that Carpenter had fled on Monday when he 
failed to make his weekly check-in call to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, when it was clear that the psychologist-turned-politician was in 
flight and would not appear for sentencing next week, Garcia issued an order 
for his arrest. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of more than seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter's attorney, Charles F. Bloodgood, said neither he nor Carpenter's 
family knows where the convicted ex-politician has fled. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Charles J. Stevens said that Carpenter's failure to report is a 
violation of federal criminal law and that the FBI is attempting to find him. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, 65, learned last year that he has advanced prostate cancer. But he 
repeatedly said he was determined to clear his name despite the physical impact 
of the disease and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking worn and ashen, he took the stand in his own defense on charges of 
mail fraud, money laundering, conspiracy and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 After he and his co-defendant, Capitol lobbyist Clayton R. Jackson, were 
convicted in the case in December, he quickly filed an appeal. He hoped he 
would be able to remain out of prison, telling a reporter during the trial that 
he would probably die of cancer before his appeal was settled. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the veteran Democratic politician who once represented a 
Downey district was continuing cancer therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am being treated with the most advanced treatment protocol available in the 
United States," Carpenter wrote in his undated letter to Garcia, who was 
scheduled to sentence him Monday. "Fifty percent of the patients on this 
treatment for as long as I have been will survive another 29 months. The other 
50% will not." 
</P>
<P>
 He complained that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been slow to 
approve new forms of treatment. "There are more adventuristic treatment 
protocols being used outside of the United States," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But since Garcia had refused his request to leave the state to spend Christmas 
with relatives after his conviction, Carpenter said, "I feel fairly confident 
in predicting that you will not let me leave the country for medical 
treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodgood said Carpenter was aware he might be taken in custody at his 
sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the day of the conviction, the government (prosecutors) moved to remand 
him (into) custody right then," Bloodgood said. "But Judge Garcia said then 
that there was no indication of flight risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter was free based on his promise to return to court and forfeits no 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodgood, who said he was taken by surprise, noted that Carpenter's hormone 
treatment "has caused some disorientation and depression." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said Carpenter "is not that afraid of prison. In my opinion, he 
is trying to save his life by getting this treatment, and I wish him well." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter faces up to seven years and three months in prison for his 
conviction last December on charges that he had laundered campaign 
contributions from lobbyist Jackson to former Sen. Alan E. Robbins. Like 
Carpenter, Jackson is scheduled for sentencing Monday. Robbins pleaded guilty 
to racketeering and tax evasion charges and is now in a halfway house, at the 
end of a two-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodgood said that because of federal sentencing guidelines, Garcia had 
little latitude in adjusting Carpenter's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is the guidelines themselves are merciless," Bloodgood said. 
"They do not provide the court with much in the way of discretion. . . . There 
is no provision for an exception to grant mercy to a dying man." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prison officials have the authority to release seriously ill inmates, 
Bloodgood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter is also awaiting a retrial in an earlier federal criminal case in 
which his conviction was overturned on appeal. In that case, he is accused of 
extortion, racketeering and conspiracy. The charges include extorting campaign 
contributions from an undercover FBI agent who was masquerading as a Southern 
businessman as part of a sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time of his first trial in 1990, Carpenter had been elected to the 
State Board of Equalization. He was forced off the board by the conviction. 
Although he won reelection less than two months later, he was barred from 
resuming office by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Carpenter has been in trouble with the federal 
court. Last year, he failed to appear at a court hearing on his retrial. His 
lawyer discovered that Carpenter was on a mountain-climbing trip to Costa Rica. 
But Carpenter eventually did appear and said he was unaware he was barred from 
leaving the country while awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest disappearance echoes that of another powerful Southern California 
politician, William G. Bonelli Sr., who like Carpenter once chaired the State 
Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1956, Bonelli fled to Mexico after being indicted on bribery charges for 
allegedly taking payoffs for granting of liquor licenses. He died there in 
1970, to the end insisting that he was innocent.

$8.6-BILLION QUAKE AID OKD BY SENATE; RECOVERY: CONFERENCE COMMITTEE MUST 
RESOLVE CONFLICTS WITH HOUSE VERSION, WHICH DIFFERS ON SPENDING CUTS. FINAL 
CONGRESSIONAL PASSAGE COULD COME TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Senate overwhelmingly approved $8.6 billion for Southern California 
earthquake relief Thursday and sent the bill to a conference committee so that 
differences with the House version of the legislation can be worked out. Final 
passage is expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodded by California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, the Senate 
ended a lengthy debate over how the government would pay for the assistance and 
voted, 85 to 10, to approve the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clock is ticking and the people are needful," Feinstein said at one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need these dollars now," Boxer implored. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift action is essential to put the emergency measure on President Clinton's 
desk before lawmakers leave this weekend for a 10-day midwinter recess. 
Clinton's signature on the law would keep federal funds flowing to Southern 
California as the region recovers from the Jan. 17 quake that killed at least 
57 people in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, the two California senators voiced gratitude. "This puts us on 
the road to recovery," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate and House negotiators were scheduled to meet early today to reconcile 
more than 125 differences between the Senate and House versions of the bill. 
But they are expected to agree quickly on final language and to ratify it later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief obstacle in the conference appears to be the gap between the $3.4 
billion in offsetting spending cuts voted by the Senate and the $2.5 billion 
worth of such reductions voted by the House. In addition, each chamber passed 
different approaches to those cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Another difference between the House and Senate bills is the wording of 
provisions designed to bar non-emergency aid to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate approved compromise language proposed by Sen. Harry M. Reid 
(D-Nev.) to require federal agencies to take "reasonable steps" to determine 
that recipients of disaster aid lasting longer than 90 days are not in the 
country illegally. The House approved a provision that said that aid would be 
barred only if government agencies knew an applicant was in the country 
unlawfully. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency had warned that it would run out of 
money for earthquake relief next week unless Congress approved the legislation. 
The Senate measure includes $4.7 billion for FEMA to repair schools, mass 
transit facilities and public buildings as well as to assist individuals and 
provide temporary shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Senate voted to allocate $1.35 billion to the Department of 
Transportation to rebuild damaged freeways and bridges and to designate $1.1 
billion for low-interest Small Business Administration loans to assist 
homeowners and small firms. A total of $200 million was voted for rent 
subsidies provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
President Clinton also would get a $500-million fund to use at his discretion 
in dealing with effects of the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake aid is part of a $10.1-billion emergency supplemental bill that 
includes $1.2 billion for U.S. peacekeeping operations in Somalia, Bosnia and 
elsewhere, $685 million for cleanup operations from last summer's Midwest 
floods and $315 million to repair the Cypress Freeway that was damaged in the 
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake aid legislation is the largest package ever 
considered for a single disaster. Congress appropriated $8.5 billion for three 
1992 disasters: Hurricane Andrew and two similar events in Hawaii and Guam. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's Administration estimated this week that the total cost of 
damage from the Northridge quake would be $13 billion to $20 billion. The cost 
for federal, state and local government assistance was estimated at $11.6 
billion, making it the most expensive single calamity in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate debate featured repeated efforts to offset the cost of the bill by 
making cuts in other federal programs -- a move that was opposed by the two 
California senators and the Senate Democratic leadership on grounds that it 
would delay the disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said: "We all agree we must provide 
disaster aid for the victims of this devastating earthquake . . . But are we 
going to ring up another $10 billion on Uncle Sam's credit card or are we going 
to shift spending priorities to pay for this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's proposal to make $6.7 billion worth of spending cuts was sidetracked, 
however, when it fell 17 votes short of the 60 votes needed to consider his 
amendment under Senate procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar efforts by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Sen. Russell D. Feingold 
(D-Wis.) and Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) to make offsetting reductions were 
crushed by lopsided margins of 3 to 1 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of offsets argued that no such restrictions were imposed when 
Congress voted emergency relief for victims of Hurricane Andrew or other recent 
disasters such as last summer's Midwestern floods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Changing the rules in the middle of an emergency like this is wrong," Boxer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all senators agreed that the nation needs a new method to pay for 
disaster relief and a bipartisan committee was appointed to look into possible 
ways to reduce the drain on the Treasury in the future when natural calamities 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate turned down on a 58-37 procedural vote a plan by Sen. Frank H. 
Murkowski (R-Alaska) to allow taxpayers to earmark $3 of their income tax 
payments to provide financial aid to victims of future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of the earthquake aid measure even invoked the specter of another 
winter storm in the Washington area to cut short senators' lengthy speeches in 
favor of both emergency assistance and deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to spend the night in the Capitol," said Sen. Robert C. Byrd 
(D-W. Va.) at one point, referring to forecasts of a heavy snowfall in 
Washington late Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Some senators objected to the earthquake aid bill because it also contained 
$10 million for relocation of Penn Station in New York City and $1.4 million to 
combat a fungus that could cause potato blight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill is about the gravy train," said McCain. "We're going to see how 
many taxpayers we can take for a ride." 
</P>
<P>
 A McCain amendment to knock out $2.2 billion in highway demonstration projects 
unrelated to the quake was rejected by a lopsided 72-23 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerry's attempt to cut $43 billion over the next five years was shelved by a 
75-20 vote. Feingold's proposal to knock out $1.2 billion for Pentagon 
peacekeeping expenses was trounced, 76 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
 On final passage, eight Republicans and two Democrats voted against the bill. 
They were Wisconsin Democrats Feingold and Herb Kohl, and Republicans Hank 
Brown of Colorado; Jesse Helms and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina; Judd 
Gregg and Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire; Larry Pressler of South Dakota, 
Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Don Nickles of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Five senators did not vote. They were Democrat Bill Bradley of New Jersey and 
Republicans John C. Danforth of Missouri, David Durenberger of Minnesota, Bob 
Packwood of Oregon and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.

COLUMN ONE; OUTLASTING A WINTER OF DISCONTENT; HOW COLD IS COLD? TRY A 
WINDCHILL OF 92 BELOW. SLICK ROADS KEEP SALT MINES RUNNING NONSTOP. A BANK 
ROBBER EVEN USES A SNOWMOBILE. MUCH OF THE U.S. IS STUNNED BY THIS SEASON'S 
SEVERITY.

<P>
 Even in a land where heated dipsticks, thermal underwear and glove liners are 
routine, this has been a winter to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard has broken more Great Lakes ice so far this season than in the 
last three winters combined. All-time low temperatures have been recorded in 16 
American cities. 
</P>
<P>
 So much snow has fallen in both the Midwest and the East that salt mines are 
operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to supply road crews with the 
ice-melting mineral. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people have had only four days off since Thanksgiving," said Bruce 
Higgins, manager of an Akzo Salt Inc. plant that mines deposits under Lake 
Erie. 
</P>
<P>
 His is important work. In the metropolis where a mayor who couldn't keep the 
streets clear lost his job in 1979, a Chicago Tribune headline writer declared 
a "salt crisis" Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 While aldermen complain about the cost of replenishing stockpiles, Mayor 
Richard M. Daley proved he knows his history. "The people want their salt," he 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of Pennsylvania even sent its National Guard to a mine in Upstate 
New York to speed the precious stuff on its way. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunning in its breadth, tenacity and severity, this wicked weather has put 
one question on millions of frozen lips: How are we ever going to get through 
this? 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the winter of '94 is good for the art of conversation. For 
years to come, the local raconteurs will tell of the "igloo effect" in 
Bethlehem, Pa.; the run on groceries in Louisville, and the practical man in 
Antioch, Ill., who robbed a bank and escaped by snowmobile. 
</P>
<P>
 The winter of '94 was the season a Chicago woman was found frozen, kneeling, 
but alive, on her floor. Temporary dams of ice chunks on rivers in West 
Virginia and Ohio created frigid floods -- there will be more, hydrologists 
promise, with the advent of the thaws. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 deaths, from snow-shovelers' heart attacks to cases of exposure 
suffered by the homeless, have been blamed on this year's onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a bad shot of cold air . . . nothing more than chaotic random 
nature," said John Christy, an atmospheric scientist at University of Alabama 
in Huntsville. But as he spoke, he gazed out his office window at an 
ice-entombed tree. "I don't know how to get home," he sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some portions of the country have actually enjoyed milder weather than usual. 
The Pacific Northwest, for example, is in the midst of its second warmest 
winter ever. Temperatures in the West and Southwest have been pleasant as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the last month, a goodly section of the nation has been shivering, 
slipping and sneezing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday alone, the storm line stretched from the Gulf Coast to New 
England, with ice-slick roads delaying the proceedings in two widely-publicized 
Texas cases: the Branch Davidian cult trial in San Antonio and selection of a 
jury in Ft. Worth to hear the ethics charges against Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to four inches of ice coated north and east Texas roadways, virtually 
paralyzing the Dallas-Ft. Worth area and snarling traffic as far south as San 
Antonio and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 New York City feels particularly beleaguered, with 11 snow storms so far. (The 
Northeast winter is the third coldest in history, as well). The Dakotas have 
been hit hard too. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the future, Weather Service meteorologist David Miskus forlornly 
predicts "no real letup this month." He expects temperatures near normal on the 
East Coast but below normal in the Midwest and Upper Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst freeze hit in mid-January, when a reading of 27 degrees below zero 
in Indianapolis broke a record set in 1894. 
</P>
<P>
 That may sound impressive, particularly to Californians. But at Devil's Lake, 
N.D., technically two degrees warmer, the torrents of whipping air made for an 
inhuman windchill reading of 92 below. 
</P>
<P>
 The town of 9,500 is 100 miles west of the state border with Minnesota and 
close to the geographic center of North America. But it felt more like the 
furthest reaches of the Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Devil's Lake fire station, Chief Bill Oehlke took it all in stride. 
"It's not a big hassle," he said. "Everyone knows what to do here." 
</P>
<P>
 That day, responding to a water main break, firefighters mummified themselves 
inside face masks, Air Force-style flight suits and Gore-tex parkas. The freeze 
rendered their water gauges inoperable. "The nice thing about having to go out 
in this kind of weather," Oehlke said, "is you don't hang around the scene once 
you're finished." 
</P>
<P>
 In relatively more temperate climes, no one was nearly as blase. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, D.C., shut down for several days last month, as the federal 
government told all non-essential employees to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 Power companies in the East, unused to the huge demand for heat, struggled to 
keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 Maple Glen, an affluent subdivision north of Philadelphia, was one place where 
the electric utilities failed. On two different weekends, Sue Klauder, her 
husband and her 3-month-old felt like pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their house has gas heat -- but electric thermostats. They went through half a 
cord of firewood in a few days, but the blaze kept only their living room warm. 
They had a kerosene heater, "but my husband had to drive four places to get 
kerosene," Klauder said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the refrigerator out of commission, they stored their meat in coolers out 
in the snow and their milk and eggs in the ground. At night, retrieving the 
makings for a meal, they could watch blue flashes -- power surges -- spark from 
the transformer boxes in their neighbors' yards. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, 600,000 out of 1.5 million Philadelphia Electric Co. customers 
were blacked out. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather problem in Bethlehem, further north, was dubbed the "igloo 
effect." When cook fires are built in the ice domes, water begins to drip down 
the interior walls. Similarly, when houses are buried under ice, warmth 
penetrates attic insulation. Water from melting snow and ice, blocked from 
running off the roof by more snow and ice, sinks through the roof and into the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Murphy thought one of his water pipes had burst and called a plumber. "He 
told me we needed a roofer," Murphy said. Water had picked up the shingles on 
his seven-year-old roof, buried under 18 inches of snow. He had to drill holes 
in his ceiling and walls to let the moisture out. His roofer told him to call 
back for repairs after the snow was all gone. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why, all over town, hand-scrawled signs now advertise: "Will Shovel 
Snow Off Roofs." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Louisville reeled from an 18-inch snowfall. It was not the first 
time; 16 inches dropped on the city in 1978. But the region was unprepared 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Normal car traffic was impossible. With most supermarkets closed, customers 
besieged any outlet where they could find basic supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 300 calls in one day asking if we were open," said Larry McCandless, 
who owns a gasoline station and grocery on Louisville's west side. "They 
completely ravaged our store, took everything -- bread, milk, chips, you name 
it. We did four times the amount of business we've ever done in a single day." 
</P>
<P>
 In Antioch, Ill., a man on a snowmobile pulled up to the drive-in window at a 
bank on Tuesday, displayed what appeared to be a pipe bomb, and demanded cash. 
He roared off into blizzard conditions after scooping up an undetermined amount 
of money put in the drawer by the frightened teller. By the time police 
negotiated snowbound roads in response to the alarm, the robber was long gone, 
his tracks disappearing under new snow. "He was just an opportunist," groused 
Lake County Sheriff's Lt. Chet Iwan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, a bastion of cold weather, the veterans of winter are better 
equipped. Letter carrier Kevin Henaghan trudged his 13-block route through the 
western suburbs swaddled in every piece of clothing the U.S. Postal Service 
issues except the summer shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 He wore long thermal underwear, pants, a shirt, a lined jacket, a down parka, 
regular socks, thermal socks, lined boots and a regulation ski mask. All that 
could be seen of his features were pale blue eyes through puffs of frozen 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
 On his rounds on a recent day where the windchill plunged to minus-60, he 
declined the coffee that his customers kept offering. Like his car, which he'd 
left running, he said, "If I stop, I won't start again." 
</P>
<P>
 All around Chicago, hardware stores know to stock a variety of gadgets to 
combat the freeze. Starting fluid to thaw out engine blocks. Gasoline 
anti-freeze to keep the fuel lines clear. Electrically heated dipsticks -- plug 
them in and keep them in the crankcase overnight to keep the engine oil from 
sludging up. 
</P>
<P>
 Lock de-icer is a staple. Plastic double-face tape keeps the chill from 
creeping past the window's edge. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dressel's Ace Hardware store in Oak Park, Ill., owner Ron Rogers watched 
the merchandise move with satisfaction during the worst of the cold. Behind the 
steamed-up windows, a cashier near the door wore gloves while she worked the 
register. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much," Rogers said, "for the greenhouse effect."

BRIEF SHELLING INTERRUPTS NEW SARAJEVO CEASE-FIRE; BOSNIA: U.S., U.N. OFFICIALS 
PLAY DOWN THE VIOLATION. IT STILL IS UNCLEAR WHETHER SERBS WILL HEED NATO 
ULTIMATUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.N.-negotiated cease-fire between Bosnian Serb and Muslim factions in 
Sarajevo went into effect as scheduled Thursday, but the truce was shattered 
briefly just before midnight when two artillery shells crashed into the city, 
accompanied by a barrage of machine-gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and U.N. officials played down the incident, saying it was difficult to 
tell which of Bosnia-Herzegovina's warring factions had fired the shells and 
suggesting that the violation may not have been sufficient to trigger 
retaliatory air strikes, as NATO has threatened. The machine-gun fire lasted 10 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports from the scene said the artillery shells exploded near the Vrbanja 
bridge, in a nearly empty section of the city that has not been turned over to 
U.N. peacekeeping forces. There were no immediate reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S. officials said it still was unclear whether Bosnia's Serbs 
planned to heed a NATO ultimatum to pull their heavy weapons -- including 
artillery, mortars, tanks and rockets -- out of a 12-mile zone surrounding the 
city within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Serbs have moved a handful of the heavy weapons they have placed 
near the city, a senior U.S. official said that there had "not been enough 
change" in the Serbian deployment to tell "whether they (the Serbian leaders) 
have made a decision on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs' actions are being watched closely as an early indication of whether 
the new North Atlantic Treaty Organization ultimatum is likely to ease tensions 
in Bosnia or bring about the first allied military intervention there since the 
fighting began 22 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian leaders gave conflicting signals. Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's 
Serbs, said that the artillery would be withdrawn soon. But Gen. Manojlo 
Milovanovic, head of the Bosnian Serb army, called a pullback "out of the 
question" in the face of the ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, reaction in Russia took a more positive turn as the Russian Foreign 
Ministry moved to ease the effects of criticism by Russian nationalists that 
NATO's ultimatum would damage U.S.-Russian relations. 
</P>
<P>
 At a briefing in Moscow, a Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters that 
NATO's call for Serbs and Muslims to withdraw their heavy artillery, or place 
it under U.N. control, is "essentially close to" a Russian proposal to create a 
demilitarized zone around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, Yuli Vorontsov, Russia's U.N. ambassador, called for an 
emergency meeting of the Security Council to revive the Russian proposal, which 
has been lying dormant for several months. But he said that Moscow would not 
try to block NATO action. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials appeared to be encouraged by the Russian response. President 
Clinton told reporters that "we have no reason to believe at this point that 
there's a serious problem with our going forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as the Clinton Administration sought to dampen 
expectations that the air strikes would destroy the Serbs' artillery and to 
assure the American public that the NATO action would not mark the start of an 
escalation of the action in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 At a briefing at the Pentagon, Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Walter B. 
Slocombe told reporters that the air strikes would be designed solely to reduce 
the amount of shelling on Sarajevo, not to knock out every Serbian artillery 
emplacement. 
</P>
<P>
 He asserted that the United States would not become trapped "on a slippery 
slope" that might lead to a full-fledged war in Bosnia, as some critics have 
feared. He called the limited air strikes "the only objective we have at this 
stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the apparent cooperation, the Administration appeared to be going out 
of its way to assuage the Russians. Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the 
United Nations, met with Vorontsov to discuss the Russian plan and apparently 
raised no objections. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry called the session "a good, 
constructive meeting on the subject of Bosnia and how to proceed at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton's efforts to telephone Yeltsin to discuss the issue 
were unsuccessful as the Russian president proved unreachable for the second 
day in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton characterized Sarajevo as "sort of the Humpty Dumpty" of Bosnia. "If 
you want everyone to be put back together again -- the country -- you've got to 
keep Sarajevo from total collapse," he said during a brief impromptu news 
conference at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the U.N. ultimatum, Bosnia's Serbs have until Feb. 21 to either withdraw 
their heavy weapons -- artillery, mortars, rockets and tanks -- from the 
Sarajevo area or turn them over to U.N. peacekeeping forces. If they do not, 
they will be subject to NATO air bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO warplanes are poised to launch immediate attacks in advance of the Feb. 
21 deadline on any Serbian artillery that fires on Sarajevo in violation of the 
cease-fire arranged on Wednesday. They also are authorized to respond to calls 
for help from U.N. peacekeeping troops that may be pinned down or under siege. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon warned that if the Serbs do not obey the NATO order, the allies 
will widen their list of targets to go beyond heavy weapons -- presumably to 
include ammunition dumps and supply depots. 
</P>
<P>
 While declining to cite specific examples, Slocombe said that the list extends 
"beyond simply the kind of weaponry which has to be moved out of the zone." He 
said the NATO order authorizes attacks on air-defense facilities as well. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Slocombe and Brig. Gen. James T. Hill, a planner for the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned that the military action being planned by NATO is 
limited in scope and designed only to reduce the shelling of Sarajevo by making 
it riskier for the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way that anyone can stand up here and guarantee you that we can 
go after and hit every artillery piece even if we could find it," Hill told 
reporters. "This is not an easy task." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they now believe that Bosnian Serb forces have between 200 
and 300 heavy weapons within the 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) exclusion zone that 
NATO has established around Sarajevo, rather than only 100, as officials had 
said on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In related action Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Administration officials were reportedly preparing to support the partition 
of Bosnia among the three warring factions if the opposing sides could agree on 
details as part of a peace accord. The Administration had previously opposed 
such a move in the face of the current fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 * A report in today's New York Times said U.S. officials have indicated a 
willingness to lift sanctions against Serbia on a step-by-step basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Britain suspended its aid convoys in Bosnia, calling the move a "prudent 
precaution" to prevent reprisals after Wednesday's action by NATO. The United 
Nations said that it, too, would withdraw aid workers from some key towns. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Geneva, the United Nations agreed to set up a special commission to 
investigate last weekend's massacre in a Sarajevo market, ending a threat by 
Serbs to walk out of the negotiations unless the United Nations brought in 
independent officials to conduct the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Pentagon made public new figures showing that the Bosnian Serb army has 
about 80,000 personnel, about 300 tanks and 200 armored personnel carriers, 
between 600 and 1,000 artillery pieces, 30 helicopters and 20 fighter aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Sonni Efron in Moscow contributed to this report. Past NATO 
Threats 
</P>
<P>
 NATO allies agreed this week to order air strikes against Bosnian Serb 
positions besieging Sarajevo unless they withdraw their weapons or put them 
under U.N. control within 10 days. But it is not the first time the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization has threatened to use air power in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's civil war. Here are some previous NATO threats: 
</P>
<P>
 'NO-FLY' ZONE: In March, 1993, the United Nations banned all unauthorized 
flights over Bosnia and authorized NATO to take "all necessary measures" to 
ensure compliance. One month later, NATO warplanes began patrolling Bosnian air 
space under "Operation Deny Flight." NATO claims the operation "effectively 
denied the use of air power by all three warring factions as an instrument of 
war." But hundreds of violations have been reported, notably by Serbian and 
Croatian helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 CLOSE AIR SUPPORT: In June, 1993, NATO foreign ministers agreed to provide air 
cover for U.N. peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. Since then, U.N. commanders under 
fire have been able to ask U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to send 
in planes to defend them. U.N. military commanders have criticized the process 
as being too slow and requested that they be given the right to call in 
attacks. U.N. figures say 33 peacekeepers were killed in war-related incidents 
through Dec. 31, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 AIR STRIKES: On Aug. 2, 1993, NATO announced it was preparing air strikes 
against the Bosnian Serbs if they continued their "strangulation" of Sarajevo 
and other Muslim "safe areas." A week later, the alliance approved air strikes 
in support of humanitarian action. In response to those threats, the Serbs 
pulled troops back from two mountains overlooking the Bosnian capital. But 
Serbian forces have continued to shell Sarajevo and have regularly blocked 
humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 TUZLA AND SREBRENICA: At a Jan. 11 NATO summit, President Clinton and other 
leaders repeated warnings of using air power to break the siege of Sarajevo. 
They also threatened air strikes if the Serbs refused to allow aid flights to 
land at Tuzla airport and permit Dutch U.N. troops to replace Canadian soldiers 
in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica. After that, the shelling of Sarajevo got 
deadlier, provoking the NATO ultimatum. The Dutch have still not been allowed 
into Srebrenica and Tuzla airport remains closed.

IRS LOSES MILLIONS IN FRAUD WITH ELECTRONIC TAX FILING; CRIME: REFUNDS ARE 
ISSUED SO QUICKLY THAT THE AGENCY HAS NO TIME TO CHECK FACTS AND MATH, THE GAO 
REPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service's fast-growing system for allowing taxpayers to 
file their returns electronically has brought with it a wave of fraud that is 
costing the government millions of dollars, federal investigators reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Refunds for electronic returns are issued so quickly that the IRS cannot check 
all of them in time to catch cyberspace outlaws, the General Accounting Office 
told members of a House subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic filing has been a point of pride with the IRS, welcomed as a big 
stride along the government's vaunted information highway. But it appears that 
electronic filing could become a highway rest stop that beckons crooks and 
thieves: False filing of returns by computer soared 105% last year, said the 
GAO, the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS "has perfected the art of using its computers to give out tax refunds 
quickly without making a corresponding effort in the area of fraud controls," 
said Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means oversight 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Thievery is relatively easy because the IRS often has as little as two days to 
investigate and stop a fraudulent refund after an electronic filing, compared 
with four to eight weeks for the traditional paper return. "The very thing that 
appeals to taxpayers -- faster refunds -- also increases IRS' vulnerability to 
fraud," the GAO reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic filing, in which an individual's tax return is transmitted by 
computer to the IRS, was first offered nationwide in 1990 and has grown 
rapidly. Last year, 12 million of the 115 million individual federal tax 
returns were filed electronically. The IRS' ambitious game plan calls for 
collecting 80 million returns electronically by the year 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 The detection of fraudulent electronic filing rose to 25,633 returns during 
the first 10 months of last year, a 105% increase over the 12,488 bogus returns 
detected during the same period a year earlier. The false returns detected last 
year claimed refunds of $53 million, but the IRS was only able to stop $29 
million before the refunds were issued. 
</P>
<P>
 And these figures could represent just the tip of the iceberg of criminality, 
GAO investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Electronic filing fraud is a problem whose true dimensions are unknown," said 
Jennie S. Stathis, GAO's director of tax policy and administration issues, at a 
congressional hearing convened by Pickle's oversight panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of identified fraudulent electronic returns is relatively small, 
but the rate of growth is high and it is uncertain how much fraud might be 
going undetected," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A taxpayer who wants to file electronically must work through an individual or 
a company authorized by the IRS to file returns by computer. The taxpayer's 
information is entered into the approved firm's computer, then transmitted to 
the IRS computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the authorized firms can prepare and send the tax returns. Others act 
only as conduits, sending returns as submitted to them by taxpayers without 
checking their arithmetic or facts. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS' primary means of detecting bogus returns is to examine a sample group 
of returns after they have been filed. The agency discovered that as many as a 
third of the crooked electronic filers were people using false names and Social 
Security numbers on their returns. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS rules say that firms transmitting electronic returns must mail supporting 
paperwork -- a document with the taxpayer's signature along with W-2 forms and 
other income verification. These documents must be sent within a day after the 
return is filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, however, the paper is not sent until after the refunds are issued, 
and sometimes it is never sent. IRS rules say firms that transmit tax returns 
electronically will be suspended for failing to send documents but the agency 
rarely enforces the rule, the GAO complained. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO said in a December report to Congress that taxpayers who want to file 
electronically should be required to submit two pieces of identification, one 
with a photograph, to the firm doing the electronic filing. "The IRS has since 
decided not to require but only recommend that two forms of identification be 
required," Stathis told the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson said her agency is vigilant in 
chasing false filers. With the current tax season only six weeks old, "we have 
already detected approximately 200 schemes involving approximately 3,000 
attempts to file fraudulent claims on returns," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have already suspended several unscrupulous return preparers from the 
electronics system, initiated numerous criminal investigations and executed 
search warrants to obtain evidence," she said.

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / ALAN C. MILLER: LAWMAKERS BREAK RANKS TO STEER AID 
BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) is a liberal former assembly line worker 
and United Auto Workers representative. His solidly Democratic suburban 
district is home to many Latino and Asian residents whose families came to 
Southern California to seek a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) is a conservative if pragmatic former insurance 
executive and state legislator. His bedrock Republican district encompasses 
part of sprawling San Bernardino County, where predominantly white residents 
have settled in search of affordable housing and traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres and Lewis have little in common. But last week both broke ranks with 
key allies to help steer the $8.6-billion California earthquake aid bill 
through the House with uncharacteristic swiftness. 
</P>
<P>
 Their involvement turned on two potential obstacles to the $8.6-billion 
measure to assist the Los Angeles region's recovery and rebuilding: a divisive 
fight over benefits for illegal immigrants and a time-consuming battle over 
efforts to pay for the disaster assistance with cuts in other federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first showdown was in the House Appropriations Committee, where Rep. Ron 
Packard (R-Oceanside) pressed an amendment to deny an individual all but 
emergency medical services when it was "made known" to a federal agency that 
the applicant was in the country unlawfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Democrats, particularly Latinos and civil libertarians, found this 
offensive. Torres was among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever there is a disaster in Mexico City, Bangladesh or elsewhere, 
Americans are the first ones there and we never say we can't help these 
people," Torres said this week. "You can't deny people here what we so 
generously give away from our borders." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Democratic leaders realized that the measure had broad bipartisanship 
support. Moreover, it could put them in the politically untenable position of 
defending aid to illegal immigrants in California at a time when the state was 
asking the rest of the nation to ante up record relief sums. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats also realized that resolving the issue in the Appropriations 
Committee, where television cameras and tape recorders are barred, was far 
preferable to airing it on the House floor before a national audience. There, 
Democrats feared a harsher amendment would prevail -- a concern underscored 
when the Senate later adopted more restrictive language. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, an Appropriations member, joined Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) 
in negotiations with Packard and Lewis, another panelist, to strike the word 
made -- with its connotation of third-party finger-pointing -- from the made 
known phrasing of the amendment. If no one reported a person's legal status, 
they figured, it would not be asked. 
</P>
<P>
 And they spelled out a range of emergency services that illegal immigrants 
would still receive, including shelter, food, water and medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Even this largely symbolic gesture provoked bitter debate. Hispanic Caucus 
Chairman Jose E. Serrano called it "immigrant bashing" and "mean-spirited." But 
when it ran into an initial snag, Torres stood up and reintroduced it. It 
passed moments later. 
</P>
<P>
 By stepping forward, Torres signaled not only the unanimous support of 
California Democrats on the powerful panel but also divisions within the 
Hispanic Caucus. He also assured himself of backlash among some immigrants' 
rights allies, even if many understood or even supported his action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people look at this as betrayal," another California Democrat said. "It 
was giving ground, whether symbolic or not." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, meanwhile, was the lone Republican who from the start took a lead role 
in opposing precedent-setting proposals to pay for the emergency aid with 
budget cuts. Such efforts to keep the federal deficit in check are an article 
of faith among many Republicans, including most Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lewis, whose district was little damaged by the Northridge quake, argued 
that such offsets could lead to drawn-out negotiations with the Senate over 
specific reductions and hold up the desperately needed relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very gutsy," said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who worked 
with Lewis. "He kept it from being a massive Republican leadership issue." 
</P>
<P>
 As he lobbied colleagues, Lewis risked reviving criticism in some quarters 
that he is too accommodating with the Democrats. Some say this contributed to 
his painful defeat as chairman of the GOP conference in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry has always been a guy who plays by the rules that he thinks can be most 
effective," a California Republican said. "In many ways, that's why he's no 
longer the conference chair."

MCA WARNED NOT TO SEEK QUAKE FUNDS FOR SUBWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Entertainment giant MCA Inc. and local transit officials, who are trying to 
win federal funds to defray the costs of relocating a subway station planned to 
serve the Universal Studios theme park, were warned Thursday not to seek money 
intended for earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting at the behest of Supervisor Michael Antonovich, a committee of the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority instructed the agency's lobbyists to 
cease seeking any funds for the station relocation that would otherwise go 
toward paying for the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raiding the last resources available to many desperate victims is not wise or 
ethical public policy," Antonovich said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation regarding use of the overall $8.6-billion earthquake relief 
package that is now before Congress first surfaced Wednesday. At a meeting of 
the MTA's Executive Management Committee, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and 
other officials indicated that part of the $100 million to be spent at 
President Clinton's discretion might be used at Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the President's discretionary money on the emergency funds -- I've heard 
that $42 million has been set aside for the Universal Station," Riordan told 
the agency's chief federal government lobbyist. "Have you heard anything on 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The lobbyist, Arthur Sohikian, answered: "At this point, it is still at the 
discretion of the President, how he spends that money. . . . But yes, that, 
that has been discussed, Mr. Mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, the chairman of the MTA and a 
co-chairman of Clinton's 1992 campaign in California, said at the meeting on 
Wednesday that the Administration supported spending part of the discretionary 
earthquake relief funds for the station relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's safe to say that the President is very sympathetic," Alatorre 
said. ". . . Within that $100 million, I think it's safe to say the President 
has every intention of providing, if needed, some monies to change the 
station." 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre could not be reached for comment late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of MCA said Thursday that the company, owned by Japan-based 
Matsushita Corp., is seeking federal funds to offset the station relocation 
costs, but is not pursuing any revenue targeted for disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not looking for earthquake funds in any way, shape or form," said 
Christine Hanson, a lobbyist for MCA. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, an aide to Clinton also said that no deal has been struck to 
spend any of the President's $100 million of discretionary funds for the 
station relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This money can only be used for earthquake repairs," said Tom Epstein, 
special assistant to the President for political affairs. "It can not be used 
for the (subway) project you describe. Anybody who has an understanding to the 
contrary is mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
 Sohikian, the MTA lobbyist, noted in an interview that the MTA board directed 
his staff last month to work jointly with MCA to seek any available federal 
funds to pay for the costs of relocating the station and the twin tunnels that 
are to serve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the President will use those (discretionary) funds for what he 
and the Administration sees fit. Hopefully, part of that will be for some 
transportation, for what people in the city of Los Angeles need to get home at 
night."

SCHOOLS ACCUSED OF IGNORING QUAKE SAFETY; AFTERMATH: DISASTER TRAINING IS 
OVERLOOKED, PTA OFFICIAL SAYS. A PANEL STUDYING THE STATE'S SEISMIC STANDARDS 
IS ALSO TOLD THAT SLOPPY CONSTRUCTION IS A MAJOR FACTOR IN DAMAGE. 
</P>

<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District has ignored a state law mandating that 
schools be prepared for an earthquake and was lucky its 640,000 students were 
not in class when the Jan. 17 quake struck, a top PTA disaster planner told the 
California Seismic Safety Commission on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The district "has long ignored the warnings and advice of disaster 
preparedness experts and the legal mandate to prepare district schools," 
including providing disaster training for officials at every school, said Helen 
Fallon, chairwoman of the 10th District Parent Teacher Student Assn.'s 
disaster/earthquake preparedness committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools had emergency first aid kits with missing or expired medicines, 
and some lacked inventories of emergency provisions, basic search and rescue 
equipment and staff members trained in disaster response, Fallon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the collective good fortune of LAUSD parents that because of the 
timing of this earthquake, the state of emergency preparedness in LAUSD schools 
was not tested," she told the commission meeting in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson had left the meeting before she spoke and could not be 
reached for comment. School district spokeswoman Diana Munatones said the 
district is in compliance with state laws mandating that schools have 
preparedness plans and emergency supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do everything that we are legally required to do," Munatones said. "It's 
not a matter of ignoring state laws. It's a matter of saying what can we do 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon, along with commission member Paul Fratessa, also expressed concern 
over unsafe conditions in classrooms that led to toppled bookcases, file 
cabinets and other equipment and fixtures that would have injured children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had the Northridge earthquake occurred only a few hours later . . . many 
district employees would be surprised to find themselves personally liable for 
long ignoring dangerous conditions at their school and failing to take steps to 
remedy (them)," Fallon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Structural engineering leaders also told the commission on Thursday that 
sloppy construction techniques and poor engineering of seismic safety features 
were to blame for considerable damage in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some buildings that were retrofitted before the Jan. 17 quake still failed 
because builders had forgotten to secure walls to foundations, according to 
Rawn Nelson, the president-elect of the Structural Engineers Assn. of 
California. In some cases, he said, bolts were sitting alongside the plates 
they were supposed to secure. 
</P>
<P>
 As the commission began a three-day hearing near the Van Nuys Airport, an 
emissary from Gov. Pete Wilson gave the panel its marching orders: Report back 
to Wilson by Sept. 1 on the adequacy of current seismic construction standards 
in the state's many quake-prone areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is vital that we learn all we can from this tragedy and, if possible, 
improve building seismic standards to protect life and property in future 
quakes," Wilson declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, leading structural engineers had admonished the commission, 
chaired by Caltech engineering professor Wilfred D. Iwan, that it must look 
immediately at setting higher construction code standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said he and his colleagues had found damage in every kind of building, 
including the modern steel-reinforced structures that had been thought most 
resistant to earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not always evident at first, but when you strip off the fireproofing, 
you find some of these steel buildings have heavy damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current president of the Structural Engineers Assn., Arthur E. Ross, added 
that inflexible or non-ductile concrete buildings often shattered instead of 
absorbing the force of the earthquake, and he termed these buildings perhaps "a 
larger threat (to safety) than (is found) in unreinforced masonry buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 The vertical force of the Northridge earthquake also called into question the 
effectiveness of base-isolation construction techniques meant to absorb 
horizontal shaking without damage to medium high-rises, the engineers said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for seismic retrofits that had been undertaken in many buildings, Nelson 
said, "There has been good performance in most cases with all these retrofits, 
if they were properly designed and constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That last issue is very important," he said. "One of the items that we have 
commonly found is there has been some poor methods of construction as well as 
some engineering done that did not understand the basic principles of 
engineering." 
</P>
<P>
 So, Nelson and Ross suggested, the Seismic Safety Commission must consider new 
means of educating builders in how to retrofit and new requirements for more 
rigid inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 L. Thomas Tobin, the staff director of the commission, said that "without 
question" the commission "will recommend both upgrades and reinforcement of 
present codes" to make buildings safer in quakes, although he and other 
speakers cautioned there is no such thing as making a structure 100% safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the witnesses were Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and the director of 
the state Office of Emergency Services, Richard Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
 Both indicated that the authorities had been hard-pressed to perform all 
essential services in the immediate wake of the earthquake. Noting that his own 
cellular phone did not work at first, Riordan said that emergency 
communications need to be improved. He said he had to find a police station so 
he could establish communications with emergency coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews warned that if the quake had occurred later in the day, or been just a 
little more powerful, there would have been so many people trapped in damaged 
buildings and parking structures that it would have exceeded the capacity of 
available rescue teams to tend to them.

SBA RAISES LOAN CAP TO AID LARGER FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of businesses too large to benefit from the federal government's first 
round of earthquake relief loans are likely to qualify in the future for the 
program, the head of the Small Business Administration said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Erskine B. Bowles said the federal agency will raise its $1.5-million loan cap 
for many companies that need more cash to stay in business and preserve jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowles made the announcement in Los Angeles after meeting earlier in the day 
with city officials, lenders, business people and landlords. Representatives of 
several other federal agencies also announced regulatory changes that they said 
will accelerate the region's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA administrator was responding to complaints from many medium-size 
businesses that they were falling through a gap in federal relief regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bowles said loans greater than $1.5 million will be approved for companies 
that employ more than 1,000 workers or more than 10% of the labor force in a 
particular industry. "I think that will do enough so that most of the 
medium-size businesses qualify," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA loans can be repaid over as much as 30 years at interest rates as low 
as 3.63%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowles said the relief applications in Los Angeles continue to dwarf those in 
other natural disasters, with more than 260,000 individuals already interviewed 
by SBA employees and about one-tenth that number filing applications for 
business and housing loans. In comparison, 18,790 victims had been interviewed 
during the same period following Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 During a disaster the SBA, which normally provides business loans, is also 
authorized to make loans to repair or replace homes and personal property. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other federal agencies said they are taking steps to encourage lenders 
to ease credit arrangements with business people and property owners who 
suffered quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Comptroller of the Currency Gene Ludwig said his agency will not judge 
national banks adversely if they extend credit to borrowers at higher than 
standard loan-to-value ratios. Bank examiners will also not blame those banks 
for high delinquency rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Housing Administration officials said they have strongly recommended 
to lenders that they hold off on late mortgage charges, suspend reporting of 
delinquencies to credit bureaus and help borrowers to refinance, if possible.

MARCH FONG EU QUITS AS SECRETARY OF STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State March Fong Eu, who has been nominated by President Clinton 
to be U.S. ambassador to Micronesia, announced Thursday that she is resigning 
and will go to Washington for Senate confirmation hearings. The resignation is 
effective next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson is not expected to appoint a replacement because of the short 
time before the election, which would make it difficult for an appointee to 
obtain state Senate and Assembly confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 The job will be done on a temporary basis by Chief Deputy Tony Miller, who has 
declared his candidacy for the position. Eu has endorsed Miller, a fellow 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno), Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) 
and Democrat Mike Woo, a former Los Angeles city councilman, also are running 
for Eu's position. 
</P>
<P>
 Eu said her proudest accomplishments while secretary of state for 20 years 
include obtaining mail voter registration, sponsoring the establishment of the 
state World Trade Commission, and getting federal approval of legislation 
allowing voters to register at the Department of Motor Vehicles and other state 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also have served as a successful role model for women and minorities," she 
said, "and that has been a source of much pride to me." 
</P>
<P>
 First elected secretary of state in 1974, Eu, 71, won by a record vote of 
nearly 3 million. She was the first woman ever elected to the post. 
</P>
<P>
 She previously served as assemblywoman representing Oakland and part of Castro 
Valley. As a legislator, Eu initiated a drive to abolish pay toilets for women 
and pushed through the necessary legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 She reaped nationwide publicity when she wielded a sledgehammer to smash a 
toilet on the Capitol steps for the benefit of television cameras and newspaper 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Eu was beaten and robbed by an ax-wielding assailant in her Hancock 
Park home. After Eu gave him $400, the man fled. She recovered and her 
assailant was convicted of several felony burglary counts. He was sentenced to 
25 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Eu considered running for U.S. Senate in 1988, but decided not to make the 
race because her husband, Henry Eu, would not disclose his financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, Matt Fong, is a Republican who was appointed to the State Board of 
Equalization by Gov. Pete Wilson. Fong is running for the office of state 
treasurer.

CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE; BOSNIANS AIRLIFTED TO U.S. FOR MEDICAL CARE ARE STRANDED 
BY WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mustafa Pajevic, a Bosnian soldier who was brought to the United States in an 
emergency humanitarian airlift in July to save his grenade-shattered left leg, 
is stranded in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Pajevic is one of 19 disabled Bosnians who were flown from Bosnia to the 
United States in the first medical rescue mission out of the war-torn country. 
</P>
<P>
 Now this group, including 10 people who were hospitalized in Southern 
California, recently learned that their expected repatriation will be 
indefinitely delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to speak English and holding tourist visas that make it impossible for 
them to work or receive public assistance, they are dependent on the charity of 
volunteers, who are seeing their own finances stretched to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Pajevic was released from Irvine Medical Center four months ago, he has 
lived with three families, moving whenever he felt the cost of his upkeep had 
become a burden on their generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the time I am on the move," Pajevic said through an interpreter. He now 
lives with two Bosnian American brothers in Laguna Niguel. "I don't know where 
I am going to end (up). . . . I may wind up on the street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Organization for Migration, the Swiss-based rescue group 
that arranged the airlift from Sarajevo, had intended that the Bosnian patients 
would return to their homeland shortly after they were released from the 
hospitals where they were treated. But that plan was scuttled after the 
conflict in Bosnia intensified.  
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees informed the rescue group in 
December that international law forbids men of fighting age from being returned 
to a war zone such as Bosnia. So unless they can change their tourist status, 
the Bosnians will remain charity cases. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the responsibility for supporting the Bosnians treated in Southern 
California has fallen primarily on the local Muslim community, including a 
handful of Bosnian American families, many of whom say they are already 
hard-pressed trying to assist relatives displaced by the war -- both those in 
Bosnia and others who have immigrated here. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers buy groceries, pay other living expenses and drive the Bosnian 
visitors to doctors' appointments. These benefactors say that representatives 
of the Swiss rescue agency assured them their services would be required for no 
more than three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now we are in the sixth month and there is no end in sight," said Ramza 
Saliefendic, a Los Angeles resident who is one of the volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each month, six families in Los Angeles and Orange counties contribute money 
to a pool to support six Bosnians -- including a baby who came for heart 
surgery, and a double amputee -- who are living temporarily in a donated 
two-bedroom apartment in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Suad Krso, who lost both legs in a grenade blast in Bosnia and came to the 
United States for surgery to prepare him for artificial legs, had lived as a 
house guest in Torrance and Garden Grove before moving into the Van Nuys 
apartment with other disabled Bosnians. Krso, who is being treated at the Los 
Alamitos Medical Center, says they live together so they can help each other 
with daily tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our self-respect," Krso said through an interpreter. "We were always 
self-supporting people, and we don't like to be a burden." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Krso and his roommates are grateful for the refuge from the fighting, 
most say they are eager to return to their homeland when the war subsides. 
</P>
<P>
 Mufid Sokolovich, president of the American Bosnia-Herzegovina Assn., a 
nonprofit organization in Santa Ana that raises funds for the international 
Bosnian relief effort, said his group is renting a four-bedroom house in 
Cerritos where about 10 Bosnians, including Pajevic and those in the Van Nuys 
apartment, will move this month.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the July airlift, the number of Bosnians entering the United States for 
medical help has grown. The Swiss rescue agency said its medical mission has 
evacuated 362 people from Bosnia, 57 of whom have been brought to the United 
States, with the remainder going to other Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting very good response from hospitals and doctors, and we are 
bringing in people practically every week," said Hans-Petter Boe, chief of 
mission at the agency's office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the plight of the evacuees from Bosnia, the State Department is 
considering halting future medical airlifts of Bosnians to this country or 
changing the immigration status of future medical evacuees to make them 
eligible for welfare and other public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Immigration and Naturalization Service officials say Bosnians 
will have no trouble remaining legally in the United States when their tourist 
visas expire in August. They will qualify under "temporary protective status," 
which would allow them to seek employment but does not give them the kind of 
federal financial assistance that people with refugee status receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Mujo Bjelonja, 41, is an electronic engineer who is making rapid progress 
learning English, according to officials at Garfield Medical Center in Monterey 
Park. Bjelonja came to the hospital severely undernourished and unable to walk, 
but now can walk with a cane, thanks to extensive medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane McDermed, a hospital social worker, said the hospital feels a 
responsibility to Bjelonja. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plan for him is to get him vocational rehabilitation and maybe some 
occupation," she said. "We brought him over here. Because other people dropped 
the ball, we aren't going to."

EUROPE; BRITISH GOVERNMENT NOT SOLD ON SUBURBAN SHOPPING MALLS; DEVELOPMENT 
HALTS AS OFFICIALS COMPLAIN THAT THE POPULAR CENTERS CAUSE GRIDLOCK AND DRAW 
BUSINESS AWAY FROM CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 While the world may have an insatiable appetite for music, movies and fast 
food from the United States, at least one American cultural icon has drawn the 
ire of officials here and may be on its way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Woe be to the British version of Los Angeles' shopping-crazy Valley Girls and 
Boys: Officials suddenly are saying "no way" to suburban malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such commercial centers have become a big hit with British consumers 
who enjoy the convenience of parking in huge lots and shopping in a variety of 
stores -- up to 300 outlets in bigger malls -- the projects create massive 
traffic jams, particularly on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 This gridlock -- and the malls' effects on other, more established retail 
districts -- has prompted Prime Minister John Major's government to step in 
this week to call a halt to unrestricted development that promotes the 
construction of large shopping centers just outside of Britain's provincial 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Environment, which has ultimate control over national zoning 
matters, presented its new program in Parliament, which could effectively call 
a halt to the kind of mall-ing of suburban America. 
</P>
<P>
 Environment Secretary John Gummer told Parliament his objections to large new 
projects were twofold: 
</P>
<P>
 * Huge malls tend to attract thousands of cars, crowding local highways and 
polluting the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Malls have drawn business away from smaller cities' main streets, known 
locally as "high streets," resulting in economic recession inside Britain's 
quaint towns. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gummer put it: "I want to see us improve the quality of our towns so that 
we can reduce the pressures of urban sprawl and the development of green-field 
sites. That means encouraging new shopping development to locations in centers 
or within walking distance. We may also need to discourage development on 
green-field sites on the edge of cities, where it would result in an 
unacceptable impact on a town center." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Britain has seen the completion of some of the largest 
shopping malls in Europe, including MetroCentre, Gateshead, near the 
northeastern city of Newcastle; Meadowhall, outside Sheffield; Merry Hill, 
Dudley, near Birmingham, and Thurrock, Lakeside, northeast of London. 
</P>
<P>
 Gummer recently rejected another huge project near the university city of 
Cambridge, declaring the mall would create giant traffic snarls and would have 
damaging effects on the vitality of the historic town. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other large malls near the major cities of Manchester and Bristol and in 
southeast London have previously received local planning approval, but their 
developers are nervously waiting to see whether they may be scrapped by the 
Department of Environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers and retailers, of course, have rushed to defend the mall concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that shopping centers and town center retailing can live and 
survive together," said Heather Davis, marketing manager of Thurrock, Lakeside 
Center, which opened in 1990, has a 12,000-space parking lot and is visited by 
350,000 shoppers during peak weeks. "The consumer is attracted to the shopping 
centers because of easy parking, access for the disabled and sometimes creche 
(child-care) facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the town center offers this, more people will be attracted to shop there," 
Davis said. "There will be a consumer demand for (our) shopping centers until 
the town centers can offer what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gummer still may have the last word. As one of his officials put it: "In 
the future, the bigger the development, the less likely it will be built. 
Effectively, there are not going to be any more of the big ones."

ASIA; JAPANESE PREMIER STUMBLES ON ROCKY POLITICAL LANDSCAPE; HOSOKAWA'S PUBLIC 
SUPPORT IS DOWN 37% ON EVE OF SUMMIT WITH CLINTON. EVEN A REBOUND IN THE POLLS 
MIGHT NOT BRING HIM THE AUTHORITY HE NEEDS. 
</P>

<P>
 He is the "war criminal of the 7% tax," one magazine blared. An "alien prime 
minister" masquerading as Mr. Clean who actually gives and takes sweetheart 
deals to favored firms, trumpeted another. 
</P>
<P>
 He uses "Hitler-like tactics" and back-room bargaining despite pledges to 
usher in a new era of open government. And, in one poll, his public support had 
plunged a whopping 37% in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Can this be Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's fresh-faced prime minister who was 
supposed to be an agent of change and voice for reform? Is this the man blessed 
with public approval ratings in the 70% range despite taking controversial 
action to open Japan's rice market, squarely apologize for the nation's wartime 
misdeeds and tackle political reform? 
</P>
<P>
 As Hosokawa meets President Clinton today, it is clear his public standing 
has, at least temporarily, taken a steep dive. This month's political snafu, in 
which he abruptly announced a new 7% tax increase, then was forced to renounce 
it by the ensuing public uproar, shook public trust and prompted a stream of 
unflattering headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The honeymoon between Mr. Hosokawa and the public is ending," said Seizaburo 
Sato, a Tokyo University professor emeritus affiliated with a think tank 
established by former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of the Liberal 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Americans have too rosy a picture of his abilities. He looks young and 
fresh. But he is not so talented or smart. He lacks experience. And his 
political base is weak, so he's an easy target to be manipulated by the 
bureaucrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the redoubtable Hosokawa can't spring back. His support ratings, 
ranging from 52% to 59%, may be his lowest. But that is still considerably 
higher than past prime ministers enjoyed: The popular Toshiki Kaifu drew an 
average 48%; Noboru Takeshita's plunged to 3% just before his resignation in 
the money-for-stocks Recruit scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 With his telegenic appeal and aristocratic elegance, Hosokawa has somehow 
weathered not only policy snafus, but also negative coverage of his "women 
problem" and alleged sweetheart deals with the giant Seibu group and the 
gangster-linked Sagawa Kyubin transport firm.  
</P>
<P>
 "His administration has proven more resilient than most people anticipated," 
said Kuniko Inoguchi, a political science professor at Tokyo's Sophia 
University. "People forgive him because he's young, inexperienced and because 
they think he's trying to do something new in a very traditional setting." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, she said, "Clinton has no alternative to Hosokawa." 
</P>
<P>
 But how effectively Hosokawa can manage his end of the U.S.-Japan relationship 
may ultimately have little to do with his public standing at home.  
</P>
<P>
 For the United States, the more important questions are: 
</P>
<P>
 Do Hosokawa's decisions carry final authority? Not necessarily, as his tax 
fiasco starkly illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever summit agreements may or may not be reached today, does Hosokawa have 
the power to force the mighty bureaucracy to implement them as the United 
States expects? Almost certainly not. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hosokawa pledged to curtail the power of the bureaucrats when he 
became prime minister last August, in fact, say many analysts, they have become 
stronger because the inexperienced coalition government has had to rely more on 
their expertise. So far, bureaucrats have resisted other Hosokawa pledges, such 
as far-ranging deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 And is Hosokawa -- or his seven-party coalition -- likely to be in power 
beyond the year? Perhaps not. As Yomiuri newspaper political editor Shoichi 
Oikawa put it: "The critical point is not whether the (tax) affair will 
undermine his popularity. What matters most is that it has caused a deep crack 
in his political power base." 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts here see an inevitable split in the coalition between the forces 
of Ichiro Ozawa, the Japan Renewal Party official who wants Japan to take a 
more aggressive international role, and those of Masayoshi Takemura, the New 
Party Harbinger leader who urges a more circumspect role for Japan as a "small 
but shining nation." 
</P>
<P>
 For the United States, that will make the political landscape even more 
difficult to fathom.

U.S. DEBATES FIRMER STAND ON JAPAN TRADE; DIPLOMACY: OFFICIALS DIVIDED ON HOW 
MUCH PRESSURE TO APPLY OVER GROWING IMBALANCE AS TWO LEADERS PREPARE TO MEET.

<P>
 Several years ago, when Tsutomu Hata was the agriculture minister in the 
Japanese government run by the Liberal Democrats, he drew a firm line: Not a 
grain of foreign rice would be allowed into Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he is foreign minister in the governing coalition that overthrew the 
Liberal Democrats. And he is asking President Clinton to understand the 
political pressures his prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, is facing as the new 
government tries to redesign Japan's economic and political systems. The two 
leaders will meet today. 
</P>
<P>
 The arguments made over the years by Hata, who met Thursday with senior 
Administration officials as they tried to head off a collision between their 
two governments, parallels the debate among the Japan experts in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 They are thrashing out whether now is the time to finally draw a firm line of 
their own by insisting that Japan drop its decades-long defense against foreign 
access to its lucrative markets. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side are the "revisionists," among them U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor, Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, and Bowman Cutter, a 
senior White House economics adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 They are adamant: It is time to hold Hosokawa to a pledge made by his 
predecessor, the last of the Liberal Democrats' prime ministers, who promised 
within six months to establish a framework of "quantitative indicators" for 
greater foreign access in four key trade groups. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side are the "chrysanthemums" -- a term taken from the seat of 
Japanese royalty, the Chrysanthemum throne. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that the United States must recognize the efforts Hosokawa has 
already undertaken, as well as the difficulties he has encountered trying to 
stimulate the Japanese economy with tax cuts that are vehemently opposed by the 
powerful bureaucrats of the Japanese government. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a nutshell, I have a feeling the Clinton people have become like the 
proverbial mouse trapped in a corner by a cat," said Ronald Aqua, vice 
president of the U.S.-Japan Foundation. "They don't know which way to run." 
</P>
<P>
 Within the State Department, said one Administration official, some are 
worried that the single-minded focus on economic issues and the unyielding 
stance dictated by the White House will weaken the other pillars of the 
U.S.-Japanese relationship. Those include a security partnership that has ebbed 
in importance with the end of the Cold War but continues to carry weight 
because of uncertainties over North Korea and the broader political 
relationship in which Japan is frequently a partner of the United States in 
such areas as combatting pollution and global population growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is concern that the other matters might fall by the wayside in the 
debate over economic issues," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the exception of the few voices at the State Department, senior 
Administration officials say they are unanimous in their insistence that there 
will be no retreat to an agreement that papers over the differences. And, they 
say, there is little risk to the strength of the overall U.S.-Japanese 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it is still a stable relationship, and I would not say it is 
permanently damaged in any sense," Altman said. "But the economic imbalance has 
to be corrected and the relationship will not be able to remain as solid as it 
should, absent that." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Thursday, groups of senior and mid-level U.S. officials met with 
their Japanese counterparts, probing for a willingness on the part of the 
visitors to agree to a measurable framework that would increase Japan's imports 
in four economic sectors: autos and auto parts, telecommunications equipment, 
medical equipment and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 For one reason or another, each sector has erected nearly insurmountable 
barriers to foreign firms. The four were agreed upon during Clinton's Tokyo 
visit last July as the first targets in the attempt to bring down Japan's trade 
surplus. That imbalance reached $132 billion last year, nearly half of it with 
the United States. By nightfall Thursday, there was no substantial progress to 
report, Altman said. 
</P>
<P>
 What had given U.S. officials hope was the centerpiece of Hosokawa's campaign 
program: deregulation of the rigid Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the arguments you hear is this (U.S.) approach is not necessary 
because they are deregulating and opening up. Up to this point, it's all 
rhetoric and there is no deregulation," said a senior Administration official 
who monitors the U.S.-Japanese relationship. "We do not know any other way of 
prying (the Japanese) market open." 
</P>
<P>
 There is little sympathy among senior U.S. officials for the political 
predicament in which Hosokawa finds himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried to give him as much running room as we can," a senior Clinton 
aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the official said, "we've told them: 'The time is up.' "

U.S. BUSINESSMAN IN CHILE WORKS FROM THE GROUND UP; CROPS: HE HOPES TO BECOME A 
MAJOR CRANBERRY PRODUCER -- MAYBE EVEN NO. 1. HE ALSO WANTS TO SELL HIS PRODUCT 
WHERE FEW PEOPLE NOW THIRST FOR IT. 
</P>

<P>
 California businessman Warren Simmons is betting big on cranberries. He's 
investing millions of dollars to plant 1,000 acres of cranberries in this 
nation, where the fruit has never been produced commercially. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons hopes to become a major cranberry producer -- maybe even No. 1 in the 
world. He also hopes that juice from his crop can be sold in Europe or Asia -- 
where hardly anyone now thirsts for the product. 
</P>
<P>
 Can it be done? That depends on many things, including bugs and bumblebees. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, 66, is the first to admit he is taking a plunge. He is not a farmer, 
much less a juice-maker or a mass-marketer. But he does have some impressive 
business successes behind him, plus some considerable capital to gamble. And he 
believes in bumblebees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I start talking about bumblebees, I talk all day," he says as he begins a 
tour through some of the farmland he is developing near Valdivia, in southern 
Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 A former airline pilot, Simmons started the Tia Maria restaurant chain in the 
early 1970s, then developed San Francisco's Pier 39 commercial complex. With 
his son, Scooter, he founded Chevys Mexican Restaurants, which had 37 outlets 
when they sold out to Pepsico's Taco Bell Corp. in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at Chevys that Simmons first focused on cranberries. He ordered fresh 
cranberries for making margarita cocktails but, as he recalls it, Ocean Spray 
Cranberries Inc. was unable to fill the order because of shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 After visiting Chile to explore the possibility of producing wine grapes here, 
he decided that cranberries could be more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 American demand for cranberries is strong, while North American land suitable 
for growing them is in short supply. When the fruit was mainly used for sauces 
and jellies, there was plenty to go around. But Ocean Spray's successful 
promotion of cranberry juice has expanded the market enormously. 
</P>
<P>
 The perennial cranberry vine, which spreads low over the ground in a tangle of 
thin runners and shoots, thrives in boggy, acidic soils. Those conditions are 
found mainly in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New Jersey. But American 
legislation to preserve natural wetlands has severely curtailed expansion of 
cranberry bogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cranberries also are grown in "upland" fields that are specially adapted with 
irrigation and sprinkling systems. This type of cultivation has been successful 
in Washington and Oregon, but increasingly strict limitations on the diversion 
of river waters are making expansion of cranberry lands difficult there too. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada has been contributing 7% or so of the supply of cranberries in recent 
years, but Canadian environmental restrictions also limit new planting. 
Meanwhile, popular belief in the medicinal value of cranberry juice, especially 
against urinary tract infections, has helped keep American demand growing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, agricultural researchers have found that cranberry 
plants grow well in southern Chile, which has a cool, rainy climate similar to 
that of the Pacific Northwest. So far, no one has produced cranberries here for 
export, but Simmons plans to begin doing so in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 As for those bumblebees: One problem cranberry growers face is pollination. 
Honeybees often fail to show up for work on rainy or overcast days. But 
bumblebees, Simmons says, work rain or shine; using them to pollinate 
cranberries can increase fruit yields by 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to put in flower beds -- borage, cat mint, bee plant -- around his 
cranberry beds to attract bumblebees. When the cranberries are in bloom, the 
flowers will be cut, leaving only cranberry blossoms for the bumblebees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will bring in a bumblebee expert and we will propagate our own colonies," 
Simmons says. "To get a 28% higher yield, I'll do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 That clearly is Simmons' style: Do what it takes, cost what it may. He already 
has hired Elden Stang, a horticulture professor from the University of 
Wisconsin, as technical adviser for his company here, called Cran Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 Stang, one of a handful of top American experts on cranberries, took a year's 
leave of absence from the university last July to work with Simmons in Chile. 
Stang's wife, Judy, supervises a laboratory where tiny pieces of cranberry 
plant are propagated in a gelatin-like medium of vitamins, minerals, growth 
hormones and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 The laboratory shoots then grow roots in a greenhouse, where they are 
redivided. The lab and greenhouse are producing over 6 million plants a month, 
Stang says, making the micro-propagation operation one of the largest in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Cranberries do not reproduce from seeds. In the United States, new plants are 
grown from vine cuttings, but strict Chilean regulations for importing plants 
made it impossible to bring in enough cuttings for a project like Cran Chile. 
So Stang, 54, helped Simmons set up the center for micro-propagation with 
technology that had never been used for reproducing cranberry plants on a large 
scale. "The man had amazing faith to do this," Stang says. 
</P>
<P>
 One advantage to micro-propagation instead of imported cuttings is that 
diseases common to cranberries in North America are kept out. "We've seen no 
diseases," Stang says. Cran Chile planting began in October and continues at a 
rate of about five acres a day. Touring three farms where work is taking place, 
Simmons stops where bulldozers, backhoes and tractors prepare sunken planting 
beds the size of football fields. The beds are side by side with roadways in 
between. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cranberry crops in the United States are harvested by flooding the 
growing beds with water. The berries float to the surface, where they are more 
easily gathered in. Simmons will harvest his crops from mobile bridges that 
span the planting beds to avoid any harmful pressure on the plants, he says. 
"The biggest thing is to save stress on the beds." 
</P>
<P>
 Cranberry vines take four to five years to mature. The average for cranberry 
yields in the United States is 160 to 180 barrels an acre (a barrel is 100 
pounds). Some land in Oregon has yielded more than 600 barrels an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 By the year 2001, when he has 1,000 acres of mature vines in production, 
Simmons hopes to be harvesting 300 barrels of cranberries per acre. That would 
be a total of 300,000 barrels, more than any single producer now harvests. "Our 
weather, we hope, duplicates Bandon, Oregon," he said. "They have the highest 
yield of anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons does not say how much he is investing. But the Chilean financial 
newspaper Estrategia estimates pre-production investment for cranberries in 
Chile at up to $16,000 per acre -- $16 million for 1,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons says he hopes to find a juice-maker to turn his berries into 
concentrate. If no one is interested, he said, he will invest in a juice plant 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But he says he needs to contract with a large marketing organization to sell 
the juice. He says he has approached several companies. "I didn't even get an 
answer to my letters," he complains, but his optimism seems undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Germans like a tart drink," he says. "I think they would like cranberry 
juice. I think Germany is the ideal market." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he is reluctant to put his cranberries on the American market, because 
the additional availability might depress prices, but he will do so if he can't 
sell them in Europe or Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one other company is planning to grow cranberries for export in 
southern Chile. Partners in the venture include Americans Thomas Kehler, Don 
Mowat and Jon Lindbergh, son of the late aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons admits his is a big bet, one he could lose. "There's just a chance 
there's a bug down here that thrives on cranberries," he says. "If some bug 
eats all my cranberries, I'll shrug my shoulders and walk away. But if I make 
money on it, I want to keep growing."

RUSSIA REMOVES LAST HURDLE TO BOSNIA AIR STRIKES; DIPLOMACY: MOSCOW WON'T 
INSIST U.N. CHIEF SEEK SECURITY COUNCIL APPROVAL. AMBASSADOR REQUESTS MEETING 
TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO DEMILITARIZE SARAJEVO. 
</P>

<P>
 Russia removed the last legal obstacle Thursday to the calling of air strikes 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina by U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali when it 
dropped its insistence that he seek new Security Council approval before he 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov told reporters before he met with other 
ambassadors of the Security Council that his government was not trying to 
prevent North Atlantic Treaty Organization planes from bombing Bosnian Serb 
positions. "Who said that we are stopping anything?" he told a questioner. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about Boutros-Ghali's contention that he does not need any further 
approval from the council, Vorontsov surprised everyone by replying, "The man 
is absolutely right." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian ambassador did present the other diplomats with a formal request 
from the Russian Foreign Ministry for an urgent meeting of the Security Council 
"to consider practical ways to demilitarize Sarajevo and to introduce there a 
United Nations administration." A demilitarized Sarajevo under U.N. 
administration is one of the proposals under consideration at the Bosnian peace 
conference in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 Many U.N. diplomats had feared that the Russian attempt to bring this issue 
before the Security Council was an attempt to thwart any air strikes. But 
Vorontsov told reporters, "It's complementary, not a substitute." 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassador Roble Olhaye of Djibouti, who is president of the Security Council 
this month, said the ambassadors had acceded to the Russian request for a 
meeting, but only partly. The Security Council had planned a public meeting 
today in which all U.N. members would be able to offer their views on Bosnia. 
Vorontsov was invited to discuss his proposal at the same time. But Olhaye said 
that the Russians would not be allowed to introduce a resolution or call for a 
vote at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Russian obstacle removed, Boutros-Ghali assumes the role of the key 
figure with the power to order air strikes in Bosnia should they prove 
necessary. U.N. diplomats said that, although the secretary general has long 
been wary of such military action, he has crossed a threshold and would have no 
hesitation about ordering air strikes now. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some confusion at the United Nations, however, about the exact 
nature of the secretary general's role. European diplomats said that 
Boutros-Ghali had the right to order air strikes both before and after the 
expiration of the 10-day ultimatum for the removal of Bosnian Serbs' heavy 
weapons from the hills around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The strikes could be ordered before, the diplomats said, if artillery fires on 
Sarajevo; afterward, Boutros-Ghali could order the strikes to take out the 
heavy weapons that had not been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior French diplomat, however, described these orders as "a shared 
initiative," implying that Boutros-Ghali would surely consult with NATO before 
ordering its planes into action. 
</P>
<P>
 Any air strikes before the ultimatum expired would probably simply take out 
the battery that had been firing, the European diplomats said. Boutros-Ghali 
would order each such air strike separately. 
</P>
<P>
 But, the diplomats said, any order for air strikes that came after the 10 days 
were over would amount to a general order for NATO to attack the emplacements 
at will, without waiting for approval from Boutros-Ghali for each air strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior French diplomat nuanced this somewhat, saying that Boutros-Ghali 
would be consulted on each of these strikes and would have "the power to 
prevent -- to say, 'Don't do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate this scenario, the diplomat described a situation in which NATO 
pilots spotted a Serbian battery still firing. "NATO will say, 'There are 
batteries. We have to take them out. Is it OK?' " The diplomat said that 
Boutros-Ghali would surely approve unless he feared the air strikes would 
threaten the lives of U.N. peacekeepers or humanitarian workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The French diplomat said that he believed that Boutros-Ghali would not object 
to this role. "I don't think he will mind so long as it (the order for air 
strikes) is done in close coordination with the secretary general," the 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others doubted that the secretary general would actually have any veto power, 
as there probably would be little time for him to stop the air strike once NATO 
had told him about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Vorontsov told reporters that he believed Boutros-Ghali would never have to 
use his authority to order air strikes because the Bosnian Serbs would comply 
with the demand that they leave Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Vorontsov's discussions with the Security Council seemed much more moderate 
than the statements made earlier in the day in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should NATO decide the issues of a peace settlement, and what's more, by 
issuing ultimatums and threatening the use of force?" First Deputy Foreign 
Minister Anatoly Adamishin told the Interfax news agency. "This is not NATO's 
business. It is the United Nations' business."

 Government and rebel forces in Sudan have massacred thousands of civilians in 
indiscriminate killings and kidnaped children on a massive scale for use as 
slaves or soldiers, according to a new U.N. report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report released Thursday to the U.N. Human Rights Commission cited grim 
details of executions and torture in "ghost houses" in northern Sudan and 
deliberate bombing of civilian targets in war-shattered southern regions. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by Hungarian expert Gaspar Biro is scheduled to be discussed this 
month during the commission's annual six-week session. 
</P>
<P>
 Biro painted a desperate picture of the plight of "hundreds of thousands" of 
children, especially in the Christian and animist south, where rebels have 
waged a 10-year-long war against the Muslim-dominated north. 
</P>
<P>
 In its yearly human rights report, the U.S. State Department last week 
described the situation in the vast nation as "dismal." 
</P>
<P>
 Aid workers have said that renewed government offensives near the southern 
border with Uganda have caused many casualties and forced tens of thousands of 
refugees to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Biro criticized Sudan's military fundamentalist government for its application 
of Islamic law. He said the country's legal code -- which provides for 
execution, amputation or flogging depending on the crime -- and the 
government's treatment of women violate international conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges prompted a furious response from the Sudanese government, which 
accused Biro of blaspheming Islam.

SOUTH ASIA TERMED MOST LIKELY AREA FOR NUCLEAR WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Asia, where India and Pakistan have fought three wars, is the most 
likely area of the world for a nuclear conflict in the next five years, a 
senior Administration official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both countries soon will be able to deploy nuclear weapons, and they are 
developing ballistic missiles that could carry the weapons to targets, the 
official told the Arms Control Assn. at the private research group's annual 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the countries are in a dispute over Kashmir, an Indian territory 
in which Pakistan supports a secessionist movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a nuclear weapon is detonated in anger in the next five years, the most 
likely place that could happen is South Asia," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Much attention is now focused on North Korea, where the Clinton Administration 
is trying through negotiations to get nuclear facilities opened to 
international inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is threatening to ask the United Nations to impose sanctions 
to hurt the North Korean economy if negotiations do not produce a solution. And 
that, the official said, "could mean a nuclear conflict on the Korean 
peninsula." 
</P>
<P>
 The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also expressed concern 
about Iran, which he said is developing nuclear and chemical weapons and aims 
to expand its authority in the Persian Gulf region.

PEACE PACT AT LEAST A MONTH AWAY, RABIN WARNS; MIDEAST: TEXT OF LATEST 
ISRAEL-PLO AGREEMENT SHOWS BOTH SIDES GAVE GROUND ON KEY ISSUES. ARAFAT FLIES 
TO JORDAN TO MEET WITH KING HUSSEIN. 
</P>

<P>
 Israeli officials cautioned Thursday that a final agreement on Palestinian 
self-rule is at least a month away, as Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat flew to Jordan to begin bringing other Arabs aboard the 
evolving peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after the two sides initialed agreements on several of the key issues 
that have prevented the beginning of Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and 
the West Bank town of Jericho, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin predicted 
"it will be at least another month, if not more, until we reach a full 
agreement, before we begin its realization." 
</P>
<P>
 In the occupied Gaza Strip, there was a mood of tempered optimism as 
Palestinians, who have watched for months the ins and outs of the faltering 
peace negotiations, waited for some concrete results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a doubt, the Palestinians see this as a big step forward. But in the 
meantime, this will not do anything for them. As long as the Israeli army 
patrols the streets and alleyways of the (refugee) camps in Gaza, as long as 
there are prisoners and wounded and roadblocks and unemployment, from the 
Palestinian perspective, nothing has changed," Suffian abu Zaida, a PLO 
activist in the Gaza Strip, told Israel's Army Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The response from hard-liners on both sides was quick. Near Gaza, Islamic 
militants claimed they had kidnaped and killed an Israeli police officer, and 
authorities confirmed that in the area of the alleged attack they had found a 
bloodstained car belonging to a former border police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's right wing condemned the preliminary accord, which they described as 
a sellout to the Palestinians that will pave the way for more Israeli 
concessions. "On the surface, it would seem that (Israel) has signed a treaty 
of surrender which does not even hint at security," said Rehavam Zeevi, head of 
the rightist Homeland Party.  
</P>
<P>
 The text of the agreement made public Thursday indicates that both sides gave 
ground, though the Palestinians took the biggest bite of concessions by 
accepting Israeli control of Jewish settlements in Gaza, ultimate Israeli 
control of border crossings and limited control of religious and tourism sites 
outside of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Israel agreed to a Palestinian presence and the display of 
the Palestinian flag at international border terminals, agreed to end searches 
of incoming Palestinians in most cases and gave Palestinians a foothold in the 
lucrative tourist market on the Dead Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The details of the pact have been downplayed, said one source close to the 
talks, "maybe because this agreement could contain some concessions, and there 
needs to be a proper release of the information in order not to provoke worries 
and harsh criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 These are the major issues agreed on in the documents signed late Wednesday in 
Cairo: 
</P>
<P>
 * Border terminals at entry points from Egypt and Jordan will be under the 
security supervision of Israel but will be divided into two wings. Residents of 
Gaza and Jericho will pass through the Palestinian wing and not come into 
contact with Israeli officials unless there is a need to search or question 
them. The Palestinian wing will include a Palestinian flag and a Palestinian 
armed guard. Other residents of the West Bank will be checked by both 
Palestinians and Israelis, and other travelers will pass through the Israeli 
wing. Negotiators left the question of whether there will be a Palestinian 
police officer on the border itself to be decided later by Arafat and Rabin 
when they meet. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Gaza Strip, the areas of the Gush Katif and Erez settlements, as well 
as the Israeli military installation along the Egyptian border, will remain 
under Israeli authority, as will the east-west roads linking the Gaza Strip to 
Israel. Joint patrols on those roads will be headed by Israelis, and Israelis 
pursuing suspects in Gaza will hand over to Palestinian officials as soon as 
practical. Joint patrols in Jericho will be headed by Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Jericho, in addition to the main area to be transferred to Palestinian 
self-rule, Palestinians are guaranteed safe passage to the religious sites of 
Nebi Mousa, revered by Muslims as Moses' burial place, and Al Maghtas, thought 
to be the site of Jesus' baptism. But instead of including those areas in the 
autonomy zone, the Palestinians will oversee them only for religious purposes. 
Palestinians also have the right of safe passage to private Palestinian 
development projects and joint ventures on the Dead Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Still not agreed upon, however, is the size of the Jericho zone eventually to 
be transferred to Palestinian control. Palestinians, who originally sought up 
to 340 square kilometers (136 square miles) of the entire district around 
Jericho, have found themselves in grudging agreement in recent weeks with 
Israel's final offer of 55 square kilometers (22 square miles). But sources 
said Arafat has reserved the right to bring up the issue with Rabin again.  
</P>
<P>
 In the points of agreement, the Palestinians "have agreed to a functional 
approach where the Israelis would have authority and powers to exercise their 
security responsibilities, and at the same time, it doesn't derogate from the 
fact that we're moving into a process where the Palestinians get more authority 
as you go along," said one analyst familiar with the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, seeking to cool Jordanian concerns that the Palestinians have not 
adequately consulted with their Arab partners in the peace negotiations, 
arrived in Jordan on Thursday for a meeting with King Hussein.

JACQUELINE ONASSIS IS TREATED FOR CANCER

<P>
 Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a 
treatable form of cancer of the lymphatic system, and has been undergoing 
chemotherapy for about a month, the New York Times reported in today's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper said Onassis, 64, had not interrupted her personal routines or her 
duties as a book editor. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is undergoing a course of treatment and there is every expectation that 
it will be successful," the newspaper quoted Onassis' spokeswoman, Nancy Tuck- 
erman, as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an excellent prognosis. You can never be absolutely sure, but the 
doctors are very, very optimistic," Tuckerman said.

WOMAN WHO FIRST REPORTED TAILHOOK SEX SCANDAL RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The woman who blew the whistle on the Tailhook sex scandal is resigning, the 
Navy said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 No reason for Lt. Paula Coughlin's resignation was given, but CBS and NBC 
reported that she was quitting because of continued harassment over Tailhook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know the reasons," said Lt. Susan Haeg, a spokeswoman for the Navy's 
Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk, where Coughlin is assigned to a helicopter combat 
support unit. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC News and CBS News, which obtained copies of her letter of resignation, 
said Coughlin cited her Tailhook assault and continuing abuse since she made it 
public as the reasons for leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "The physical attack on me by the Naval aviators at the 1991 Tailhook 
convention and the covert attacks on me that followed have stripped me of my 
ability to serve," NBC quoted her letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, a Navy source told the Associated Press that the admiral 
overseeing punishments stemming from the Tailhook convention is likely to 
accept a judge's dismissal of the last three cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Adm. J. Paul Reason probably will not appeal Capt. William T. Vest Jr.'s 
ruling but has not made a final decision, said the source, who is close to 
Reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Reason was expected to announce his decision today.  
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin, then an admiral's aide, was the first woman to come forward with a 
report of being groped as she was forced down a hotel hallway gantlet of 
drunken aviators at the Las Vegas convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Her resignation letter was submitted earlier this week, Haeg said. She said it 
would take two or three months before the resignation is processed and Coughlin 
leaves the service. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain amount of paperwork and other things to take care of," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin has an unlisted telephone number and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Her allegations about Tailhook helped uncover a scandal that shook the Navy at 
its highest levels as dozens of women eventually came forward to say they had 
also been attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one went to trial for Tailhook offenses, the scandal resulted in 
the firing of the secretary of the Navy and the demotion of a retired senior 
admiral.

STARS OF CLASS IMPLICATED IN ANNAPOLIS CASE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The class president and the co-captains of the football team are among 133 
senior midshipmen implicated in the largest cheating scandal in the U.S. Naval 
Academy's 149-year history, papers filed in federal court Thursday disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were among 47 midshipmen who asked a federal judge to block any 
disciplinary action by the academy, claiming the investigation into the 
cheating scandal violated their constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Naval Academy officials have postponed the first hearings on the 
cases, slated to begin today before an officers' panel that has the power to 
recommend expulsion for any midshipman involved in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-seven of the seniors implicated, including class president Jason Berger 
and football co-captains Jason Van Matre and Javier Zuluaga, filed suit in U.S. 
District Court for the District of Columbia against Navy Secretary John H. 
Dalton and top Navy officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing will be held Monday before U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Harris.

CONGRESS TERM LIMITS SET BY INITIATIVE VOIDED; GOVERNMENT: A FEDERAL JUDGE 
THROWS OUT PART OF WASHINGTON STATE'S LAW, SAYING SUCH CURBS WOULD REQUIRE AN 
AMENDMENT TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Throwing a chill over America's spreading voter revolt, a federal judge ruled 
Thursday that term limits cannot be imposed on members of Congress by way of 
ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Only by changing the U.S. Constitution can terms of federal officeholders be 
restricted, U.S. District Judge William L. Dwyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 His decision invalidating part of Washington state's term limit law was a 
sweet first-step victory for House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and the 
system of congressional seniority. It also was a potentially ruinous setback 
for growing legions of discontented Americans bent on a congressional purge. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, term limits for U.S. senators and representatives 
have become the national steam vent for voter frustration -- with ballot 
propositions passing one after another in 15 states, including California. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the idea are pushing similar initiatives in eight more states this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dwyer ruled that, no matter how fervent their frustration, voters cannot 
"add substantive requirements" for candidacy for federal office beyond those 
written in the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Article I specifies only three such qualifications for the House of 
Representatives: a minimum age of 25, citizenship for at least seven years and 
state residency. For the Senate: a minimum age of 30, citizenship for at least 
nine years and state residency. 
</P>
<P>
 "If adopted as a complete bar to reelection, a term limit law would exclude a 
category of candidates qualified under Article I: those who have served for a 
certain time," Dwyer wrote in a 36-page summary decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The landmark case was argued at the most fundamental level: Exactly what were 
the intentions of the framers of the U.S. Constitution? 
</P>
<P>
 To that, Dwyer answered, the founders of the nation adopted only the shortest 
list of qualifications to protect the "indisputable right" of voters to "return 
whom they thought proper" to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwyer noted that political fancies come and go. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, voters want to bring fresh blood into Congress and shake up the system 
of incumbency. But, the judge pointed out, if voters were given free rein to 
define the qualifications for candidacy, the winds may shift and they could 
decide that only candidates with prior electoral experience could run for 
Congress. That would not be fair either, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A state may not diminish its voters' constitutional freedom of choice by 
making would-be candidates for Congress ineligible on the basis of incumbency 
or history of congressional service," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether "term limits are wise or foolish" was not for him to decide, Dwyer 
wrote, adding that Americans only have one choice if they wish to proceed: a 
constitutional amendment, such as the 22nd Amendment, which limited presidents 
to two elected terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwyer's ruling applies only to the state of Washington. But this case is 
certain to move on toward the U.S. Supreme Court, where the nation could look 
for a uniform application of constitutional doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
 With Foley and the congressional incumbency on one side and voter majorities 
on the other, the stakes are too weighty for anything less: the advantage in 
shaping, and perhaps controlling, the U.S. Congress in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terrible decision! We're appealing immediately," said Chris Marks of the 
Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group U.S. Term Limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks said he believed that Thursday's decision would spur grass-roots 
organizers to redouble their efforts on the 1994 ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the eight states where congressional term limit drives are 
under way, Marks said, about 600 local term limit propositions are being 
advanced this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement, Foley -- a 14-term congressman -- said: "I believe that 
this decision provides an important framework for the resolution of one of the 
most important constitutional questions of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own view is that a constitutional amendment is the only way term limits 
can be implemented," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Stephen Smith, said the ruling "best protects the constitutional 
rights of all citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 "Accepting the sponsors' arguments would have created a disastrous precedent 
in which many types of candidates could be barred from the ballot simply 
because a group of voters did not wish them to participate," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 This case represented the consolidation of two suits filed against Washington 
state's 1992 term limit law -- one by the League of Women Voters and another on 
behalf of a suburban Seattle voter. They were soon joined by Foley, 10-term 
Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) and the American Civil Liberties Union. Among the 
lawyers representing their side was Lloyd Cutler, White House counsel in the 
Jimmy Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending the statute was the state of Washington, the initiative's 
grass-roots sponsors, U.S. Term Limits and the Pacific Legal Foundation. Their 
defense team included former Carter Administration Atty. Gen. Griffin B. Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwyer's ruling would appear to have little consequence for term limits imposed 
by voters on state or local officeholders. That portion of the Washington law 
was not challenged. The U.S. Supreme Court already refused to hear a challenge 
to California's legislative term limits, which were passed in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The invalidated portion of Washington's law, similar to California's 1992 
federal term limit proposition, would have permitted members of Congress three 
consecutive terms and senators two. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley would have been allowed to serve in the House through 1998; then his 
name would have been banned from the ballot, although he could seek office as a 
write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of other initiatives differ by state, but their cumulative effect -- 
if ultimately left standing -- would likely change the character of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 That was exactly the aim of term limit sponsors. In oral arguments last month, 
Bell put it this way: "We're asking, what are the limits on the power of the 
people?" 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Washington and California, the other states that have adopted term 
limits for congressional candidates are Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, 
Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota 
and Wyoming.

WEATHER MAY SNARL SHUTTLE LANDING PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crew of the space shuttle Discovery packed Thursday to come home after a 
mission that made history with its U.S.-Russian partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad weather threatened to disrupt NASA's landing plans.Forecasters were 
calling for possible rain, low clouds and high winds at the Kennedy Space 
Center, any one of which could prevent the shuttle from landing there as 
scheduled at 9:44 a.m. PST today. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were considering sending Discovery to Edwards Air Force Base in 
California or keeping the shuttle up an extra day. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery's five astronauts and cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, the first Russian 
to fly on a U.S. shuttle, have been in orbit since Feb. 3., working inside 
Spacehab, the small commercial laboratory in the cargo bay. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crew achieved only two of three planned satellite releases. The most 
important, deployment of the Wake Shield Facility, failed due to problems with 
the satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 The steel, saucer-shaped Wake Shield remained aboard instead of flying free 
for two days as intended. Physicists wanted to avoid shuttle contamination 
while developing semiconductor film on the Wake Shield; the film, if pure, 
could have led to faster computers.

IRS LOSES MILLIONS IN FRAUD WITH ELECTRONIC TAX FILING; CRIME: REFUNDS ARE 
ISSUED SO QUICKLY THAT THE AGENCY HAS NO TIME TO CHECK FACTS AND MATH, THE GAO 
REPORTS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service's fast-growing system for allowing taxpayers to 
file their returns electronically has brought with it a wave of fraud that is 
costing the government millions of dollars, federal investigators reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Refunds for electronic returns are issued so quickly that the IRS cannot check 
all of them in time to catch cyberspace outlaws, the General Accounting Office 
told members of a House subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic filing has been a point of pride with the IRS, welcomed as a big 
stride along the government's vaunted information highway. But it appears that 
electronic filing could become a highway rest stop that beckons crooks and 
thieves: False filing of returns by computer soared 105% last year, said the 
GAO, the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS "has perfected the art of using its computers to give out tax refunds 
quickly without making a corresponding effort in the area of fraud controls," 
said Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means oversight 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Thievery is relatively easy because the IRS often has as little as two days to 
investigate and stop a fraudulent refund after an electronic filing, compared 
with four to eight weeks for the traditional paper return. "The very thing that 
appeals to taxpayers -- faster refunds -- also increases IRS' vulnerability to 
fraud," the GAO reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, two Orange County men were indicted by a Los Angeles federal grand 
jury for allegedly obtaining about $22,000 in tax-refund loans. The Justice 
Department, which sent prosecutors to investigate the case, alleged that the 
men submitted phony W-2 forms to three Orange County tax preparers. They in 
turn electronically transmitted to the IRS completed tax returns based on those 
W-2 forms.  
</P>
<P>
 Once that was done, the men allegedly applied to financial institutions for 
refund-anticipated loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic filing of tax returns to the IRS was first offered nationwide in 
1990 and has grown rapidly. Last year, 12 million of the 115 million individual 
federal tax returns were filed electronically. The IRS' ambitious game plan 
calls for collecting 80 million returns electronically by the year 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 The detection of fraudulent electronic filing rose to 25,633 returns during 
the first 10 months of last year, a 105% increase over the 12,488 bogus returns 
detected during the same period a year earlier. The false returns detected last 
year claimed refunds of $53 million, but the IRS was able to stop only $29 
million before the refunds were issued. 
</P>
<P>
 And these figures could represent just the tip of the iceberg of criminality, 
GAO investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Electronic filing fraud is a problem whose true dimensions are unknown," said 
Jennie S. Stathis, GAO's director of tax policy and administration issues, at a 
congressional hearing convened by Pickle's oversight panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of identified fraudulent electronic returns is relatively small, 
but the rate of growth is high and it is uncertain how much fraud might be 
going undetected," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A taxpayer who wants to file electronically must work through an individual or 
a company authorized by the IRS to file returns by computer. The taxpayer's 
information is entered into the approved firm's computer, then transmitted to 
the IRS computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the authorized firms can prepare and send the tax returns. Others act 
only as conduits, sending returns as submitted to them by taxpayers without 
checking their arithmetic or facts. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS' primary means of detecting bogus returns is to examine a sample group 
of filed returns. The agency discovered that as many as a third of the crooked 
electronic filers were people using false names and Social Security numbers on 
their returns. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS rules say that firms transmitting electronic returns must mail supporting 
paperwork -- a document with the taxpayer's signature along with W-2 forms and 
other income verification. These documents must be sent within a day after the 
return is filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, however, the paper is not sent until after the refunds are issued, 
and sometimes it is never sent. IRS rules say firms that transmit tax returns 
electronically will be suspended for failing to send documents but the agency 
rarely enforces the rule, the GAO complained. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO said in a December report to Congress that taxpayers who want to file 
electronically should be required to submit two pieces of identification, one 
with a photograph, to the firm doing the filing. "The IRS has since decided not 
to require but only recommend that two forms of identification be required," 
Stathis told the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson said her agency is vigilant in 
chasing false filers. With the current tax season only six weeks old, "we have 
already detected approximately 200 schemes involving approximately 3,000 
attempts to file fraudulent claims on returns," she said.

HOUSE APPROVES 2-YEAR EXTENSION OF S&L INQUIRIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The House on Thursday backed a two-year extension of the government's pursuit 
of civil charges against failed savings and loans, including the institution 
involved in the Whitewater case. 
</P>
<P>
 Both houses of Congress have now agreed to extend, through Dec. 31, 1995, the 
deadline for pursuing fraud and negligence actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans were primarily concerned with a Feb. 28 deadline for filing civil 
actions against Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison Guaranty is linked in several ways to Whitewater Development Corp., a 
real estate venture that was owned by Bill and Hillary Clinton, along with the 
owner of Madison Guaranty and his wife at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension for action by the Resolution Trust Corp. would be added to 
legislation providing relief for victims of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The House vote of 390 to 1 came on a motion to instruct its conferees on the 
earthquake bill to back the extension when a compromise bill is worked out with 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate voted 95 to 0 on Wednesday to add the extension to the relief bill. 
The House had passed the earthquake bill without the amendment.

 A federal appeals court upheld a North Dakota law that requires a 24-hour 
waiting period for abortions.The U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2 to 1 
that the "informed consent" law was not an undue burden for rural women and 
pregnant minors. The law had been challenged by the Fargo Women's Health 
Organization, the only clinic for abortions in the state. The clinic argued 
that the law could require two, and possibly even three, long-distance trips. 
The law requires that the state make available information about fetal 
development and abortion alternatives. In the case of a pregnant minor, the 
information must be given to the girl's parents.

 A 110-pound Akita's three years on Doggie Death Row in Bergen County, N.J., 
ended with the pooch's permanent exile. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's staff and 
lawyers for the dog's owners signed documents that spelled out conditions of 
the dog's release.Taro, owned by Lonnie and Sandy Lehrer, had been in a county 
pen since 1991 for injuring the Lehrers' 10-year-old niece. Officials in their 
town, Haworth, wanted the dog killed under New Jersey's vicious dog law, 
claiming it had bit the girl's lip. The Lehrers insisted the girl provoked the 
sleeping dog and Taro only scratched her face. The Lehrers said they will give 
Taro to a West Chester County, N.Y., woman who has promised them unlimited 
visitation rights.

 A group representing thousands of surgeons turned its back on the Clinton 
health care plan, favoring instead a system in which the government would pay 
most medical bills. The American College of Surgeons, which has 60,000 members, 
announced its stand at a hearing of a House Education and Labor subcommittee, 
saying a so-called single-payer system would be more efficient, simpler and 
better for doctors and patients. The group did not endorse the single-payer 
health plan pending before Congress, saying it would give states too much 
control.

 The skeletal remains of a body found Tuesday near Landers were identified 
Thursday by the San Bernardino County coroner's office as those of an 
11-year-old Yucca Valley boy who ran away from home with a friend nearly three 
months ago, authorities said.

 San Bernardino sheriff's homicide Detective Dan Glozer said the youth, Robert 
Martinich, was believed to be the victim of a homicide, although the autopsy is 
not yet completed.The time of his death also is unclear.

 State agriculture officials said Thursday that they hope to begin aerial

Norco on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But the controversial spraying -- which has been postponed three times -- will 
face another last-minute battle before the helicopters fly. Corona City Manager 
Bill Garrett said the city will file another appeal Monday, this time to the 
California Supreme Court.

 Just as it unsuccessfully argued in an appeals court in San Bernardino, the 
new appeal will charge that Gov. Pete Wilson failed to meet certain 
requirements when he declared a Medfly crisis in Corona.

ANTI-CANCER DRUG TAXOL SYNTHESIZED BY RESEARCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Diego researchers reported Thursday that they had achieved complete 
chemical synthesis of taxol, a promising anti-cancer drug made from the yew 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
 The research by the team of scientists from Scripps Research Institute in La 
Jolla will be published in the Feb. 17 issue of the magazine Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxol was originally isolated from the Pacific yew tree. More recently it has 
also been made from the European yew. Synthesis of taxol could help scientists 
devise ways of making large amounts of it relatively cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at Florida State University also reported this week that they had 
been able to manufacture taxol in a laboratory using camphor and other 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxol has been described by the National Cancer Institute as one of the best 
new cancer drugs in 15 years and has shown promise in treating ovarian and 
breast cancers that do not respond to other drugs.

VIDEO OF HARRIS EXECUTION DESTROYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A videotape of the 1992 execution of Robert Alton Harris, prepared for a 
lawsuit challenging the use of the gas chamber but never shown in court, has 
been destroyed at a judge's order, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly unsealed documents in federal court disclose that the tape was destroyed 
after state lawyers agreed that they would not offer any new witnesses' 
testimony about executions if the gas chamber suit is retried. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement means "we would not need the videotape to show what happened to 
Robert Harris," said Michael Laurence, lawyer for the American Civil Liberties 
Union, which filed the suit on behalf of Death Row prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris consented to the taping but asked his lawyers to "do everything (they) 
could to avoid pain to his family" by preventing the tape from becoming public, 
Laurence said. If it had been shown in court, Laurence said, "we probably could 
not control its dissemination" to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurence added that as far as he knows, the tape stayed in the court's vault 
and was never shown. 
</P>
<P>
 The court documents include U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel's Jan. 14 
order to destroy the tape and a statement by Richard Wieking, clerk of the 
court, that he carried out the order Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer who once represented a television station seeking to film Harris' 
execution criticized the destruction of the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only videotape of an American execution ever," said William Bennett 
Turner, who represented San Francisco station KQED in an unsuccessful 1992 suit 
to allow cameras into the execution chamber. "I don't understand the reasons 
for its destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 No television station or other news organization sought access to the court 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was executed in the San Quentin gas chamber in April, 1992, for the 
1978 murders of two San Diego teen-agers. It was California's first execution 
since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the state's objections, Patel ordered the execution videotaped for 
possible use as evidence in the ACLU suit, which contends that gas chamber 
executions violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 If the suit succeeds, all executions in the state will be conducted by lethal 
injection, an option added by law last year in response to the case. Patel 
heard final arguments in the case Jan. 26.AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER

 A woman identified as Norma Staikos, Jackson's former chief of staff who ran 
his Neverland ranch in Santa Barbara County, testified for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the investigation said her evidence was considered crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara County grand jury began hearing testimony Wednesday. It was 
expected to adjourn for two weeks before resuming its task of hearing from more 
than a dozen witnesses. There was no immediate reason given for the 
adjournment. 
</P>
<P>
 Staikos was served with a subpoena ordering her to testify. She reportedly had 
fled to her native Greece rather than talk to police when the investigation 
started in August, but later returned.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's accuser, a 14-year-old boy who said he was sexually molested by the 
35-year-old singer when he was 13, settled a multimillion-dollar civil suit out 
of court last month. Jackson has vehemently denied the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who identified himself to reporters only as a member of Jackson's 
production staff also testified to the grand jury Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two witnesses -- former Jackson security guard Miko Brando, son of actor 
Marlon Brando, and an unidentified friend of the singer's -- appeared before 
the 19-member panel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of a grand jury is to consider the testimony of witnesses and 
decide if the person being investigated has cause to answer, in which case it 
hands up an indictment. The witnesses are produced by the prosecutors, and no 
defense is presented.

HOLY DAYS NO SOLACE FOR BOSNIAN MUSLIM REFUGEE; RELIGION: AT 90, WOMAN WHO FLED 
WAR-TORN SARAJEVO FEARS SHE MIGHT BE SPENDING HER LAST RAMADAN AWAY FROM 
HOMELAND. 
</P>

 Sadika Dzinovic observes Ramadan every year. But this year, the holy month 
takes on a new urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be her first Ramadan away from her hometown, war-torn Sarajevo in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. And the 90-year-old Muslim, who left Sarajevo Feb. 3 to 
live with her daughter in Anaheim Hills, said she fears that this will be her 
final observance of the holy month before she dies -- in a country far from her 
birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dzinovic and other Bosnian Muslims living in Orange County, this year's 
Ramadan -- the Islamic holy month that begins Saturday -- takes on a more 
poignant meaning as they began their religious rituals that include 30 days of 
fasting. More than a traditional practice, Bosnian Muslims here say, the 
fasting now symbolizes their joining in the suffering in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can observe Ramadan anywhere, but I'm sad that I'm doing it here this 
year away from my home," Dzinovic said, speaking in Bosnian as her daughter, 
Sabi Zagwolsky, translated. "My heart is home with my country, my neighbors, my 
friends, my children and their children.  
</P>
<P>
 "I pray to God for all of them," she said, her hand touching her trembling 
lips. "I pray to God to forgive me because my health doesn't allow me to suffer 
with them, if only for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Dzinovic is one of about 30 Bosnian Muslims among Orange County's 20,000 
Muslims who will join other members of their faith worldwide in observance of 
Ramadan. The Islamic holy month is celebrated as the period when God revealed 
to the prophet Mohammed the Koran, Islam's holy book. It is a time of religious 
renewal, self-discipline and charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramadan falls during the ninth month of the lunar year, beginning on the first 
day of the month after a new moon has been sighted. For 30 days, Muslims 
abstain from food, alcohol and other pleasures from dawn until sunset. After 
the last day of fasting, Ramadan ends with a prayer and a traditional 
celebratory feast, Eid Ul-Fidr . 
</P>
<P>
 "This month is like a retreat for Muslims without them leaving the daily 
routines," said Ihsan Bagby, a spokesman for the American Counsel for Public 
Affairs, a Muslim organization that dispenses information about the religion. 
"Muslims are to focus their attention on God and try to live out as goodly and 
saintly a life as possible during these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Ramadan is a time for Muslims to be introspective, to examine 
and be thankful for what they have and, through their fasting, empathize with 
those who are less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Local Bosnian Muslims say this is a fitting time for them, given their 
country's ongoing turmoil. Last Saturday, 68 people were killed when a 
120-millimeter mortar round was fired into an open market in Sarajevo. On 
Wednesday, NATO threatened the Serbs with air strikes if they do not withdraw 
their heavy weapons surrounding Sarajevo or place the arms under United Nations 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mustafa Kuchevich of Laguna Hills there is not a day that goes by that he 
doesn't think about the fighting in Bosnia. Pain sears his soul, he said, 
because he cannot help those who are fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't escape it," Kuchevich, 32, said sadly. "I come to work in the morning 
always sick in my stomach from reading the papers and seeing the news." 
</P>
<P>
 In a very small way, Kuchevich said, fasting during Ramadan will allow him to 
feel the hunger the Bosnians at home are experiencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of the Muslim soldiers and I think that they are fasting every day 
because they do not have enough food," said Kuchevich, who came to the United 
States 10 years ago. "Every day, and especially during this Ramadan, we will 
pray for them. In our fasting, we will feel their hunger -- and their 
strength." 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Kuchevich said, the Bosnian soldiers "will feel our strength, know 
that spiritually we are with them, and this will make them stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dzinovic, who has fresh memories left over from the war from which she 
physically escaped last week, there is so much to pray for in Bosnia. First and 
foremost, she prays for the safety of her two sons, who fight for the Bosnian 
army, and their children who remained behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is so quiet and peaceful here," Dzinovic said as she looked beyond the 
glass back door into the serene mountains. "The place where my children and 
grandchildren are, it is dark and it has no life. And it breaks my heart that 
they are there, hungry and scared, while I am here, safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Dzinovic said that if there is one bright spot right now -- aside from being 
alive and near her family in Orange County -- it is that she can pray during 
this year's Ramadan in peace and without fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not concentrate on my prayers last year because off all the noise, 
all the bombings in the background," she said. "This time, I will be in peace 
as I pray for my family and my people."

DANA PARSONS: THERE'S A CATCH TO CRIME-FIGHTING 'THREE STRIKES' PITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime, or, more specifically, talking about crime , is now the national 
political pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure we all understand that, politicians have simplified the crime 
lingo to that of our other national pastime: in crime now, as in baseball, it's 
three strikes and " Yer outta here! " 
</P>
<P>
 Three violent-crime convictions and hit the showers, bud. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Assembly has approved five "three strikes" measures, President 
Clinton has endorsed the concept, and even the presumed bleeding heart liberal 
governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, supports it. 
</P>
<P>
 At first blush, there's nothing wrong with the three-strikes provision. 
There's not much of an argument to be made for why society should be 
perpetually at risk from proven hard-core criminals. And, strictly as a 
political ploy, the strikeout strategy is right up there with support of the 
death penalty for sheer fan appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 But will it make much difference? Will we be that much safer? 
</P>
<P>
 As an overall crime strategy, it has an inherent defeatist tinge. Before the 
punishment kicks in, the criminal gets three whacks at victims. Three dead or 
battered bodies is hardly cause for celebrating a "get-tough" crime provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the danger for the public. Politicians no doubt see the strikeout 
as a way to impress the crowd. Used to be they could talk about building more 
prisons and that would wow the public. Now, the public is saying, "Hey, we 
built all these prisons and we still don't feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was that more strikingly proven than in 1991 in Orange County, a 
law-and-order outpost if ever there was one. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sheriff Brad Gates threatening the public with criminals-on-the-loose 
because of overcrowded jails and asking for only a half-cent sales tax increase 
to build a new one, Orange County resoundingly said no. Nobody showed up to 
vote (one in six registered voters turned out) and three out of every four who 
did voted against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, I suggested that proved that crime was overrated, but other 
analyses were probably more accurate: namely, that the public wasn't convinced 
that government knew how to handle the crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
 So, here we are in 1994, and crime heads the list of things Orange County 
residents are concerned about, according to a poll last summer. Similar concern 
is voiced from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any more reason today to believe the public trusts government to 
handle the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Criminologist and UC Irvine assistant professor Brian Vila doubts it. "In 
general terms, people are discouraged about the conventional approaches to 
dealing with crime," he says. "Clinton became the sixth President in a row to 
declare war on crime and people know that the crime rate goes up and the crime 
rate goes down, one kind goes up and another kind goes down, and I don't think 
people have the perception that government is very effective in dealing with 
crime. And, in particular, that's one of the main reasons they haven't been 
anxious to build a new jail in Orange County, for instance, or build more 
prisons." 
</P>
<P>
 With a law enforcement background, including a stint as a Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputy, Vila says he is "no kind of flaming liberal." But, he says, 
we've got it all wrong when it comes to the crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a growing body of research that the 5%-6% of the people who commit 
50% of the serious crimes were severely damaged early in their lives," he says. 
Those problems run the gamut, he says, from prenatal problems to child abuse to 
growing up in dysfunctional families. "Lots of people survive those same 
traumas, but a large proportion of people who go on to become our biggest 
problems do come out of dysfunctional backgrounds," Vila says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious to Vila that that's where a large share of money must go. "I 
think a real key is to think about the life course, to think about prevention 
not as a thing you do for today or this year, but that you try to effect over 
the course of an individual's life." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like the old liberal philosophy that lost public support, I suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Vila agrees but said even Great Society goals were too short-term-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the short term," Vila says, "we need cops on the street, we need prisons 
and jails, we need supervision for people on parole and probation, but those 
are short-term solutions and they don't do much about the real roots of the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Vila said politicians underestimate the public's intelligence on root causes 
of crime and that leaders of "stature, understanding and guts" could sell a 
long-term approach. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take a sell job, because my reading is that the public thinks we tried 
that, and it didn't work. But my reading also is that the public, deep down, 
isn't convinced more jails and prisons are the answer either. 
</P>
<P>
 You want to talk "three strikes and you're out"? 
</P>
<P>
 While pitching for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1969, recent Hall of Fame 
designee Steve Carlton struck out 19 batters in a nine-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
 He also lost the game, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton learned that there's a lot more to winning a game than striking people 
out.

STATION SETTLES LAWSUIT FILED BY MANILOW REPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles radio station quickly settled a lawsuit Thursday brought by 
representatives of Barry Manilow, who alleged that the station disparaged the 
entertainer and used his name unlawfully in a television advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
 KBIG-FM (104.3), which began running the 30-second ad last week, agreed to 
drop the promo and replace it with another advertisement, said Kari Johnson 
Winston, the station's general manager and vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings, Clayton & Tucker, a Nevada-based entertainment firm that owns the 
promotional and marketing rights to Manilow's name, had filed suit Tuesday in 
Orange County Superior Court against Utah-based Bonneville International Corp., 
which owns KBIG, asking for an estimated $28 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal action was dropped after KBIG agreed to withdraw the promotional 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Manilow nor his Los Angeles manager, Gary Keith, could be reached for 
comment, but representatives of the singer said he knew the suit had been filed 
on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 KBIG officials said the ad was an attempt to differentiate the station from 
its main competitor in the soft-rock arena, KOST-FM (103.5). The spot named 
artists that KBIG plays -- such as Mariah Carey, Genesis, Rod Stewart and Sting 
-- and noted that KOST plays the likes of Manilow and the Carpenters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're replacing that commercial that Mr. Manilow objected to with another 
commercial," Winston said. "We're doing this completely to avoid any continued 
upset on Barry's part. It was never our intention to upset Barry Manilow at 
all. It was just our intention to point out the differences. I, frankly, 
thought that since we were saying where he is played, that that would be a 
positive, but he was unhappy about it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, the KBIG ad was "falsely disparaging." The suit also 
contended that the station was not authorized to commercially use the singer's 
name, which "has become, through widespread and favorable public acceptance, a 
distinctive designation . . . and is an asset of incalculable value." 
</P>
<P>
 Winston said the station was not aware that it needed to seek permission to 
use the singer's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned from his lawyer that his name is service-marked," Winston said. 
"We didn't know that. We've made dozens of commercials listing names of artists 
for years, and we've never asked for permission in the past. That's how most 
stations promote themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said it is highly unusual for a major entertainer to sell the 
rights to his name. Rather, most celebrities license it to merchandising 
corporations to exploit it for commercial purposes. Some music industry 
insiders suggested that Manilow may be a silent partner in Hastings, Clayton & 
Tucker, but his representatives denied that. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, another Los Angeles radio station, KRTH-FM (101.1), was having fun 
with the lawsuit. Morning personality Robert W. Morgan planned today to offer 
$5,000 to a listener willing to sit through an entire Manilow song. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to be sued by Barry, so I decided I'd better play a Barry 
Manilow record," Morgan told The Times.

GONE (URBAN) FISHIN'; CITY ANGLERS CAN NOW LURE TROUT FROM LAKES IN MILE SQUARE 
PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE TASSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marco Aviles and his preschool son, Nelson, waited lakeside in Mile Square 
Regional Park, their fishing pole at the ready, eager to have a crack at the 
rainbow trout planted Thursday morning in the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The trout shipment is part of the state's Urban Lakes Program, which began 
stocking some Orange and Los Angeles county lakes with trout last year. Funded 
by revenue from fishing licenses and taxes on sporting goods sales, the program 
has two goals: to bring fishing into metropolitan areas and to bring trout, 
instead of the more commonly stocked catfish, to the urban angler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since more and more people have been moving into the metropolitan areas, 
fishable waters moved farther and farther outside town," causing many to give 
up the sport, said Patrick Moore of the California Department of Fish and Game. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has not planted urban lakes with trout for at least 25 years. In 
recent times, lakes like the two in Mile Square Park were stocked with catfish, 
which "doesn't dance on the water, it doesn't jump, it doesn't run, it doesn't 
do those sorts of things that anglers like to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The Urban Lakes Program was so well received last year that the agency decided 
to double the number of lakes stocked this year, adding Mile Square, the only 
newcomer in Orange County, to the list of parks. Mile Square Regional Park's 
two lakes received almost 2,000 trout; another thousand were dumped in both 
Tri-City Lake in Placentia and Centennial Lake in Santa Ana -- almost a ton of 
fish.  
</P>
<P>
 The venture is not just popular with the public. Trout Unlimited, a national 
conservation organization dedicated to preserving wild trout and cold-water 
fisheries, raves about it, although it has been critical of the genetically 
inferior hatchery-grown trout in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's a great program," said Kevin Reed, president of the 
organization's Los Angeles County chapter, "because it reduces the impact on 
streams and lakes that are harder to get to that can't handle heavy traffic."  
</P>
<P>
 The program's strength, he added, is that it keeps wild trout separate from 
hatchery-grown trout, which can damage the wild fish by competing with them for 
habitat and food. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen people, many of whom had children resting on their shoulders, 
watched as Fish and Game workers hoisted the half-pound trout, grown at Mojave 
River Hatchery in Victorville, into the lake off of Euclid Avenue. They scooped 
net after net-full of some 1,000 flapping fish into the water before unloading 
the same amount into the park's other lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The first nibble came in 20 minutes to the fishing pole of Marco Aviles, 27, 
of Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know who's the fisherman out here," he said with a laugh, letting his son 
Nelson, 3, reel in the catch. The boy tried unsuccessfully to hold onto the 
slippery fish as a playmate watched and laughed. Then Marco put the trout on a 
stringer, saying they would try to catch some more and eat them later. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone planned to make dinner of their catch. Joe and Annette Banuelos, 
among the first to arrive Thursday, were there for the recreation.  
</P>
<P>
 "While the kids are at school, we go and do some fishing -- we play," said 
Joe, 32. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to wait for an hour to let the fish settle," Joe said. "They're 
still dizzy." But spurred on by the infectious enthusiasm of the other anglers, 
he cast his line into the calm water. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe said he may throw his catch, which he got 20 minutes later, back. He used 
hooks with short, blunt tips that protect the trout from being fatally cut and 
a submersible container to store the caught fish under water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the Fish and Game department scientists had their wish, though, everyone 
would take their catch home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We prefer that they keep them because they're not going to survive" 
indefinitely in the lake, said John Sunada, a department biologist. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated that at least 50% of the fish are caught by anglers, others die 
of natural causes or are eaten by birds and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 With a $23 state fishing license, anyone can fish for the trout, which cost 
the department about $2 each to raise and release, Moore said. Before putting 
those valuable commodities in the lake, Sunada's office made sure the ponds 
would be a safe environment. 
</P>
<P>
 A year before approving the new sites, scientists tested each proposed lake 
for oxygen, pH level, temperature, and the presence of copper, a toxic 
substance used to control algae in some lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the better lakes," he said, referring to Mile Square park. 
</P>
<P>
 Trout will be planted again at the lakes in late February. If trout thrive 
there and people continue to fish, more shipments will come about every two 
weeks until April, when catfish, which can survive in warmer temperatures, will 
be planted. Department surveyors will check twice a month on how the program is 
going at the new sites, Moore said. About Trout The rainbow trout is one of 10 
species of trout in North America and is considered a good sport fish as well 
as a good eating fish. A profile of the rainbow trout: * 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat: Native to western North America; lives in freshwater streams and 
lakes. Those living in the ocean and returning to fresh water to spawn are 
called steelhead trout. * 
</P>
<P>
 * Markings: Black spots on upper body and tail, brilliant reddish band along 
sides, strong teeth and streamlined body with small scales. A small, fleshy fin 
grows on the back near the tail fin. * 
</P>
<P>
 * Diet: Young rainbows mainly eat invertebrates including insects. Mature 
trout feed on other fish and crayfish. They occasionally eat young birds, 
lizards or other animals that fall into the water. * 
</P>
<P>
 * Weight: Can reach up to 30 pounds in four to five years on a trout farm. * 
</P>
<P>
 * Spawning: In early spring, trout move upstream to a spawning area. The 
female chooses a shallow, gravel area at the beginning of a stretch of choppy 
water. She turns on her side and beats her tail up and down, scooping out a 
shallow nest called a redd and positions herself over it. A male swims 
alongside her and quivers his body. When the female is ready to spawn, she 
moves to the bottom of the redd and presses her belly against the gravel. As 
she releases eggs, male releases sperm that fertilize the eggs. The female 
covers the eggs with gravel. * 
</P>
<P>
 * Offspring: Eggs hatch in about two months. The young push up through the 
gravel into the water. * 
</P>
<P>
 * Life Span: Up to 11 years. * 
</P>
<P>
 * Overseas Fish: In 1884, the rainbow trout was introduced into European and 
other waters. Pond to Platter Two quick and easy trout recipes use trout to 
fill the plate, and won't bust a budget either: * Corn-Stuffed Trout (makes 
four servings) * Ingredients * 4 whole dressed, fresh or frozen trout * 1 (8 
3/4-ounce) can cream-style corn * 1/2 cup bread crumbs * 1 teaspoon instant 
onion * 1/4 teaspoon salt * 1/8 teaspoon black pepper * Dash thyme leaves, 
crushed * 1 tablespoon melted butter or margarine * Preparation 1. Thaw trout, 
if frozen. Rinse with cool water. Pat dry with paper towels. 2. Combine corn, 
bread crumbs, onion, salt, pepper and thyme. Spoon mixture into trout cavities. 
Brush fish with melted butter. 3. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes or until 
fish flakes easily with fork. 4. Garnish with lemon and serve with buttered 
broccoli. * Fried Trout (makes two servings) * Ingredients * 2 whole frozen 
trout * Salt, pepper * Flour * 3 tablespoons butter or margarine * 1/2 cup 
sliced mushrooms * 1/4 cup chopped green onions * 2 teaspoons lemon juice * 1 
tablespoon vermouth * Preparation 1. Thaw trout. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. Dust with flour. 2. Saute in two tablespoons butter, 3-4 minutes on 
each side. Remove to platter and keep warm. 3. Add remaining tablespoon butter 
to skillet. Saute mushrooms and green onions until tender. Stir in lemon juice 
and vermouth and pour over trout. 4. Complete with a tossed green salad and 
herb-broiled tomato halves. * Sources: World Book Encyclopedia, "The Complete

STATE RESPONSE TO BEACH CURFEW PLAN IS CALLED INTRUSIVE; COASTAL ACCESS: 
OFFICIALS ASSAIL PROPOSED 'CASE-BY-CASE' REVIEWS OF LOCAL ORDINANCES. 
</P>

 Calling it an unworkable solution to the beach curfew controversy, city 
officials in Orange County on Thursday criticized a proposal to help local 
governments "maximize" beach access and protect public safety through new 
funding legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is part of a list of recommendations made by Peter Douglas, 
executive director of the California Coastal Commission, in preparation for a 
commission workshop on beach access Wednesday in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like (Douglas) again is proposing to set guidelines for local 
governments," said San Clemente Mayor Scott Diehl. "I certainly understand the 
mission of the Coastal Commission and its staff. But we at the local level are 
charged to balance our resources and to govern locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a reality standpoint," Diehl said "the idea they're proposing is 
contrary to budget reality. You have to keep in mind the money problems the 
state, the cities and the county are now going through." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Hagan, Huntington Beach director of community services, said any 
legislative approach seeking more funding for beaches would be a "dream 
recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 28, after meeting with representatives of six Orange County coastal 
cities, Douglas said the state would not challenge the curfews the cities 
recently imposed to help curb late-night crime on their beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering was one of several meetings between state and local officials to 
iron out their differences after a Coastal Commission warning last October, to 
73 cities and counties along the state's 1,100-mile coastline, that beach 
curfews are illegal without state approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas said in a telephone interview Thursday that the intent of his 
recommendations was to offer feedback only. At the Jan. 28 meeting, he said, 
local representatives told him they do not have enough money to maintain and 
patrol beaches that are open to the public at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said that if the state wants us to keep our beaches open for everyone, 
then the state should come in and provide some support," Douglas said. "Even 
though local governments get economic revenue from operating a beach, I thought 
we ought to try and help local governments find a source of funding if we can. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the commission isn't interested, then we won't," Douglas said, adding that 
he was not suggesting that he has found "a hidden money trove to tap into." 
</P>
<P>
 However, more than one local official voiced concern with yet another 
recommendation on beach curfew ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas wrote that unless the commission directs its staff to do otherwise, 
staff members will meet with individual local governments to "discuss the 
relevant ordinances, if any, and suggest modifications, if needed, to address 
Coastal Act concerns." The act ensures beach access. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pending this review on a case-by-case basis, it is staff's intent to maintain 
the status quo relative to existing beach-closure ordinances," Douglas said in 
his recommendations to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said he interpreted the case-by-case review as being contrary to what 
Douglas had told local officials earlier. According to Hagan, the executive 
director said that he did not want to "micro-manage" local governments from 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "But here he is again, saying that they want to study these ordinances on a 
case-by-case basis," Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Douglas said he told the local officials that although the state 
will not challenge beach curfews, they still must be reviewed by the commission 
for possible violations of the state's Coastal Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas said that this is especially true for Huntington Beach. He said city 
officials gave him a copy of the beach ordinance, but it does not mention 
whether fishing was permitted at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told . . . by Huntington Beach officials that (night) fishing is OK, 
but that wasn't in the ordinance I got," Douglas said. "And in fact, through 
city officials, I learned that they allow fishing and that it was implicit but 
not contained in the ordinance. Well, from our perspective, it's problematic."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; PROTESTERS SEEK TO SAVE THE TIGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The endangered Siberian tiger may live thousands of miles away, but Thursday 
morning the animal was the subject of a protest here by 15 environmental 
activists opposed to Hyundai Corp.'s logging in the Siberian Forest in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters claimed that another subsidiary of the parent company of Hyundai 
Motor America is stripping the tiger's habitat and creating access roads that 
poachers use to hunt the tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the activists sat atop a huge concrete Hyundai sign and held a banner 
calling for a boycott of Hyundai. Two men managed to make their way to the roof 
of Hyundai's four-story building at 10550 Talbert Ave. to display their 
message. That drew the attention of morning commuters on the San Diego Freeway 
as well as Hyundai executives, who called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Jake Kreilick, regional coordinator of the Nature Forest Network, said the 
protest was calculated to force a meeting with Hyundai executives. Earth First! 
and the Rainforest Action Network were also represented at the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a fact-finding mission," he said after a 40-minute meeting with 
three company executives. "We know they are practicing unsustainable forestry 
but we want to know from them the extent of their logging activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Wolf, a spokesman for Hyundai Motor America, said the company is a wholly 
owned subsidiary and is totally financially independent from its parent company 
and its outside ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no involvement at all with any of the other companies," he said, "so 
we have no idea what this logging operation is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Kreilick said he asked Keith Duckworth, vice president of administration, to 
submit a letter containing questions from his group and a book titled 
"Clearcut, the Tragedy of Industrial Foresting," to the company's chief 
executive officer, who was not present. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters disbanded at about 10:30 a.m., two hours after it began. There were 
no arrests. BRIAN RAY BALLOU

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; WATER DISTRICT DROPS RECYCLING PLANT BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Ranch Water District plans to withdraw a bill in the state 
legislature that would have given the agency the right to build a hazardous 
waste water recycling plant in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which is sponsored by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), 
has been the subject of much debate over the past few months. City officials 
and some residents fear that the plant could pose environmental risks if it is 
built near the San Joaquin Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district officials on Thursday said the city's concerns were a factor in 
the decision to drop the bill for now. But they insisted the recycling plant is 
a sound idea and said the district might have the bill reintroduced in coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is something the city understands better and something we looked at and 
thought was a viable deal, we would bring it back," said water district 
President Peer Swan. "If we don't, we won't bring it back." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, SB 1191, would have amended the California Water District Act to 
give the IRWD the same right as the Orange County Sanitation District to 
recycle hazardous waste water. 
</P>
<P>
 The district never formally proposed a recycling center project or selected a 
site. IRWD officials agreed last year that any such project would require 
approval from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But concerns about the bill have persisted, especially among those who feared 
the plant would be built near the environmentally sensitive San Joaquin Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said the city was concerned about whether a 
strong earthquake could send industrial waste water from the plant into the 
marsh and into Upper Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan said another reason for seeking the bill's withdrawal was that the 
district had no interest in developing the recycling plant for at least three 
years. He said the district will continue to seek legislative approval of a 
modified bill that would allow the IRWD to open a composting facility for 
"green waste" such as grass, leaves and branches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that this is a much more rational plan," said Councilman Barry J. 
Hammond. "It's better for the district and the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Swan: "The composting does not appear to be a controversial issue. We 
want to let it go through the city process. Then when and if the (waste 
recycling issue) comes up, we'll address it at that time." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CULTURES CROSS AT MASUDA SCHOOL FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The smells of native foods wafted through the schoolyard: hot bratwurst, yamas 
(a Philippine dessert of condensed milk and peanuts on a stick), dunk-a-roos 
(Australian cookies) and even American apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kazuo Masuda Middle School's Multicultural Faire on Wednesday, students 
shared their ancestry and their culture with classmates, and learned more about 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The significance is to spotlight these children who come to our school from 
different countries," said Lorraine Leavitt, assistant principal. "This is an 
opportunity for them to share their culture, their foods and their costumes. I 
think the kids get to know these other kids better and they realize how small 
our world is." 
</P>
<P>
 At Masuda, 16 languages are spoken among the nearly 100 students in the 
program for limited English-speaking children, said teacher Bobbie Dickey.  
</P>
<P>
 The multicultural fair was started three years ago with the students who 
recently immigrated here, she said. This year, it featured 44 booths -- almost 
double last year's number -- with nearly 200 students participating, Dickey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Displays included those of Japan, Palestine, Turkey, Italy, Vietnam, Republic 
of China, Spain and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 Students displayed toys, coins, photographs, handicrafts, jewelry, games, 
books, newspapers, magazines and stamps from their native lands. They also 
dressed in their native clothing, such as a barong Tagalog , worn by males in 
the Philippines, or a colorful hanbok , a traditional dress South Korean 
females wear on special occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-grader Jessica Marchand, 11, from France, brought crepes and croissants 
to share. Her booth boasted pictures of castles, the Eiffel Tower and 
Versailles. She showed books in French, including "La Belle et la Bete," known 
here as "Beauty and the Beast," and played French music.  
</P>
<P>
 Marchand, who started school last month at Masuda and speaks little English, 
said she's proud to share her country with new friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is making her feel at home here -- but not forget where she is from," 
Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neeta Patel, 11, shared puffed rice, displayed her mother's sequined wedding 
dress, or sari, and a panjabi , her own party dress. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun way to learn about everyone else's culture and you can share your 
culture too," said American-born Neeta, whose father is from India and whose 
mother is from Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you have a better understanding of how they lived their everyday 
life in their country," she said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; AGENCY HIRED TO SELL RED HILL SCHOOL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees for the Tustin Unified School District have decided to hire a 
consultant to help sell the 10-acre Red Hill School site. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district tried to sell the property through competitive bidding in 
August last year, but there were no takers, apparently because of the slumping 
economy, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the hiring of Lee & Associates of Orange, Supt. Dave Andrews said 
Wednesday that district officials hope to find a buyer. The state has given the 
Tustin school district permission to negotiate directly with a buyer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Fisher, the school district's finance director, said that Lee & 
Associates will receive 2% of the money from the sale of the property, which 
the school district hopes to sell for $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said that the real estate company will get the fee only if escrow 
closes or when the school district receives payment for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The school site, at 11911 Red Hill Ave., has been closed since 1982. Some of 
the classrooms are being leased to a private school. 
</P>
<P>
 Money from the sale will be used to complete the renovation of the Columbus 
Tustin campus on Beneta Way, which is scheduled to reopen in 1994-95, Andrews 
said. The district needs about $2 million to finish the renovation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said that Lee & Associates was picked over three other consultants 
because the company's president, Chuck Noble, a North Tustin resident, is aware 
that residents near the school are worried about a developer building 
apartments and condominiums on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to see three years from now apartments across the street from me," 
said Sally Howie, a 17-year Tustin resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents have said that the school district should keep the school site 
because it might be needed as student enrollment grows. But school district 
officials said that enrollment in the area has declined and the site is no 
longer needed. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; DONATIONS OF FOOD TOP MILLION POUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County restaurants and food companies have donated more than a million pounds 
of leftover food to the area's needy residents during the first two years of a 
"rescued food" program, local food bank organizers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort, organized by the nonprofit Food Distribution Center in Orange, has 
matched 33 restaurants, food companies and vending machine operators with 
shelters and other charity groups since January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The food donors range from small doughnut shops to the sprawling Disneyland 
and Knott's Berry Farm theme parks, said the center's resource coordinator, 
Debbie Nadon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadon said the charities on the receiving end have needs as modest as those of 
a battered children's shelter in Santa Ana that feeds six youngsters, and as 
large as a Costa Mesa shelter that feeds 200 people daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Food Distribution Center staff members visit restaurants interested in joining 
the program, size up their daily leftovers and then match them with a local 
charity.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than having this food go home with an employee, or worse, getting 
trashed, we match them up with somebody who can come by and get the food to 
people who really need it," center spokeswoman Charlene Sydow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is far exceeding the center's early goals. Food bank organizers 
initially hoped the program would rescue 100,000 pounds of food the first year, 
a projected total that was quadrupled the first 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors include Costco, the Hard Rock Cafe, Lucky Stores, Marriott Hotels, 
Monarch Vending, Pizza Hut, Subway Sandwich Shops and Upper Crust Catering. 
</P>
<P>
 While the program has been a success, Sydow said, the center estimates that 
more than 1.7 million pounds of prepared food is wasted each month in Orange 
County. That number is based on a conservative estimate of 10 pounds of 
discarded food per restaurant each day, Sydow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the food rescue program, the decade-old Food Distribution Center uses 
private donations to buy bulk quantities of food staples to distribute to more 
than 260 local charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Those efforts, coupled with help from a national food donation network, help 
the center feed an average of 180,000 people each month, almost 60% of them 
children or senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about volunteering time, money or food, or participating in 
the food rescue program, call the food bank at (714) 771-1343, or write to the 
Food Distribution Center, 426-A W. Almond Ave., Orange, Calif. 92666. GEOFF

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SURFERS SAVE WOMAN BELOW CITY PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two long-board surfers rescued a young woman Wednesday night after she hurtled 
into the ocean from the 42-foot high city pier, state Lifeguard Supervisor Ken 
Kramer said Thursday. No Huntington Beach lifeguards were available because of 
budget cuts, Marine Safety officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two unidentified surfers, believed to be in their 30s or 40s, heard the 
woman's screams and a splash, Kramer said. They swam to the woman, lifted her 
onto one of their boards and stood by until Kramer arrived on a surfboard that 
he commandeered. 
</P>
<P>
 The surfers escorted Kramer and the unconscious woman, still on one of their 
long boards, to shore, where she was treated by Huntington Beach paramedics and 
taken to Pacifica Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, believed to be a 20-year-old resident of Garden Grove, spent the 
night at the hospital and was transferred to a psychiatric unit Thursday, a 
city official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What (the surfers) did was no easy feat in the dark," Kramer said. "They were 
very competent, and there is no question that they saved her life because the 
water was cold (58 degrees); it was dark, and the woman was unconscious." Surf 
conditions were moderate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great example of surfers helping professional life savers," Kramer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they reached shore, Kramer said, he helped to put the woman in a 
paramedic van. When he looked for the surfers, they were gone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget cuts made in November eliminated lifeguard protection in the city after 
dark in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through the years there (have) been a number of suicide attempts at the 
pier," said Marine Safety Lt. Mike Buerlein. "We like to think that if we have 
lifeguards on duty, we could save people." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the body of a 26-year-old Irvine man washed ashore near the city 
pier. Authorities said there was no evidence of foul play, and the death was 
believed to be a suicide. Marine Safety Lt. Steve Davidson said it is unknown 
if the man jumped from the pier or entered the water at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 There were apparently no witnesses to Wednesday night's incident, and Kramer 
said it was unknown whether the woman fell or jumped. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Services Director Ron Hagan, who supervises city lifeguard 
operations, said Thursday that the city was "penny-wise and pound-foolish" when 
it cut lifeguard protection in winter months.  
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said his department was required to cut $250,000 from its budget. ROBERT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; TEMPERS RISE OVER AIR CONDITIONERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tempers heated up earlier this week as parents and school board members argued 
over the best way to air-condition Fullerton elementary classrooms during hot 
summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and residents angrily accused the board of "socialist" measures when 
three members said the cash-strapped school district won't accept money 
earmarked to buy air conditioners for selected schools, yet leave schools in 
poorer areas neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing concerns over equal opportunity, the board members said parents ought 
to raise money on a districtwide basis so all students have an equal chance of 
beating the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 But many parents disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If money is so tight, how can you look a gift horse in the mouth?" said Diane 
Czypull, 37, who is part of a group that has been trying to get the school 
board's approval to raise money for air-conditioning for the Laguna Road 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are more than willing to help you out," Czypull said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents at Acacia Elementary School raised money and donated five 
air-conditioning units to their school last summer, but board members said 
Tuesday they will no longer accept such donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has not voted formally on the issue and instead handles each gift 
donation on an ad hoc basis.  
</P>
<P>
 Board members Robert C. Fisler, Elena Reyes-Jones and Rosamaria Gomez-Amaro 
said they oppose allowing parents to raise money to buy air conditioners for a 
particular school, while members Karen Chavez and Marjorie Pogue said they 
agreed with the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that if parents are willing to do extra time (fund-raising) for their 
schools, that's their choice," Pogue said. But Gomez-Amaro said the school 
board is under the obligation to insure "equal educational opportunity" when 
accepting gifts.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to turn down any money that's going to help the district, but 
we want to make sure it doesn't create imbalances," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes-Jones explained that although some parent groups are successful at 
raising money, schools in poorer areas may not be as successful, and the school 
district doesn't have the money to buy air conditioners for them. Most of the 
district's 17 schools and 11,000 students are without air-conditioning, 
Reyes-Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to exacerbate the inequity," Reyes-Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair or not, cool air is a hot topic, especially when classroom temperatures 
soar past the 100-degree mark.  
</P>
<P>
 "The number of children who go home on hot days with headaches and lose 
education is appalling," said Lynne Frutchey, 35, a kindergarten teacher at 
Laguna Road Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 Frutchey called the board's decision "extreme" and suggested the district turn 
off all its air conditioners, including the units in the board members' 
offices, until the problem is solved.  
</P>
<P>
 Even residents with no children in the school system came to the board meeting 
to offer their opinion.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's socialism, and you're driving everyone down to the lowest level," 
72-year-old Charles Ford told the board.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the American way," agreed Pat Lochrie, who has one child in 
private school. "It's ridiculous that this board thinks it has any right at all 
to take its hands and stick them into these kids' pockets for something they've 
raised for their school," she said. MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; BORDER CHECK STOPS NET DRUG SEIZURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Federal agents seized more than $430,000 worth of narcotics within a span of 
three hours at the San Clemente Border Patrol checkpoint, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first seizure occurred at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday when a 25-year-old man 
riding in a rental car began acting nervous while crossing the checkpoint, said 
Border Patrol agent Ted Swofford. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents discovered 7.6 pounds of cocaine valued at more than $228,000 when they 
pulled the car over to interview the passenger, Raul Quintero-Martinez, and the 
car's 31-year-old driver, Raul Valdez-Quintero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canine units ran around the car and alerted agents," Swofford said. "The 
cocaine was found hidden in the rear door panel." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three hours later, agents pulled over 21-year-old Chester Armstrong, 
of San Diego, as he prepared to cross the checkpoint at 6:20 p.m., Swofford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver stopped the car before the stop sign and when he was waved 
forward, he didn't want to cross," Swofford said. "Then, when he was asked to 
pull over, he took off." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong stopped about 100 yards away from the checkpoint and allowed agents 
to check the contents of his trunk, where they discovered 254 pounds of 
marijuana valued at more than $203,000, Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three men were arrested on suspicion of transporting drugs to sell, 
Swofford said. They are being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 
San Diego. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; LADY WASHINGTON FINALLY GETS TO PORT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stiff winds and high seas couldn't keep the Lady Washington out of Dana Point 
Harbor for long. 
</P>
<P>
 On its third try, the 112-foot vintage tall ship completed a journey from San 
Diego on Thursday, after foul weather had forced the crew to turn back on both 
Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lady Washington is a replica of the first colonial American vessel to 
reach the West Coast. The modern version is equipped with an engine, but 
despite the technological improvement, Capt. William Larson said the ship still 
couldn't make any headway in the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally based at Grays Harbor Historical Seaport in Aberdeen, Wash., the Lady 
Washington is on a tour of West Coast ports. The vessel will be open to the 
public at the Orange County Marine Institute throughout the next two weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about the Lady Washington's visit, call the marine institute 
at (714) 496-2274. The institute is at 24200 Dana Harbor Drive. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; MAN DIGS DEEP FOR BOULDER-HOME SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As far as Dennis Morin is concerned, the $650,000 he paid last week for a 
9,800-square-foot parcel dominated by a huge boulder was a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the rock will eventually be his home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a rock that size on the beach?" Morin said. "It's a steal." 
</P>
<P>
 Morin, 47 and single, is now the proud owner of the craggy boulder at Aliso 
Beach that sparked controversy -- even catching the attention of the British 
and Russian press -- when a Newport Beach architect revealed plans in 1992 to 
scoop it out like a pumpkin and build a three-bedroom house inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Morin, the founder of an Irvine computer software company who now lives in an 
Aliso Viejo condo with "stucco walls and a red tile roof," said he was ready 
for a change when a newspaper ad about the Laguna Beach property caught his eye 
about a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just drove down there and climbed up on the rock and sat there and said, 
'This is great.' I said, 'This is it.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Morin said he plans to live by himself in the house, which should cost "a 
millionish" to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to develop the boulder, which is alongside Coast Highway next to Aliso 
Creek at the south end of town, got off to a controversial start in Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents had balked at the design, calling it a "Disneyland technique," while 
preservationists said the rock was a "cherished landmark" that should be left 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 However, after about a half-dozen public hearings in the city, the Design 
Review Board cleared the plan in October, 1992. And last April, the project won 
unanimous approval from the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the rock will be hollowed out so the 2,800-square-foot home can 
be built inside. The boulder will be recapped with simulated rock and 
landscaped so that it will appear largely unchanged from some vantage points 
along Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-foot-tall rock was previously owned by Mary Bowler, who said she and 
her husband, who is now deceased, bought the parcel for $36,000 about 35 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city must still finish a final plan check on the property, Laguna 
Beach building official John Gustafson said Thursday that he foresees no 
problems with the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Morin could be living in one of Orange County's more unusual dwellings by the 
spring of 1995, according to architect BrionJeannette. 
</P>
<P>
 During a meeting with an interior designer on Thursday, Morin said his new 
home will be "modern and contemporary but warm in feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The essential element is to bring the outside in," he said, to create "a 
harmonious interfacing between the outside and the inside." LESLIE EARNEST

FUTURE LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM MAY INCLUDE STOP IN IRVINE; TRANSIT: CITY WANTS TO BE 
PART OF INITIAL CONSTRUCTION, BUT MAY HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LATER EXTENSION OF THE 
LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Next stop, Irvine," may be heard by passengers aboard a future light rail 
system if city and some county officials have their way. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a disagreement about timing, with Irvine officials wanting their 
portion of the system built in the first phase of construction and not as an 
extension of the main line. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine has some bargaining chips. It already controls $125 million in state 
rail bond money earmarked for a rail project that would serve its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the Orange County Transportation Authority staff is recommending 
that a 13-mile central route be built from South Coast Plaza to Disneyland, 
with future extensions running north to Fullerton and south to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 That recommendation is included in a staff report sent to OCTA board members 
this week. The report was requested by board members who wanted a look at 
longer routes, which would more likely receive long-range federal funding and 
local political support. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation has displeased Irvine officials, who believe their $125 
million entitles their city to be included in any initial project. 
</P>
<P>
 In its report, the OCTA staff studied four ways of extending the central line 
and determined that the Fullerton-to-Irvine route was preferable.  
</P>
<P>
 "At 27.8 miles, this option provides optimal funding flexibility. In addition, 
this alternative enhances future funding strategies by allowing for a centrally 
located initial segment with both northern and southern extensions," it says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton and Irvine depots serve both Amtrak and Metrolink trains. 
They're considered good north-south terminal points for an urban rail line 
because both already can handle increased bus and automobile access by 
potential rail passengers, according to OCTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition," the OCTA report stated, "the 28-mile length closely follows the 
recommendations of (the Federal Transit Administration) and the expert panel to 
identify a priority corridor of approximately 30 miles." 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA staff has recommended against a spur from the Santa Ana Transportation 
Center to Beach Boulevard in Stanton, along the vacant, weed-strewn Pacific 
Electric right of way once traveled by tourists and business people alike. OCTA 
officials said federal transit officials would consider the spur an attempt to 
fund two separate lines instead of one. 
</P>
<P>
 Final evaluations will be presented to the OCTA board on Feb. 28, a public 
hearing will be held on March 14, and a final vote is expected on April 11, 
agency official said.

UCI MEDICAL CENTER TO TAKE PART IN BREAST CANCER STUDY; HEALTH: AT LEAST 50 
LOCAL SURVIVORS OF THE DISEASE WILL BE RECRUITED FOR A NATIONWIDE INQUIRY INTO 
WHETHER A LOW-FAT DIET CAN PREVENT RECURRENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 UCI Medical Center next week will recruit survivors of breast cancer to take 
part in a nationwide study to determine if eating less fat will reduce 
recurrence of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI is one of 20 medical centers throughout the United States participating in 
the study, which will follow about 2,000 women, ages 48 to 78, who have had 
surgery and chemotherapy for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Butler, chief of surgical oncology at UCI Medical Center in Orange, 
said that at least 50 volunteers will be needed locally for UCI's portion of 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a very important study (because) there is a lot of 
epidemiological and experimental information that suggests that decreasing fat 
intake will have a beneficial effect," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without dietary change, breast cancer recurs in about 30% of cases, with the 
relapse rate lower for those who receive initial treatment at an earlier stage 
of the disease. "The majority of women who have a recurrence of cancer will die 
of the disease," Butler said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ernst Wynder, a research physician at the American Health Foundation in 
New York City, is leading the nationwide study funded by the National Cancer 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who participate will be randomly assigned to a control group whose fat 
intake will be limited to 30% of their total daily calories or to a test group 
whose diet will be restricted to 15% fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynder said that 15% was selected as an optimum level of dietary fat because 
it approximates the diet of women in China, where the occurrence of breast 
cancer among post-menopausal women is about one-eighth as frequent as among 
American women. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 1,700 new cases of breast 
cancer will occur this year in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the women in the control group will have a healthier diet than the 
average American, whose diet is typically 37% fat, said Cynthia Smith, a 
nutritionist who will work with study participants. 
</P>
<P>
 The women eating the lowest-fat diet will be closely monitored and receive 
coaching in how to grocery shop, prepare meals and order from restaurant menus. 
They will also meet in support groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can just drop to a 15% fat diet. It takes a lot of effort," Smith 
said, adding that the low-fat diet will include an abundance of fruit, 
vegetables, bread and cereals and less red meat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, especially in Southern California, there are many new fat-free and 
reduced-fat products in the grocery store, including cookies, ice cream and 
yogurt. So (study participants) won't be totally deprived of sweet things," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will be expected to stick to their diets for a minimum of three 
years and perhaps as long as 10 years, since that is the period in which breast 
cancer tends to recur. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said it will take five to 10 years before the success of the low-fat 
diet can be determined. He predicted that even if fat reduction does not prove 
effective in preventing cancer, it will enhance the overall health of study 
participants.

MAN SAVES NEIGHBOR FROM SUICIDE ATTEMPT, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who apparently tried to burn himself to death Thursday was rescued by a 
partially paralyzed neighbor who dragged him out of a smoky mobile home, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out at about 3 p.m. at the Midway Mobile Home Park, 200 W. 
Midway Drive, after a 33-year-old man apparently doused himself with gasoline 
and ignited himself with a lighter, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Anthony Gardner, 38, a neighbor, pulled the burning man to safety, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner said he heard a shout to call 911 and dashed out to see smoke coming 
out of his neighbor's mobile home. He ran to get a crowbar and quickly broke 
open the door, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pitch-black in there," Gardner said. "I took a breath and I went 
inside and started feeling for a body. And I found him. I grabbed him by his 
belt buckle and dragged him out of the trailer." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, whose right arm is partially paralyzed from an auto accident, said it 
took him five attempts before he could pull the victim to safety. Because he 
could only use his left arm, Gardner had to pull the man a short distance, then 
run out for fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose name was withheld, was listed in critical condition at UCI 
Medical Center in Orange, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner was treated at Western Medical Center-Anaheim for smoke inhalation and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, who described the victim as a good friend, said he doesn't believe 
the man had attempted suicide. "I think he fell asleep with a cigarette," he 
said.

'NO. 1 MATCHMAKER' LINED UP ZEROS, SUIT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E. J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three former clients of marriage broker Orly Hadida filed suit Thursday 
against the self-proclaimed "No. 1 Matchmaker in the World," claiming she 
failed to introduce them to the kind of single men they had requested. 
</P>
<P>
 In a civil lawsuit filed Thursday, Roxie Steele of Newport Beach, Leslie 
Kaplan of Woodland Hills and Elizabeth Donner, whose home town was unavailable, 
allege that Hadida's company, "Orly Personal Touch Matchmaker," introduced them 
to men who barely spoke English, were overweight, and earned less than the 
$500,000 annual salaries they desired. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, the lawsuit contended, the man was married. 
</P>
<P>
 Hadida and her attorney, Daryl Hansen, could not be reached for comment 
Thursday. The matchmaker has offices in Newport Beach, Beverly Hills and other 
Southern California locations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, Steele hoped to meet men "who are professional, 
successful, fit, attractive, nonsmokers and marriage-minded." Orly arranged a 
date with a man whom Steele liked a great deal, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Steele later discovered her new boyfriend was already married, she 
canceled her yearlong contract with Orly and demanded a refund of the $5,000 
fee. Orly did not answer her demand, Steele alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan and Donner lodged other complaints about their dates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orly took the $5,000 payment and utterly failed to deliver on her part of the 
bargain," the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
 The three women are suing for full refunds plus interest, along with general 
damages caused by "severe mental depression" resulting from the poor 
introductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a 72-year-old Fullerton woman settled her lawsuit against Hadida, 
whom she claimed had paired her with men "beyond life expectancy" or a 
generation younger than herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethel Ashley alleged that Orly failed to honor a one-year, $10,000 VIP 
contract to provide her with unlimited referrals to wealthy men. In five 
months, Ashley said she met only four men. All were either too young or too old 
and none of them earned enough money, she claimed.

CALTRANS CLOSING HOMELESS CAMP BESIDE FREEWAY

 Caltrans maintenance workers put a group of homeless people on notice Thursday 
that they must move out of a scrubby area next to the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 homeless people have been living amid trees and shrubs off the 
shoulder of the freeway near Lemon Street, a Caltrans spokesman said.Caltrans 
officials say the small community of lean-tos and tents close to the freeway 
may pose a danger to drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans workers handed out flyers to the homeless and posted signs in the 
area Thursday advising trespassers to leave.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've had reports of people riding bicycles down the shoulder," said Albert 
Miranda, spokesman for Caltrans. "There are sanitary and safety issues as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda said nearby residents have reported that dogs owned by the homeless 
people have tried to cross the freeway, and that fencing surrounding the area 
has been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officers will remove anyone who does not leave by 
Tuesday, Miranda said. CHP officers will escort trespassers out of the area, he 
said, but will not arrest or detain anyone unless they resist leaving 
peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers from the Orange County Animal Shelter will remove any animals left 
behind, Miranda said. Caltrans maintenance workers will raze trees and shrubs 
off the shoulder to clear the site after it is vacated. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers also gave information about where the shanty residents could pick 
up any belongings of value left behind in the area and later confiscated by 
officers, Miranda said. The items will be taken to the Orange Maintenance 
Facility, at 691 Tustin Ave. in Orange.

MOTORCYCLIST KILLED IN FREEWAY CRASH TRYING TO FLEE CHP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A motorcyclist being pursued by police along the Costa Mesa Freeway died 
Thursday of injuries suffered in a crash late Wednesday, according to the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The cyclist, identified as Philip Edward Vautrinot, 30, of Lake Forest, was 
first pursued by Newport Beach police officers northbound on the freeway at 
speeds up to 85 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Vautrinot attempted to make the transition to the southbound San Diego

JUDGE URGED TO LIMIT ATTORNEY FEES IN PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's top securities regulator Thursday accused a group of investors' 
lawyers of betraying their clients' interests in settling a lawsuit against 
Prudential Securities Inc., and he urged a federal judge to sharply limit the 
legal fees they will receive. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers have sought fees of about $27 million in the class-action lawsuit 
involving the Prudential Energy Income Funds, plus at least $1.8 million in 
expenses. Any fees will be paid out of a $90-million settlement approved last 
month by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges by state Corporations Commissioner Gary S. Mendoza, in a letter to 
U.S. District Judge Marcel Livaudais Jr. in New Orleans, come as lawyers in the 
case say a major squabble seems to be brewing with Prudential over the size of 
the fees and how they will be divided. 
</P>
<P>
 They come, too, as securities regulators grow increasingly critical of 
class-action lawyers who specialize in representing investors. The regulators 
say these lawyers often negotiate large fees for themselves but little money 
for their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The class action involved Prudential's largest limited partnership program, 
which sold $1.44 billion in oil and gas investments to more than 130,000 small 
investors, many of them elderly. The vast majority of investors lost money. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza's criticisms were aimed at the group of class-action lawyers who filed 
the case three years ago and had urged Livaudais early last year to approve a 
settlement that would have paid investors just $37 million in cash. After state 
regulators and another group of private lawyers objected, the judge derailed 
that settlement last February. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the partnerships have been sold for $491 million -- a sum the 
investors will share, along with their portion of the $90-million settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Mendoza argued that the lawyers had been willing to settle the 
case for much less than it was worth and had sought to collect steep legal fees 
after performing relatively little work. He also noted that whatever is paid to 
the lawyers will mean less for the investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza urged Livaudais to limit the lawyers' fees to the maximum of $12 
million they would have received under the original settlement offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward A. Grossman, the lead investors' class-action lawyer, could not be 
reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Grossman has argued in court that the original offer was fair and 
that the lawyers were right to have accepted it because there was a strong 
chance that they would have lost had the case gone to trial. In legal papers, 
Grossman argued that he had helped bring about the larger settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Bernstein, a lawyer with another firm that is seeking a large share of 
the fees, declined to comment on Mendoza's criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza has recently become outspoken on the Prudential limited partnership 
scandal, positioning California as the last holdout among the states in signing 
a disciplinary settlement with the firm. He contends that most of the credit 
for the larger settlement for Energy Income investors belongs to state 
securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 But a group of private lawyers that intervened in the case early last year 
says it persuaded Livaudais to torpedo the earlier offer. This group is now 
seeking a large portion of the legal fees in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Prudential is also likely to ask Livaudais to reduce the lawyers' 
fees. Under a separate settlement of civil fraud charges with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, the company agreed to set up a $330-million 
restitution fund for investors. Amounts paid to investors in the Energy Income 
class action will be counted as part of the $330 million, but not sums paid in 
legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential executives declined to comment.

GOVERNMENT WILL FREE UP AIRWAVES FOR COMMERCIAL USE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: ACTION 
WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE BANDS AVAILABLE FOR USE ON THE INFORMATION 
SUPERHIGHWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Thursday freed up a slice of the nation's 
airwaves for new commercial communications technologies and proposed that an 
even bigger chunk of government-controlled airwaves be relinquished for future 
commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes -- which could begin as early as this summer and continue into the 
next decade -- could help the government raise billions of dollars by nearly 
doubling the proportion of the airwaves it could make available to businesses 
for wireless phone, data, video transmission and other telecommunications 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Such mobile communications services represent one of the fastest-growing 
segments of the $300-billion telecommunications industry. Telephone and 
computer engineers, among others, are rushing to develop products that will 
allow users to send and receive faxes, voice, video and other information from 
devices as portable and unobtrusive as a wrist watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeing up of airwaves was proposed after the Coast Guard, Department of 
Energy and other government agencies agreed -- after a year of bitter 
negotiations -- to relinquish control over 200 megahertz of valuable radio 
frequency. 
</P>
<P>
 A hertz is a unit of frequency in a radio spectrum that ranges from cosmic 
rays to TV and radio waves. Broadcasters, phone companies, satellite operators 
and others use these airwaves to transmit voice, video and other information. 
But each service ties up slices of radio spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-megahertz chunk is significant: The FM radio band uses just 20 
megahertz, for example; cellular phones use another 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the accord, some military activities, such as air defense radar systems 
and military communications links, would be forced to move outside the block of 
airwaves being reallocated to make way for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts expect the proposal to provoke a huge lobbying campaign pitting 
business against military interests. The Commerce Department is giving all 
parties about three months to comment on its proposals, after which they may be 
modified. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown hailed the proposal as an important step 
toward opening up the telecommunications industry to more competition and 
innovation. He said a quarter of the airwaves will be immediately turned over 
to the Federal Communications Commission for allocation to private commercial 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "This plan has great commercial value as we attempt to construct an 
information superhighway that reaches all the American people," Brown said. "It 
will clearly promote competition in communications, which should have the 
effect of driving down prices for all consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC has said it hopes to raise between $7 billion and $10 billion when it 
begins auctioning airwaves this summer that have been designated for a new 
wireless technology called personal communications services. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Irving, assistant secretary of commerce for communications and 
information, who coordinated work on the Commerce Department plan, said he does 
not believe that freeing up such a huge block of frequencies will depress 
prices for the other frequencies the FCC contemplates auctioning. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FCC has not yet adopted auction rules. Agency officials said they have 
the discretion not to auction the 200-megahertz block of government-controlled 
airwaves and instead allocate them by lottery or through administrative 
hearings.

AT&T CUTTING PAYROLL BY UP TO 15,000 JOBS; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: COMPANY SAYS 
WORK FORCE REDUCTIONS ARE MADE NECESSARY BY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said Thursday that it will cut 14,000 to 
15,000 jobs in its telephone services unit over the next two years, a move the 
company says will save $900 million annually and enable it to stay competitive 
in the cutthroat long-distance business. 
</P>
<P>
 The job reductions are the latest in a seemingly endless series of layoffs by 
blue-chip corporations, whose executives say they must reduce bureaucracy and 
cut costs to compete in the 1990s. Indeed, AT&T has been aggressively slashing 
its payroll for years, ever since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutbacks announced Thursday will affect about 15% of the long-distance 
division's 96,000 employees, falling heavily on middle managers. AT&T, which 
employs 306,000 people overall, said 8,000 managers will lose their jobs; the 
remainder of the cuts will hit unionized workers in clerical and operations 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the reductions will be in New Jersey, where AT&T is 
headquartered, with the rest spread around the country. Eight regional sales 
and service centers, including one in Pleasanton, Calif., will be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T said customer service will not be affected. But the Communications 
Workers of America, the union that represents most of the non-management 
employees, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's yet another example of a healthy company playing to Wall Street and 
looking for a quick cost-cutting fix instead of growing the business," CWA Vice 
President James Irvine said in a statement. "Most of the people AT&T wants to 
get rid of are the operator and service representatives who deal directly with 
the customers. . . . Servicing the customers is AT&T's strength and its 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T and the CWA agreed in 1992 to engage in a program known as the Workplace 
of the Future, designed to foster cooperation between the union and management. 
Irvine said Thursday's action "casts a long shadow" over that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Ketchum, vice president of labor relations at AT&T, said he hopes that 
will not be the case, though he acknowledged that "it certainly creates a 
strain." The union, he said, has been aware of an upcoming layoff, though "the 
magnitude of it may have been a bit of a shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Ketchum said new technologies and processes will enable the company to do the 
same amount of work with fewer employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Nespola, president of Management Network Group, a Leawood, Kan.-based 
telecommunications consulting company, agreed with that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "AT&T has over the last several years put a lot of money into developing new 
systems and new software applications and computer tools that make employees 
more productive," said Nespola, whose firm counts all the major long-distance 
carriers among its clients. "You should not see any diminishment in their 
service." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, AT&T is taking on a big task in trying to fight its competitive battles 
against MCI and Sprint with a smaller work force. AT&T's share of the 
long-distance market has been declining, if slowly, and it has suffered from 
recent blunders in consumer marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it remains by far the largest long-distance carrier and produces 
substantial profit -- $982 million in the fourth quarter of 1993. Peter 
Bernstein, senior vice president of Probe Research of Cedar Knolls, N.J., said 
the problem is not that the company isn't making money, but rather that "it's 
not making what (it thinks) it should." 
</P>
<P>
 Competition, he said, has forced AT&T to cut prices, "so the only way to 
maintain profit is to cut people." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bell System was broken up in 1984, AT&T had 373,000 employees; most 
observers agreed that its monopoly tradition had left the firm bloated. 
Currently, the company has 309,000 workers, despite adding 69,000 employees 
through acquisitions over the last decade.

4TH QUARTER CAPS A GM TURNAROUND; AUTOS: COMPANY EARNED $2.46 BILLION LAST 
YEAR, INCLUDING A RARE QUARTERLY PROFIT IN NORTH AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, General Motors Corp. was spending an average of 35 hours to build 
a car. Today, that time has been cut by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, GM pumped up sales by shipping nearly 750,000 vehicles at cut-rate 
prices to rental car companies. In 1993, it sold only 500,000 cars to rental 
fleets, while boosting more profitable retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, GM had a salaried staff of 91,000. Today, those ranks have been 
trimmed to 71,000; several thousand more white-collar jobs will be eliminated 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 These signs of a more efficient and cost-conscious company are among the 
reasons why GM, once the basket case of the world automotive industry, reported 
fourth-quarter earnings Thursday of $1.18 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 More important, the auto behemoth made a quarterly profit in its North 
American auto operations for the first time since the spring of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's turnaround from a $652-million fourth-quarter loss in 1992 is further 
evidence of a U.S. auto boom being driven by free-spending consumers seeking to 
replace aging vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. had operating earnings of 
$7.41 billion in 1993 -- the Big Three's first profitable year since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 GM earned $2.46 billion, or $2.13 a share, for 1993. The company lost a record 
$23.5 billion, or $38.28 a share, in 1992, but that included a onetime 
$20.8-billion charge for future retiree health benefits. GM's revenue for 1993 
totaled $138.2 billion, up 4.5% from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 While the company's automotive operations showed significant improvement, the 
1993 earnings were solely attributable to the strong performance of three 
non-auto units: GMAC financial, EDS computer services and Hughes Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter, however, the company's automotive operations 
contributed more than 40% of the firm's $1.28-a-share profit. The biggest 
turnaround came in North America, where GM had operating earnings of $427 
million in the final three months, compared to a loss of $1.79 billion in the 
year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're encouraged by the trend, but we can't be satisfied until the earnings 
power of our operations in North America is fully restored," said John F. 
Smith, GM chief executive and president. 
</P>
<P>
 The company -- belittled for its inefficient factories, bloated work force and 
dated cars and trucks -- has lost nearly $18 billion in North America since 
1990, including $982 million in full-year 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's goal was to make the company profitable in 1993 in North America 
before interest, taxes and retiree health care benefits. Having hit that 
target, he now promises net earnings in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "No excuses," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the expectation of improved results has driven GM's stock to 
its highest level in 30 years. But the shares retreated Thursday to $62.50, 
down $1.75 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange as investors took profits 
in the entire auto sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said GM's results were aided by a $444-million federal income tax 
credit taken in the fourth quarter. "About 40% of the fourth-quarter net income 
came from the tax department, not the auto department," said David Healy, an 
analyst with S.G. Warburg, a New York brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most analysts were impressed with GM's advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a doubt, year over year GM is making progress in North America," said 
David Garrity, analyst for McDonald & Co. Investments in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 GM attributed the improvement to both the growing economy and the company's 
ongoing restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's U.S. sales increased about 6% last year, but its market share 
retreated to 33.2% from 33.9% in 1992. GM officials said the share loss was in 
part due to 250,000 fewer fleet sales. The fleet sales kept factories running 
but provided little profit and eroded new car sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is an assembly plant of volume," said G. Richard Wagoner, chief 
financial officer. "But it was costing us a tremendous amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
 With retail demand on the rise, GM has been able to reduce rebates and other 
incentives. The average incentive was $880 per vehicle in the 1993 fourth 
quarter, down from $960 a year earlier. GM Comes Back

 Workers' Comp Insurer Sued: Three employers have filed a class-action suit 
claiming that California's biggest workers' compensation carrier, State 
Compensation Insurance Fund, has intentionally or negligently allowed its 
customers to be improperly overcharged for their coverage.The suit, filed in 
Orange County Superior Court, alleges that the insurer overstated by $500 
million the insurance reserves it has held over the last two years to cover 
potential claims against its customers. The suit says that the misreporting, in 
turn, enabled the insurer to inflate premiums for employers. The insurer, also 
known as SCIF, denied the accusation and said the plaintiffs should have 
submitted their complaint to state regulators to try to resolve the dispute 
before filing a lawsuit.

 Apple Computer to Introduce Set-Top Device for TVs: In its first foray into 
interactive television, Apple said it will introduce a device next week to let 
viewers receive movies and other services that will be offered by cable TV and 
telephone companies. The device will use the technology inside the Macintosh 
personal computer. Apple, the largest independent personal computer maker in 
the United States, said it signed an agreement to make the device compatible 
with a computer-based movie retrieval system being developed by Oracle Systems 
Corp. Apple will demonstrate the set-top box Tuesday in Los Angeles, along with 
Oracle's system, which essentially serves as a computerized VCR that can send 
programs to thousands of homes at one time.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; SCRAMBLE FOR TEMPORARY OFFICES SLICES VALLEY 
VACANCY RATE; REAL ESTATE: OTHER MARKETS GAIN FROM DISPLACED FIRMS SEEKING 
QUARTERS. RENTS EXPECTED TO CLIMB SOON. 
</P>

 Tenants scrambling for temporary quarters have sent office vacancy rates 
plunging in the San Fernando Valley, putting upward pressure on rents and 
bolstering other markets from Pasadena to Ventura County, real estate experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake knocked out dozens of high-rises and millions of 
square feet of office space. As a result, leasing experts say the overall 
vacancy rate in the San Fernando Valley -- the lowest in Southern California 
even before the quake hit -- could fall to 7% by summer from 14.5% just a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer maker Packard Bell, which had announced its intention to move out of 
the area shortly before the temblor hit, has vacated its quake-damaged 
headquarters in Chatsworth and rented temporary office and manufacturing space 
for at least a year in Ventura County. Although office rents have not risen 
much following the Jan. 17 quake, most local brokerage experts say prices 
should start climbing soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although there is a tremendous short-term need for office space in the 
Valley, we haven't seen a rise in the cost of rent," said Seth Dudley, a 
leasing agent with Julien J. Studley in Westwood. "But as the dust settles and 
the vacancy rate goes down in a few months, the cost of the remaining space 
will start to creep up."  
</P>
<P>
 One of the early winners in the search for new office space is the Conejo 
Valley, which includes Newbury Park and Thousand Oaks. More than 500,000 square 
feet of empty space was rented in the area in the two weeks following the 
quake, according to the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake-related deals have also helped fill the 434,000-square-foot Studio Plaza 
office development in Burbank. Among the new tenants: the Motion Picture Assn. 
of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which 
is temporarily relocating from its damaged headquarters in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Broker Mike Zugsmith, president of Zugsmith-Thind in Burbank, said he expects 
the demand for temporary office space to send the vacancy rate into single 
digits within weeks and cut it in half in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "But long-term," he said, "my sense is that the quake will have little impact 
overall. Many of these temporary leases will wash out in the next month to two 
years, when tenants displaced by the earthquake begin moving back to their 
repaired or rebuilt buildings."  
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, tenants are bound by lease agreements to reoccupy a building 
after it is repaired or rebuilt, Zugsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell decided to lease a 160,000-square-foot building in Westlake 
Village for its temporary headquarters and a 176,000-square-foot building in 
Camarillo as a manufacturing center for its personal computers. Before the 
quake left its Chatsworth headquarters badly damaged, the company, which 
employs 1,600 people, was reportedly planning to move to Palmdale or out of 
state.

DOW FALLS 36.58 ON COMMENTS BY ANALYST; BOND YIELDS UP

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks slumped again Thursday as interest rate jitters hit the market and 
profit takers pulled auto issues lower. Utility stocks dropped sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond yields rose as the Treasury concluded its quarterly refinancing with 
the sale of 30-year bonds and as investors focused on today's release of 
January wholesale inflation figures. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The market began the day with a small carry-over rally from Wednesday's gain, 
but sellers quickly gained the upper hand. Prices seesawed the rest of the 
session, but the overall trend was lower all day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials finished down 36.58 points at 3,895.34, as losers led 
winners 1,311 to 811 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Wall Street was unnerved by well-known Lehman Bros. analyst 
Elaine Garzarelli's comments on CNBC-TV. She said that while she remains 
bullish on the market, she sees a correction of 4% to 7% coming at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Garzarelli "got the ball rolling downhill," said Guy Truicko, analyst at Unity 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders were also disappointed by the reaction to General Motors' quarterly 
earnings report. GM sank 1 3/4 to 62 1/2, pulling Ford down 2 1/2 to 66 and 
Chrysler down 1 5/8 to 59 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Another negative was a sharp decline in utility stocks. The Dow utility index 
tumbled to a new 52-week low. That selloff suggested that investors remain 
fearful of another rise in interest rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the market is still sorting out the possibilities in the wake of 
the Federal Reserve Board's move last Friday to tighten credit for the first 
time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Besides the auto stocks, other industrial issues hit by profit taking 
included Deere, off 1 3/4 to 79 5/8; Caterpillar, down 2 3/4 to 106 1/8, and 
machine tool maker Cincinnati Milacron, down 1 5/8 to 22 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among utility stocks, Houston Industries shed 7/8 to 43 3/8, American 
Electric Power dropped 3/4 to 33 5/8 and Commonwealth Edison sank 3/4 to 26 
3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Banking and brokerage stocks were also broadly lower. Merrill Lynch fell 1 
1/4 to 40 3/4, First Interstate dropped 1 3/4 to 64 3/4, BankAmerica eased 5/8 
to 42 3/4 and NationsBank sank 1 1/4 to 48 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the upside, GTech Holdings soared 3 1/4 to 32 1/4. The company won a 
$200-million, seven-year contract from the Texas Department of Human Services 
to provide a system of electronic transfer of welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign trading, London's FTSE-100 index lost 22.1 points to 3,407.0, while 
Frankfurt's DAX index ended at 2,118.96, up 33.67 points. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 
average inched up 149.32 points to 19,990.70. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, profit takers struck again, pulling the Bolsa index down 41.19 
points to 2,818.44. Toronto shares also fell, with the TSE-300 index easing 
21.20 points to 4,441.97. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields rose after Wednesday's brief respite, as the Treasury finished its 
quarterly refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
 The department sold new 30-year bonds at an average yield of 6.43%, up from 
6.33% at the last auction, held in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said there was strong demand for the new bonds from Wall Street firms, 
which now must find buyers among institutional investors. The bid-to-cover 
ratio, a measure of demand comparing the number of bids offered to those 
accepted, was 2.78 to 1, up from the average of 2.23 to 1 in the previous 12 
auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts attributed the strong demand in part to the fact that the Treasury 
last spring reduced the frequency of 30-year auctions from four times to twice 
yearly as part of a shift toward shorter-term securities. That has created a 
higher perceived value for the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the well-received auction didn't stop traders from pushing other 
yields up. The yield on 2-year T-notes closed at 4.45%, up from 4.40% on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A key test for the market comes today, when the government issues its first 
look at inflation in 1994 with the January wholesale prices report. A 
higher-than-expected number could stoke fears of higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Light, sweet crude oil futures eased 4 cents to $14.56 a barrel on the New 
York Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Precious metals weakened again. February gold dropped $2 to $382 an ounce; 
March silver slipped 1.5 cents to $5.32.

PANEL'S ADVICE POSES THREAT TO ULCER DRUGS; MEDICINE: EXPERTS CONVENED BY THE 
NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH RECOMMEND ANTIBIOTICS TO TREAT THE CONDITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The $7-billion market for drugs that ease ulcer symptoms is under threat after 
medical experts recommended that the condition be treated with antibiotics, 
which provide a cheaper, quicker alternative. The recommendation, made 
Wednesday by an independent panel convened by the National Institutes of 
Health, is supported by evidence that shows ulcers are caused by the bacterium 
H. pylori and therefore can be treated with antibiotics or a combination of 
antibiotics and ulcer drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts were divided over how much of a negative impact the recommendation 
will have on the companies that make ulcer drugs, which decrease the amount of 
acid in the stomach. Experts predict that the decline in sales of ulcer 
medications could range from 5% to up to 40% over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many variables, we don't know how much of an impact it's going 
to have," said Hemant Shah, an analyst who heads H.K.S. & Co. in Warren, N.J. 
"But one thing is certain: It's going to be negative." 
</P>
<P>
 The market is dominated by three pharmaceutical giants: Glaxo Inc., maker of 
Zantac, the world's best-selling drug, with global sales in excess of $3 
billion; Merck & Co., maker of Pepcid and Prilosec, whose combined sales total 
about $1.3 billion, and SmithKline Beecham, maker of $1-billion-a-year Tagamet. 
</P>
<P>
 These drugs, more costly than antibiotics, are often taken for months or 
years. Antibiotic therapy is short-term in nature, perhaps just a few weeks. 
Antibiotics are also cheaper, and generic equivalents of them, which are 
cheaper still, are more likely to be available. 
</P>
<P>
 The link between ulcers and H. pylori is not new. Two Australian physicians 
identified the bacterium in 1983 in patients with ulcers and gastritis. Experts 
say the most likely course of therapy would combine antibiotic drugs with 
current ulcer medications. Still, that would cut short the length of time a 
patient would need an antisecretory medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Nordmann, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc., predicted that the impact 
on ulcer drug sales would be fairly modest, mainly because the drugs are used 
for many other conditions, such as heartburn. 
</P>
<P>
 But investors weren't as confident. On the New York Stock Exchange, Glaxo, 
whose shares trade as American Depositary Receipts, fell 87.5 cents to $18.25 
on Thursday. SmithKline's shares sank $1.25 to $29.625, while Merck stock was 
unchanged at $34.875 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 As the market leader, Glaxo would appear to have the most to lose. But Glaxo 
spokeswoman Nancy Pekarek said that "it's hard to say what the (recommendation) 
means."

 New Weekly Jobless Claims Decline: The number of Americans filing new claims 
for state jobless benefits fell by 47,000 last week to 366,000, almost erasing 
the large jump after the California earthquake, the Labor Department said.The 
sharp drop in first-time claims for the week ended Feb. 5 was the largest in 
more than five months. New claims for unemployment benefits had surged 50,000 
to 413,000 the prior week, with about 20% of the increase in California. That 
jump helped push the closely watched average of claims over the last four weeks 
to 377,250, its highest level in 15 months.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; ECONOMISTS REVISE THEIR RATTLED OUTLOOK; 
RECOVERY: A GROWING NUMBER SAY STATE RECESSION WILL END BY EARLY NEXT YEAR, 
DESPITE PREVIOUS GLOOM OVER QUAKE IMPACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the full economic impact of the Northridge earthquake comes slowly into 
focus, a small but growing number of economists say the temblor will not delay 
the Southland's long-awaited recovery for very long and are renewing their 
forecasts that the regional recession will be over by the start of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier predictions that the Jan. 17 quake would keep Southern California 
mired in recession well into 1995 are being replaced by more upbeat forecasts 
that the temblor may delay the recovery by only a month or two. Some forecasts 
say the economy will turn around as early as this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists credit their new optimism to a variety of factors, including the 
quick repair of the region's telecommunications network and a relatively fast 
and effective response by disaster relief agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The full-scale meltdown of the transportation system that some analysts said 
was imminent never materialized, so most merchants and manufacturers are having 
little trouble getting the goods and materials needed to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
 "At worst, I think the quake might push back Southern California's recovery by 
60 days, maybe even less," Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles 
County Economic Development Corp., said Thursday at a breakfast meeting of 
downtown executives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The score right now is Optimists 1, Doomsayers 0," he said. "The recovery 
should still arrive by the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kyser initially worried that the businesses that were closed by the 
quake could raise the region's unemployment rate, he now believes the 
rebuilding effort could create more jobs than the temblor cost. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, before the quake, Kyser predicted that employment in the 
construction industry would be flat this year. But now he says the rebuilding 
effort should create 10,000 construction jobs, plus nearly 20,000 others in 
related industries such as engineering and furniture making. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are any silver linings in the clouds, this is one of them," Kyser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts at Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bank are also more confident 
about the future of the Southland economy than they were immediately after the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, I thought the improvements we were seeing (before the temblor) 
were so fragile that the quake was going to push our recovery back farther into 
next year," said Adrian Sanchez, the bank's regional economist. "But L.A. 
bounced back quickly, and there's a lot of insurance money and federal help on 
the way. So I'm sticking to my original forecast: Southern California will be 
in recovery by early '95." 
</P>
<P>
 With the region's infrastructure on the mend, most economists now are more 
concerned about tourism than transportation. The quake is expected to cost 
about 9,000 tourism jobs, according to Pannell Kerr Forster, an industry 
consultant. But most of those jobs have already disappeared, said PKF director 
Bruce Baltin, and Los Angeles' $20-billion-a-year tourism industry should 
return to normal by the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Los Angeles Convention & Visitors Bureau say the industry 
could rebound even sooner if no more major aftershocks hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time there's a big aftershock, the networks show it on the nightly 
news, and it erodes visitors' confidence in our city," said Gary Sherwin, the 
bureau's spokesman. "People see a collapsed apartment in Northridge and they 
think all of Southern California looks like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Even assuming the best about the earthquake, California's economy is hardly 
out of the woods. Standard & Poor's Corp. on Thursday changed its long-term 
outlook on the state to "negative" from "stable," citing dwindling funds and 
budget deficits. Although S&P did not mention last month's quake, California 
officials have said the disaster caused $13 billion to $20 billion in damage, 
making it the second-worst natural disaster in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit agency said that, with economic recovery in the state now expected 
to slip to late 1994 or early 1995, balancing the state's 1995 budget will be 
difficult. S&P said California faces pressures from school, welfare and prison 
needs. The recovery has been hampered by the loss of 868,000 jobs, or 7% of the 
work force, since 1990. Half those were in defense and 40% were in 
construction, S&P said.

$1,136.5 billion from $1,136.4 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, 
deposits in checking accounts and non-bank traveler's checks. M2 is M1 plus

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: WERE SECRET TALKS ON SOFTWARE DEAL NOT VERY SECRET? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some lucky investors were piling into shares of Broderbund Software before its 
$400-million merger agreement with Electronic Arts was announced late 
Wednesday--raising the question of whether there was a leak about the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Broderbund's stock reacted to the merger announcement by soaring 
$4.625 to $45.875 a share in Nasdaq trading. But the price had been rising 
steadily Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday--up $1.75, $2 and $3.75 
respectively--during the secret talks between the two interactive software 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Electronic Arts, which is the acquirer in this deal, saw its 
shares edge lower between Monday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot: Buyers of Broderbund at Monday's low of $33 have made 39% this 
week by grabbing the stock before the merger announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, trading in call-option contracts on Broderbund's stock on the 
Chicago Board Options Exchange also surged this week. A call gives the buyer 
the right to acquire a given stock at a set price in the future--a way to lock 
in a profit in advance if you expect the stock to soar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Could there have been a leak of the deal? Broderbund spokeswoman Robin 
Linstrom in Novato, Calif., said the firm was obviously aware of the stock's 
rise before the announcement, and tried to track down what was moving it. "I 
heard no rumors on (Wall) Street regarding Broderbund and Electronic Arts," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Bakar, analyst at brokerage Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, agreed. 
"I heard not a peep about this" in the market, he said. But Bakar added that 
the stock's action "looks a little strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said some buyers of Broderbund this week probably were motivated by 
continuing rumors that the firm is set to buy the electronic rights to Dr. 
Seuss characters for use in interactive home software programs. In addition, on 
Tuesday, Broderbund competitor Sierra On-Line announced strong home-software 
sales gains in its latest quarter. That sent its shares up $3.375 to $22.875 
that day, and refocused investor attention on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 A research report released last Friday by San Francisco-based investment 
bankers Robertson Stephens & Co. also may have helped Broderbund's stock. The 
report, by Robertson analyst Peter Rogers, reiterated his "buy" recommendation 
for Broderbund, though it mentioned nothing about a possible takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, Robertson also is the banker representing Broderbund in the 
merger talks. Which raises the question: Should Robertson have allowed its 
analyst to put out that report so close to the consummation of a surprise 
merger? 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson President Michael McCaffery noted that his firm, like all 
brokerages, has a "Chinese wall" between its banking department and its 
research department, to avoid potential conflicts of interest. So analyst 
Rogers knew nothing about the pending deal, McCaffery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, when a brokerage is working secretly on a merger, it will put a 
moratorium on comment from its research side without explaining why. But 
McCaffery points out that such moratoriums create conflicts in and of 
themselves, by immediately confirming for outsiders that something is brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the research report was a reiteration of the analyst's "buy" 
recommendation, not a change in his outlook, McCaffery said the firm thought it 
best not to raise suspicions by quashing the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky thing for any Robertson clients who took Rogers' advice. Unlucky for 
anyone who sold out their Broderbund shares to those eager buyers who appeared 
before the deal was made public. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC Wants Fund Trading Data: As expected, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission has launched a major probe of mutual fund managers' personal-account 
trading habits since recent disclosures of controversial trading by a star 
Invesco Funds manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC said Thursday it has requested extensive information from 30 fund 
companies, none of which it named, to determine whether the funds' internal 
controls over manager trading are adequate. Among other things, the SEC will 
review the funds' codes of ethics, any recent violations by managers of 
in-house rules, and how trading in managers' personal accounts compares to the 
trades they have made for their funds. 
</P>
<P>
 With the rapid growth of the fund industry since 1991, concern has mounted 
about the potential for fund managers to enrich themselves by personally 
trading in stocks ahead of transactions they make for their funds. Most fund 
companies have stringent controls over such activities, but for political 
reasons, the SEC has been expected to take a closer look at fund practices. 
Pre-Merger Excitement 
</P>
<P>
 Though Electronic Arts' negotiations to buy Broderbund Software were secret, 
Broderbund's shares surged between Monday and Wednesday, just before the deal 
was announced. 03,11,16,15 Day Broderbund Elec. Arts Friday 33 3/4, -2 25 1/2,

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: SURVIVAL KITS CAN JOLT THE WALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Can your wallet survive the cost of an earthquake survival kit? We paid $29.99 
at Vons this week for a kit containing supplies that would cost 25% less if 
purchased separately. 
</P>
<P>
 The kit contains 1.5 pints of water (79 cents for half a gallon at Lucky), six 
high-calorie food bars ($4 at Extend-a-Life in Pasadena), a space blanket ($2 
at Extend-a-Life), a plastic flashlight (98 cents at Home Depot), an AM 
transistor radio ($6.99 at Radio Shack), two D batteries ($2.55 for six at Home 
Depot), two AA batteries ($2.87 for eight at Home Depot), eight Bayer aspirin 
tablets ($6.39 for 100 at Lucky), less than a tenth of an ounce of antibiotic 
($3.99 an ounce at Sav-on), six alcohol prep pads ($1.79 for 100 at Sav-on), 
three gauze pads ($2.29 for 10 at Lucky), four Band-Aids ($2.15 for 60 at 
Lucky) and six antiseptic towelettes ($1.67 for 20 at Sav-on). 
</P>
<P>
 Based on these prices, you could duplicate the survival kit's contents for 
just over $21, while including 10 times the antibiotic (the kit gives you three 
foil packets; our price is for a tube) and more than twice as much water. You 
could lower the cost further by buying generic medications and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing missing from our list is the belt pack the kit's items come in. 
If you need that to survive, the Lands End catalogue recently had them on sale 
for $4. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people may find the kits convenient. Other people concerned about saving 
a few bucks might want to assemble their own kits. 
</P>

 Now for really frequent fliers: United Airlines is requiring its frequent 
fliers to go the extra mile -- 5,000 miles to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 In notices to its frequent fliers this month, United said it is raising the 
mileage points needed for a free domestic round-trip ticket to 25,000 from 
20,000. In another change, the airline said that unused mileage points will 
expire after three years, making it harder for occasional fliers to earn free 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes reduce United's outstanding liability for free tickets and shift 
the emphasis of the program toward people who fly often, primarily business 
travelers. It comes amid other industry moves to limit mileage point 
accumulation. Recently American Airlines placed a cap on the mileage points 
people can earn by using its Citibank AAdvantage Visa or MasterCard. 
</P>
<P>
 United's changes take effect Feb. 1, 1995. 
</P>

 Gone flat: The company that makes STP automotive products is recalling STP 
Flat Fixer, an aerosol product that temporarily patches flat tires. The company 
said a chemical in the aerosol spray is flammable and could ignite if 
precautions are not taken when the tire is later removed at a gas station for 
permanent repair. 
</P>
<P>
 The product inflates a flat tire to about 15 pounds of pressure, enough to 
allow a car to be driven a short distance for repair. First Brands Corp. Vice 
President Mark Haglund said the product is safe for consumers to use. The 
hazard arises when the tire is removed for repair and flammable gas is 
released. A fire could result if anyone nearby is smoking or if friction from 
removing the tire sets off a spark, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haglund said the company cannot be certain that mechanics are aware of the 
hazard. He said the recall is voluntary and that no injuries have been 
reported. The problem was uncovered through internal product testing, Haglund 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers may call (800) 277-3766 for a refund and disposal instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not too well done: American Express, in a pitch to cardholders, is offering 28 
ounces of steaks from Omaha Steaks International for $39.95, plus a free 
one-pound tin of pistachio nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a good deal? An ad in New Yorker magazine offers 30 ounces of Omaha 
steaks for the special introductory price of $29.95. First-time buyers may want 
to pass up the American Express special offer, unless they take their filet 
mignon with pistachios. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Odds and ends: Marketers are continuing to work the earthquake angle. An 
Arcadia company is touting its cellular phone as an "earthquake survival kit," 
and a Westwood clinic offers to relieve quake-related stress. . . . La 
Mirada-based Playmates hopes to boost sales of its action figures by further 
mutating its Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles into amphibian Indiana Jones and Star 
Trek personalities.

VIACOM SAYS QVC IS CHEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Viacom Inc. on Thursday charged that QVC Network Inc., its rival in the 
bidding war for Paramount Communications Inc., is cheating by attempting to 
improve its offer before the contest's Monday deadline, and it called on 
Paramount to take "vigorous action." 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom noted that QVC has hinted in recent meetings with securities analysts 
and traders that it might provide guarantees for the price of the stock portion 
of its Paramount bid.Those guarantees would come from having one of QVC's 
investors, BellSouth Corp., agree to purchase QVC stock in the future, 
according to published reports. Viacom denounced QVC's efforts as "a backdoor 
attempt by QVC to change its offer after the bidders' Feb. 1 deadline." Viacom 
said that, in response, it will consider "all options and remedies." Paramount 
had no immediate comment. QVC denied the accusations.

 It's not war yet, but battle lines are being drawn. Insiders wonder how MTV 
will react to Warner Music Group, Sony Software, EMI Music, PolyGram Holding 
and Ticketmaster launching an interactive music channel.The main question is 
whether MTV will air videos from its fledgling competitors. Conversely, once 
the new channel is up and running sometime in 1995, will Warner, Sony, PolyGram 
and EMI make their music readily available to MTV? Meanwhile, insiders are 
casting an early pall over the music channel planned by TCI and Bertelsmann 
Music Group. Some wonder whether the venture is more than a press release.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: CORMAN NEARS SALE OF B-MOVIE LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roger Corman, king of the B-movies, is looking to cash out -- again. 
</P>
<P>
 After selling New World Pictures in 1983, Corman says he's close to striking a 
deal for his cult-classic library, which was not part of the original sale. 
Included in the package are "Death Race 2000," "Big Bad Mama," "Stepmonster" 
("She's Mean. She's Green. She's Your New Mom!") and "Carnosaur" -- not to be 
confused with Steven Spielberg's dinosaur movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Corman refuses to name his asking price or the prospective buyers. But 
industry sources say he began shopping the 250-plus titles around last year for 
$20 million to $30 million. People close to the company say the deal remains 
lucrative, despite rumors that the price has been lowered to about $18 million 
and that Corman has had a tough time finding a taker. 
</P>
<P>
 By selling the library now, Corman hopes to capitalize on the surging interest 
in entertainment programming that began with the Paramount Communications 
takeover battle. One analyst joked that there are enough films in the library 
to create a "Roger Corman Cable Network" if all the hype surrounding the 
500-channel cable universe becomes reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Concorde-New Horizons Corp., the successor to New World, will not be part of 
the deal. Corman says he intends to continue making 20 or so movies a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no plans to retire in any way," said the producer, who turns 68 in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 While he operates well outside the mainstream and on small margins, Corman is 
known as one of Hollywood's craftiest businessmen. The title of his 1990 
autobiography, "How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a 
Dime," is indicative of his reputation, though Corman confesses that he 
actually did lose money on a small number of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Corman is also known for being strictly private about his financial 
activities. He's peddling the library without the aid of an investment banker 
or any other formal adviser. Asked to asses its worth over lunch at The Grill 
one day, Corman responded: "Neither we nor the prospective purchasers know what 
it's worth. It'll be our guess against theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 One concern among people who have passed on the library is that there may be 
some cross-ownership problems, which Corman's company denies. Others worry that 
the movies are too short, too violent or too weird for broadcast TV. "You 
couldn't base an entire channel around the films, because there aren't many big 
stars," said one buyer. "But it might make sense for someone who already has a 
big library." 
</P>
<P>
 Corman insists there's still plenty of room in the marketplace for his brand 
of movie. 
</P>
<P>
 With the death of the drive-in theater partly to blame for B-movie revenue 
falling 76% from 1989 to 1991, Corman and his management team -- which includes 
video president Jonathan D. Fernandez and sales manager Bill Bromiley -- have 
shifted much of the company's attention to the video market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 70% of Corman's films go directly to videotape -- with the big sellers 
including its record-setting "Carnosaur" (85,000 copies), "Blood Fist IV" 
(40,000 copies) and a family movie called "White Wolves" (55,000 copies). The 
other 30% does most of its theatrical business in small towns. And about 50% of 
the company's overall business comes from foreign sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Corman has also survived largely by sticking to the low-budget, high-volume 
formula he developed some 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fantastic Four," which is now in post-production, ranks as a major 
undertaking by Corman standards, at $4 million. Most of his movies still cost 
less than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Corman also develops 75% of his ideas in-house, using a stable of beginning 
writers and directors who work out of a former lumberyard in Venice that Corman 
calls "The Factory." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a well-known part of the Corman legend that past pupils have included 
Jack Nicholson, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Ron Howard, Robert 
DeNiro and Jonathan Demme. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about a lengthy development process or round-table rewrites: "If we 
want to make a picture, we decide in 30 minutes and start shooting three days 
later," Corman says. 
</P>
<P>
 People close to Corman say it's not surprising that he has avoided the 
temptation to make a big-budget movie over the years, given his conservative 
style. One associate remembers Corman stepping into a beat-up, unrecognizable 
car after lunch one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Corman explained that it was a prop car that had just been blown up for one of 
his movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Corman agrees that he's most comfortable operating outside the traditional 
film community, but he also challenges the way his films are most commonly 
labeled. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not B or B-plus pictures," Corman says. "These are A-minus 
pictures. It's a subtle differentiation." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 They do it their way: The French, fierce protectors of their own culture and 
well-known lovers of Jerry Lewis, also have a thing for Paul Anka, it turns 
out. Anka was recently named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by 
the French Minister of Culture for his international contributions to music. 
The performer was in Paris to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his best-known 
songwriting achievement, "My Way."

MCA BUYS 'SIGNIFICANT' STAKE IN O.C.'S INTERPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MCA Inc., the Japanese-owned movie and entertainment giant, said Thursday that 
it has purchased a "significant minority stake" in Interplay Productions Inc., 
one of Orange County's largest video game publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Fargo, president of Interplay, said the company was courted by all of 
the major Hollywood studios but decided on MCA, parent company of Universal 
Studios, because of its extensive entertainment holdings -- from books and 
movies to records and theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in a unique position as one of the last independent, privately held 
publishers of a large size," Fargo said. "My attitude was that it wasn't about 
the money or hype, but the strategic partnership that counted." 
</P>
<P>
 Fargo said his company would use the money for internal expansion and 
acquisitions of other game companies. Neither company would say how much money 
MCA invested. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Isgur, an analyst at Volpe, Welty & Co. in San Francisco, estimated 
Interplay's current market value at about $100 million and said MCA's 
investment may be $30 million to $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 This deal combines Interplay's talent for producing interactive games and 
software with MCA's library of movies, records and books -- titles that can be 
converted into interactive entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Interplay has published computer games based on Paramount's 
original "Star Trek" television series. MCA's Universal Studios, which produced 
the hit "Jurassic Park," will likely work closely with Interplay on 
movie-related projects, said Skip Paul, executive vice president of MCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Other opportunities include producing interactive computer programs that use 
video and sound of musicians from MCA's Geffen Records unit. Interplay recently 
produced "Xplora 1" for rock star Peter Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 The MCA-Interplay partnership is the latest in a series of alliances between 
Hollywood studios and video game publishers to create multimedia titles, or 
those that combine the interactive elements of video games with the visual and 
sound content of movies on compact discs known as CD-ROMs.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, Irvine-based video game publisher Virgin Interactive 
Entertainment raised $55 million from selling minority stakes to Blockbuster 
Entertainment Video and Hasbro Inc. And just this week, Virgin announced plans 
to issue stock to the public, which could raise an estimated $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have spent the last few years carefully studying the interactive software 
industry," Sid Sheinberg, president of MCA, said in a statement. "We have 
looked at a number of opportunities in this area, but early on identified Brian 
Fargo's Interplay as the ideal next step for MCA." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul said MCA chose to invest in Interplay because of Fargo's business style. 
He said Interplay, which may open an office on the Universal Studios lot, would 
be completely autonomous. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an executive who manages the creative people and product with his own 
hands," Paul said. "Sort of like a film studio run by a filmmaker. Everybody 
has been talking about Silicon Valley and Hollywood. That's looking down the 
wrong freeway. They should have looked at Hollywood and Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fargo, 31, founded Interplay 10 years ago as an independent publisher of 
computer and video games. Fargo was a whiz kid programmer from Corona del Mar 
who left college to pursue game design. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly on the strength of its in-house game development, Interplay has grown 
to $60 million in annual sales and 140 employees with offices in London and 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 As video games become more sophisticated, Interplay has hired a wide array of 
talent, including programmers, actors, musicians and special effects people. 
Consequently, Interplay's Irvine headquarters resembles a movie studio more 
than a computer software firm. 
</P>
<P>
 New media such as the CD-ROM, or compact disc, read-only memory, allow 
computer games to store more than 600 times the data kept on a floppy computer 
disk. Such capacity allows Interplay to put more film footage, stereo sound, 
computer animation and text into its games. And that means the company must 
license more titles from Hollywood studios that own the rights.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've made it on our own for 10 years, and we're trained well to survive 
because there are 100 failures for every success," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The company's top-selling titles include "Battle Chess," "Mario Teaches 
Typing" of Super Mario Bros. fame; and "Star Trek: 25th Anniversary Enhanced 
CD-ROM." Last Christmas, Interplay's "Clay Fighter," a parody of violent arcade 
games, was one of the top-selling titles for the Super Nintendo Entertainment 
System. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the arrangement, MCA is Interplay's sole outside investor. MCA was also 
granted additional options to increase its minority position.  
</P>
<P>
 Fargo said the company expects to create joint projects with MCA, but declined 
to provide details. He said he intends to retain control of the company and 
operate as an entrepreneur under MCA's wing. MCA and Interplay Strike a Deal 
</P>
<P>
 MCA is purchasing a minority interest in Interplay Productions, an Orange 
County-based video game publisher. Details on the two companies:

STATE AGENCY DENIED CONTROL OF O.C. FIRM; COURT: BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE REMAINS IN 
CHARGE OF WASHINGTON TRUST DEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state agency lost a round in federal bankruptcy court Thursday when a judge 
refused to give it control again of Washington Trust Deed Service Corp., a 
Newport Beach company accused of defrauding hundreds of elderly investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Corporations in December persuaded a state judge to 
appoint its hand-picked receiver to run the company in order to protect 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 To wrest control from the receiver, Washington's owner filed for Chapter 7 
bankruptcy a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
 The practical impact of the ruling is nil because control of the company 
remains beyond the reach of the owner, Kenneth E. Sarvak, 68. A federal 
bankruptcy trustee is now in charge of the company, which will be closed down 
and its assets sold off to pay debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is a sister company to Lincoln Mortgage & Loan Co. in Newport 
Beach, also owned by Sarvak and also in bankruptcy. Both concerns sold 
investments in second mortgages mostly to senior citizens and sports figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corporations said Thursday that it had not decided whether 
to appeal the ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John J. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The state agency acknowledged that -- either way -- Sarvak has relinquished 
control of the company but said the issue is a matter of principle: Sarvak, it 
maintained, should not be able to thwart state regulators by filing for 
bankruptcy.

FIRED MITSUBISHI EMPLOYEE LOSES AGE BIAS LAWSUIT

 An Orange County Superior Court Jury on Thursday rejected an age 
discrimination lawsuit filed by an employee who said he was fired by Mitsubishi 
Electronics America Inc. because he is older than 40. 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating for four hours, jurors decided there was not enough 
evidence to support allegations by George O'Mary, 58, of Sierra Madre. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Mary accused the Japanese-owned Mitsubishi of singling out older managers 
when the company fired him and 38 other people at its Cypress-based computer 
business in November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Mitsubishi said the firings were simple economics -- losses from 
a computer-selling venture had forced the company to reduce its work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very happy that the jury looked at the facts and did not give a 
knee-jerk verdict in favor of the individual against the corporation," said 
attorney Barclay Edmondson, who represented Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Mary had sought $620,000 in lost wages and compensation for emotional 
distress.

BRIEFCASE: BANKING; MANY BANKS IN O.C., STATE ARE STILL PERFORMING POORLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by James S. Granelli, Times staff writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With only 10 of Orange County's 27 banks posting profits through the first 
nine months last year, the prospects that many more will be profitable for the 
year appear slim. 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, for banks statewide, say banking consultant Gerry Findley and his 
son, Gary Steven Findley, a banking lawyer.The Findleys, who operate the 
Findley Reports and consulting business in Anaheim, expect that 35% of the 
state's 384 banks will post losses for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see glimmers of hope from the performance of several institutions in 
Northern California; however, the performances of several institutions in 
Southern California have been quite sobering," they said in their monthly 
Findley Reports newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 24 banks were acquired by other institutions or seized by 
regulators. Among them were three county institutions that failed -- American 
Commerce National Bank in Anaheim, First American Capital Bank in Laguna Beach 
and Mid City Bank in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Findleys figure that about 20% of the state's banks have serious financial 
and that 24 more will be acquired or closed this year, including several in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 One county bank, CommerceBank in Newport Beach, is precipitously low on 
capital, its final cushion against losses, and is preparing to raise capital in 
a public offering. Pioneer Bank in Fullerton also is looking for new money. At 
least six other county banks are watching the efforts of CommerceBank and 
Pioneer to see if it is worthwhile for them to ask the public to invest.

PACIFIC GULF MAKES INITIAL $121-MILLION STOCK, BOND OFFER 
</P>

<P>
 Pacific Gulf Properties Inc., a Newport Beach real estate investment trust, 
went public Thursday with a $71.2-million initial stock offering and $50 
million worth of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the symbol PAG, the company's stock opened at $18.25 per share on the 
American Stock Exchange and closed unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific REIT is a spinoff of apartments and industrial property owned by 
Santa Anita Realty Enterprises, Inc., a REIT based in Arcadia. The Pacific 
offering is an attempt by Santa Anita to reduce debt and increase value for its 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 A real estate investment trust raises money by selling stock to shareholders 
and then investing in real estate or mortgages. These securities' high rates of 
return have recently attracted investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita said Thursday that it will take a charge of $11 million, or 98 
cents a share, on the sale of its properties to Pacific Gulf. In exchange for 
the properties, Santa Anita will receive 149,900 shares of Pacific Gulf, $44.4 
million in cash, and will clear $44.3 million of debt related to the properties 
off its balance sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Santa Anita stock closed at $18.125 per share Thursday, up only 37.5 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Gulf owns 11 apartment properties located in Southern California, 
Texas and the Pacific Northwest. The REIT also includes six industrial 
properties in Southern California and in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
 While REITs have been popular on Wall Street recently as an option for 
yield-hungry investors, one local analyst questioned whether this newest REIT 
is the best deal available. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of newer REITs that have come public within the last few 
years that have greater capability for creating shareholder value than Pacific 
Gulf or Santa Anita," said Craig Leupold, an analyst with Green St. Advisors, a 
Newport Beach investment adviser.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: ACME HOLDINGS TO TAKE FOURTH-QUARTER CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acme Holdings Inc. of Irvine said it expects to take a charge of $2 million 
for the fourth quarter to cover reorganization costs, including future lease 
commitments and severance and relocation costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a press release, the company said it also expects to report a 
fourth-quarter charge of about $3.5 million for the write-down of underutilized 
assets, adjustments to inventory, additional reserves for uninsured liability 
claims and bad debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Acme said it expects its quarterly results -- before reorganization and other 
charges -- to be "below third-quarter 1993 levels." 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported losses of about $2.2 million for the third quarter and 
$5.13 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30. The nine months included a 
charge of $649,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Acme estimates that total revenue for the fourth quarter and the year ended 
Dec. 31 will be about $16.6 million and $63.5 million, respectively, compared 
to $17.7 million and $68.6 million a year earlier. The company said that 
audited fourth-quarter and year-end results will be released around March 1.

<P>
 The Costa Mesa maker of computer components and software said Thursday that it 
has selected Feb. 25 as the date it will distribute stock in its QLogic Inc. 
unit to existing shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax-free transaction is contingent on shareholder approval at a Feb. 24 
special meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Emulex said shareholders will get one QLogic common share for each Emulex 
common share, pending a proposed one-for-two Emulex reverse stock split. That 
means someone with 100 Emulex shares would have 50 shares after the split and 
would receive 50 shares of QLogic stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Emulex will acquire all fractional shares by paying cash for each half share 
based on the average price of the stock for the 10 previous trading days.

distributes pacemakers. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley also said it has signed a new four-year agreement with Haemonetics 
Corp. of Braintree, Mass., to continue distributing Haemonetics' surgical 
blood-salvage products in the United States. The automated systems are used to 
collect patients' blood before, during and after surgery for re-infusion to the 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter Healthcare Corp. is the main unit of Baxter International Inc. in 
Deerfield, Ill., the world's leading maker of health care products. Bentley 
makes disposable oxygenators, which provide oxygen to the blood while the heart 
and lungs are stopped during open-heart surgery.

BRIEFCASE: BANKING; TOP MORTGAGE SELLERS

 Five Orange County thrifts, led by Plaza Home Mortgage Bank in Santa Ana, were 
on the list of the savings and loan industry's top 10 sellers of home mortgages 
for the third quarter, according to an industry periodical. 
</P>
<P>
 No one disputes that Plaza, an aggressive mortgage banker, would be the 
national leader by selling $2.1 billion in loans to Wall Street and other 
investors during the quarter. But several savings and loans told National 
Mortgage News that they weren't sure they belonged on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-biggest seller of mortgages, for instance, was Independence One 
Bank of California in Laguna Hills with $1.9 billion in loans sold. But 
Independence says its listing is more a function of new reporting techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings and loan lends money to mortgage companies so they can make loans 
to home buyers. The companies then sell the loans. But Independence temporarily 
holds title to the loans after they are made but before they are sold -- making 
it a major reseller of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 American Savings Bank in Irvine thinks the number attributed to it is too high 
because it apparently includes a $1.3-billion swap of loans for securities 
backed by those loans. The thrift isn't sure such transactions are complete 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Newamerica Savings Bank in Irvine, which ranks seventh with $1.1 
billion in loans sold, no longer exists. It was the conduit used by its onetime 
parent company, Franklin Mortgage Corp. in Irvine, to fund loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny thrift was sold in December to California Federal Bank, a Los Angeles 
thrift. Franklin then was sold to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a New York 
investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The other local thrift in the top 10 was Household Bank in Newport Beach, 
headquarters for a seven-state operation. Household was ranked 8th with $1 
billion in loans sold.

STERLING AWARD INTENT FORMS DUE MARCH 8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County companies have less than a month to decide whether they want to 
enter the competition for the second annual Sterling Award, which recognizes 
quality at service and manufacturing firms based in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies wishing to compete must obtain a page-long "intent form" and return 
it by March 8 to Shelley Murphy at KPMG Peat Marwick in Costa Mesa.She can be 
reached at (714) 850-4392. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms seeking the Sterling Award should know that the applications can run as 
long as 35 pages and are "very time-consuming and thorough," said Phil 
Schimmel, chairman of the Sterling Award Council. The application forms won't 
be ready until Monday and must be returned by May 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards program is patterned after the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality 
Award given each year by the U.S. Department of Commerce. More than 900 county 
companies expressed an interest in competing last year, but only about two 
dozen filed applications, a drop-off similar to the Baldrige competition, 
Schimmel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Awards are presented in six categories: large and small manufacturing 
companies, large and small service companies, nonprofit and public-sector 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sterling Award is sponsored by the UC Irvine Graduate School of 
Management, St. Jude Medical Center, the city of Santa Ana and 14 companies, 
including Fluor Corp., Western Digital Corp. and The Times Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Intent forms and applications can be obtained by writing to Murphy at KPMG 
Peat Marwick, 650 Town Center Drive, Suite 1000, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626.

UPROAR FOLLOWS JUROR'S CUDDLING OF BABY GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The issue of life or death in an Oxnard murder case took a back seat this week 
while a judge and lawyers on both sides debated what to do about a juror who 
got too friendly with a cuddly baby. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arose when Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn complained that a 
woman juror had held the defendant's infant niece during a break in the 
emotional murder trial of Christopher James Sattiewhite. 
</P>
<P>
 Sattiewhite is charged with murder, kidnaping and rape in connection with the 
Jan. 26, 1992, slaying of 30-year-old Genoveva Gonzales, the mother of four 
small children. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn asked Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch to admonish jurors and 
Sattiewhite family members not to have contact with each other -- saying later 
that he thought such contact could make jurors less objective about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in criminal trials are routinely instructed not to have any contact 
with witnesses or family members of defendants or victims. But Storch decided 
Tuesday that the incident with the baby did not warrant a formal admonishment, 
according to a transcript of the brief hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to order the family to do anything," the judge said. "And I am 
not going to order the jury to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, said Storch, he would "appeal to everybody's sense of fair play" -- 
urging relatives of Sattiewhite to do their best to avoid any further 
juror-baby contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident Tuesday was the first of two this week involving complaints about 
contact with jurors by relatives of Sattiewhite. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, a bailiff complained that Sattiewhite's brother-in-law, Wayne 
Walker, had discussed the case in the presence of the jury outside the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch responded by telling Walker outside the presence of the jury to "be 
fair-minded" and try not to influence the jury in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, the father of the 2-month-old infant, is one of a handful of 
Sattiewhite relatives who have been regular visitors at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Thursday, Glynn said he witnessed the female juror holding a 
child in the air Tuesday during a break in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said he learned that Sattiewhite's sister is the mother of the child 
that the juror held. 
</P>
<P>
 "I complained to the judge about the relationship with the defendant's 
family," Glynn said. "It makes it difficult for them to be objective." 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Sattiewhite's attorney, Willard P. Wiksell, encouraged Storch not to 
admonish the jury. "I think that would only prejudice (jurors against) Mr. 
Sattiewhite," Wiksell argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch said problems with jurors and family members mingling are hard to avoid 
because the two groups share the same space in the corridors of the Hall of 
Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Other courthouses, he noted, have private rooms to insulate jurors from 
participants in cases during breaks in trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that certainly the court's not going to condone family members 
ingratiating themselves with members of the jury, and I am not about to accuse 
any family member of doing that," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 He encouraged the family members and jurors to "keep to themselves" as much as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he could understand how a juror might have ended up holding the 
infant, but asked the family to make sure that it does not happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also said he understood prosecutor Glynn's argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem that we have from the prosecutor's standpoint (is) that it is 
difficult to get a juror to divorce oneself from a defendant's family when one 
becomes involved with the defendant's family." 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said Thursday that he is hopeful that won't happen in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the jurors are intelligent enough, and their principles are strong 
enough, that they won't let this affect their decision."

EXCHANGE PROGRAM; TIES STRENGTHEN BETWEEN OJAI SCHOOL AND SISTER INSTITUTION IN 
CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year after launching a sister-school relationship with a private boarding 
school in China, the Ojai Valley School is hustling to keep up with the rapid 
changes and events that have accompanied the international partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last eight months, two groups of Chinese students have visited Ojai 
Valley School and another group will arrive this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, an Ojai teacher traveled to Dujiangyan, China, for six weeks to 
observe and advise the sister institution, the Guang Ya Private Primary School. 
</P>
<P>
 And next month, three Chinese educators will visit Ojai Valley School as part 
of a seven-city tour of the United States. The trip, sponsored by the United 
States Information Agency, will focus on elementary and middle school 
education, both public and private. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has gone faster than we normally develop these relationships," said 
Headmaster Michael Hall-Mounsey. "But that's why we felt we needed to send an 
official over there." 
</P>
<P>
 Third-grade teacher Shelley Hermes was selected from the Ojai school's faculty 
for the trip in November. Her role was to serve as a curriculum adviser and 
teacher trainer to Guang Ya. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the People's Republic of China authorized school privatization in 1992, 
hundreds of private schools have cropped up. Many of them are located in 
centrally situated Sichuan province, including the Guang Ya school, said Anne 
Elvin, an officer at the Institute of International Education in Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the rush to privatization, Guang Ya was the first private primary 
school to open its doors since 1949. Its founder and namesake, Qing Guang Ya, 
wanted to model his school after an American private institution. With the help 
of the United States Information Agency, he found Ojai Valley School. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1993, the school was approached by the energetic Chinese 
educator, who said he wanted to develop a relationship between his struggling 
new private school and the 82-year-old Ojai school. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rest hasn't even had time to hit the history books. 
</P>
<P>
 "The changes that are occurring in China are happening very rapidly," said 
Michael Connor, admissions director at Ojai Valley. "You're talking about a 
country with 300 million students and this private education idea is so new. Up 
to this point Chinese education has been centered on political ideology, and 
now it's making a shift toward educating people for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between Ojai Valley and Guang Ya is the first of its kind 
between American and Chinese private schools, Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly we're spending more time on the fax machine, but it's not something 
that's been distracting -- it's been exciting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most exciting aspect came in November, when Hall-Mounsey and Hermes 
traveled to Sichuan province to observe Guang Ya school. "We felt a need from 
the school officials that to gain credibility, they needed to demonstrate a 
sincere exchange and a strong link with an American school," said Hall-Mounsey, 
who visited for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a huge task in front of them," said Hermes, who has taught at Ojai 
Valley School for five years and was a student there. "They would like this 
American-style education, but it's hard when they're so immersed in their own 
culture and language." 
</P>
<P>
 There are 240 students enrolled at Guang Ya, which offers a preschool class 
and 11 elementary classes in grades one through six. Classes meet six days a 
week, from 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. -- a rigorous schedule that American students 
would not be able to handle, Hermes said. "Our kids would go nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Guang Ya isn't cheap: Tuition is approximately $5,000 a year. One reason the 
school is so strict, Hermes said, is that it attempts to transform the wealthy 
students there into well-behaved citizens of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 During her six-week stay at Guang Ya, Hermes worked closely with the students 
and faculty, which includes five American teachers. In addition to helping 
develop the curriculum, she taught an English-language class to a group of six- 
to 12-year-olds, which the 34-year-old teacher described as "one of the most 
difficult things I've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
 One aspect of American education Hermes hopes the school adopts is a focus on 
the individual student. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their educational style is not directed for the individual, it's for the 
group. There's a norm set for the group and the whole group has to achieve at 
that norm," she said. "One of my goals was to have them look at these children 
as individuals . . . to appreciate each child for (his or her) own 
individuality." 
</P>
<P>
 Hermes said she learned an important lesson from the trip, which she intends 
to impress upon her students. "Tolerance. Be tolerant and respect our 
differences and enjoy them."

SUPREMACISTS ARRESTED IN SCHOOL STRIFE; CRIME: THREATS AND VIOLENCE AGAINST 
BLACKS AT VENTURA HIGH LEAD TO FOUR YOUTHS BEING TAKEN INTO CUSTODY, POLICE 
SAY. A CONSULTANT HAS BEEN CONTACTED.

 Threats and violence against several black students and a guard at Ventura 
High School have led to the arrest of four teen-agers described by police as 
white supremacists, and school district administrators have called in a 
consultant to ease racial strife, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests came after two incidents. One, on Jan. 26, involved racial 
taunting of black students and a threat to a black school guard; the other, on 
Feb. 4, involved a fistfight between black and white youths. Both incidents 
occurred at Ventura High basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
 Another fistfight between a black student and a white student near campus is 
still being investigated and could lead to another arrest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Jan. 26 incident, two 16-year-old black students were surrounded by 
half a dozen white youths shouting racial slurs, police said. As faculty 
members and a black security guard stepped in, one of the white suspects 
threatened to retrieve a gun and shoot the guard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested three teen-agers in the incident, none of whom attend Ventura 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Cecil Lassiter, 18, faces a felony charge of threatening a school 
official, with a special allegation that the threat was racially motivated. He 
also faces a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace at a school with 
offensive language, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two 15-year-old males arrested, one was cited and released to his 
parents, while the other is being held in Juvenile Hall for violating his 
probation in another case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lassiter, whom Grant described as a "skinhead, white supremacist type," is 
being held in County Jail in lieu of $5,000 bail. He is scheduled to appear for 
a preliminary hearing Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 4 incident occurred when a white Ventura High student made racial 
comments to a black football player, then started a fistfight, according to 
Ventura Police Sgt. Carl Handy. 
</P>
<P>
 The football player fought back until police broke up the fight. The white 
student was arrested and treated at a hospital for cuts on his face, then 
released to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Both students received a three-day suspension, which ended Wednesday. But the 
football player has not returned to school and has applied for a transfer to 
Buena High. He said he no longer feels safe on the Ventura High campus, where 
only 50 of the 1,750 students are black. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm at the bus stop, catching the bus home, guys will drive by yelling 
all their racial slurs and stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of some of the black students said the incidents are signs of more 
widespread racism on campus -- signs that the district does not seem to 
recognize, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone there would say there is a policy of zero tolerance for racism," said 
the mother of a 16-year-old black student who was involved in the Jan. 26 
incident. "If that were the case, something like this never would have happened 
on school property at a school function. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not uncommon," she said. "That's the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But Joseph Spirito, superintendent of the Ventura Unified School District, 
said Friday he is not convinced that the fistfight was racially motivated or 
that there is a serious problem of racial harassment on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the million-dollar question," he said. "I'm trying to ascertain . . . 
whether or not this is to be viewed as a racial problem or two kids who have 
had an altercation and they happen to be black and white." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura High Principal Jerry Barshay said the incidents should not be seen as 
flowing from the school, but from society as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in our community, in our world, and it spills into a high school 
campus," he said. "It's not manufactured on a campus, it comes into a campus." 
</P>
<P>
 To evaluate racial attitudes and tension at Ventura High, the district has 
contacted Santa Barbara attorney Judy Rubenstein, whom Spirito described as an 
expert in conflict resolution and issues of prejudice. Spirito said he plans to 
meet Tuesday with Rubenstein and possibly with members of the Anti-Defamation 
League's Woodland Hills office. Following that meeting, Rubenstein may meet 
with Ventura High students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Ventura police officials said they plan to maintain a high 
profile on campus and at sporting events over the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But several Ventura High students contacted after school Thursday question 
whether the police, or a consultant, can do much to change attitudes on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Andrea McFadden said she has been surprised at how often she hears 
racist comments from fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought high school was supposed to be better -- with opportunity and 
everything," she said, "but it seems like it's worse."

AGREEMENT THAT REDUCES TEACHERS' PAY IS REACHED; EDUCATION: CONEJO DISTRICT AND 
UNION TENTATIVELY APPROVE A TWO-YEAR CONTRACT THAT WILL RESULT IN A 4% TOTAL 
CUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Conejo Valley school officials and teachers have reached tentative agreement 
on a two-year contract that would reduce teachers' pay by 3% and cut their work 
year by two days. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortened work calendar for teachers will result in a 4% total pay cut, 
officials said. The agreement was reached Wednesday after two days of 
negotiations with a state-appointed mediator. The two sides declared an impasse 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say we're grudgingly accepting a pay cut," said John Uelmen, 
president of the Unified Assn. of Conejo Teachers, which represents the Conejo 
Valley Unified School District's 683 teachers. "Nobody is happy to see their 
paycheck drop." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the pay cut, the tentative contract would have teachers pay more 
for health insurance, raising the annual deductible from $150 per individual to 
$250, officials said. Insurance coverage to dependents would be cut off at age 
19. Currently, the benefits extend until dependents are 25 if they are 
full-time students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very skeptical about us reaching a settlement, but I think the district 
just realized that we had moved a lot," Uelmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen said a mail-in ratification vote will be conducted over the next two 
weeks. Once a majority of union members approve the contract, the school board 
must follow suit, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reaction to the tentative agreement among the union's members has 
generally been supportive, Uelmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll get ratification," Uelmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake High School English teacher Bill Csellak said he will vote for the 
deal, but not because he is happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really unfair and unfortunate that teachers are being asked to 
shoulder what appears to be the brunt of (the district's) fiscal 
mismanagement," Csellak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Csellak said he isn't so sure that teachers will vote for pay cuts, although 
he doesn't believe there are other choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of disgruntlement out there," Csellak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Quick, a 20-year teaching veteran at Weathersfield Elementary School, 
said she also will grudgingly support the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the ones that are responsible for the children's education, yet it 
seems like when push comes to shove, we get shoved," Quick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pay cuts are unfortunate but necessary, said Alice Humbertson, a Thousand 
Oaks parent active in the local Parent-Teacher Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers deserve every penny that they earn, without a doubt, but it's just 
hard times. We're all facing them," Humbertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, beginning teachers make about $24,000 per year while top scale 
after 24 years is $51,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks teachers have been working without a contract since the previous 
three-year agreement expired last June. That contract gave teachers a 20% pay 
raise over three years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tentative pact is approved, school officials will have trimmed the 
budget by $2.6 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this negotiation was critical for us to even be able to operate next 
year," said Assistant Supt. Sarah Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first of the year, the district has also been bargaining with the 
local unit of the California School Employees' Assn., which represents 600 of 
the district's secretaries, custodians, teacher aides and other support staff. 
</P>
<P>
 That contract is still being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Because salaries and benefits make up 85% of the district's budget, school 
officials are looking for classified employees to shoulder their share of the 
budget cuts as well, Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with negotiated cuts, school officials expect they will need to cut 
$300,000 or $400,000 in programs from next year's budget, Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the salary cuts, the teachers got their wish to make union 
membership mandatory.  
</P>
<P>
 The tentative contract agreement would require all teachers to pay the 
association's $500 annual dues for local, state and national representation. 
About 569 of the district's 683 teachers now belong to the union.

ELECTIONS; RIVALS QUESTION MAYOR'S ABILITY TO BE AUDITOR

 Two candidates in the Ventura County auditor-controller's race challenged 
whether Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton had enough accounting experience to 
legally qualify for the job of managing the county's $836-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But County Clerk and Recorder Richard Dean, after receiving advice from the 
county counsel on Thursday, said Stratton's name would be on the ballot in June 
unless someone files a legal challenge over his qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a candidate swears he meets the qualifications of office in his 
declaration of candidacy, then we accept that," Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other elections:  
</P>
<P>
 * Democrat Dorothy Maron, a former Oxnard city councilwoman, and Republican 
Christopher Merriam-Leith have filed nomination papers to challenge Assemblyman 
Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) for his seat in the 37th Assembly District that 
stretches from Thousand Oaks to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura County Superior Court Judge Edwin M. Osborne announced that he will 
not seek a sixth term and may, in fact, step down within the next few weeks. 
Dean said Thursday that he is still researching whether Osborne's successor 
would be elected or appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson. Osborne's decision not to 
run extends the deadline for candidates to file nomination papers to run for 
his seat until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the 38th Assembly District, Democrat Donald Allan Cocquyt, a Simi Valley 
attorney, declared his candidacy against Assemblywoman Paula L. Boland 
(R-Granada Hills) in the race to represent a district that encompasses Simi 
Valley, Fillmore and portions of the western San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the challenge to Stratton's qualifications, Dean said he began looking into 
the matter after questions were raised about Stratton's accounting background 
by his two campaign rivals -- appointed Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon and 
Ventura accountant Scott Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mahon said Thursday he had no plans to pursue the matter further, 
Weiss said he is considering challenging Stratton in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at all my options, and I wouldn't rule that out," said Weiss, a 
certified public accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said he believes he is more than qualified for the job and is 
prepared to stand up to a legal fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess there's some people who don't want to meet me on the playing field," 
he said. "So they're trying to find another way to beat me." 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for the county auditor-controller's position, a candidate must 
either be a certified public accountant; have served as county auditor or 
deputy auditor for at least three years; or possess a certificate or diploma 
from a school of accountancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are no more schools of accountancy in California, Stratton said 
he believed his master's degree in business administration -- including 10 
units in accounting -- from Cal Lutheran University qualifies him for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe what they're looking for is somebody who either is a CPA or someone 
who has the education to be a CPA," he said. "I believe I have the education to 
be a CPA." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton accused Mahon of misleading voters by sending out a campaign letter 
that claims he has "a master's degree in accounting and marketing from New York 
University." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Mahon has a master's degree in business administration with an 
"emphasis on accounting." 
</P>
<P>
 When questioned about the discrepancy, Mahon said he did not realize a mistake 
was made in the letter. "Is it precisely correct, no," Mahon said. "Should it 
be corrected, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said he qualified for the office because he has served as assistant 
deputy auditor-controller for more than 20 years before being appointed to the 
top job last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates for the 18th State Senate District seat being vacated by Santa 
Barbara Democrat Gary Hart and the 35th Assembly District seat now held by 
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell, a Democratic candidate for Hart's Senate post, have 
until Monday to file their nomination papers. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, O'Connell of Carpinteria and Republican Steve Decker, a Santa Barbara 
businessman, are the only declared candidates for Hart's 18th District seat 
that represents Ventura, Santa Paula, Ojai and all of Santa Barbara and San 
Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Brooks Firestone, Democrats Mindy Lorenz and Robert Ream and 
Libertarian candidate Chris Blunt are the four candidates competing to replace 
O'Connell's in the 35th Assembly District, which encompasses Ventura, Santa 
Paula, Ojai and most of Santa Barbara County. All of the candidates who have 
declared so far are from Santa Barbara, except for Lorenz, who is from 
Summerland.

FEDERAL AGENCY WOULD SHIP SEA LIONS TO COUNTY AGAIN; ENVIRONMENT: FISHING 
OFFICIALS HERE DISLIKE THE PLAN, AIMED AT HELPING STEELHEAD TROUT STOCKS IN 
WASHINGTON STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As many as 60 California sea lions that are devouring large numbers of 
steelhead trout off Washington state would be relocated to waters off Ventura 
and Santa Barbara counties under a proposal to be considered next week by the 
California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which has been criticized by local fishing interests, marks the 
second time that the National Marine Fisheries Service has tried to relocate 
sea lions to keep them from eating the already depressed stocks of steelhead at 
their spawning grounds near Ballard Locks, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, after the Fisheries Service relocated six sea lions to local waters, 
five returned to Ballard -- a 1,500-mile journey -- within a month, according 
to James R. Raives, a Coastal Commission analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, as soon as they were released into the water, they headed north 
and high-tailed it back to Washington," Raives said, adding that sea lions in 
Washington all migrated north from California waters in the first place. "They 
apparently know a good meal when they see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Scordino, deputy chief of fisheries management for the Fisheries Service's 
northwest division, said the goal is not necessarily to relocate the sea lions 
permanently, but to provide some relief for the spawning steelhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, what we are doing is buying some time for the steelhead to spawn 
without them being grabbed by the sea lions," Scordino said. "We do not harbor 
any beliefs that the animals we transport down there will stay there." 
</P>
<P>
 Raives said the Coastal Commission staff will recommend that members approve 
the Fisheries Service proposal, but local fishing officials said it is a bad 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The population of sea lions here is already out of control," said Brian 
Jenison, spokesman for the Ventura County Commercial Fishermen's Assn. "It's 
not right that one state's problems are being dumped on another." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenison said the sea mammals often follow sport and commercial fishing vessels 
and effectively shut down their operations, grabbing the catches directly from 
nets and lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the sea lions show up, you have to leave or you'll be wasting your 
time," Jenison said, adding that the sea lions especially enjoy sea bass and 
halibut. "You just hope that they won't follow you." 
</P>
<P>
 Scordino said the Ballard Locks area is the first hurdle of a miles-long 
steelhead migratory path into the Lake Washington watershed off Puget Sound. 
Because the fish are slow to negotiate the locks' fish ladders, they become 
vulnerable to the constantly hungry sea lions. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to protect the steelhead, Fisheries Service biologists have 
installed underwater devices that emit noise designed to repel the sea lions, 
which works to some extent, Scordino said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The animals that we will eventually seek to relocate are those that penetrate 
the acoustical barrier around the locks," Scordino said. "So far, that barrier 
has worked, but we would like to have the relocation option available to us 
should we need it." 
</P>
<P>
 Once captured, the sea lions will be trucked south from Washington to the 
Santa Barbara area in an estimated 22-hour ride, with stops along the way to 
feed and wet down the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Scordino said the mammals will be released into groups of sea lions spotted in 
the Santa Barbara Channel or on one of the Channel Islands. In peak season, the 
channel is home to more than 100,000 sea lions, according to official 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 If any of the newcomers remain in Southern California waters, the Coastal 
Commission's Raives said, it will be the larger, sexually mature specimens. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we noticed in 1989 was that all five of the sea lions that returned to 
Washington were young or sub-adult in classification," Raives said. "The one 
animal that stayed in the area was older and bigger and was able to integrate 
himself with the local populations of female sea lions." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jan Mangus, 44, a Santa Barbara-based sport fishing enthusiast, the 
addition of even a few sea lions means more headaches and less fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I view sea lions the same way a farmer views gophers -- a real pest," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is due to come before the Coastal Commission during its meeting 
at 9 a.m. Thursday in San Diego.

 Oxnard police are looking for two suspects who beat and stabbed a man in front 
of the Lucky's Supermarket on West Hemlock Street in Oxnard, an Oxnard Police 
Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Donovan, 48, of Santa Paula was taken Tuesday night to St. John's 
Regional Medical Center, where he was treated for a stab wound and lacerations, 
a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donovan was walking to his car parked near the supermarket when he was struck 
on the back of the head by one of the men, the police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that while Donovan lay semiconscious on the ground, he 
attempted to ward off the attack and was stabbed in the neck by another man. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects then rifled through Donovan's pockets, stealing his car keys, 
credit cards and $75 in cash, before fleeing on foot, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made and the robbery is under investigation, the 
spokesman said. SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; FAMILY MOVES OVER RADAR TEST CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Operational tests being conducted by the builders of the radar station on 
Sulphur Mountain have prompted a nearby landowner to pack up his family and 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Fuller, whose home is within several hundred feet of the antenna, said 
he has been living in a motor home for nearly a week because he is afraid of 
the low-level radiation emitted from the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to do," he said Thursday. "We're living by the day right 
now. I've got kids. I just can't take that kind of chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The radar tower, which will track storms and wind conditions for the 
government, is scheduled to be turned on before the end of the month, said 
Jerry McDuffie, who runs the Oxnard office of the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 But Unisys, the information services firm that is building 165 of the Doppler 
radar systems across the country, has been testing the Sulphur Mountain tower 
east of Ojai for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make sure it's operational before we sign it over to the weather 
service," said Unisys spokeswoman Pat Schoppmeyer. "It will be several more 
weeks before that radar is turned over to the government." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of residents last week lost a suit filed against the federal 
government after a judge refused to order the government to perform more 
studies on the tower's effects. 
</P>
<P>
 McDuffie said Thursday that he has invited some residents to a demonstration 
next week to prove that the system is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take readings with the radar on and then with the radar off to show 
people that there's no problem up there," McDuffie said. "It's about as 
above-board as we can make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, however, said nothing could convince him that the high-pitched noises 
he hears coming from the tower are safe. "I don't know what they're testing, 
but it sure blows my eardrums," he said. JEFF McDONALD

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANDBAGGING; A GUIDE TO 
PROTECTING YOUR HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last fall's brush fires have left behind burned hillsides that are susceptible 
to flooding, erosion and mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandbags can be used to keep debris from entering a house and to channel it 
around or away from a structure. Many fire stations provide empty sandbags free 
of charge. Using plastic sheets to cover slopes also can control erosion and 
divert flood debris. Filling and Stacking the Bags The most efficient way of 
filling and stacking the sandbags, which are made of burlap or nylon, is shown 
below: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fill halfway: Overfilling makes the bags heavy and difficult to manage. * 
Placement: Place with the flap tied or tucked under and pointed in the 
direction of the water or mud's flow. * Stacking: Place bags on top of each 
other tightly, with each layer staggered. Rows should be no more than three 
layers, unless supported by a building or stacked in a pyramid. Placing Bags to 
Protect Building * Use layers: Layers of bags should be placed against 
building. * Protecting doors: To prevent water and mud from seeping under a 
sliding glass door, a plastic sheet should be placed against glass with 
sandbags or a plywood barrier holding the plastic in place. Directing Debris 
Away From Building * Make a line: Layers of bags should be lind up away from 
house to divert flow of debris. * Keep it in the street: Often curbs cannot 
contain floodwaters. Bags can be lined along the street to help contain the 
flow. Where to Get Sandbags 
</P>
<P>
 City and county fire departments are providing empty sandbags. Residents must 
pick up and fill the bags themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 City Fire Department: L.A. stations are providing a maximum of 25 bags per 
person or family. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Departments: County stations in areas at risk for flooding are 
providing an unlimited number of bags. Where to Get Sand 
</P>
<P>
 Gravel or garden supply stores. If sand isn't readily available, bags can be 
filled with dirt, mud or rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rain falling on hills bare of vegetation creates a flood danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Erect temporary wooden fence to deflect debris from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Board up doors and windows to keep out debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Place layers of sandbags against building. 
</P>
<P>
 Allow large path for flow of debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a permanent brick wall to divert debris from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut slope drain to direct and slow flow of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant slopes near home to absorb water and anchor the soil.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; OFFICIALS SEEK TO END JOB PROGRAM DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard school officials and representatives of a local jobs agency have agreed 
to try to resolve a contract dispute that is threatening a job-training program 
used by about 150 welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 After a presentation Wednesday by the Oxnard-based Job Training Policy Council 
to the Oxnard Union High School District board, school trustees decided to send 
Supt. Bill Studt and Assistant Supt. Robert Brown to meet with officials from 
the jobs agency. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials and council representatives hope to resolve a dispute about 
how the jobs council pays the district for a program designed to get people off 
welfare and into the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Greater Avenues in Independence, the program offers adult welfare 
recipients courses in English as a Second Language, high school equivalency and 
remedial math and reading. The Oxnard adult school has offered these courses 
for about seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The federally funded jobs council pays about $83,000 to the Oxnard district 
each year to run the program. In addition, the district receives county and 
state funding, but those payments are contingent upon the school district first 
having a contract with the jobs council, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials became angry when the jobs council proposed this year to 
change its contract to pay the district only half the $83,000 up front, 
withholding the rest until the yearlong program is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see that we can do business this way," district trustee Jean B. Daily 
said at Wednesday's meeting. "We never have." 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberto De La Selva of the jobs council told the board his agency was only 
trying to protect itself financially. This year marks the first time the 
council became responsible for accounting to the federal government on how the 
GAIN funds are spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Withholding a portion of the funds would give the jobs council time to audit 
how the district spent the first part of that year's payment, De La Selva said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; STUDENTS CAN TRAIN FOR TOURISM INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard High School this fall will become the first Ventura County high school 
to train students for jobs as chefs, hotel desk clerks and other careers in the 
tourism or hospitality industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The yearlong program aims to give students a head start in the competition for 
jobs in restaurants, hotels, travel agencies and related businesses, said Mary 
Hopple, chairwoman of the school's home economics department. 
</P>
<P>
 Open to the school's juniors and seniors, the program will allow students to 
focus on one of four areas: lodging, recreation, travel or hospitality, which 
includes restaurant work. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to taking school courses on topics such as hotel management, the 
students will have field trips to local businesses and will be assigned to 
observe individuals who work in their chosen fields. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the program, each student will serve an internship at a local 
business in the hospitality or tourism industry, Hopple said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the training, Hopple said, would be to teach students how to deal with 
the public. "This is a real people-type of industry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who finish the program would receive a certificate, in addition to 
their regular diploma, declaring that they have achieved certain skills in 
hospitality or tourism, Hopple said. Both the school district and the business 
at which the youth interned would sign the certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopple hopes that the career-oriented program will encourage students to work 
harder at their academic courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think of school as this thing we go to and then we're going to start 
life after school," she said. "Our goal is that if we give kids a focus that 
they're interested in, they're going to see a connection between classwork . . 
. and what they need on their jobs." MAIA DAVIS

 Two former promoters of an Oxnard card club pleaded not guilty Thursday to 
felony charges of grand theft and will stand trial April 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael E. Wooten, 45, of Camarillo and Frank Marasco, 48, of Ventura also 
face a misdemeanor trial on six counts of money laundering in connection with 
political contributions made to the campaigns of four public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were charged in both cases in October. 
</P>
<P>
 In the grand theft case, prosecutors say the defendants -- co-owners of the 
defunct Darrik Marten Co. in Ventura -- submitted a $10,000 construction 
voucher to a consortium of Ventura County investors, then used the money 
personally without telling the lender. 
</P>
<P>
 The misdemeanor money-laundering trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooten and Marasco are charged with illegally reimbursing three former 
employees for contributions to former Oxnard City Councilwoman Dorothy Maron's 
1990 council campaign, Assemblyman Nao Takasugi's 1992 Assembly campaign, 
Councilman Michael Plisky's 1992 mayoral bid and Councilman Thomas Holden's 
council campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the politicians were unaware of the true source of the 
contributions. DWAYNE BRAY

Carlos Aguilera walked out, said Jim Faulconer, the city's director of 
community services. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissidents accused Aguilera of quashing the recall discussion with 
heavy-handed tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall campaign was started after the Jan. 5 election of Aguilera to a 
second term as La Colonia chairman. Some members of the council accused 
Aguilera and his supporters of improper lobbying during the election and 
altering city-issued election flyers. Aguilera denied any role in the tampering 
of the flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Faulconer said the city is unlikely to take action because the 
bylaws governing the 25 active inter-neighborhood councils provide little 
direction on how council elections should be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff "will summarize their observations and try to understand the 
concerns of those who left the meeting," Faulconer said. "But unless there is 
some irregularity proven, the matter will be resolved by the Inter-Neighborhood 
Council Committee itself." The committee addresses issues common to the 25 
neighborhood councils. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Branthoover, the committee chairwoman, said a subcommittee will review 
the group's bylaws and attempt to clarify its election procedures. On Tuesday, 
Aguilera said he will ask to have a Colonia representative on the bylaw 
committee, but Branthoover said La Colonia Neighborhood Council will have a 
chance to comment on the proposed revisions before they are adopted. PATRICK

<P>
 More than 200 east Ventura County residents have qualified for more than 
$60,000 in emergency food stamps since the county began accepting applications 
from quake victims this week, county welfare officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Few cases of attempted fraud have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon Thursday, 226 individuals and families had qualified for the emergency 
stamps to purchase a month's worth of food, with another 69 applications 
pending, said James E. Isom, director of the county Public Social Services 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Social service workers declared just 37 of the 326 applications ineligible to 
receive food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are being accepted at the First Assembly of God Church at 703 
Central Ave. in Fillmore and at the East Valley Courthouse at 3855-F Alamo St. 
in Simi Valley. The centers are open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are also being accepted at the Piru Community Center, 802 Orchard 
Lane, from 4 to 7 p.m. weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday. PATRICK

<P>
 A Municipal Court judge on Thursday ordered a 44-year-old man to stand trial 
on charges that he abducted his former girlfriend outside her Thousand Oaks 
church, handcuffed her and held her at gunpoint for about 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Judge Bruce A. Clark ordered Thomas Robles of Norwalk to appear 
Feb. 18 for an arraignment in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 He is charged with one count of kidnaping and a special allegation that he 
used a firearm during the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 During a preliminary hearing Thursday, Keely Okada testified that Robles 
forced her into his car as she left church near Sandberg Street and Keats 
Avenue on Dec. 17. She said he put a hand over her mouth because she was 
screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Robles' car, the woman said, she was handcuffed to the front seat as 
he drove around Thousand Oaks and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she had broken off a relationship with Robles this past September, 
when they stopped living together after about six months. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; VICTIM GOT ORDER AGAINST HUSBAND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Only days before a Moorpark woman was slain by her husband, she had obtained a 
restraining order to prevent him from selling or securing loans against his 
company's assets, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, June Abe had obtained the restraining order 
against her husband, Carl Abe, 49, on Monday.That day, she also filed for 
divorce on the basis of irreconcilable differences. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day, Carl Abe was notified of the restraining order and of his 
wife's filing for divorce. On Wednesday morning, he fatally shot her before 
killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents show that June Abe claimed that the company that Carl Abe 
operated in Moorpark -- a business providing seminars on buying and selling 
trust deeds -- was community property.  
</P>
<P>
 In the divorce papers, June Abe claimed that her husband was keeping the 
operation of the business a secret from her and that she had no idea how much 
the business was worth.  
</P>
<P>
 She feared that if her husband found out that she was filing for divorce, he 
would sell the company's second trust deeds and hide the profit from her. 
</P>
<P>
 In the court records, June Abe also said that her husband kept their domestic 
expenses a secret from her by paying for all the family's expenses himself and 
giving her a monthly stipend of $700. The stipend stopped six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She also claimed that Carl Abe had prohibited her from going into the 
company's office. June Abe had worked at the company for several years, but she 
quit about six years ago at the birth of the couple's first child. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who were married for nearly 12 years, left three children, ages 6 
years to 18 months. The children are staying with neighbors since the deaths of 
their parents, authorities said. CHRISTINA LIMA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; GADFLY, COUNCIL MEMBERS AT ODDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks gadfly Ekbal Quidwai had no sooner taken the podium this week, 
armed with pages of facts and figures about the Civic Arts Plaza, when 
Councilman Frank Schillo threw out a statistic of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a little research and I found out that Mr. Quidwai has talked before 
the council 71 times this year," Schillo said. "Many times, he's come up four 
times in one night. He's already on his second time tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Quidwai -- who indeed comes to every council meeting and testifies on nearly 
every big issue -- has clearly gotten on the nerves of at least two 
politicians, Schillo and Councilman Alex Fiore. 
</P>
<P>
 Although council members are not supposed to debate public speakers during 
meetings, Fiore frequently challenges Quidwai to prove his statements or 
explain his statistics. And Schillo has recently launched a mini-campaign to 
dissuade Quidwai from taking up so much time at council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is democracy at its worst," Schillo said. "One person is monopolizing 
all our time. He says people are intimidated from coming down here because they 
get criticized all the time. Well, no one else gets criticized except him, and 
I complain about him because I'm getting complaints from other residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Quidwai has been firing back. 
</P>
<P>
 He read the Declaration of Independence during the public comment period of 
last week's council meeting, after Schillo chided him for speaking too often. 
And when Schillo started to question him during his third presentation Tuesday, 
Quidwai responded icily: "I guess it's OK to interrupt those who we don't agree 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 Slowing his speech -- usually extra-rapid so he can cram as many comments as 
possible in a five-minute period -- Quidwai also offered an impassioned defense 
of his motives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plead guilty to enjoying coming to this forum," Quidwai said. "I plead 
guilty to believing that this is the place where one citizen can make the most 
difference. I plead guilty to being passionate about the issues." STEPHANIE

<P>
 After three months of deadlocked negotiations, community college instructors 
and administrators have agreed to return to the bargaining table on March 4, 
district and union officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's very good news," said Allan Jacobs, board of trustees 
president of the Ventura County Community College District."No one wants a 
long, dragged-out disagreement." 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides announced in the early fall that their negotiations were 
officially stalled over the teachers' 1993-94 contracts. In November, they met 
with a state-appointed mediator who declared them too far apart in their 
positions to continue with collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers are asking for a 3% salary raise and a cost-of-living adjustment. 
The district wants to maintain salaries at current levels and ask the teachers 
to contribute to the cost of their health benefits. CONSTANCE SOMMER

O.C. THEATER / JAN HERMAN: 296 PLAYS -- NOT ONE BY A BLACK WRITER; SOUTH COAST 
REPERTORY'S DIRECTORS SAY THEY ARE NOT EXCLUSIONARY. OTHERS ARE SURPRISED AT 
THE RECORD OF THE NATIONALLY PROMINENT HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its entire 29-year history, South Coast Repertory has never produced the 
work of a black American playwright living or dead, famous or obscure, 
avant-garde or middle-of-the-road. Not once in 296 productions. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be the single most astonishing fact about the remarkable success of a 
nationally prominent Southern California theater born in the same year as the 
1964 Civil Rights Act and grown to maturity between the century's worst 
racially sparked urban insurrections -- the Watts riots of 1965 and the Los 
Angeles riots of 1992 -- only a commuter's drive from its doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a little-known, unreported fact. Mention it to anybody in the 
theater world, and it invariably elicits surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stunned," said C. Bernard Jackson, an astute veteran of the Southland's 
black American arts scene. "They would have done better just based on the law 
of averages." (Jackson's Inner City Cultural Center in Los Angeles nurtured 
George C. Wolfe, the black Tony Award-winning writer-director and, to a small 
degree, August Wilson, the black two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist, in 
their early days.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SCR doesn't advertise the total absence of black American dramatists from both 
its Mainstage and Second Stage or from its Collaboration Laboratory, a 
longstanding program to develop new plays by emerging writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Costa Mesa theater, which won a Tony Award in 1988 largely in 
recognition of its commitment to undiscovered writers, has long proclaimed a 
credo of enlightened social engagement and cultural diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly we are not exclusionary," SCR co-founder Martin Benson said 
recently. "We have never said, 'We will not do a play by a black playwright,' 
or anything like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always excited when a play comes from any minority source, because it 
helps open up the theater and keeps it from being the white elitist enclave it 
is often accused of being." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, in the lead article of a recently published SCR magazine to celebrate 
the theater's history, Benson and co-founder David Emmes write that they are 
"ever on the lookout for new ways to redefine the establishment." 
</P>
<P>
 They emphasize their devotion to "ethnic voices and non-traditional visions" 
and say they prize creative work that "more closely reflects the vibrant 
multicultural character of our community and our nation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A separate overview of SCR's programming policy asserts that plays from the 
classic and modern repertoires are "chosen for their ability to illuminate the 
compelling personal and social issues of our time." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview at the theater, moreover, Emmes described an embryonic 
program called Nexus, which is intended to foster a combination of cultural 
diversity and experimental theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are looking for ultimately is getting interconnected," he said. "We 
want to explore the interaction of cultural influences. If we are going to 
succeed as a society, we must overcome this Balkanization of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without each of us giving up our identities we must get to a point where we 
become interculturally related, or we fractionalize ourselves out of existence. 
And we are hoping that artistically there's a way of doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 How, then, do they explain their exclusion of black American writers from SCR 
for three decades? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very good question," Benson said. "I really have no specific answer, 
except to say I read a ton of scripts and with very few exceptions I haven't 
seen any (by black Americans) we wanted to do which weren't either committed 
elsewhere -- I'm referring now to August Wilson's plays -- or dealt out before 
we could get them." 
</P>
<P>
 As for helping to develop new black writers by proffering commissions, public 
readings or in-house workshops -- SCR's usual array of services -- Benson 
added: "I must confess we've never had an agenda to go out and find black 
writers. We haven't put the resources into discovering them the way we have, 
say, with Hispanic writers." 
</P>
<P>
 The theater's commitment to those writers through its Hispanic Playwrights 
Project, an offshoot of the Collaboration Laboratory, has resulted in four SCR 
productions since the project's inception in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 All were world premieres: Arthur Giron's "Charley Bacon & His Family" and Lisa 
Loomer's "Birds," both offered the year HPP began. The others commissioned and 
developed by SCR were: Octavio Solis' "Man of the Flesh" in 1990 and Milcha 
Sanchez-Scott's "El Dorado" in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 Those are the only SCR world premieres by Latino writers, or any writers of 
color, out of a total of 53 since the company was founded. The other 49 were 
premieres of plays by white writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Going all the way back to SCR's beginning, three other Latino plays were 
mounted in revival -- Fernando Arrabal's "An Evening of Arrabal" in 1969, 
Giron's "Becoming Memories" in 1984 and Manuel Puig's "Kiss of the Spider 
Woman" in 1991 -- for a total of seven. 
</P>
<P>
 The scant number of minority productions notwithstanding, SCR's effort to work 
with Latino and Asian writers cannot be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years the theater has awarded commissions to eight Latino 
playwrights. It also commissioned the Chinese American playwright David Henry 
Hwang and the Japanese American playwright Philip Kan Gotanda long before 
either gained success. Both have yet to submit their scripts to SCR. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very large Hispanic community nearby, and we've responded to it," 
Benson noted. "I think we've worked very successfully in that area, whatever 
the number of Hispanic plays that have actually made it onto our stages." 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos constitute 23% of the county's population, and Asians make up 10%, 
according to the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is, with just 39,159 black residents in the county, constituting 
only 2% of the population, does SCR have a similar obligation to present black 
American plays? 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson says yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care how removed South Coast Rep feels from the tides of Los 
Angeles," said Jackson, who co-founded L.A.'s Inner City Cultural Center 28 
years ago. "The 1992 riot just happened. Those currents of dissatisfaction are 
going to continue to affect all aspects of life in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cultural institutions have to help their constituencies come to grips with 
their feelings whether or not they live right where the disturbances happened. 
And South Coast Rep has a special responsibility in a county perceived as a 
narrow enclave of privilege. You'd think they'd want to offset that image." 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Jordan concurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never have anything on the Mainstage pertinent to our community," said 
Jordan, who publishes the Black Orange, a Mission Viejo-based African American 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 She is not mollified by the fact that twice during the late '80s SCR rented 
its Second Stage to the now-disbanded Orange County Black Actors Theatre for 
short-run summer productions of the musical revues "Ain't Misbehavin' " and 
"Eubie!" 
</P>
<P>
 "We know they've had some black performances there," Jordan said. "But that's 
no investment in the community. They will assist without risk. What theater 
wouldn't do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is she comforted that over the years SCR has staged a handful of Mainstage 
productions with black actors in some traditionally white roles or that it 
occasionally draws on the black cultural experience, as it did a few seasons 
back for a Caribbean-style version of Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Woody King, an elder statesman of the African American theater 
world, is not impressed that SCR has mounted several of white South African 
Athol Fugard's anti-apartheid plays or that his latest drama about black-white 
relations, "Playland," is now on the SCR Second Stage, neatly coinciding with 
Black History Month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Fugard is one of the world's great writers," said King, who heads the 
black New Federal Theatre in New York. "They should have given Fugard the Nobel 
Prize years ago. But America embraces him because he's not writing about their 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable that the artistic leadership of a professional theater 
cannot find plays by African American writers. It seems to me they should do at 
least one black play every few years just to keep current.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would be remiss if I said, 'Gosh, I can't find any white plays worth doing, 
or any Jewish plays.' Could I really say that? If I did, there must be 
something warped in my sensibility. Because that does not reflect America." 
</P>
<P>
 King added, "I choose to do one or two white plays every other year, or one or 
two Latino plays. Not that I'm white, Jewish or Latino. A contemporary theater 
simply cannot ignore that kind of art. And the same goes for African American 
art." 
</P>
<P>
 An informal survey of 10 not-for-profit regional theaters comparable to SCR in 
California and around the country tends to support King's assessment. It also 
shows that black American plays constitute well under 10% of each theater's 
total productions. (see box). 
</P>
<P>
 The Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles has done 12 plays by black American 
writers (and six by Latinos) of 166 productions since its founding in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old Globe Theatre in San Diego has produced 12 black American plays, 
including the current musical revue "Blues in the Night" (and 10 Latino plays), 
among 513 productions since 1950. In addition, it has "Jar the Floor" by Cheryl 
L. West opening in March. West is an emerging black writer whose work is 
gaining currency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Shakespeare Festival, headed by Wolfe since 1993, has produced 
more black American plays than any theater company. This season alone it has a 
hit in black writer Eugene Lee's "East Texas Hot Links," which originated in 
Los Angeles at the Met Theatre, and three more black plays opening by the end 
of March. 
</P>
<P>
 But long before Wolfe became its producer, the 40-year-old festival had the 
largest roster of black dramatists in the nation. The late Joseph Papp, the 
festival's Jewish founder, produced more than 50 black American plays by 35 
writers, including everyone from Ed Bullins, Alice Childress and Adrienne 
Kennedy to Charles Gordone, Ntozake Shange and Wolfe. 
</P>
<P>
 While readily conceding the need for minority plays, SCR's Benson nonetheless 
worries about the pressure of politically correct programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately," he said, "we've got to do the work we want to do, the plays we 
think are the best at a given time. It always starts with the art. It can't be 
a quota thing or an agenda thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't put the cart before the horse. We can't say, 'We've got to do a play 
written by a black person. We don't have one that's particularly good, but 
we're going to do it anyway.' That would be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "But . . . I can feel the spurs in my side. I think it's fair to say we 
haven't been aggressive enough in seeking out black playwrights. It's something 
we're going to have to take a look at."

CATEGORY THAT ALMOST WASN'T NARROWS FIELD; OSCARS: THE SHORT-LIVED DEATH KNELL 
FOR SHORT FILMS PROBABLY HELPED SHRINK THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES. ONLY THREE 
DOCUMENTARY NOMINEES WERE SELECTED.

 He may not be as famous as most of the other Academy Award candidates, but 
Steven Cantor's telephone has been ringing madly with calls from agents, 
producers, directors and journalists ever since the nominations were announced 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taylor Hackford woke me up this morning," Cantor, 26, said Thursday, 
referring to the director of "An Officer and a Gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
 Cantor's 30-minute film, "Blood Ties: The Life and Work of Sally Mann," was 
one of three short documentaries nominated in a category that was almost wiped 
out by the academy last year. Earlier this month, the organization's board of 
governors reversed itself, voting unanimously to continue recognizing both 
short documentaries and short live-action (fictional) films. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unusual, though not unprecedented, for only three films to be selected 
out of a possible five in the short-documentary category. This has occurred 
only three other times since 1955 (in 1957, no films were nominated). Five 
films were nominated in the live-action category. 
</P>
<P>
 Freida Lee Mock, who chairs the academy's documentary screening committee, 
said last year's announced death knell for short films probably helped shrink 
the number of entries. This year, only 16 short documentaries were entered, 
while usually there are from 30 to 40 submissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us surmised that a major contributing factor was the confusion caused 
by the controversy," Mock said. Another factor, she pointed out, may have been 
her committee's decision to tighten eligibility requirements. For example, a 
film can still qualify if it has been shown at a festival, but the list of 
approved festivals has been cut back, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Academy spokesman Bob Werden praised the committee for limiting its selections 
rather than trying to bend its standards. "If they had been political they 
could have pushed in five," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For one of the nominees, good news arrived even before the academy selections 
were made. A production company headed by Rosalie Swedlin has been negotiating 
with Disney's Hollywood Pictures to make a feature film based on former USC 
film student Elaine Holliman's "Chicks in White Satin." Holliman's documentary, 
which screened at the recent Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, is 
about two lesbians who decide to formalize their eight-year relationship with a 
commitment ceremony. As part of the deal, Holliman will co-write and direct the 
film, according to a spokeswoman for Swedlin's Longview Entertainment Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Holliman, who left for Germany to show the 20-minute short at the Berlin Film 
Festival, could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The third nominee in the short documentary category is "Defending Our Lives," 
produced by Cambridge Documentary Films, a Massachusetts-based group that has 
been making social-issue films for 17 years but has never before received an 
academy nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, budgeted at $135,000, records the experiences of battered women who 
were convicted of killing their mates despite a claim of self-defense. It was 
made in conjunction with Battered Women Fighting Back, a nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-producer Margaret Lazarus said the nomination will mean much greater 
exposure for her cause. "It means that many more people will see this 
documentary, and hopefully they will get a greater understanding of domestic 
violence and be in a position to stop the cycle," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Cantor, producer of the Sally Mann film, said the project originally began as 
a documentary about censorship. After interviewing Mann, a prominent 
photographer who has been criticized for taking nude pictures of her young 
daughters, he decided instead to concentrate on her. "I grew up in New York, in 
an artistically oriented family, but I had never been so moved by any artist," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a USC film student, Cantor said his film cost $4,000, excluding perhaps 
$30,000 worth of free services provided by a New York editing facility. 
Documentary filmmaker Mark Mori ("Building Bombs") was so impressed with the 
film that he raised $11,000 from a foundation in order to give the film wider 
exposure, Cantor said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he continued to field calls, Cantor expressed delight that the academy 
chose to abandon its original decision to drop short films. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this category does is provide for young and not very well-financed 
filmmakers a chance to have access to a large public and to be seen by the 
industry," Cantor said.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'WITNESS': HOW FAR WILL TV GO?; TELEVISION: THE NBC MOVIE 
ABOUT A PAY-PER-VIEW EXECUTION MUDDLES ITS MESSAGE AND SIDESTEPS THE REAL 
QUESTION: SHOULD THESE ACTS OF PUBLIC POLICY BE TELEVISED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The movie is "Witness to the Execution." It's 1999, when television's 
500-channel universe has arrived, bringing a pay-for-view telecast of a 
killer's date with the electric chair. It sounds as bad as paying for New 
Year's Eve with Howard Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Young is strapped into this largely witless NBC effort as a high-voltage 
TV executive who creates the Ultimate Program. Directed by Tommy Lee Wallace 
from a script by Thomas Baum, "Witness to the Execution" airs at 9 p.m. Sunday 
on Channels 4, 36 and 39, affirming just how far television will go to make a 
movie about just how far television will go. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far enough, it turns out. "Witness to the Execution" fails on its own 
narrow terms by fogging its message and blunting the impact of its final 
electrical current. Nor does it address the broader issue of whether executions 
should be televised so that Americans can witness their public policy in 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 As a careerist said to have "slept her way to the middle," Jessica Traynor 
(Young) is one of those familiar faces from Hollywood's cookie cutter. So let's 
waste no time getting her down to her black lace bra and panties. Much hotter, 
though, is the dilemma she faces as the new programming chief at Tycom 
Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in trouble, Jess," says the firm's predatory CEO (Len Cariou). "Movies 
don't work. Screen's still too small. Sports is dying. The sex boom is over. 
Where the hell are we going? Why would anybody really pay to watch TV? What are 
they really looking for?" 
</P>
<P>
 Heads together now: There's a coup in Cuba. "We can get the guerrillas for 
under a million," says Jessica, sounding like warmed-over Faye Dunaway in 
"Network." Borrrrrring. NASA's Mars landing, maybe? Borrrrrring . What to do? 
Her face as blank as color bars, Jessica cocks her head and waits for the tiny 
light bulbs in her brain to click on. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's skimpy performance is a one-channel universe measured against the 
grisly extravaganza that her character is about to stage. Tycom's "Countdown to 
Justice" will be the big burn, a blockbuster execution headed for 20 million 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 With polls showing most Americans fed up with violent crime and favoring 
capital punishment, "Countdown to Justice" is good business. Tycom will do 
death big, telecasting it live in prime time from someplace called the 
Megadome, preceded by the national anthem. It will be packaged like the Super 
Bowl, with promos, billboards, a pre-show hosted by a priest and a phone poll 
at $1 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally the state gets a cut. After some haggling over rights, the governor 
settles for 30%, with some of the money going to put more cops on the streets. 
Another $5 million will be split between a comatose victim and the young 
daughter of the Death Row inmate whom Jessica picks from videotapes like a news 
director selecting an anchor. The condemned star-to-be is multiple slayer 
Dennis Casterlane (Tim Daly), a seductive manipulator with Ted Bundy charm and 
looks. 
</P>
<P>
 When callous Jessica begins believing in his innocence, everything changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has been watching lately hardly needs to be told by "Witness to the 
Execution" the lengths to which some in television will go to attract and grip 
an audience. The line for acceptable TV behavior continues to move, frequently 
in the wrong direction. For striking evidence of spreading gunk, have a look at 
today's tabloid TV, under whose mantle so-called legitimate media and the usual 
greasers are now merging. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the big deal? Instead of being jarring, this movie merely slams down 
another exclamation point, diverting attention from a more salient matter 
regarding executions: They should be available on free TV to a society that 
endorses them, instead of being abstractions, carried out almost clandestinely 
beyond public view. 
</P>
<P>
 As if they were a source of shame. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the telecast of an execution is barbaric, what does that say about the 
execution? The point was last raised in California two years ago when public 
station KQED-TV in San Francisco was denied permission to tape murderer Robert 
Alton Harris' death in San Quentin's gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 If condemned people give permission, and their crimes and the pain they've 
caused are properly noted, why shouldn't there be execution telecasts? 
</P>
<P>
 Terrible taste, you say? Sure, and gas chambers are good taste? 
</P>
<P>
 Said one media observer who witnessed the Harris execution: "There was a point 
when his face turned kind of red and a vein stood out on his forehead . . . and 
his cheek puffed out." Thus, it's possible that the gruesomeness of televised 
executions would bolster the anti-capital punishment crowd. Or they could go 
the other way, desensitizing viewers to the spectacle. Yet if capital 
punishment is the deterrent its supporters claim, then showing executions 
logically would strengthen that deterrent by putting an even heavier scare into 
potential murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whichever the case, executions deserve air-time. Shown late at night with 
proper advisories, they would render moot such fast-buck scenarios as the one 
depicted in "Witness to the Execution." 
</P>
<P>
 Timidly straddling its own soapbox, this movie is a preacher with no lucid 
message. Ultimately second-guessing her own telecast plans, Jessica belatedly 
has a Deep Thought about Casterlane's scheduled public death: "Is that going to 
keep people from killing or just turn them on?" That thought begets another: 
"We're the problem . . . we're the lunatics." 
</P>
<P>
 Just who she means, executioners or telecasters, is not clear. Nor is a 
comically pretentious and overwrought finale that Young punctuates with a 
screeching fury that itself is almost lethal. Is it aimed at the execution or 
at the execution show? Or at herself for doing this clunker?

LIFE WITHOUT FATHER: THE ZAPPA LEGACY; POP MUSIC: THE LATE MUSICIAN'S SONS' 
FIRST JOINT ALBUM BEARS HIS QUIRKY, COMPLEX MARK -- WITH SOME 'DIFFERENT 
FLAVORS' ADDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Frank Zappa died in December, but he's still all over the place at Joe's 
Garage, a funky rehearsal and recording complex in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 A framed gold record for the 1980 album that gave the building its name hangs 
on a wall near the entrance. The famous '60s poster of the scowling rock 
iconoclast seated on a toilet dominates a small bathroom. Pillows covered in 
Zappa album and tour T-shirts are scattered around the window seat in the 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 And from a closed room toward the rear of the building comes the sound of a 
band playing a hard-riffing, metal-progressive fusion. You wouldn't mistake it 
for the Mothers of Invention, but its quirkiness and its rhythmic and harmonic 
complexity carry the clear mark of Frank Zappa. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-man band is called Z, and it's led by Zappa's two sons, Dweezil and 
Ahmet. They've just released their first joint album, "Shampoohorn" (see review 
on F14), and they're getting ready for a concert tour that includes a show at 
the Palace next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly not ashamed of Frank's influence," says Dweezil, sitting with 
his brother in a small control room packed with recording equipment. "We like 
to put it in wherever possible. (We recorded) 65 songs, including stuff that 
was a lot more heavily influenced in some way, shape or form by my dad, but we 
were trying to put together a record that has different flavors." 
</P>
<P>
 Dweezil, 24, has three of his own albums under his belt, but the arrival of 
Ahmet as flamboyant singer-frontman has allowed the admittedly shy guitarist to 
assume a more comfortable role slightly out of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers, along with their mother, Gail, and sisters Diva and Moon (of 
"Valley Girl" fame), endured Frank's struggle with prostate cancer in upbeat 
and irreverent form -- no surprise for one of rock's most famously 
unconventional nuclear families. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a situation like that, you uncover things that you didn't have 
the opportunity to do before," says Dweezil, who, like Ahmet, has lived all his 
life at the Zappas' Laurel Canyon home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one good thing that an illness or whatever can bring to a family is that 
you end up spending more, quote, quality time, you end up talking about some 
stuff, you get to know each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very natural progression for all of us. There were no really hideous 
moments. You know the outcome, but you go through it in the way that is the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing I can say about Frank is he always had a great sense of humor 
about everything. I don't know that too many people would understand it from 
the same level that we would. It might even scare people, the way that we joke 
about stuff in our house. But for us, it's just part of our makeup. We're 
brutal. We like to make jokes about anything and everything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the Zappa heritage guarantees some attention for the brothers' 
enterprise, it can be a double-edged sword, they've discovered. Now that 
Dweezil has finally escaped some of the image problems that formed when he was 
portrayed as a Hollywood Romeo a few years ago, he finds Frank's legacy being 
used to fence Z in musically. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always accepted who we were and who our father was. It was never a 
problem. . . . Our music is not nor should it be a carbon copy of his music. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are people who think that it's not right for someone who has this 
pedigree last name, that we would do something that could maybe be played on 
the radio. If we don't go the completely bizarre route where people don't 
understand what we're doing, then we've sold out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmet, 19, cuts in, sounding defiant and exasperated. "I liked Bananarama and 
the Thompson Twins when I was younger, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 Says Dweezil, "And I was into like AC/DC, Ozzy, Van Halen, all this stuff. So 
I want to create music like that crossed with Bananarama and the Thompson 
Twins, and people won't let us." 
</P>
<P>
 "But we can't be stopped," says a smiling Ahmet.  
</P>
<P>
 For the Zappa family, Frank's real legacy is more about personal integrity 
than musical direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Dweezil, "Basically we grew up being taught that we're responsible for 
our own actions and that life is something that you should enjoy, and enjoy 
with the people that are close to you. It was a very close-knit thing, and we 
had a very firm grip on true reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank was a very, very intelligent man, full of surprises, had a great sense 
of humor. So to us the best things in life are being able to laugh at anything 
and everything, don't take yourself too seriously, and be nice to people. What 
else is there in life? You got good food, you got music and you got pets. 
That's about it."

THE HOLLYWOOD BUZZ ON OSCAR SNUBS AND SURPRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood was buzzing Thursday over who got the short-shrift and the few 
surprises in this year's Oscar nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 Many studio executives were surprised that "The Fugitive" director Andy Davis, 
in particular, was snubbed and that "Short Cuts" director Robert Altman got the 
nod even though his film received no other honors. 
</P>
<P>
 While "The Fugitive" pulled off seven nominations including best picture, some 
wondered why the list overlooked Harrison Ford as best actor and Writers Guild 
nominees Jeb Stuart and David Twohy for best screenplay adaptation. Other 
writers most noticeably ignored were Amy Tan and Ron Bass for "The Joy Luck 
Club," another favorite with critics that was also nominated by the Writers 
Guild. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some Hollywood insiders were surprised that best actress nominee Stockard 
Channing in "Six Degrees of Separation" managed to bump Michelle Pfeiffer 
(usually an academy favorite) in Martin Scorsese's "Age of Innocence," a film 
notably rejected for the top nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also see the double nods to Emma Thompson and Holly Hunter in the 
best actress and best supporting actress categories as clear indication of the 
dearth of good roles for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the number of strong male roles, the number of meaty women's parts fell 
short by comparison, noted entertainment attorney David Colden and various 
studio heads. "This industry has a vast number of superb actresses like Meryl 
Streep, Glenn Close, Sigourney Weaver, Cher and the list goes on," Colden says. 
"Where were roles for them this year? Where were the roles like 'Norma Rae'?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some in Hollywood were wondering why Jane Campion's "The Piano," a film that 
centers on a woman's love for music, didn't get a nod for best original musical 
score. Bob Werden, spokesman for the academy, explained that the picture's 
score didn't qualify "because the music's been played before." 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers were noting an unusual number of relative newcomers on the 
list: best supporting actress nominee Anna Paquin ("The Piano") and best 
supporting actor contenders Leonardo DiCaprio ("What's Eating Gilbert Grape") 
and Pete Postlethwaite ("In the Name of the Father"). Yet Werden said the list 
of new names is actually shorter than years past, although he didn't have 
specifics on which year held the longest list of relative unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, most said they were thrilled to see what some called the academy's 
"taste factor" rise significantly in the members' selections. Many especially 
noted the best actor nomination to Tom Hanks as not just an issue of being 
"politically correct" but as an acknowledgment of the actor's risk in taking 
the role. Before "Philadelphia" opened, many wondered if mainstream audiences 
would accept Hanks as a lawyer dying of AIDS who challenges the system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of buzz, many Oscar reports erroneously said that Emma Thompson and 
Holly Hunter's nominations for best actress and best supporting actress mark 
the first time two actors have had double nominations in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, way back in Oscar's infancy, five performers and one director 
received double nominations. It was 1930, the only year the academy allowed 
double nominations in the same category. 
</P>
<P>
 George Arliss won separate best actor nominations for "Disraeli" and "The 
Green Goddess." Maurice Chevalier was nominated for "The Love Parade" and "The 
Big Pond." Ronald Colman got his two nominations for "Bulldog Drummond" and 
"Condemned." The best actor award went to Arliss for "Disraeli." 
</P>
<P>
 On the best actress side, Greta Garbo nabbed nominations for "Anna Christie" 
and "Romance." Norma Shearer also received nominations for "The Divorcee" and 
"Their Own Desire." Shearer won for "The Divorcee." 
</P>
<P>
 And Clarence Brown won two best director nominations for "Anna Christie" and 
"Romance." Lewis Milestone won the award for directing that year's best picture 
winner, "All Quiet on the Western Front." 
</P>
<P>
 So to set the record straight: Thompson and Hunter's double-double is the 
first in differ e nt categories.

CHINATOWN BUS BENCHES DISPLAY PUBLIC ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six artist-designed images have been installed on bus stop benches in 
Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the public art project, which is funded by a grant from the 
Cultural Affairs Department, are works by Los Angeles artists Hing Alan Cheung 
and Betty Phoenix Wan. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheung's series, called "Legend -- Artmerica," juxtaposes images of artifacts 
from various cultures as a reminder of Los Angeles' diverse cultural 
background. Wan's "Nature Fleshes" addresses educational themes. 
</P>
<P>
 The images are at Sunset Boulevard near Broadway at the Broadway Chinatown 
crosswalk, and at the Hill Street Chinatown crosswalk. They will be up through 
July.

A HISTORICAL COMPOSITION; BUDDY COLLETTE AND LUTHER HUGHES TEAM UP FOR A TALK 
ON JAZZ'S PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an hour of theme and variation as saxophonist Buddy Collette and 
bassist Luther Hughes teamed to speak on the history of jazz Wednesday at 
Golden West College. Working much like a musical duo, Hughes supplied the riffs 
and Collette the improvisations in front of an audience of 100 as part of the 
college's weeklong "Salute to Jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Collette, a high-school chum of Charles Mingus when both were growing up in 
Los Angeles, is one of the most respected California-based musicians. He was a 
member of drummer Chico Hamilton's groundbreaking chamber-jazz quintet in the 
'50s and has taught such giants as James Newton on flute. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the first black musician to crack Hollywood's restrictive studio scene 
and continues to champion jazz, especially Los Angeles jazz. He recently 
completed two volumes of his remembrances as part of UCLA's Central Avenue 
Sounds Oral History Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes has also championed jazz here in Orange County, booking music at 
different times into a variety of venues, and he has served as a disc jockey on 
jazz radio station KLON-FM. 
</P>
<P>
 As a longtime member of keyboardist Gene Harris' quartet (now appearing 
through Monday at Catalina Bar and Grill in Hollywood), Hughes has played many 
of the country's major clubs and festivals as well as issuing a series of 
contemporary albums under his own name. 
</P>
<P>
 Together the two men offered up a lively, sometimes humorous discussion. 
Hughes queried Collette on a number of personalities and issues. When asked 
about East and West Coast jazz styles, Collette responded with tales of the 
many musicians, including Dolphy, Mingus and saxophonists Dexter Gordon, 
Ornette Coleman and Charles Lloyd, who spent their formative years on this 
coast before establishing careers back east. Collette analyzed what came to be 
known as the West Coast Sound, saying that it was more formal than the be-bop 
movement with an emphasis on composition rather than improvisation, and giving 
credit to its innovators, including Shorty Rogers and Jimmy Giuffre. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out the misconception that the East Coast was the home of hot jazz 
whereas the California sounds were laid back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not forget that people like (saxophonists) Teddy Edwards and Harold 
Land were playing a very hot style on Central Avenue . . . when be-bop was 
being played back in New York," he said. And he outlined the West Coast's 
importance in the formation of be-bop, pointing to Charlie Parker's late-'40s 
stint at Billy Berg's club in Hollywood as a turning point. 
</P>
<P>
 Collette was also revealing as he talked about how innovation sometimes comes 
by accident. Typical was his explanation of how the Hamilton quintet came to 
include a cellist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Fred Katz (now an Orange County resident) would play cello to keep the 
audience entertained between the Hamilton group's sets at the small Long Beach 
club where they were appearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chico would see him playing and say it was time to get back up there," 
Collette said. "But the stage was so small that we had to practically climb 
over him while he was playing . . . and when we got up there, there was no room 
for him to squeeze back to the piano. So he just kept playing the cello with 
the band. . . . People really reacted to it, so we started writing music for 
cello." 
</P>
<P>
 His best stories were about Mingus. It was Collette who urged Mingus to pick 
up the bass when the two were in their early teens. It was Mingus, he 
explained, who came up with the idea of playing on the Los Angeles streetcar 
line as the two would commute to rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Let's jam on the streetcar,' Mingus said, and he unzips his bass and began 
to play. I thought if he can do it so could I, so I did. There we were, two 
young kids playing on the streetcar. People began to request us." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally informative were the two numbers played by Hughes and Collette. For 
the first, joined by Golden West professor of music Gerry Schroeder on piano 
and music instructor Frank Fakinos on drums, Collette called for Duke 
Ellington's "In a Mellotone" -- in the key of A-flat -- and the quartet, 
without rehearsal, conversed in the universal language of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Switching to flute, Collette called next for Kenny Dorham's hard-bop theme 
"Blue Bossa," and responded with a light and lively delivery that turned the 
tune's melody inside out. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West's "Salute to Jazz" concludes today with a student-faculty jam 
session in the school's Student Center at noon, and a 3 p.m. screening in the 
school's Forum II Theatre of Bertrand Tavernier's 1985 film, "Round Midnight," 
which stars Dexter Gordon as an American jazz expatriate (see review on F31).

STILL FIRED BY THE INSPIRATION OF CANNONBALL; JAZZ: 'EVERY TIME I PLAY, IT'S A 
TRIBUTE' TO THE LEGENDARY SAX MAN, SAYS HIS BROTHER, CORNETIST NAT ADDERLEY, 
WHO WILL PERFORM WITH HIS QUINTET AND AN ALL-STAR BAND IN A SPECIAL SALUTE 
SATURDAY IN LONG BEACH.

<P>
 With the exception of Charlie (Bird) Parker, no other alto saxophonist has 
influenced modern jazz as much as the late Julian (Cannonball) Adderley. And 
nobody knows it better than his brother and band mate cornetist Nat Adderley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I play, it's a tribute to Cannonball," the saxophonist's younger 
brother said earlier this week in a late-night call from his home in Lakeland, 
Fla. "I've done an awful lot of shows, including the one last summer with 
(singer) Nancy Wilson at the Hollywood Bowl, dedicated to him. But that's not 
unique. Every night my band plays, we do something from the Cannonball 
songbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Nat Adderley and his quintet, along with an all-star big band, will 
dig deeply into that songbook for a "Salute to Cannonball" at the Carpenter 
Performing Arts Center in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking onto the scene shortly after Parker's death in 1955, Cannonball 
Adderley expanded on Bird's be-bop breakthroughs with his own soulful touches, 
an approach that humanized bop's hard, intellectual side. 
</P>
<P>
 On the heels of Parker's quantum leap, Cannonball made jazz friendly to the 
general public again while capitalizing, not diluting, on his predecessor's 
artistic triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 After doing time in the service, the Adderley brothers formed a quintet in 
1956, but troubles with the tax man sent Cannonball out looking for work. He 
landed in Miles Davis' band, where he replaced Sonny Rollins. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next three years, he stood shoulder to shoulder with Davis and tenor 
giant John Coltrane, contrasting the trumpeter's spare lyricism and Coltrane's 
deep intensity with rhythmically savvy lines steeped in the blues and gospel 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 After parting company with Davis in 1959, Adderley enlisted his cornetist 
brother for his own quintet. The two worked together until Cannonball's death 
in 1975. Such musicians as drummers Louis Hayes and Jimmy Cobb, pianists Joe 
Zawinul, Victor Feldman and George Duke and bassist Walter Booker passed 
through the band. 
</P>
<P>
 When Adderley added a second saxophonist to the lineup, he employed such 
heavyweights as Yusef Lateef and Charles Lloyd. The group's impact on the 
course of jazz in the '60s and early '70s is still being felt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But no other single musician was as influenced by Cannonball as was his 
brother. Nat recalled how his brother's initial instrument was passed on to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Cannon who got the trumpet first. My father, who was a cornet player, 
bought him one when Cannon was 7, and he stuck by it. He was very good with it, 
but he had built-in problems. He had little endurance for the instrument, and 
his tooth formation wasn't really suitable for becoming a brass player. And 
still he could play very well." 
</P>
<P>
 "We put together this first little band, the Royal Swingers, when we were in 
high school, and I was the singer. We'd play after football games and such. And 
finally Cannon switched to the alto saxophone. But he didn't want Pop to be 
upset because no one was playing the instrument he had bought, so he started 
teaching me the trumpet. And eventually I started playing trumpet with the 
band." 
</P>
<P>
 So how did Nat Adderley come to the cornet? 
</P>
<P>
 "One time I put the trumpet down in the high-school auditorium, and it was 
stolen. So I went to the music teacher to look for another, because I had a gig 
to make, but they were all checked out. But they had a cornet. Later while I 
was playing, I realized I had stumbled on to my instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 Adderley said he and his brother got along well while growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have that sibling-rivalry thing. For one, we didn't play the same 
instrument. And he was so much better playing than me and everyone else that 
there couldn't be a rivalry. I was just happy to play with him." 
</P>
<P>
 After Cannonball died, Nat went through a short period of inactivity. "His 
death affected me more than I thought. I just couldn't play with other 
saxophonists. Nobody sounded like him. It took me some time to get to the point 
where I could hear the value in other players." 
</P>
<P>
 The first of those other players was Philadelphia native Sonny Fortune, whose 
Coltrane-influenced sound on alto had fired pianist McCoy Tyner's distinguished 
early-'70s combos that included trumpeter Woody Shaw. Adderley was inspired to 
lead his own band. "A player like Sonny Fortune will get you straight for 
sure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Adderley quintet plays for Saturday's salute to Cannonball, the band 
will be a deliberate blend of veterans and younger players, according to 
Adderley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On sax will be rising star Vincent Herring, who has earned critical accolades 
for his recent albums on the MusicMasters and Landmark labels. Those albums 
featured such young-generation stars as trumpeter Wallace Roney and pianist 
Mulgrew Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vincent came up once when Sonny was in the band and said, 'I love Cannonball 
and I know all the tunes.' And I said, 'Yeah, sure, kid.' And he kept coming 
in, and so a couple of nights later we let him sit in. Once he played, I knew 
what he was talking about. He's been in the band ever since, playing with us 
while Sonny was still in the band. The critics called it the muscular front 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 But the group also includes two longtime Cannonball Adderley associates: 
drummer Cobb, who was in the Davis band with the saxophonist, and bassist 
Booker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cannon was influential in getting Jimmy to join Miles -- he had played with 
us before joining (the Davis band). And he played with Cannonball's band for 
many years. What he saw in Jimmy was the same thing that I see in him now: He's 
a master." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nat Adderley quintet will be joined by the big band for the premiere 
performance of trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater's piece dedicated to Cannonball. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the luminaries in that band will be saxophonists Antonio Hart, Jeff 
Clayton and Rickey Woodard; trumpeters Brigewater and Oscar Brashear, and 
trombonists Garnett Brown, Buster Cooper and Thurman Green. At the time of this 
interview, Adderley had yet to see Bridgewater's composition (it was scheduled 
to be rehearsed in Los Angeles), but he was undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be real jazz," he predicted. "Jazz is supposed to be 
unpredictable, and I know this will be the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Salute to Cannonball" with the Nat Adderley Quintet and all-star big band 
is Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Carpenter Performing Arts Center, Cal State Long 
Beach, 6200 Atherton St., Long Beach. $20-$25. (310) 985-7000.

NORTHWEST, KLM TO UNVEIL NEW COMBINED BUSINESS CLASS; AIRLINES: THE PLAN IS A 
BID TO ATTRACT HIGH-FARE PASSENGERS. IT WILL ENSURE THAT TRAVELERS ON ROUTES 
LINKED BY BOTH CARRIERS WILL HAVE STANDARDIZED SERVICE. 
</P>

<P>
 Northwest Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines will launch a new, shared 
business class service next week in a bid to lure high-fare passengers amid an 
industry price war, industry sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest, the nation's fourth largest airline, declined comment but said the 
carriers plan to announce "a significant expansion of our global alliance" at a 
news conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 KLM could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined business class service will ensure that passengers traveling on 
routes linked by Northwest and KLM will receive the same level of service on 
both flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Both carriers currently have business class service, in addition to coach and 
first class, but the move would standardize the services. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources were not familiar with all details of the new service, but 
said it is likely to include substantial amenities to lure high fare business 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The carriers first formed an alliance in 1989 after KLM made an equity 
investment in Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch flag carrier now owns a 49 percent equity stake in Northwest, 
including 20 percent of its common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership has since expanded into shared operations, revenues and costs 
on most trans-Atlantic flights. 
</P>
<P>
 The carriers also share frequent flier programs and flight codes, which 
automatically place passengers from one carrier on connecting flights with the 
other airline. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Northwest and KLM, in their first coordinated fare action, cut 
overseas ticket prices by 30 percent 
</P>
<P>
 Minneapolis-based Northwest is on the road to recovery following a major 
restructuring in 1993 that prevented it from filing for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest this week reported profits of $10.5 million in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Its poor results a year ago forced KLM to take a $157 million writedown for 
its stake in the airline. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest plans to go public in the first quarter with an initial public 
offering that is expected to raise about $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 It also intends to issue up to $400 million of senior notes to pay off debt 
and for general corporate purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 KLM last week reported a surprising third quarter profit of $7.7 million, 
after a $225 million loss a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It also unveiled plans to issue some $500 million worth of new shares to 
bolster its balance sheet.

HOT PROPS / THE WORD ON WHAT'S HIP AND WHAT'S HYPE: THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS!

 Candy and flowers are sweet but so, uh, traditional. Try an unexpected source 
like the Warner Bros. Studio stores in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, and, as 
of today's grand opening, in the Brea Mall. "There are gifts that are 
sentimental, with a sense of humor for all ages," notes spokeswoman Liz 
Gardner. And many have a romantic slant: Check out silver-plated pins ($10) or 
a box containing a "fat-free" T-shirt ($20), both featuring Looney Tunes 
couples. More Than Friends 
</P>
<P>
 Leave it to Tiffany & Co. to remember that one of the most significant aspects 
of a relationship between two people is being friends. Hence the legendary 
jeweler's recent Friendship Collection of bangles and rings in white, yellow or 
pink gold adorned by a tiny heart of diamond, amethyst or tourmaline ($375 to 
$2,600). "It connotes all kinds of things -- messages of endearment, courtship 
or a promise of something more," says spokeswoman Jo Ellen Qualls. She adds 
that the line has been well-received by the company's younger clients. Love on 
the Inside 
</P>
<P>
 Undergarments are among the most popular gifts at Valentine's Day -- but don't 
assume it's sexy lingerie. Joe Boxer, famous for its novelty print boxer shorts 
and pajamas, counts this time as one of its busiest of the year. "If you're 
going to say it," says spokeswoman Denise Slattery, "we suggest saying it with 
underwear." Skivvies covered with red hearts or ruby lips ($14) have become a 
classic for the San Francisco-based label. Gals who don't care to wear his 
things can turn to the Joe Boxer Girlfriend! line for Cupid jammies ($34) or 
the "love me, love me not" sleep T-shirt ($18). Personal Touches 
</P>
<P>
 Chocolate mint. Raspberry. Vanilla. These scrumptious flavors don't come in a 
box for your honey but, rather, in a collector glass bottle ($12.50) that the 
two of you can indulge in with a mutual rubdown. Moonrose in San Juan 
Capistrano carries a full range of Kama Sutra oils that owner Sue Toler says 
are "popular for sensual massages." There are also weekender kits filled with 
samples of flavored oils, cornstarch powders, creams and soaps for $18; the big 
gift drum is $60. The store also sells the Aura Casia line of essential oils 
that can be specially blended with massage oil to fit personal tastes for under 
$20. ROSE APODACA

KISS & MAKEUP; IF YOU DON'T HAVE LUSCIOUS LIPS, DON'T POUT. THERE'S STILL TIME 
TO BRUSH UP ON YOUR COLORING TECHNIQUE BEFORE VALENTINE'S DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Having great lips is an art. The perfectly painted mouth takes an artist's eye 
for color, a sculptor's steady hand and a painter's skill with a brush. The 
rest is done with chemistry -- the chemistry between two people. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those born with full, sensuous lips must learn how to wield a lipstick 
like a pro. The always-tardy Marilyn Monroe reportedly spent forever painting 
up her famous mouth. Conversely, when makeup artists want to turn a beauty such 
as Michelle Pfeiffer into a dowdy waitress, bright lipstick is the first to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorgeous lips make the face. Red lips attract valentines. Jan Thielbar, a 
makeup artist and owner of Make-Up Creations in Irvine, knows the importance of 
a great pair of smackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a make-over last night on a woman, and the lips really made the 
difference," Thielbar says. "They looked so luscious. They brought out her eyes 
and facial features. Without her lipstick, it would not have been a total 
look." 
</P>
<P>
 A sensuous mouth begins with the right lip color. There's only one way to tell 
if a lipstick shade is right for you: Try the stuff on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at the tube isn't giving you the true color," Thielbar says. Seeing 
it on a friend won't help, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's lip color is different, and when (lipstick) goes on it looks 
different on each person," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lip color should match your skin tone. Skin that has a faint bluish undertone 
looks best with blue-based lip colors such as pink, fuchsia and plum, Thielbar 
says. If skin has a warm, orange undertone, choose lipstick shades in the 
orange family such as peach and brown. The intensity of the shade depends on 
how light or dark the skin tone is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lip color should be a little darker than your skin," Thielbar says. "If it's 
too light you look washed out." 
</P>
<P>
 Red lipsticks are hot for Valentine's Day, but not all reds are equal. Often 
they have a slight blue or orange cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me years to find a true red," says a triumphant Thielbar. She 
recently added her perfect red to her Make-Up Creations lipstick line ($8). 
</P>
<P>
 "Bright reds will always be popular on Valentine's Day," says Nikki Gersten, 
spokeswoman for Clinique in New York City. Yet not all women look their best in 
ruby-red lipstick. Clinique's best-seller is a deep pink frosted shade called 
Raspberry Glace ($9.50) at department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone seems to think they look good in it," Gersten says. "It spans every 
skin color, every age, every geographic area. People like it because it's not 
too bubble gummy, and it's not too deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Deep matte lipsticks that have no shine are still popular, but lighter sheers 
in neutral colors are making their way from fashion runways to cosmetic 
counters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's swinging back to a younger, youthful look. The lipsticks are pale, but 
with shine and a hint of pink," Gersten says. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural tones such as warm plum, rose and taupe are strong for lips, says 
Robin Silber, cosmetic treatment buyer for Nordstrom in Brea Mall, 
MainPlace/Santa Ana and South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-selling lipsticks at most cosmetic companies fall into the rose-taupe 
family. The top shades at M.A.C., a makeup line exclusive to Nordstrom, are 
Retro, a taupe color, and Twiggy, a muted mauve ($12). Runaway Rose and a taupe 
shade called Soft Mink are the hot sellers at the Chanel counter ($19), while 
Lancome's No. 1 lipstick is a brownish rose shade called Crushed Rose ($15). 
</P>
<P>
 Bright orange and red tones "are real spotty," Silber says. "They're more 
seasonal."  
</P>
<P>
 Brights and frosted lipsticks have also lost their luster at Revlon. They've 
been replaced by neutral shades and deep vegetable hues such as berry and plum. 
A rusty brown color called Toast of New York ($6.50) is Revlon's No. 1 shade, 
according to Tanya Landor, vice president of marketing.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a movement from being made up to (having) a natural look," Landor 
says. "A red, pink or orange lipstick is definitely makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 Before applying the color, lips have to be prepped. Most makeup artists 
recommend starting with a lip conditioner (a tip dry-lipped men should follow, 
too). 
</P>
<P>
 "Lips need conditioning just like hair," says Richard Stevens, makeup artist 
and co-owner of Stevens & Cross Cosmetic Studio in Newport Beach. He recommends 
applying a lip moisturizing stick fortified with Vitamin E before bed and at 
least five minutes before applying one's makeup, then removing the moisturizer 
with a tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lips that are dry never hold color," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 To help lipstick stay in place, many makeup artists apply foundation and 
powder over the mouth as well as the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation keeps the lipstick from running and makes the color last longer, 
Thielbar says. Powder also helps seal the color when lipstick tends to seep 
into the fine lines around the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Applying lipstick is a skill that even practiced makeup artists can have 
trouble mastering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do the bow-and-arrow lip," Stevens says. "People think it's the Lucille 
Ball lip, but it's really not." Lips should be well sculpted but not 
exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know those two little lines that come out of the nose? Those are where 
you turn the corners of the bow. You don't make the turn until that imaginary 
line touches the lip." 
</P>
<P>
 The corners of the mouth "always stay tight." The bottom and top lips should 
line up at the corners perfectly, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try to make the shape as pretty as you can," Stevens says. "If you're 
doing a sheer lipstick, make sure your lip liner isn't showing. Nothing looks 
worse than seeing the lip liner." 
</P>
<P>
 While big, bee-stung lips sent women hurrying to dermatologists for collagen 
injections just a few years ago, the emphasis has shifted to more natural lips. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lip shape is more based on your own lip, your face and not what you see 
on (model) Linda Evangelista," Gersten says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, those who want their lips to look more voluptuous can trace their lip 
liner around the outer edge of the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Lips "are not overdone or underdone," Silber says. Looking like "a different 
woman after a make-over isn't popular at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorgeous lips make the face. Red lips attract valentines.

OPERA, CIGARS, CANDOR -- WE ALL NEED A FRIEND LIKE FRANCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RIP RENSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I stopped smoking cigars 14 years ago. I love them, but my lungs don't. Still, 
I occasionally light one up. The occasion being whenever my friend Franco 
offers one. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco is no Wolfgang Puck. You won't find him hobnobbing with celebrities or 
guesting on "Live With Regis & Kathie Lee," prattling on about some mutant, 
esoteric cuisine, like seared lion-fish pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 Most nights you'll find Franco upfront in his namesake Gianfranco Ristorante 
Italiano in West Los Angeles, seated in his own private alcove. He reads the 
paper, sips wine, has a little dinner and steps outside every now and then to 
light up a short, hard, dry-cured Italian cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a bear of a man, this middle-aged immigrant from Oria, Italy, with silver 
hair, heavy glasses and a storm front of black eyebrows. Once, many years ago, 
he was an expert mason doing marble work on Italian churches for the St. 
Vincent de Paul Society. He's a great lover of many kinds of music; opera plays 
perpetually in his restaurant. His favorite tenors, for very different reasons, 
include Giuseppe di Stefano and Mario Lanza. 
</P>
<P>
 He gives dinner to a guy who has lived on the sidewalk for 12 years. He likes 
conversation -- and candor. He won't like this article, because he's too modest 
to suffer anyone writing about him. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt at home the first time I went to Gianfranco, back around 1983, long 
before I ever met its proprietor. I don't think it was just because the music 
playing was Puccini's "La Boheme," an opera whose every note, to my simple 
ears, aches with comprehension of life's fragility and poignancy. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think it was the wine. I don't think it was the Italian side of my 
ancestry coming to life. I don't think it was that even with only a few 
customers, Gianfranco seems bright and full of life. I don't know what it was, 
but I felt at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, at the end of a spectacularly unpleasant day, I went to 
Gianfranco and invited myself "home" to Franco's alcove. When I left four hours 
later -- full of good cheese, olives, bread, Chianti and dragging on one of 
those hard Italian cigars -- I had partly restored the illusion that life isn't 
such a raw deal after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to a guy like Franco can do that to you. He's accumulated a lot of 
years and experience, yet he hasn't been beaten down. Overused, flaccid terms 
like compassionate and optimistic seem alive and relevant when applied to 
Franco. I find this confounding -- and heartening. 
</P>
<P>
 We covered the gamut of usual conversational fare that night, except that, 
like all good conversation, it didn't seem so usual. We discussed the lost 
souls in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 12 years," said Franco through his thick accent, "this man has lived 
right outside the restaurant. He's not just homeless. He's mentally, uh . . . 
problem. He needs help. He doesn't beg. He doesn't ask people for money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I have a pair of shoes upstairs. He doesn't want it. And his shoes are 
all gone! Sometimes I ask him if he wants food, and he doesn't want it. Like 
last night, I say, 'Hey Tim, you want some food?' Not today. Other nights, he 
takes something. But he needs medicine. Maybe with medicine, he could 
recuperate." 
</P>
<P>
 I drained my wine glass. Franco refilled it instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, there was an old man," he continued. "He collects bottles. I've 
seen him here for many years. I know him, we give him bottles. He lives on the 
street, and he's old -- maybe in his 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then one day, he didn't come anymore. I just found out from someone, remember 
when it was cold a few weeks ago? He tried to get warm by sleeping inside a car 
wash. But he died. The wind took him." 
</P>
<P>
 Franco shook his head, and I thought his eyes looked teary. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," he said, a darkness in his tone, "when I get up in the morning and 
look into the mirror to shave, I tell myself, 'You own nothing.' I remind 
myself. We all own nothing. We are here for a short time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We went on talking -- about the roots of problems like homelessness: the 
breakdown of the family; the mesmerizing, soul-sapping influence of television; 
floundering public schools; annihilation of individual judgment by 
marketing/demographic study-dictated decision-making; governments choked by 
partisan, game-playing, lifer politicians; runaway technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," Franco said, "Technology has a lot of brain, but no eyes. . . . 
And now, there are so many hands, but they're not doing anything because 
technology does it for them. And maybe they turn bad, or do crime." 
</P>
<P>
 We talked about how his hands came to the United States to shape marble and 
stone for churches and synagogues in the early '60s, how he came to Los Angeles 
to see Disneyland but made so many friends that he decided to stay. How he 
raised his family here. How his restaurant was to be a marble studio until a 
wise friend pointed out that good pasta would likely sell better than marble. 
We embarked on tangents; genetic engineering took up a good 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows what's going to happen with the manipulation of genes?" Franco 
said, pushing pepper cheese at me. "That's another world we're going to enter 
-- it's very scary. . . . Because I come from the Old World, and to see 
manipulation of genes, I don't know if I'm going to accept everything.  
</P>
<P>
 "To me, the world is nice the way it is. I like to see fat people, I like to 
see skinny people, I like to see midgets. That's where beauty is. Everything's 
beauty. What if you never see another rotten tomato? Will tomato still be as 
beautiful? See what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 I said that I did, and told him of a man I know who was born with spastic 
cerebral palsy. He learned to paint as a child in Korea -- very well -- with 
his teeth, until they became too crooked to hold a brush. Then he moved to the 
United States, learned English, and graduated at the top of his class from UC 
Berkeley in engineering. He's now in a doctorate program. They made a movie 
about him in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "So maybe if I'm not going to be that cute, I will not be born, maybe," Franco 
said. "This boy with disability has a great gift." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Di Stefano sang that cascading, embittered laugh in "Vesti La Glubba" from "Il 
Pagliacci" on the sound system. Franco remarked about how the United States has 
the "best government system" in the world, how the American spirit is strong 
but seems "scattered -- somebody has to bring it together." And how problems in 
inner cities can be solved: 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a little boy, after school, one friend would go to the tailor for 
a few hours, and another to the mechanic," he said, smiling. "Six, 7 years old! 
Sweep the floor, whatever. Apprentice! I think it was fun! So some of the kids, 
by 12 or 13, they already know a trade. Some, they went off to become a writer 
or doctor or thing like that. Some just become a tailor. . . . As soon as the 
mind start learning." 
</P>
<P>
 We were just denouncing government for not pulling out the stops to start 
apprenticeship programs, and mandatory service akin to the Civilian 
Conservation Corps of the 1930s, when a homeless guy in tattered Army surplus 
stuff walked in and asked for a soda. His voice was the kind of permanent rasp 
cultivated by chronic exposure to the elements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, my friend," Franco answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't pay you now," the guy said. Franco answered: "Later." 
</P>
<P>
 The guy laughed. "Later. Later. Always later," he said. "You're the best." And 
he went on his way. 
</P>
<P>
 As I did, a few minutes later. Owning nothing, but puffing on a pretty good 
Italian cigar.

LEG MEN; WHY THE LOVE AFFAIR WITH SHORTS? REBELLION? SIMPLICITY? NAH. A GUY'S 
GOTTA DO WHAT A GUY'S GOTTA DO -- LET HIS GAMS BREATHE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shorts are not complicated. They require no ironing. They complement nearly 
every T-shirt in a man's wardrobe. And some styles feature a ventilated liner, 
which eliminates the bother of underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 What more could a guy want? 
</P>
<P>
 "Functionally comfortable" is how Malcolm Wilson puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano Beach artist counts himself among a common breed: men who love 
to wear shorts. Five, six days a week in summer or winter. Bermudas, hiking 
shorts, jams. Wilson prefers baggy flannels. 
</P>
<P>
 Such men crave sartorial brevity after work, on weekends and on Friday nights 
when their significant others wish they would dress up for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 The simplicity of the garment no doubt appeals to male sensibilities. When it 
comes to men and fashion, the fewer buttons, the better. But a more powerful 
force must fuel what, for some, amounts to dependency. A subconscious 
insistence, a primal machismo perhaps, tints Wilson's voice when he speaks for 
all shorts lovers: 
</P>
<P>
 "I just gotta let my legs breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 This sentiment rings familiar, typically male and typically Californian, an 
archetype that wraps every Beach Boys album and most Frankie Avalon films into 
a tidy, sun-drenched package. Think about it. The only time you saw Malibu Ken 
wear long pants was when he had to take Barbie to the prom. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in the depths of the Golden State, in the bluster of winter's 60-degree 
afternoons, Harley riders cruise Hollywood Boulevard in denim cutoffs. Sure, 
they might be cold. But they will not admit it. Meanwhile, the young guys at 
Culver City Ice Arena skate circles in their jams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see them every day," says the manager, who assures us that skating 
bare-kneed is no problem "unless you fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly there are other risks. The risk of exposing knock-knees, scrawny 
calves and lumpy ankles. Some dare to uncover wide expanses of pale skin. Not 
that there is anything wrong with pale skin. Some of my best friends are pale. 
It's just not the physical attribute they should be accentuating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I shop for a pair of shorts, I end up in line behind some geek who 
shouldn't be wearing shorts at all," says Keith Heerdt of Canyon Country. "I'll 
ask myself, 'Should I be wearing them?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, he says, the answer is a brazen "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1959 tome "The Importance of Wearing Clothes," Lawrence Langner 
suggests that people use clothes to convey a message about who they are or 
would like to be. Even the guy in the velour pullover and Sansabelt slacks 
will, at some point, look in the mirror and say: "Oh, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although cultural restrictions have loosened since olden days when bare shins 
were considered inappropriate, wearing shorts still conveys a hint of 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, for one, revels in his opportunity to wear shorts while working. 
Self-employed, he considers himself a fortunate misfit in a world where most 
white-collar workers must don a coat and tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got long hair and an earring," he boasts. "So I may fit into that rebel 
category." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is such impetuousness, the need to strike out against convention, 
that incites men to wear shorts on rainy days or in other inappropriate 
instances. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a warm summer day and you look nice and you're not wearing knee socks 
and dress shoes, then shorts are OK," says Maxine Moshay, a Los Angeles writer 
who harbors strong opinions about the public display of gams. "Wear them to a 
Sunset Boulevard cafe on a Saturday afternoon, but don't wear them to a nice 
restaurant. And don't wear them to the Music Center. I mean, there are a couple 
of men who wear shorts to my church." 
</P>
<P>
 This propensity goes against the very grain of evolution. Clothing served to 
separate early humans from the animal world, Langner writes. It offered certain 
illusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this he was helped by the invention of clothes which covered his body, 
kept his higher centers plainly visible, but covered the lower centers which 
emphasized his kinship with the animal world," he writes. "He no longer felt 
akin to this animal world, but to the world of gods and spirits." 
</P>
<P>
 Who, Langner concludes, wears more clothes than clergymen? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is where primal urges come into play. The author notes that Levant rock 
paintings, dating from about 10,000 BC, provided an early glimpse of men 
wearing shorts. They were virile men, great hunters wielding spears. Does a 
blip in our genetic memory draw us back? 
</P>
<P>
 The mere suggestion evokes Robert Bly and his mytho-poetic beckoning for 
modern "soft men" to discover their "hairy wild man" side. Or the infamous 
Bohemian Club, a San Francisco men's group that counts ex-Presidents and 
self-made millionaires among its members. Each summer, this august body 
retreats to a redwood grove in Northern California to gallivant half-naked and 
urinate on trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a gentleman's club," an official once explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, such gentility will result 
in an enthusiastic invitation to 72 hours of psychiatric observation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, by wearing shorts and refraining from public relief, the legally 
acceptable man may be indulging a deep-felt, if unacknowledged, desire to bare 
his thighs, to let shin hairs bristle in the breeze, to avoid chaffing. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not dismiss this as mere whimsy. The unassuming shorts may, in fact, serve 
as a battleground in the clash between fundamental male psychology and 
contemporary social mores. They may represent a subconscious attempt to regain 
the manhood that was lost when men became dependent on gas-driven automobiles 
and TV dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorts may be the last connection to man's true nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just put them on," says Kyle Matthews, a Calabasas teen-ager. He shrugs 
at the suggestion of any deeper significance to the pair of dark baggies he 
sports. "They're easier than pants."

FASHION; TRADITION ON PARADE; TET FESTIVAL GIVES VIVID EXAMPLES OF ENDURING 
ATTIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who attended the Vietnamese Tet Festival in traditional attire became 
part of the pageantry at the Golden West College event in Huntington Beach 
Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the women at the festival that celebrates the Vietnamese lunar new 
year wore an ao dai , a colorful long silk tunic that is slit to the waist to 
reveal wide-legged trousers.They moved through the 70,000-strong throng in 
their mandarin-collar and raglan-sleeved dresses, fluttering fuchsia, coral, 
crimson and jade silk like graceful banners. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the vivid streaks of silk that wove through the crowd were poufs of 
velvet and a sprinkling of white and gold beads. Women and children wore hai , 
velvet beaded slippers that turn up at the toes, and khan dong, bright-hued 
turbans. Chinese characters were embroidered or hand-painted on peasant jackets 
and other clothing.DAVID KAWASHIMA / For The Times

FAUX PAS REPORT: WARMING TO THE LAYERED LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We don't get the miserable winter weather of our brethren Back East, but we 
often tend to look like them at this time of year. On those sharp, cold 
mornings, many women can be seen rushing to work wearing a heavy cotton or wool 
sweater underneath a fashionable blazer . . . tsk, tsk. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you wear a sweater that's too bulky (underneath a blazer), you'll end up 
looking like a stuffed sausage," says Stephanie Grani of Stephania in San Juan 
Capistrano. "You're changing the way the jacket fits, and it's not 
complimentary." 
</P>
<P>
 You can stay just as warm with a thinner silk knit or cotton cashmere sweater, 
and it will be flatter. Bodysuits also work well with blazers, and thicker 
knits will keep the body heat in. If you need to wear that fisherman's cable 
knit to stay cozy, forget the blazer and throw on your ski jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Wool over the eyes: You've got that hot ski outfit, new boots, sharp glasses 
-- and an old wool ski cap. 
</P>
<P>
 That old, one-size-fits-all cap has been around longer than wood skis and 
leather boots. Lots of guys have been spotted at local resorts wearing an old, 
stretched-out cap -- possibly for luck. But they should know that there are 
other options. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some great new hats and headgear that go well with some of the new 
colors," says Heather Patterson of Newport Ski Company in Newport Beach. "Of 
course, the right wool cap can fit in too." 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to stick with tradition and go with the Alpine look, make sure you 
pick a cap that fits. Try it on in the store, pull it down to cover your ears 
and be aware of your forehead. If you feel some abnormal tension, try another. 
It should be snug but not cut off your circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the nail: Not everyone can have a manicurist do their nails, but that 
doesn't mean everyone else has to notice.  
</P>
<P>
 Many women are seen around town with great coats of polish on their nails, but 
brush strokes across the cuticles are the telltale signs of a home (or auto) 
manicure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mistake many women make is they don't soak their hands," says Belva 
Quigley of Belva's Nails Naturally in Orange. "Soak them for a while in hot 
water before you start; the cuticles will be soft, and it will be easier to get 
polish off them when you make a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're saving some cash by not visiting the nail shop, at least splurge a 
little by using good polish. Cheap paints won't create a smooth finish.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, don't make the mistake of doing your nails during the lunch hour or 
during any other time crunch. The more relaxed you are, the steadier your hand 
will be.

BEHIND THE SCENES: FASHION; CLOTHES MAKE THE MAN A LOSER IN THE DATING GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sighs of disappointment were heard at "Let's Make a Date," a fund-raiser at 
Trattoria Spiga in Costa Mesa that tried to find matches between women from the 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and men from Young Professionals Against Cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The simulated "Studs" game show Tuesday should have been called "Duds."  
</P>
<P>
 The heartbreaking outcome?  
</P>
<P>
 None of the three women, each of whom went out with the two men, chose to have 
another date with destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Were the guys rejected because their standard-cut suits were as sartorially 
exciting as dating a sibling? No. The turnoff, said the women, was that the 
men's clothes reflected their conservative personalities.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was no sparkle," sniffed a disapproving woman contestant. "And they 
looked like George Bush."

FASHION; A GEM OF A BAG; JUDITH LEIBER DOESN'T MAKE ORDINARY PURSES -- NOT WITH 
THOSE RHINESTONES, BEADS . . . AND PRICES 
</P>

<P>
 To the women who treasure them, they're real gems -- evening bags that sparkle 
like diamonds and often come with price tags to match. 
</P>
<P>
 These beaded velvet pouches, rhinestone-covered sculpted bags and 
satin-covered clutches with faux jewel clasps add the crowning touch to ball 
gowns or beaded cocktail dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 The handbags' designer, Judith Leiber, has been compared to famed Russian 
jeweler Faberge. Her coveted minaudieres have gone to inaugurations and galas 
with Mamie Eisenhower, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
The purses have been displayed at the Smithsonian Institution and the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Those lucky enough to afford a bag -- prices start in the thousands -- tend to 
show it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our customers collect them like artwork. A lot of socialites display them in 
their homes," says Billur Wallerich, spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus in Newport 
Beach. "They are the ultimate accessory to add to any outfit." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiber studied her craft in Budapest, Hungary, her birthplace. She joined the 
Hungarian Handbag Guild as an apprentice at age 18 and achieved the rank of 
master after learning each step of making a handbag, from tanning the skins to 
engineering the clasps. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in her 70s and a U.S. resident for 30 years, Leiber still participates in 
every aspect of her handbag production. She began creating her trademark 
rhinestone-studded metal purses in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hadn't existed before," she says. "They were something I felt ladies 
would love." 
</P>
<P>
 They did. Women began coveting and collecting the bags. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a few customers who have two or three hundred bags," Leiber says. 
"When you see a lady carrying a little dog bag or a little cat bag or an egg, 
it makes you happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Leiber's latest styles, sold in such stores as Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth 
Avenue and I. Magnin, include a mailbox-shaped purse with a crazy-quilt pattern 
in multicolored rhinestones ($1,535), a panda bear in a gold and red jacket 
($3,400) and a gold heart covered with red stones ($1,400). 
</P>
<P>
 She also creates soft bags with jeweled frames. One satin bag has an Art 
Deco-inspired clasp with marcasite ($1,000); another comes in black alligator 
skin with a bar clasp set with semi-precious stones ($3,725). 
</P>
<P>
 Leiber finds ideas for her creations everywhere. She's been inspired by museum 
exhibits, Japanese bronzes, "a knot on a hairdo or a button on a jacket," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a good sense of humor. I think everything we do should have whimsy in 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 When a friend gave her a sculpture of a sleeping cat to put by the fireplace, 
it led to one of her more famous designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have made 1,000 cat bags by now. Of course, none of them (is) the 
same -- some have stripes, some have flowers, some are solid." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Leiber minaudieres, women are toting soft vintage-looking 
bags to galas, says Jessica Morrell, handbags and accessories manager for Saks 
at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything has a definite vintage flair. It's part of the romantic look -- 
the long vests, the cameos, the ruffled blouses brought them in," Morrell says. 
</P>
<P>
 Small drawstring bags and framed clutches with jeweled top handles that open 
like coin purses are strong for night and come in every price point. Saks has 
pouches of crinkled gold or silver lame or black or navy satin for $40. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing these varied evening bags have in common: their size. Most bags are 
so tiny that a woman can carry only the barest of necessities. In Morrell's 
opinion, that comes down to just two crucial items: 
</P>
<P>
 "Lipstick and a credit card."

FASHION; ATHLETIC SUPPORTERS; ACTIVE WEAR LEAPS TO A HIGHER LEVEL AS CREATORS 
ADD PADDING AND REINFORCED SEAMS AND SUBTRACT BOUNCE, CHAFE AND SWEAT 
</P>

 Hard-core aerobics activists apparently have been whining. They want the burn, 
but they want it while sitting on the soft, cushy seat of padding in warm, dry 
clothing that sucks in body fat and supports creaky knees. And the women would 
like a bit of cleavage showing, too. 
</P>
<P>
 As equipment and training regimens become more sophisticated, so does 
clothing. The people who create workout wear have been toiling to eliminate the 
bounce, chafe, sweat and stench associated with exercise -- without sacrificing 
style. Their latest innovations include reinforced panels, extra padding and 
sophisticated fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Fibers are stronger and more elastic. Fabrics are designed not only to absorb 
and disperse moisture but also to fight bacteria. Garments are engineered to 
support muscles and protect joints. It seems the only people still wearing 
old-fashioned sweat pants are those who don't intend to sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Nautilus, the Independence, Va., company associated with muscle-crunching 
equipment, will begin selling its inaugural line of apparel and footwear next 
month in major sporting-goods stores. Most of the clothing items are made of 
heavy-duty Supplex, a synthetic fiber that's much thicker and stronger than 
spandex. It "gives a feeling of compression," says David Erwin, Nautilus design 
director. "People don't like the feel of body fat moving around."  
</P>
<P>
 The company's $85 multipurpose pants feature a double layer of heavyweight 
quilted Supplex at the knees, a show of extra support for aerobicizers, 
weightlifters, runners or anyone with weak joints.  
</P>
<P>
 Shorts and sports tops, $22 to $55, have strategically placed (small of the 
back, chest, underarm) panels of Aquator, a wicking (sweat dispensing) fabric. 
And the $8 socks and $75 weight-training shoes contain agents that fight that 
gym-bag aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 Hind, a San Luis Obispo maker of active wear, collaborated with Cal Poly 
researchers in developing its wicking fabric, DryLete. The company, whose line 
is sold at Big 5 and Sports Chalet, is also working with cyclists to create 
more comfortable gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Its cycling unitard, $64, comes with a thick crotch padding that mimics the 
shape of the bicycle seat. The cycling pants, $70, have a padded crotch and a 
double layer of fabric in the knees, not so much for support as for warmth. And 
to prevent chaffing along the inner thigh, Hind moved seams of the garment to 
the front and back. 
</P>
<P>
 A design advance of another kind offers support and separation for women who 
like the comfort of a sports bra. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all of the uni-boob construction," avid aerobicizer Kimberly 
Mattson says of the first sports bras. "They made my chest look like a shelf." 
</P>
<P>
 So Mattson, who lives in Los Angeles, looked into the sports-bra market, found 
a niche, ran some numbers and hooked up with a pattern maker. The result is a 
$35 underwire bra -- made of Supplex, lace and non-stretch straps -- that looks 
like fine lingerie. It is sold in sizes 32-B to 40-D under the label By 
Kimberly at Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 For women whose problem area is below the waist, Carol Green has developed 
matte nylon/Lycra bike pants and leggings with satin tummy- and thigh-control 
panels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The satin makes them look tuxedo-ish, and those panels hold in everything," 
Green says. The $40 to $80 line, Aubergine, is sold at Saks Fifth Avenue and 
Neiman Marcus.

FASHION; SUPPORT FOR MOMS; SPECIALTY BRAS FOR PREGNANT AND NURSING WOMEN HAVE 
PROLIFERATED. BUT GETTING THE RIGHT FIT IS STILL TRICKY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Agood friend who recently delivered a nine-pound baby had shaken her head in 
disbelief early in her pregnancy. "It wouldn't surprise me if the same company 
that made maternity underwear also made trash bags," she said, holding up a 
nursing bra. A few months later, it fit perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 So it goes when you're trying to decide what to buy in the way of 
"foundations" -- nursing bras and other specialty garments -- to get you 
through pregnancy and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hormonal changes cause most women to begin changing bra sizes within the 
first few months (of pregnancy)," said Patty Villarreal, a registered nurse and 
director of the South Texas Lactation Center in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only will the cup size increase, but a pregnant woman's chest wall 
expands, changing both (letter and number) measurements," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The options for pregnant and nursing women have proliferated in recent years, 
said Liz Wallace of A Pea in a Pod, a national chain of maternity stores. 
Prenatal and nursing bras now come in a wide variety of styles, including front 
closure and underwire, as well as versions for jogging and sleeping.  
</P>
<P>
 But "a bra need not be labeled 'prenatal' " to be practical, said Carol Anne 
Friedman, a lactation consultant and owner of Mothers With Style, a Glendale 
maternity shop. "Any good-fitting, supportive and comfortable bra will work as 
a prenatal bra." 
</P>
<P>
 But Friedman endorses nothing but 100% cotton. "Frilly nylon bras aren't 
functional," she said. "When you're nursing a baby, you want comfort and 
functionality." 
</P>
<P>
 Villarreal agrees. She also suggests that moms-to-be put off shopping for a 
nursing bra until the last trimester so the bra can be worn before and after 
the baby arrives. "Women should opt for a fabric that allows the skin to 
breathe and a fit that leaves room for growth -- and nursing pads," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace measures clients around the bust line and the chest, then uses a 
conversion chart to determine cup size. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the bra fits you perfectly, it's the wrong bra," she explained. "It should 
be loose through the nipple going up to the bust line. This will accommodate 
for milk and pads." 
</P>
<P>
 Villarreal cautions against choosing underwire styles for postpartum wear 
because they may impede circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that you should be able to unhook the breast flap with one hand. 
"'Practice unhooking the cup while in the dressing room," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts also emphasize the importance of wearing a bra day and night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many women find they cannot go without one," Wallace said, adding that 
sleeping bras in lightweight, breathable cotton offer comfort and support. 
</P>
<P>
 Nursing moms who go without will probably regret it, Villarreal said. "The 
long-term effect is the stretching of muscles that support breast tissue."

FASHION; HEADS-UP STYLE; WHITE CYCLING HELMETS? BOR-ING. NOW, THE GEAR IS 
SLEEKER AND DECIDEDLY MORE COLORFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Bicycle riders are breaking away from boring white helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a helmet while riding a bike became state law for the under-18 set 
Jan. 1. Yet while parents and legislators fret about safety, riders have an 
additional concern: fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Children -- and adults -- no longer pedal around in clunky helmets that make 
them look like astronauts. Thanks to innovative designs, bicyclists can sport 
sleek, colorful helmets that fit a wide range of tastes, not to mention heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as Giro and Bell have pulled ahead of the pack with adult- and 
child-size helmets that come in such trendy colors as purple and teal. Some 
helmets come in "fader" tones that go from light to dark, or in fancy metallic 
hues that match the bikes. A few helmets have fun graphics, such as paint 
splotches, stripes and even dog paw prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Helmet styles began changing gears several years ago, when wearing a bike 
helmet became more common. 
</P>
<P>
 "People became more aware of how important it is to wear a helmet," says Sue 
Grisson, co-owner of Rainbow Bicycle Co. in Laguna Beach. "And they were more 
likely to wear them if they looked cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior riders now have their pick of styles, such as a white helmet by Bell 
festooned with a colorful alphabet soup ($42), a "Rover" style by Troxel 
covered with black paw prints ($35), and Troxel's teal-colored helmet adorned 
with barking dogs and abstract swirls and zigzags ($35). 
</P>
<P>
 For adults, there's the sleek "Diva" from Troxel with a pearly finish that 
fades from deep purple to white or red to yellow ($50) and the "Black Light" 
from Giro, with purple streaks that glow on the helmet's black surface ($84), 
as well as assorted solid-colored and metallic helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies have souped up their helmets to look like something out of the 
Indianapolis 500. The "Streetrider" style from Bell comes with racing stripes 
down the sides. The "Air Blast" helmets by Giro look as if they've been worn 
while riding through a rain of blue paint. Helmets range from $30 to $140. 
</P>
<P>
 "Giro's known for wild colors. And they change colors every year, just like 
fashion designers," says Greyson Tipping, manager of Performance Bicycle Shop 
in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Giro's '94 helmets come in deep jewel tones, including a few faders in 
graduating shades of purple, red or yellow. One of Giro's newest helmets has 
webbing that drops down onto the neck -- it helps stabilize the helmet, Tipping 
says, and riders think it makes them look cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year's styles promise to be even wilder. 
</P>
<P>
 At bike shows, Specialized has been showing off its Piranha prototype, a blue 
helmet with a small fin on top and a mouth full of sharp teeth in front, 
Tipping says. Although some helmets have only four vents, the Piranha will have 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're designing helmets so that it's just as cool to wear one as not to, 
due to wind tunneling and the placement of the vents," Tipping says. 
</P>
<P>
 Extra vents help keep the head cool while riding, and it helps that most 
helmets no longer cover the ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Older helmets were cumbersome. They were almost painful because they were so 
heavy," Tipping says. "Now they weigh only seven to nine ounces." 
</P>
<P>
 Helmets have become more bearable thanks to a thin plastic shell and insides 
made from lightweight polystyrene foam. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like high-tech ice-chest material," says Kenny Woods, manager of 
Bicycles Etc. in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 "Years ago, helmets were heavy and hard. Now they're lightweight with lots of 
ventilation holes," he says. They also have a sleeker, more aerodynamic shape 
instead of the bowling-ball looks of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 When choosing a helmet, first find one that fits well, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should fit snugly but not too tight," Woods says. "Everybody's head size 
is a different shape and size." 
</P>
<P>
 Some manufacturers make their helmets more oval, and others make them rounder. 
The helmets come with foam pads that adjust to fit the head. One 
top-of-the-line helmet by Bell comes with a Reebok pump system that inflates to 
the exact proportions of the rider's head. It sells for about $140. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put it on and pump the little bladder inside up for a perfect fit," Woods 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Riders should choose a helmet that meets the safety standards of the American 
National Standard Institute or the Snell Foundation, which has even stricter 
safety guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing the right helmet can save a rider's life, and no one knows that better 
than Tipping. He credits a bike helmet with saving him from a serious head 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was during a race. I got cut off and hit a cone and went headfirst over my 
bike. When I crashed, I hit the front side of the helmet going 30 m.p.h.," he 
says. "Other than a road rash and a little headache, I was fine. But the helmet 
was destroyed."

IRS LOSES MILLIONS IN FRAUD WITH ELECTRONIC TAX FILING; CRIME: REFUNDS ARE 
ISSUED SO QUICKLY THAT THE AGENCY HAS NO TIME TO CHECK FACTS AND MATH, THE GAO 
REPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service's fast-growing system for allowing taxpayers to 
file their returns electronically has brought with it a wave of fraud that is 
costing the government millions of dollars, federal investigators reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Refunds for electronic returns are issued so quickly that the IRS cannot check 
all of them in time to catch cyberspace outlaws, the General Accounting Office 
told members of a House subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic filing has been a point of pride with the IRS, welcomed as a big 
stride along the government's vaunted information highway. But it appears that 
electronic filing could become a highway rest stop that beckons crooks and 
thieves: False filing of returns by computer soared 105% last year, said the 
GAO, the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS "has perfected the art of using its computers to give out tax refunds 
quickly without making a corresponding effort in the area of fraud controls," 
said Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means oversight 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Thievery is relatively easy because the IRS often has as little as two days to 
investigate and stop a fraudulent refund after an electronic filing, compared 
with four to eight weeks for the traditional paper return. "The very thing that 
appeals to taxpayers -- faster refunds -- also increases IRS' vulnerability to 
fraud," the GAO reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, two Orange County men were indicted by a Los Angeles federal grand 
jury for allegedly obtaining about $22,000 in tax-refund loans. The Justice 
Department, which sent prosecutors to investigate the case, alleged that the 
men submitted phony W-2 forms to three Orange County tax preparers. They in 
turn electronically transmitted to the IRS completed tax returns based on those 
W-2 forms.  
</P>
<P>
 Once that was done, the men allegedly applied to financial institutions for 
refund-anticipated loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic filing of tax returns to the IRS was first offered nationwide in 
1990 and has grown rapidly. Last year, 12 million of the 115 million individual 
federal tax returns were filed electronically. The IRS' ambitious game plan 
calls for collecting 80 million returns electronically by the year 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 The detection of fraudulent electronic filing rose to 25,633 returns during 
the first 10 months of last year, a 105% increase over the 12,488 bogus returns 
detected during the same period a year earlier. The false returns detected last 
year claimed refunds of $53 million, but the IRS was able to stop only $29 
million before the refunds were issued. 
</P>
<P>
 And these figures could represent just the tip of the iceberg of criminality, 
GAO investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Electronic filing fraud is a problem whose true dimensions are unknown," said 
Jennie S. Stathis, GAO's director of tax policy and administration issues, at a 
congressional hearing convened by Pickle's oversight panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of identified fraudulent electronic returns is relatively small, 
but the rate of growth is high and it is uncertain how much fraud might be 
going undetected," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A taxpayer who wants to file electronically must work through an individual or 
a company authorized by the IRS to file returns by computer. The taxpayer's 
information is entered into the approved firm's computer, then transmitted to 
the IRS computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the authorized firms can prepare and send the tax returns. Others act 
only as conduits, sending returns as submitted to them by taxpayers without 
checking their arithmetic or facts. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS' primary means of detecting bogus returns is to examine a sample group 
of filed returns. The agency discovered that as many as a third of the crooked 
electronic filers were people using false names and Social Security numbers on 
their returns. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS rules say that firms transmitting electronic returns must mail supporting 
paperwork -- a document with the taxpayer's signature along with W-2 forms and 
other income verification. These documents must be sent within a day after the 
return is filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, however, the paper is not sent until after the refunds are issued, 
and sometimes it is never sent. IRS rules say firms that transmit tax returns 
electronically will be suspended for failing to send documents but the agency 
rarely enforces the rule, the GAO complained. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO said in a December report to Congress that taxpayers who want to file 
electronically should be required to submit two pieces of identification, one 
with a photograph, to the firm doing the filing. "The IRS has since decided not 
to require but only recommend that two forms of identification be required," 
Stathis told the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson said her agency is vigilant in 
chasing false filers. With the current tax season only six weeks old, "we have 
already detected approximately 200 schemes involving approximately 3,000 
attempts to file fraudulent claims on returns," she said.
