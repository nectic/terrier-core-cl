THE ROAD FROM THERE TO HERE; ROADWALKERS, BY SHIRLEY ANN GRAU (ALFRED A. KNOPF: 
$22; 272 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pulitzer Prize-winner Shirley Ann Grau's ninth work of fiction begins 
promisingly as a sweeping social novel in the no-longer-fashionable fashion of 
John Steinbeck: 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1934 this is the way it was. Homeless people were moving in a steady flow 
across the southern part of the country, back and forth across the surface of 
the earth, seaweed on a tide that ebbed and rose according to seasons, 
following rumors and hopes, propelled from place to place by police and 
sheriffs and farmers with shotguns, and closed doors and locked gates. . . . 
They were called roadwalkers." 
</P>
<P>
 Early on in her nearly 40-year career as a writer, Grau established a 
reputation for leavening her expertise regarding debutante New Orleans with an 
uncondescending view of the South's poorer black and white residents. In this 
book she quickly zeros in on a small stunted black child known only as Baby. 
Baby begins life as one of six siblings in a small-town family "with four pecan 
trees in the yard." But in a flash all she has vanishes. Around the time she is 
born, her father deserts the family for another woman. Her mother departs 
shortly thereafter. The children find Aunt Rosie in a nearby town, but Rosie, 
overwhelmed, practices a heartless triage, abandoning Baby with two of her 
siblings by the side of the road when she heads off with the other children 
toward a relative who works as a Pullman porter in Atlanta. In a few short, 
blameless years, Baby has sunk to being a roadwalker. 
</P>
<P>
 With her brother Joseph as her tutor, Baby drifts from town to farm. They 
steal eggs from henhouses and milk from unwatched cows. Here Baby's tiny size 
is a virtue: "What she could do was this: she could wriggle through the least 
crack in a fence or window and open it wide for them to come back to later." 
These pages, which chronicle Baby's feral existence, her constant exposure to 
disease and fear of a shotgun blast, are beautifully imagined and written. But 
soon "Roadwalkers" loses its footing and begins to feel like an oddly matched 
set of novellas joined along exposed seams. 
</P>
<P>
 Baby is "captured" by the employees of an idealistic plantation owner, who 
sends her, mute and barely housebroken, to a school run by nuns. There she is 
considered a hopelessly wild child until she demonstrates an unsuspected talent 
for drawing bright, evocative religious images. Re-christened Mary Woods by the 
nuns, Baby is enraptured by African gods invisible to her Christian handlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then "Roadwalkers" shifts abruptly now into the first person, becoming the 
account of Nanda Woods, Mary's daughter, who at 36 years of age narrates her 
childhood retrospectively. Much has changed in the interim: Mary has become a 
successful New Orleans couturier. Nanda is her model, and the two are famous 
enough to be featured in Newsweek (this strange turn of events is actually an 
expansion of Grau's short story, "The Beginning," from her last book, "Nine 
Stories"). Nanda faces the challenge of integrating an eastern Catholic 
boarding school. 
</P>
<P>
 For a novel that has begun with the grand impersonality of "The Grapes of 
Wrath" to reach suddenly for the autobiographical intensity of Lorene Cary's 
"Black Ice" or Jill Nelson's "Volunteer Slavery" is tricky enough. But Nanda, 
drawn as a thoroughly whiny and ungiving young woman with resentment as deep in 
her blood as art was in her mother's, makes this improbable retooling yet 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Nanda excels academically, she despises the tokenism which has brought 
her to this nameless, prestigious school. She acts this anger out through minor 
mischief from experimenting with bisexuality to rejecting those who accept her. 
Ultimately she graduates from college with an attitude problem and a Phi Beta 
Kappa key. . . . Fast forward again as she finds in a young black doctor with 
an anarchic streak -- an ideal groom for an open marriage. The time scheme of 
the novel now seems to have reached the swinging '60s. The novel concludes 
limply in the present with an epiphany from the adult Nanda: She and her 
husband "smile at each other, cautiously, warily, as we walk across the 
worm-infested lawn. . . . And so alone I came into my kingdom. My portion 
neither more nor less." 
</P>
<P>
 Writing a novel is more like driving a train than a car -- once it runs off 
the rails, recovery is rarely possible. "Roadwalkers" probably is doomed from 
the moment Baby is saved. But one wonders at Grau's troubles with the latter 
part of the book. After all, she made her name in part through the expertise 
with which she brought alive women of Nanda's age, albeit mostly white and rich 
women, like the manipulative Joan Mitchell in Grau's wonderful "House on 
Coliseum Street" (published in 1961). Yet in "Roadwalkers," the author's first 
novel in 18 years, Grau appears to have lost access to the feel of young 
adulthood, which she once grasped so well.

LEVITATE!; MR. VERTIGO, BY PAUL AUSTER (VIKING: $21.95; 292 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joanna Scott, Joanna Scott is the author of Various Antidotes.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Throughout his career as a novelist, Paul Auster has been making a fictional 
map of the United States, carefully pinning his characters to real places -- to 
specific city streets, small towns and stretches of highway. In this new novel, 
Auster takes us to the Midwest in the 1920s and '30, but this time his map 
includes a portion of the Kansas sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 12 years old the first time I walked on water," begins the narrator of 
"Mr. Vertigo." He is Walter Rawley, and though he likes an occasional 
wisecrack, he's telling us the truth here. "Walt the Wonder Boy," as he is 
nicknamed, does walk on water in this novel. He flies. He climbs up invisible 
staircases and over bridges that don't exist. He somersaults in midair, falls, 
brakes inches above the ground and floats down to earth. He is the supreme 
vaudevillian, a nearly flawless entertainer and his greatest act is the story 
he tells us, the story of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Auster has always been intrigued by games, and the fact that he is 
playing with the rules of realism in this novel seems a natural development, 
given his earlier sleight of hand. He's a sly realist, a writer who asks us to 
lose ourselves totally in the illusion of his fiction even as he exposes the 
artifice. This is part of the joy of reading Auster's work -- his stories are 
absorbing, his insights jolting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Vertigo" is surely one of Auster's most absorbing tales, written in a 
prose that is precise, confident in its use of vernacular and sometimes 
smoothly lyrical, as in this description of a Kansas drought: "The air was so 
parched, so delirious in its desiccation, you could track the buzzing of a 
horsefly from a hundred yards away." Reaching from old age back through memory, 
Auster's narrator recounts his life, miracle by miracle, beginning in 1924, 
when the mysterious Master Yehudi enters Walt's life. Walt is only 9, an orphan 
living with a wicked uncle and an indifferent aunt. Master Yehudi offers a 
rather primal proposition to young Walt: "'If I haven't taught you to fly by 
your 13th birthday, you can chop off my head with an axe."' Since Walt has no 
better prospects, he accepts the challenge and goes to live with Master Yehudi 
on a farm in rural Kansas. There he meets Mother Sue, a Sioux Indian, and 
Aesop, an Ethiopian boy, both of whom are indebted to Yehudi for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt joins this makeshift family weighted down with the burden of provincial 
bigotry. He identifies Mother Sue as the "Queen of the Gypsies" and Aesop as 
the "Prince of Blackness." It doesn't take him long to give up his prejudices, 
though. Walt attempts to escape Master Yehudi's harsh regimen and runs away 
several times. His last failed attempt ends in illness, and his recovery is 
marked by a vast shift in attitude. He forgets his earlier prejudices and comes 
to consider Aesop and Mother Sue his best friends. This improvement -- too 
complete, too convenient, even for Auster's modern fairy tale -- may be the one 
significant weakness of the novel. Walt gives up his dangerous bigotry as 
easily as an old coat, replacing it with loyalty and deep respect. The 
snarling, distrustful boy suddenly becomes likable, a transformation that ends 
up seeming more unreal than his levitations. 
</P>
<P>
 That complaint aside, Walt's catalogue of initiating terrors is unforgettable. 
In order to achieve some kind of psychic control over gravity, he must endure a 
variety of tortures. "I was flogged with a bullwhip; I was thrown from a 
galloping horse; I was lashed to the roof of the barn for two days without food 
or water; I had my skin smeared with honey and then stood naked in the August 
heat as a thousand flies and wasps swarmed over me. . . ." The list goes on. 
Somehow Walt manages to survive Master Yehudi's initiation. And at last, in his 
moment of deepest despair, he feels his body rise a few inches into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 With practice, Walt learns to control his flights, to turn levitation into a 
graceful dance. But his magical buoyancy has little consequence -- it is 
entertainment, stupendous entertainment. Walt is no more than a boy with an 
amazing trick up his sleeve. His magic can't help him when the Ku Klux Klan 
rides in. He cowers with Yehudi behind a tree and witnesses terrors that far 
surpass the cruelties of his initiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The road has always been a useful metaphor for Auster -- it is a means of 
escape and pursuit, as well as an image for the motion of thought. Walt and 
Yehudi take their show on the road and escape the Klan's destruction. At the 
same time they head out in pursuit of fame, fighting their way into the 
limelight. Walt the Wonder Boy becomes a national celebrity, though only for a 
few short years. Levitation, it turns out, is a kind of magic that belongs only 
to children (and to eunuchs, Master Yehudi intimates). When Walt enters 
puberty, the effort of flying becomes unbearably excruciating and he is forced 
to abandon the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt all but abandons his singular self as well. No longer a curiosity, he 
becomes a type -- a slick nightclub owner obsessed with guns and baseball. If 
Walt seems less interesting as an adult, less original, it is not a fault of 
the novel. It is the fault of the culture, which offers the earthbound young 
man few prospects and permits no miraculous escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very slowly, I felt my body rise off the floor. The movement was so natural, 
so exquisite in its gentleness, it wasn't until I opened my eyes that I 
understood my limbs were touching only air," Walt says about his first 
levitation. But as soon as the magic is over, Walt sinks "like a stone to the 
bottom of the world." "Mr. Vertigo" is a thrilling flight of fancy that never 
abandons the world. A magical-pertinent book, it gives us a bird's-eye view of 
the strange, violent, paradoxical century behind us.

MEMORIES ON TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Katy Butler might have made more clear why Gary Romona won in the 
landmark repressed-memory trial, she did clarify the issues ("A House Divided," 
June 26). But she failed to challenge the now conventional wisdom in the debate 
-- that there are only two options regarding those memories: They are either 
true or false. 
</P>
<P>
 A third option should not be ignored, one that is associated with Freud. These 
memories may be remembered fantasies, part of the childhood dream world, 
inspired by the natural attraction of children for the parent of the opposite 
sex. Repression of fantasies occurs when the child senses that the fantasies 
and the feelings they spring from are too threatening. (The child feels that 
the parent of the same sex would harm him or her if he or she knew.) 
</P>
<P>
 That option would account for the difficulty of retrieving the memories. Few 
remember fantasies easily, but those who were in fact victims of childhood 
sexual abuse never forget it. It also would account for the connection between 
the memories and later emotional and even physical problems, since those can be 
caused by the repression of such a basic part of the self as sexual feeling.

 In trying to strike a balance between the stories of Ramona and his daughter, 
Butler forgot the journalist's most important role: to report the truth. 
Commentator Edward R. Murrow did not try to strike a balance between Joe 
McCarthy and the senator's falsely accused victims. Was there a balance between 
the so-called witches of Salem and their accusers? 
</P>
<P>
 Butler cites one scientific study that "proves that some instances of 
recovered memory are credible." Yet, a closer review shows that the study was 
not about recovered memory at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The child-abuse hysteria, beginning with the McMartin day-care case a decade 
ago, has lasted longer than any other episode of hysteria in American history 
and destroyed thousands of American families. If you don't know the major role 
The Times has already played in promoting this hysteria, I suggest a review of 
its admitted misreporting of the McMartin case. The Times has a special 
responsibility to get this story right. Too much is at stake for the true 
victims of this hysteria.

 The most chilling statement in Butler's article was: "In July, Holly will 
complete work on her MA in clinical psychology at Pepperdine University; she 
wants to work with abused children." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither experts nor Holly can figure out what did or did not happen to her. 
Her history of problems has left her confused, angry, distraught and troubled. 
That Holly could possibly get into a position where she can influence the 
mental state of young, hurt and easily manipulated children is unthinkable.

 While Butler does a good job at placing the Ramona trial in its historical 
context and discussing the issues underlying its great interest, she also 
showed a subtle bias and a rather naive acceptance of unsubstantiated claims 
about traumatic memory. 
</P>
<P>
 One example of bias was in the description of the False Memory Syndrome 
Foundation, which was formed, Butler says, when "there were enough agonized 
fathers protesting their innocence to spawn a support group . . . ." What she 
neglected to say was that the foundation was formed by a group of families and 
professionals who were concerned about questionable therapeutic practices. She 
omits the fact that the foundation's Scientific Advisory Board includes some of 
the most prestigious memory researchers in the country and the world. Butler 
frames her discussion in terms of "fathers," leaving out the information that 
40% of the accusations of abuse are against mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for unsubstantiated claims about traumatic memory, Dr. Lenore Terr's 
testimony that a person's dislike of bananas and whole pickles is a sign of 
past sexual abuse has no validity. And while the Linda Meyer Williams research 
is an advance in the methodology of studying memories of past sexual abuse, it 
in no way can be said to provide "scientific support for the proposition" that 
there is any special mental mechanism that operates in traumatic situations. If 
Butler would read the Williams study with greater care she'd note, for example, 
that a majority of the 38% of women did not say that they had not been abused, 
but rather they told about abuse situations other than the particular one the 
researchers had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler also neglected to mention that both the American Psychiatric Assn. and 
the American Medical Assn. have said that in cases of recovered memory "there 
is no completely accurate way of determining the validity of reports in the 
absence of corroborating information."

<P>
 Butler replies: Thanks to Pamela Freyd for setting the record straight. Among 
the members of her foundation accused of sexual abuse, a significant percentage 
are mothers. Although sociologists say the majority of reports of child sexual 
abuse involve men, I should have spoken of "accused parents," not "accused 
fathers."  
</P>
<P>
 Turning to Freyd's assessment that I show "a subtle bias" and a lack of knowl 
edge of memory research, I suggest that what is unknown about the workings of 
memory, by everyone, far outweighs the known. Neuroscientists, clinicians and 
cognitive psychologists all describe small pieces of the puzzle in their own 
specialized languages, but a specific consensus on facts, models and precise 
neural mechanisms does not exist.  
</P>
<P>
 There are, however, many anecdotal reports from clinicians, as well as 
research by Terr and Elizabeth Loftus that trauma produces distortions of 
memory. Terr is a nationally respected researcher who studied children who 
suffered the publicly acknowledged trauma of the Chowchilla kidnaping. Many of 
those children suffered distortions of memory, remembering, for example, a 
female or a black kidnaper rather than three young white men. I stated that 
Terr's assessment of Holly was based on her entire clinical picture, including 
her physical symptoms, fears, nightmares, sexual and social functioning, 
psychological test responses and other factors. To reduce her assessment to a 
single, easily parodied reference to "bananas and whole pickles" seems unfair.  
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the Williams study, Freyd is correct that of the women who did not 
recall the child sexual abuse that brought them into the study, 68% told of 
other sexual assaults (involving different perpetrators and circumstances) 
experienced in their childhood. However, any report of abuse by the offender 
whose actions had brought the women into a city emergency room as children was 
counted by Williams as remembering the abuse, even if it involved different 
dates and circumstances.

TRUST ME ON THIS; RETURN TO LA MANCHA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM KRUSOE, Jim Krusoe teaches at Santa Monica College. He is the editor of 
the Santa Monica Review. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As nearly as I can remember, the last time I picked up Don Quixote, Richard 
Nixon was President and we thought he'd never leave. There was a war going on 
in Southeast Asia; I'd been married for three years and was lying low on a farm 
in West Virginia. In those heady days I never dreamed of reaching 40, let alone 
the pit beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a couple months ago I was looking for a way to tell a story that would 
allow me simultaneously to move forward and to digress, one that I could use as 
a model for a piece I was trying to write, so I turned again to Quixote. 
Immediately I was struck by two things I'd missed the first time through. The 
first was that Cervantes' great character wasn't all that old; he was in his 
mid-50s, just about my age. The second (well, really the second and third) was 
how rapidly the story gets underway and then, once it does, what a large number 
of people are truly hurt -- I mean broken bones, and blood and near-death and 
financial loss -- by all that idealism. 
</P>
<P>
 The other thing I'd more or less forgotten (yet another!) was that his 
adventures actually take up not one, but two full volumes. The first, which 
contains the most famous episodes (the windmills, the sheep, Mambrino's Helmet 
and the troubles at the inn), explores the multiple possibilities of 
interpreting the work. Is the son plain wrong, or is he right that the tricks 
played on him are the product of enchanters? Or, another possibility, have the 
enchanters covered not his eyes but the eyes of the rest of the world? 
Everything in that first volume exits in multiples -- the numerous pairs of 
lovers (what's true love and what's false?), the Don and Sancho, even the 
question of who the narrator is -- Cervantes or his reputed source, the Moor, 
Cid Hamete Benengeli. No wonder Borges, master of mazes and of mirrors loved 
this book, and no wonder, with Cervantes' stories within stories, so large a 
tip of the hat is given to the Thousand and One Nights. 
</P>
<P>
 And if that first book is all about the Don being mocked for his original 
vision (itself a copy of the romances of old), then, in the second, he is 
ridiculed for believing the visions others have copied from his won. Instead of 
disbelieving his as in part one, in the second, worse, he is humored. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is starting to sound a lot like life, well maybe it is. In my own case 
by now I have ventured out twice from the relative comfort of marriage (ah, 
true love and false!) in search of a different way to be in the world. Both 
times I found it, and both times the pain I lay about others was very, very 
great, in fact unspeakable. Was it worth it? Did I accomplish more as a result? 
My answer is only to echo Quixote, and the ancient Greeks as well, that it's 
the adventure, not the result that is our measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Quixote did both good and harm, as much by chance as anything, and maybe 
that's been true of my life also. Still, it's interesting that of all his 
adventures, the one that troubled the Don the most was the Cave of Montsantos, 
where, instead of descending to the depths of an abyss, he instead settles in 
along a ledge a few feet from the top and falls asleep. There he has a dream, 
or vision, and forever after the question keeps bothering him: Was it a true 
vision or a false one? In time, the best answer comes from a charlatan: Some of 
it was true and some was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Another surprise this time around is that while in my youth I was in a hurry 
to reach the end, I would have been happy, this second reading, to have it last 
forever. Quixote (in the Modern Library, Putnam translation) comes to nearly 
1,000 pages, and it took more than two months to complete. Now I can't think of 
searching for a new place to live, choosing a house, packing and unpacking, and 
putting things in place, in a way that's separate from the adventure of the 
mill, or the flying wooden horse. How many experiences are there, for that 
matter, that are that luxurious, outside life itself? A compact disc will last 
an hour, a movie possibly two, most novels (when I'm not caught up in moving) 
two or three days. To allow a book to be absorbed so completely into one's life 
makes it seem as if we are living not one, but two separate and very different 
existences. 
</P>
<P>
 Related to the book's length, curiously, is the breath-taking brevity of the 
don's death. It takes four pages in all, so rapidly that it seems not even to 
have happened, to be the greatest illusion of all. But isn't this also like 
life? Of all the deaths of others I've experienced, the most unbelievable were 
not those close at hand, or sudden, or even of the very young. The deaths 
hardest to accept were of those characters so eccentric, so unusual, the until 
the actual moment of their passing they seemed to operate on a set of physical 
laws so different than our own. They couldn't die, and then they did. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, speaking of the unexpected, there is a stunning scene in the second 
book of his adventures where the Don actually takes into his hand, not the 
first volume, which we know he is aware of, but the very book we are holding, 
so that later, meeting a minor character in a country inn, he comments to 
Sancho that surely this man must be who he claims to be because earlier, when 
he was looking over the second part, he saw his name (which, of course, is this 
very scene we are reading. Speak of mirrors inside mirrors!). 
</P>
<P>
 For Cervantes then, the measure of fiction and the measure of life, too, is 
the story. And just as there are romances, and thrillers, and success stories 
and stories of disasters, as well as modern epics of bleak and hopeless 
drudgery, each attracts us in a different way. So lives vary too, and other 
than the pleasure of living them, who can say if one is better than another. Is 
a long life more valuable than a short, or an exciting one of more significance 
than one that's quiet? Ultimately, what makes a book valuable isn't style, or 
plot, or character, or tone, but simply its ability to tell us something that 
we hadn't known, that we'd forgotten -- our own strange and illusory existence. 
</P>
<P>
 So is Quixote about illusion or about life? Read on: No sooner had I finished 
the last words of the novel (" . . . doomed to fall. Vale."), than I turned to 
find the source of the clanking sound coming from the next room. It turned out 
to be my dog scratching his ear, and the sound was of his metal collar tags 
hitting one another. The ear looked to be infected, so I went to the dresser to 
find a few cotton swabs to clean it, and when I pulled on the drawer, the front 
came off in my hands. I was headed toward the garage when I heard a cheery 
"Hello." I looked up and saw two guys in dark suits; each was carrying a 
briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you noticed that there seems to be a plan behind all things?" the taller 
one ventured by way of starting a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hmmm," I replied, and sensing the lie of the land, he handed me what he 
called, "some of our literature," which I took, but didn't pay attention to 
until after I'd re-glued the drawer and cleaned the offending ear. Then I 
looked. My farewell gift was a small pamphlet titled, "Who Really Rules the 
World?" and its message was that deceptions are everywhere. Things aren't what 
they seem, the pamphlet said. Don't be gullible. Don't always believe your 
friends, or what you read in the papers, or see on television, or in films. 
Watch out, it said. Beware.

COVER STORY: FIVE STARS WITH A NEW LUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Movie stars had faces then. And glamour. And magical auras. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the decades, several have become legend: Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, 
Clark Gable, John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Humphrey Bogart, James Dean, Marilyn 
Monroe, Katharine Hepburn. Their images grace posters and T-shirts. Festivals 
present retrospectives of their films. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were numerous other talented actors and actresses who worked in 
Hollywood in the 1930s, '40s and '50s who never developed a cult following, but 
were acclaimed stars in their own right. Thanks to home video and cable, 
today's film viewers have been reintroduced to these movie stars. The scoop on 
five of our favorites: Dana Andrews (1909-1992) 
</P>
<P>
 CHARACTERISTICS: Handsome, sensitive, brooding, dependable, romantic, 
forceful; played good guys and villains and was equally at home in 
sophisticated, contemporary roles as well as Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
 BEGINNINGS: Andrews, the older brother of Steve Forrest, worked as a gas 
station attendant while a student at the Pasadena Playhouse theater group. He 
eventually was signed by producer Samuel Goldwyn and in 1940 began to appear in 
supporting roles in Goldwyn and Fox films, including William Wyler's 1940 
sagebrush tale "The Westerner" and Howard Hawks' 1941 comedy "Ball of Fire." 
Singled out by critics in 1943 for his memorable turn as a victim of a lynch 
mob in William Wellman's "'The Ox-Bow Incident." 
</P>
<P>
 BREAKTHROUGH FILM: "Laura" (1944): Otto Preminger's classic romantic-mystery 
stars Andrews as a sexy, hard-boiled and vulnerable Los Angeles police 
detective. His character tries to solve the suspected murder of a beautiful 
young woman named Laura (Gene Tierney) and finds himself falling in love with 
her as he digs deeper into the case. 
</P>
<P>
 SET YOUR VCRs FOR: "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946): Andrews gives his 
best performance in the multiple Oscar-winning film as a disillusioned World 
War II veteran who has a difficult time coping with civilian life.

<P>
 "Boomerang!" (1947): Andrews plays a determined prosecuting attorney trying to 
find a pastor's murderer in an excellent semi-documentary mystery directed by 
Elia Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where the Sidewalk Ends" (1950): Andrews teamed up again with Preminger and 
Tierney for an inspired film noir . Andrews plays a violent New York police 
detective who accidentally commits a murder while investigating a murder. He 
then desperately tries to cover up his own crime while continuing on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Foolish Heart" (1950): Andrews is at his romantic best as a soldier whose 
romance with a young woman (Susan Hayward) ends in tragedy. John Garfield 
(1913-1952) 
</P>
<P>
 CHARACTERISTICS: Brooding, sexy, violent, rebellious, carried a huge chip on 
shoulder but had a vulnerable and sensitive side. Paved the way for Montgomery 
Clift, Marlon Brando and James Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 QUOTABLE: "Whaddya going to do, kill me? Everybody dies!" -- Garfield in 
1947's "Body and Soul." 
</P>
<P>
 BEGINNINGS: Just like many of his characters, Garfield grew up tough and poor 
on New York's Lower Eastside. As a teen-ager, he won a debating contest 
sponsored by the New York Times and received a scholarship to attend the 
Oupsenskaya Drama School. In the '30s, he joined Broadway's famed Group Theatre 
where he caught the eye of Warner Bros., which brought him to Hollywood in 
1938. 
</P>
<P>
 BREAKTHROUGH FILM: "Four Daughters" '(1938): Garfield made his film debut and 
received a best supporting Oscar nomination for his mesmerizing turn as Mickey 
Borden, an embittered down-on-his-luck composer who marries the fresh-faced 
daughter (Priscilla Lane) of a widower musician (Claude Rains). 
</P>
<P>
 SET YOUR VCRs FOR: "Pride of the Marines" (1945): Garfield gives a rugged, 
multilayered performance as World War II hero Al Schmid, who was blinded by a 
grenade during a Japanese attack. He returns home angry and bitter, fearing 
rejection by his wife (Eleanor Parker). 
</P>
<P>
 "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (1946): Garfield and Lana Turner sizzle as 
the murderous illicit lovers in this red-hot version of James M. Cain's tale of 
love, lust, and revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Humoresque" (1946): Garfield plays as a tough guy from the slums who becomes 
a famed violinist and fiddles around with a wealthy, suicidal society matron 
(Joan Crawford). 
</P>
<P>
 "Body and Soul" (1947): Garfield received a best actor Oscar nomination for 
his greatest performance as Charlie Davis, a slum kid with -- what else? -- a 
chip on his shoulder who becomes a championship boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Force of Evil" (1948): Engrossing cult film finds Garfield in fine form as a 
hard-as-nails, self-centered attorney, working for Wall Street and a racketeer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Breaking Point" (1950): Garfield gives a finely etched performance as a 
skipper so desperate for money that he agrees to take on illegal cargo and 
nearly loses his family and life in the process. Based on Ernest Hemingway's 
"To Have and Have Not." Robert Ryan (1909-1973) 
</P>
<P>
 CHARACTERISTICS: Dependable, versatile leading man and character actor; played 
everything from heroes to villains to psychopaths. 
</P>
<P>
 BEGINNINGS: Ryan attended Dartmouth College, where he held the college 
heavyweight boxing championship for four years. After graduating he worked in a 
variety of jobs, including male model and ship stoker. He received his 
theatrical training in Hollywood at the Max Reinhardt Theatre Workshop and made 
his stage debut in 1939. The following year, Ryan appeared in his first film, 
"Queen of the Mob." After he starred on Broadway in 1941 in Clifford Odets' 
"Clash by Night," RKO signed him to a film contract. He made a few films for 
RKO, including 1943's "Tender Comrade," then he left Hollywood to serve as a 
Marine in World War II. His career took off after he returned home. 
</P>
<P>
 BREAKTHROUGH FILM: "Crossfire" (1947): Ryan received a best supporting Oscar 
nomination for his ruthless, intense portrayal of an anti-Semitic soldier who 
murders a Jewish man. 
</P>
<P>
 SET YOUR VCRs FOR: "Act of Violence" (1949): Ryan plays a mentally and 
physically scarred World War II veteran stalking his superior officer (Van 
Heflin) who betrayed his men while they were POWs in a German camp. Fred 
Zinnemann directed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Set-Up" (1949): Ryan gives a sensitive and sympathetic portrait of a 
washed-up boxer who refuses to give up the game or give in to gangsters in 
Robert Wise's stark boxing drama.

who falls for a blind woman (Ida Lupino) while on a murder case in Nicholas 
Ray's superior crime drama. 
</P>
<P>

Claggart, who tortures angelic young sailor Billy Budd (Terence Stamp) in Peter 
Ustinov's adaptation of Herman Melville's allegorical novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wild Bunch" (1969): Ryan is a standout in Sam Peckinpah's landmark 
Western as outlaw William Holden's old friend who is leading a posse of bounty 
hunters tracking Holden and his gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Iceman Cometh" (1973): Ryan gives a soulful performance as the 
emotionally haunted radical Larry Slade in John Frankenheimer's ambitious 
version of O'Neill's four-hour drama about a group of barflies in a saloon, 
circa 1912. Margaret Sullavan (1911-1960) 
</P>
<P>
 CHARACTERISTICS: Charming, vulnerable, sensitive, subtle, willowy, equally 
adept at comedy and drama, distinctive husky voice. 
</P>
<P>
 BEGINNINGS: Sullavan studied dance and drama in childhood and made her 
professional debut on stage at 17. She appeared on Broadway three years later 
and in 1933 was put under contract by Universal. 
</P>
<P>
 BREAKTHROUGH FILM: "The Good Fairy" (1935): Sullavan is all wide-eyed 
innocence as a movie usher who tries to be a "good fairy" to a struggling 
attorney (Herbert Marshall) while being pursued by a wealthy older man. 
Directed by William Wyler, who was briefly married to Sullavan. 
</P>
<P>
 SET YOUR VCRs FOR: "The Moon's Our Home" (1936): Lightweight comedy is worth 
watching for the pairing of Sullavan with another former husband, Henry Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three Comrades" (1938): Sullavan received a best actress Oscar nomination for 
her inspired portrayal of a frail but vibrant woman living in post-World War I 
Germany and the three men in her life (Robert Taylor, Robert Young, Franchot 
Tone). Co-written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Shop Around the Corner" (1940): Sullavan and James Stewart are delightful 
in Ernst Lubitsch's romantic souffle about two squabbling store clerks who 
don't know they are romantic pen pals. Later became the basis for the musical 
"She Loves Me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Back Street" (1941): Sullavan and Charles Boyer bring Fannie Hurst's 
tear-jerker to life. Sullavan plays a smart, beautiful woman who has a 
decades-long affair with a married man. Rosalind Russell (1908-1976) 
</P>
<P>
 CHARACTERISTICS: Smart, witty, sophisticated, versatile. 
</P>
<P>
 BEGINNINGS: After beginning her career in the theater in the late '20s, 
Russell made her film debut in 1934 in the MGM drama "Evelyn Prentice." For 
several years she was seen primarily in dramas, but got a chance to show her 
comedic side in 1939's "The Women." 
</P>
<P>
 BREAKTHROUGH FILM: "His Girl Friday" (1940): Russell found her niche as one of 
the best comedic actresses around in this fast-paced remake of "The Front 
Page." Russell plays savvy reporter Hildy Johnson who wants to leave the grind 
of newspaper work and settle down, but her editor and ex-husband (Cary Grant) 
won't let her. Russell is a marvel of quick delivery and crack timing, the 
perfect verbal sparring partner for Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 SET YOUR VCRs FOR: "My Sister Eileen" (1942): Russell received her first best 
actress Oscar nomination for her energetic performance as a career-minded woman 
from Ohio who moves with her younger sister Eileen (Janet Blair) to a tiny 
Greenwich Village apartment. A decade later, Russell starred in the Broadway 
musical adaptation, "Wonderful Town." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sister Kenny" (1946): Russell received her second Oscar nomination for her 
forceful dramatic turn as the famed Australian nurse who discovered how to 
treat polio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mourning Becomes Electra" (1947): Russell lost the best actress Oscar to 
Loretta Young in "The Farmer's Daughter" by just a few votes for her impressive 
work as the revengeful, murderous daughter of a Civil War veteran in Eugene 
O'Neill's American version of Greek tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Auntie Mame" (1958): Russell received her fourth and final Oscar nomination 
for her vivacious performance as one of life's free spirits in this popular 
adaptation of the hit Broadway comedy in which she also starred.

EXERCISE WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How exciting for those of us in the health and fitness industry to read about 
new products relative to fitness in such a widely read magazine ("Stretching 
It," Style, June 26). However, as a certified instructor and a degreed exercise 
physiologist with the Aerobics and Fitness Association of America, I must point 
out that the pregnant participant pictured in the article is shown performing a 
contraindicated exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 In the position shown, the cervical vertebrae and disc are under far too much 
pressure, which could lead to injury to the neck, especially considering the 
added weight of the baby. A more experienced individual may be able to perform 
the exercise without risk, but it is always best to be careful about the 
message that is sent to readers. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd hate to see a less-experienced pregnant woman attempt this position and 
ultimately injure herself or, worse, her unborn baby.

 What an ugly display of locker-room banter, or as I refer to it, verbal abuse 
("Playing Hardball," by Pat Jordan, June 26). 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Women have some disadvantages when competing against men . . . which are 
inherent in physiology.''The girls in Thunder Bay are the easiest lay.' 'It's 
like they used us . . . now they don't need us.' 'We gotta kill these bitches.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 What blatantly sexist hate-mongering against female players! Noting that sort 
of mentality, I can better understand the likes of Mike Tyson -- and, dare I 
say, perhaps O. J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Will someone train these animals to respect women and to give women the 
dignity they deserve as human beings -- and do it before we say, "Play ball!"

 Pat Jordan is mistaken that before Phil Niekro there had never been a starting 
pitcher who was successful solely with the knuckleball. Less than 50 years ago, 
the majors' first winning knuckleballer, Emil (Dutch) Leonard, pitched well 
into his 40s for the old Washington Senators, a team that never had much 
success.

 Jordan replies: Leonard threw knuckleballs but also got batters out with his 
fastball and curve. It wasn't uncommon during the '20s, '30s and '40s for 
pitchers to use the knuckleball as an off-speed pitch. Niekro, however, was the 
first successful starting pitcher to rely almost solely on the knuckleball, 
which he threw about 99% of the time.

SHADOWS IN A NEW LAND; THE MARKS OF BIRTH, BY PABLO MEDINA (FARRAR, STRAUS AND 
GIROUX: $22; 276 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Enrique Fernandez, Enrique Fernandez is a columnist for the New York Daily 
News. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Critics of mainstream publishing's attitude toward minority authors have long 
pointed out that the industry is interested only in ethnic autobiography. 
Certainly this genre makes up a large part of what is best in the growing body 
of Latino literature, from Rudolfo Anaya's "Bless Me, Ultima" and Richard 
Rodriguez's "Hunger of Memory" to Sandra Cisneros' "The House on Mango Street" 
and Julia Alvarez's "How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accent." 
</P>
<P>
 But given the rapid proliferation of this genre, one can't help but wonder 
upon opening this latest installment: Can yet another Latino coming-of-age 
novel possibly be fresh? 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Pablo Medina's "The Marks of Birth" seems to tell a tale common to 
all of these more or less autobiographical first novels: a young person born 
abroad migrates with his family to the U.S. -- or is born within a Latino 
family that is "abroad" even within America's shores. Here he wrestles with the 
alienation of having been born and raised within a foreign culture and in the 
process learns to be an American with a difference. A Latino American. Grouped 
together, these books could compose a saga titled "Birth of a Subnation." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Medina's novel tells this same story, his style is altogether 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Medina's narrative lacks the candor found in other Latino 
fictionalized autobiographies, in which one can feel the author palpitating 
right under the surface of the discourse. "Marks of Birth" puts a greater 
distance between author and text, and, therefore, between author and reader. 
One does not get to know Medina through his Anton, a character who remains a 
mystery until the very end. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Anton is not the kind of character one is meant to know in the sense 
one knows the protagonists of realist fiction. He has not been brought to life 
with psychological detail; instead, he wears a birthmark shaped like some kind 
of map that flares up in moments of crisis. To find Anton's literary 
antecedents one should look to the heroes of the medieval romance or Baroque 
fable rather than to the fleshed-out characters of the 19th-Century novel. 
However, he is the heir to a kind of coming-of-age narrative that flourished in 
Romantic and realist European fiction and which would become firmly rooted in 
Medina's native soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban literature did not invent the Bildungsroman -- to call the coming-of-age 
tale by its more distinguished name. It is a genre that traces its origins to a 
variety of early forms of narratives, including the Spanish picaresque novel, 
and that, once realism played itself out, became emblematic of European 
modernism. Only two Old World titles need be mentioned: "Portrait of the Artist 
as a Young Man" and "Remembrances of Things Past." Although to place Medina's 
novel in its proper context, one needs to think also of two Cuban titles: Alejo 
Carpentier's "Explosion in a Cathedral" and Jose Lezama Lima's "Paradiso." 
</P>
<P>
 Both of these books, written by authors in the full bloom of their mature 
artistic powers, not by youths new to the writing profession, place their 
protagonists in the heart of bourgeois families that are nearly self-contained 
micro-universes, the kind of setting that is rich soil for the ripening of 
complex, observant, eclectic personalities. And in both, the protagonist's 
journey toward self-knowledge moves in counterpoint through both familial and 
social history. Typically, Carpentier, though majestically at ease with 
cultural history, is more fascinated with the political side of social history, 
while Lezama, the great aesthete, is more engaged with the process of culture, 
a kind of a historical history. 
</P>
<P>
 In Medina's tale, the history that knocks against the slow, rich unfolding of 
familial and personal growth is definitely political -- more precisely, the 
politics of the Cuban revolution. But Medina has chosen to take an almost 
anti-historical tack by not calling the most important event in his native 
country's young life -- Cuba is barely a century-old republic -- by its name. 
Cuba itself is called "the island," while its revolutionary leader is named 
"Campeon." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a happy artistic maneuver, for it drains the Cuban Revolution of its 
excessive power of signifying and allows the protagonist to wrestle with 
History with a capital H, not just the Revolution with a capital R, which is, 
after all, but a small chunk of History. Medina cuts the Cuban Revolution down 
to size and by doing so takes History by storm, ripping it from the arrogant 
hands of its epic manipulators and putting it at the service of culture. 
</P>
<P>
 And what simple truths a novelist can tell once he has divorced political 
"reality." Here is Felicia, the family matriarch, evaluating her "island's" 
revolutionary leader: "The worst thing that could happen to a country was for a 
rich boy to take it over in the name of the oppressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all is that a novelist can do directly what a historian must labor 
endlessly to elucidate. The books that analyze the phenomenon of Cuban Miami 
add up by now to an American sub-genre, yet Medina in just two paragraphs gets 
it absolutely right: 
</P>
<P>
 "Miami in those days was a bleached bone stretching west and south from 
Biscayne Bay, as if it wanted nothing to do with the sea. Its topography, or 
lack of it, its square, dull houses, and the grid layout of its streets were 
perfectly suited for exiles who did not want to be distracted from the past and 
from the delectable contemplation of their memories. They made sure that 
whatever life they had in the new land was a mere shadow of what they had left 
behind. They bought used cars and fixed them superficially so that they were 
constantly breaking down. If it wasn't the carburetor, it was the alternator; 
if it wasn't the alternator, it was the valves. 'The Studebakers and Packards 
of the Island,' they would reminisce. 'Those were real cars.' Their houses, 
too, were weak, unstable things. Any strong wind would call their permanence 
into question. 'Nothing,' they would say, surveying the ruins after a 
hurricane, 'can compare to the buildings of our land. They were built to last. 
Even the trees here topple over as if they had no roots.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth was that nothing and no one in Miami had any roots. The city was 
built on water -- or more accurately, the water had been drained from the land 
so that the city could exist. Left to its own devices, the water would seep 
back in and the land would revert to swamp and mangrove. Exiles were the 
perfect denizens of such a place, and they were making Miami, with the ocean on 
one side and the Everglades on the other, a fervent distorted image of the 
larger, more permanent island they had left behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Felicia's move to Miami caps the family's exile from the island; like most 
Cuban families they leave their country individually or in nuclear family units 
only to be reunited in the United States and then be dispersed again by this 
country's centrifugal power. The grand bourgeois family -- although Felicia's 
is grand in depth and complexity, not wealth -- is not possible here. Thus, the 
cultivation of a personality like Anton is not possible either. Which is to say 
that to reinvent the Cuban Bildungsroman in exile is to do war with the 
impossible, and, in Medina's case, to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Anton tries to be American. He goes about it with the self-contained patience 
of a hero in a Puritan morality tale. And he succeeds to a certain extent. 
Toward the end of the book, Anton has become a lean spirit, cultivating his 
garden (one of the many acknowledgments that Medina grounds his tale in fables 
like Voltaire's "Candide") and living a marital life that borders on 
asceticism. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, his heart is cloven by love for two kinds of aesthetes: his American 
wife, whose singing of the Shaker hymn "Tis a Gift to Be Simple" labels her as 
a Protestant Everywoman, and a Cuban -- er, "islander" -- of austere political 
vision whose dedication to overthrowing Castro -- er, "Campeon" -- leads Anton 
to join a paramilitary group training to invade the island. 
</P>
<P>
 The aesthetic remove of Medina's art applies to every aspect of island 
politics, and he is no more sympathetic toward the anti-Campeon factions than 
toward the island's triumphant revolutionaries. All politics, in fact, appears 
as a dangerous mixture of bluster and betrayal, with only one character, the 
enigmatic Spaniard Jose Maria Unanue, standing for a kind of political 
integrity. Fittingly, he is as disillusioned as he is true, a perfect stoic, 
although how he manages to know and accomplish so much -- he sneaks Anton and 
his parents out of the island -- shrouds him in a veil of suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Maria, in a way, is a kind of father figure, as is Anton's uncle Antonio 
-- Anton's true father is rather ineffectual. Antonio, charming and clever as 
he is, is a man of action, albeit failed political action, not letters, and his 
nephew is not destined to become a writer -- it's grandmother Felicia who by 
writing Anton's biography becomes a kind of literary fairy godmother within the 
novel. Anton too must act, must do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 That the right thing is an absurd thing is fitting in this novel in which 
political action is always absurd or has absurd consequences: Medina reduces 
his native country's revolution to a grand absurdity. In the end, Anton is 
ready. The island is ready. The family's evolution had led him to the move he 
must make. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Marks of Birth" is a gloriously reactionary piece of fiction in which 
history lacks the power of family, politics pales before imagination, 
revolution is but one more trial on the road to redemption, and dialectics can 
be flipped over like a turtle by a personality that comes to understand 
destiny.

 A Woodstock diary for 1994: 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 12, 2 p.m.: First class from LAX to Kennedy is filled. Flight attendants 
in tie-dyed scarves greet the pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
 3:15 p.m.: Attendants discover all 18 special-order fruit and yogurt plates 
have been inadvertently loaded on flight to Dusseldorf. All they have is beef 
Wellington. No one eats; everyone drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 5:10 p.m.: The in-flight movie begins -- "Getting Straight," a radical-chic 
1970 film with Elliott Gould and Candice Bergen. Gould is, by coincidence, 
seated in Row 4. One person asks what it was like kissing Murphy Brown. Three 
others ask what it was like being married to Barbra Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
 6:18 p.m.: Quarreling erupts as several passengers claim attendance at 
Woodstock I and challenge others to prove theirs. "You all make me sick," rages 
one. "It's like everybody saying they voted for McGovern." 
</P>
<P>
 6:25 p.m.: Everyone confesses they were never at Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 7:45 p.m.: Limo pools reach the Plaza. Waiting in each room is a note about 
Tiffany's commemorative Woodstock jewelry: "69" and "94" worked into a peace 
symbol. The pendant, in silver, $295; in gold, $1,195. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 13, 9 a.m.: In the town car, someone asks the driver to crank the air 
conditioning. Someone else asks for the car's manual first. "It's OK," he says 
at last. "The AC is non-CFC." 
</P>
<P>
 11 a.m.: Daughter whines that she'll miss "Beverly Hills, 90210" because 
father can't program VCR right. He says he's brought her 3,000 miles and paid 
$135 for her to hear the Red Hot Chili Peppers and learn a little damn history. 
She says she can hear them at home without having to camp out with her lame 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 12:30 p.m.: They spot the eight-foot-tall security-patrolled fence marking the 
festival grounds in Saugerties. Inside at the Eco-Village, they check out the 
fund-raising PAC for Country Joe's possible run for Berkeley City Council, a 
"Dunk Limbaugh" baseball toss and an herbal check-your-cholesterol booth. 
</P>
<P>
 2 p.m.: Carlos Santana plays "The Star-Spangled Banner" on Jimi Hendrix's 
Stratocaster. Thousands weep; thousands more try to follow the lyrics in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 2:08 p.m.: Country Joe takes the vast stage. "Gimme an F!" he hollers. "Gimme 
a U!" A woman shouts angrily: "You can't say that -- my kids are here!" Joe 
ponders. Then, ". . . Gimme a T! Gimme another U! Gimme an R! Gimme an E! 
What's that spell?" No one figures it out. "Future!" he hollers. "It spells 
future!" 
</P>
<P>
 4:51 p.m.: Two women walk down to see the famous creek. "No nude swimming," 
the signs say. "Thank God," they think. 
</P>
<P>
 8:07 p.m.: Twilight falls. It is a magical moment. "Everybody, light a match 
and hold it up!" calls Dave Crosby. No one has a match; everyone has stopped 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 14, 8 a.m.: A fast-food chain has donated coffee and meatless patties on 
muffins in exchange for product placement in the movie. "What we have in mind," 
read the food wrappers, plagiarizing 1969, "is McBreakfast in bed for 400,000." 
</P>
<P>
 8:05 a.m.: Joan Baez urges a hunger strike in support of political prisoners 
in Lompoc. Thousands agree and lay aside the McBreakfasts. 
</P>
<P>
 11:17 a.m.: Lost-and-found tent announces it has nine cellular phones, a 
three-iron and a Rolex inscribed "Still Feelin' Groovy." 
</P>
<P>
 1:35 p.m.: Orderlies rush by with stretchers. "Coming through! Bad acid!" 
Later, after doses of Maalox, the victims are doing fine. 
</P>
<P>
 4 p.m.: President Clinton 'copters in to play sax for Joe Cocker. A speaker 
tower topples, sending debris into the crowd. From the downstage mike, Clinton 
says feelingly: "I share your pain." 
</P>
<P>
 7:17 p.m.: As Nine Inch Nails comes onstage, the Californians leave to catch 
the red-eye. "It's a good thing John Lennon is dead," sighs one, "because this 
would have killed him." 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 15, 8:02 a.m.: The first liability lawsuit is filed in Ulster County 
Court.

 TRUE NORTH by Jill Ker Conway. (Knopf: $23 : 246 pp.) Here is another chapter 
in Jill Ker Conway's life, which seems to move ever forward with a determined 
stride.For those who did not read "The Road From Coorain," it may not be 
immediately clear that Conway is running from a childhood that eerily resembles 
Manon's in the book and film "Jean de Florette" and "Manon of the Spring." As a 
child in the Australian outback, Conway watched her beloved father fold from 
the backbreaking labor of trying to carve a living in that harsh environment, 
and her mother turn into a willful, dependent neurotic. She is also running 
from "a culture actively hostile to women, and from the constraints of a 
still-colonial society." A scholar first and last, in 1960 Conway got a 
Fulbright scholarship and went to Harvard to get a doctorate in history. At 
Harvard, she met her husband, John Conway, a scholar and also a sufferer of 
deep depression. Conway's own nature is so buoyant, so grateful and capable, 
that it is easy to imagine her providing the emotional structure for their 
relationship. They both obtain teaching positions in Canada, where she is 
eventually made vice president of the University of Toronto, and then on to 
president of Smith College in Massachusetts. Conway's contribution at each of 
these places is her devotion to women's studies, and to equality for women in 
the academic environment. She is very strong, unfettered in her youthful 
ambition by romantic attachments, and clearly one of the first of a generation 
of woman that had to fight every step of the way. When things got really bad, 
Conway would go to Elizabeth Arden's, have a few martinis and put some 
"intellectual distance between myself and my crisis." Sigh.

 TEMPLE by George Dennison. (Steerforth Press: $19.50; 192 pp.) George Dennison 
was that woolly mastodon of the genus writer: a career purist who stuck to his 
guns despite a lifelong lack of substantial recognition.A few of his plays were 
produced "by friends in lofts," some essays in literary journals and a book on 
the free school movement, "The Lives of Children" (1969). That same year, he 
moved with his wife and the first of two children to the very rural town of 
Temple, Me. He continued to write and paint and do odd jobs until his death in 
1987. He kept notebooks in which he recorded the seasons with wholehearted 
delight: "Suddenly the air is dancing with snowflakes and the wind is blowing 
hard. But now a patch of blue opens directly west, as if a bright blue wedge 
had been driven into the buttermilk squall." He also began to record the wit 
and wisdom of his neighbors and several old Mainers at a nearby nursing home, 
like Oiva: "I don't have any children. I been shootin' blanks all my life," and 
Dana Hamlin, born in 1880: "I hauled milk for 60 years. That's a long time. I 
believe I've gone more miles on a milk route than any man in the world," and 
the blind man, aged 80, a farmer all his life: "Get a glass up there on the 
shelf. This won't kill yeh. Not what made me blind. No, the woods did that." 
These are memorable characters, and Dennison, himself a disappointed man, sees 
them from all sides: "Dullness, narrowness of life, appalling sameness of days, 
disappointment, desperation, traces of bitterness, stirrings of a rage that 
never really breaks the surface. . . ."

FOCUS; WHAT HAPPENED IN ROSWELL, N.M.?; SHOWTIME FILM RE-EXAMINES ACCOUNTS OF 
1947 UFO LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BART MILLS, Bart Mills is a free-lance writer based in Southern California.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When you're making a film about extraterrestrials visiting Earth, rule No. 1 
is not to deny their existence -- or the vehicles they arrived in. 
</P>
<P>
 So Kyle MacLachlan, starring in "Roswell," Showtime's drama about a possible 
UFO crash in 1947, is careful not to disrespect anyone's faith: "I personally 
have never seen a flying saucer," he says gravely. "There are people who have 
seen something. Obviously, something has moved them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Roswell," premiering Sunday, relates the true story of an incident near the 
town of Roswell, N.M., also known as the birthplace of Demi Moore. A sheep 
rancher found some strange debris and called the sheriff in Roswell, who called 
the Air Force base. Officers from the base talked to the people and checked out 
the debris. Lacking any other explanation, the base commander put out a press 
release saying a flying saucer had crashed. Immediately afterward the Pentagon 
declared the press release inoperative and clamped the lid down on further 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, the officer played by MacLachlan 30 years later decides to check 
into people's memories of what happened. Needless to say, he finds that their 
stories conflict. Was there a cover-up? Does the United States Air Force know 
all about extraterrestrials but won't tell us what it knows? 
</P>
<P>
 MacLachlan says he believes the question of the existence of UFOs "is 
incidental." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the debris came from some hush-hush military experiment and that's why 
they removed all the traces of the crash. Maybe they withdrew the press release 
about finding a flying saucer so the military wouldn't be a laughing stock. It 
does strike me as odd that such an effort was made. There's no denying that 
those people saw something." 
</P>
<P>
 The man conveying these judicious thoughts appears to be a stooping, 
gray-haired retiree, but it's actually MacLachlan, 34, in makeup to play scenes 
set at an Air Force squadron reunion in 1977. The "Roswell" unit has finished 
shooting on the actual "UFO crash site" and is now filming at an airfield in 
Van Nuys, in the shadow of one of the few World War II B-29s still flyable. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Sheen is also here, playing a man who crashes the reunion to stir up 
MacLachlan's inquiries about the long-buried Roswell incident. Sheen has his 
own way of discussing UFOs: "I wish it were true. I really do. I'd love there 
to be ETs -- as long as they were better creatures than we are." 
</P>
<P>
 For many people, the questions surrounding ETs and UFOs were resolved by 
Steven Spielberg in his movies "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "E.T. 
The Extraterrestrial." He showed that ETs and UFOs are no more than wonderful 
fantasies. For a few, however, the question is urgent and real. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these people is "Roswell" executive producer Paul Davids, who stands 
near the unit's makeup trailer, where a tabloid headline taped to the door 
alleges: "UFO Aliens Sold in Pet Shop -- They're Mistaken for Hamsters." 
</P>
<P>
 Davids, a Princeton University graduate, says, "The story has been denied, and 
we include those official denials in the film. But there are many credible 
people in the military who believe that Roswell marked mankind's discovery of 
extraterrestrial life." With only the slightest encouragement, Davids will 
mention other strange UFO incidents. "There was the incident in Washington, 
D.C., in 1952. There were sightings all over the capital, confirmed by radar. 
Within a few days, everything was denied." 
</P>
<P>
 His Roswell, N.M., theory is that aliens were checking out the Earth's atomic 
potential. "Three bombs had recently been tested nearby, one just 70 miles 
away. If there was intelligent life watching, that blast could have been seen 
from Mars." 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation, though, is far from MacLachlan's mind. "The answer doesn't matter 
to me. I'm interested in this character, who makes an effort to rediscover 
something he had denied and lost. When he was told to forget about it, he did, 
and he didn't wake up for 30 years. Then he discovered that the government 
wasn't the benevolent institution he thought it was." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to make the parallel between MacLachlan's character in "Roswell" and 
his Agent Cooper character in the cult series "Twin Peaks." Agent Cooper 
investigated strange goings-on in the Northern woods, and this character 
investigates strange things in the Western desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do tend to play characters who go through experiences that cause them to 
have a transformation," he agrees. Why? "Because I'm available," he jokes. When 
he embarked on "Roswell," he had just returned from Prague, where he played 
Franz Kafka's Joseph K. in "The Trial," another story of a man seeking to 
penetrate a cosmic mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said when I finished 'The Trial' that I've had it. ... Yet here I am. It's 
like Al Pacino, always being pulled back to play gangsters. If you do something 
well and the audience likes you doing it, when you want to move on, they don't 
allow you to." 
</P>
<P>
 "Roswell" premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. on Showtime.

 THE AMERICAN WOMAN IN THE CHINESE HAT by Carole Maso. (Dalkey Archive: $19.95; 
199 pp.) Nobody Move. Vita Sackville West is not dead.She is alive and well and 
living in the body of Carole Maso in New York. Sex and travel, the literary 
genre best loved by cafe rats and jobless creative types the world over, is 
almost dead but still kicking. It just gets harder and harder to imagine that 
tender-wristed people can still have a poetic life on the high-wire between 
nervous collapse and romantic passion. Or that they have delirious sex with 
people they meet on trains (and in cafes and in bookstores and on beaches and . 
. . hmmmm). Maso's obsessed heroine, living in exile (Paris, where else?) has 
just been abandoned by her lover, the woman of her dreams, who can no longer 
"be a slave to her genius." Not to mention all the cheating. For the next few 
weeks she cries, she writes letters and she "meets" people, especially a 
beautiful young man named Lucien. They don't talk too much, but they have a 
wonderful time in bed. "I realize that I am living in the last moments before I 
become resigned to everything forever," she writes. And of course, just when 
they are really starting to fall in love, someone must leave. It's a book that 
begins and ends in a flash of light, with a clatter of voices all speaking 
French. In between is silence, a glass of wine, a knife, a dark room and a lot 
of passion.

PALM LATITUDES: THINGS TO COME; SEE YOU ON THE HOLODECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By Jane Spiller

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight months ago, advertising guru Jay Chiat reopened the doors to his 
$16-million Venice headquarters, a Frank Gehry-designed building whose focal 
point is a three-story binocular-shaped entrance. Architects Lubowicki & Lanier 
had gutted the interior and designed an open plan with a clubhouse as a social 
center equipped with pool table, chessboard and punching bags bearing 
management's faces. There's a library, project rooms, lounge areas, even a 
concierge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like fun? Sure, except most of the employees can't actually work there. 
The Chiat/Day office has gone virtual. Workers, if they need to come in, pick 
up their computers, phones and beepers at the "company store" as they arrive. 
They plug in their laptops at shared carrels or at other connections scattered 
around the building. But all in all, Chiat/Day execs would just as soon they 
stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
 There are certainly many benefits to freeing the worker from the office -- 
less commuting time, family-friendly schedules, and telecommuting was a boon in 
the weeks following the Northridge earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 But what's it like to be on the compu-cutting edge? Management made it clear 
they wanted to "control" the coverage, but employees on their way in and out of 
the building were happy to talk (until a security guard came out with the 
message that Chiat/Day didn't want employees interviewed). 
</P>
<P>
 Fun is part of the plan. Improving on IBM's New Jersey virtual office, which 
consists mainly of a lot of anonymous cubicles, the Chiat/Day architects tried 
to make up for the loss of individual work spaces by creating recreational 
areas and furnishings that are playful. "They put kind of funky stuff in," says 
one man, "like tilt-a-whirl things from a county fair, to put you in a 
different environment than in an office." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone thinks the traditional office is so bad, though. "The paperless 
office is a little hard to handle," one woman says -- everything is now 
supposed to be filed electronically. "Everyone likes to keep paper, so you 
carry your papers, PowerBook computer on one shoulder, phone clipped on you, 
and everyone's backpacks are getting bigger and bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Many employees grumble that the lack of a personal work space means no family 
photos or potted plants. "All you really own is a locker and an extension 
number," says one staffer. "There's no place to call home," says another. "You 
just sort of roam." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the privacy issue. "You see people hiding off in corners, trying 
to make a private phone call," says a woman employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Others refuse to sweat the small stuff. "For a younger associate, it might be 
like working in a vacuum," says another staffer. "But it gives us the 
flexibility to work at our clients' offices and gives us a lot more face time 
over there. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when I work at home," he says, "I usually work longer. I get up, and 
instead of taking a shower and getting dressed, I immediately get to work. I 
live on the beach; I put my computer on the porch, I have my phone out there 
and I'm getting a suntan while I'm working." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, he admits, there's a price for tan maintenance: "The closeness of 
the social interaction kind of goes away," he says. So when he wants to chat at 
Chiat/Day, "I stop in. There's a clubhouse with bagels and coffee in the 
morning, and popcorn and lemonade in the afternoon. It's kind of fun, and I 
just read that we're going to have a party the last Friday of every month." 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the most important step in a project like this is the desire to 
change," says a technical administrator. "A few people left. They couldn't 
adapt. Chiat's genius is to see that change is really necessary. It stirs up 
the creative juices. People being upset is part of the whole process. People 
are going to get angry. You look at some of Picasso's works, you think that he 
was always happy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for those who get uptight by the creativity-through-stress ethic, 
massages are available twice a week. For those, you have to come in. Jane

 BONNARD by Nicholas Watkins. (Phaidon: $49.95) Pierre Bonnard (1867-1947) 
began his career as a graphic artist, creating many memorable and famous 
posters and advertisements like the one above ("La Petite Blanchisseuse," 
1896), or the well-known "France-Champagne" (with poem), or "Femmes au jardin," 
1891 (with text, above).But something snapped. In 1900 he began spending more 
and more time in the country, with Marthe, his companion and later wife. He 
painted rooms, and views from rooms, and cupboards, and Marthe. Marthe in the 
bath, Marthe getting into the bath, Marthe sitting at the table. The subjects, 
like his daily diary entries, are simple: "Beau," "Beau Temps," "Pluie le 
Matin," but his colors are warm and explosive and harmonious. When you become 
familiar with his paintings, you think of his colors when you look at rooms. 
More than anything, you want to live in them and look out. Susan Reynolds

<P>
 Don't talk to me of love. I've had an earful

 Do you mind if we do not go to the Louvre,

 The little bit of Paris in our view.

<P>
 Am I embarrassing you? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm in Paris with you.

 GENDER & DISCOURSE by Deborah Tannen. (Oxford: $19.95; 203 pp.) Deborah Tannen 
is the archangel of clarity. Her best-selling book, "You Just Don't Understand: 
Women and Men in Conversation," has become part of the way we think about 
relationships, and has saved countless thousands from the horrors and joys and 
expenses of marital therapy ("Now Bob, tell Susie that you love her.").She 
makes the art of listening less scary and more fascinating than any other 
sociolinguist or therapist writing today, and as a reward she is cited and 
leaned on in almost every book on how to live with other people. "Gender & 
Discourse" is a funny little book, essentially the background material for "You 
Just Don't Understand," all the footnotes and references and methodology that 
Tannen couldn't sneak into a bestseller. And still, still it is free of all but 
the most pleasing, common-sensical jargon (phrases such as "discourse analysis" 
and "topical cohesion" -- keeping a conversation meaningful by paying 
attention). This book also gives Tannen a chance to address the accusation that 
by exploring the style differences in communication between men and women as 
"cultural differences," she implied that "men do not dominate women, but only 
misunderstand them." In fact, one of her central points was that "women's and 
men's characteristic styles often put women in a subordinate position in 
interactions with men." But these claims are not made defensively or at any 
great length. Tannen doesn't need to ramble on. She just says what she means.

 BREAKFAST AT THE VICTORY: The Mysticism of Ordinary Experience by James Carse. 
(HarperCollins: $21 ; 232 pp.) These are a series of gracefully written essays 
on the varieties of mystical experience.They almost always begin with the small 
and immediate, and end with the enormous yet intimate. They are very specific 
to the life and experience of James Carse, director of religious studies at New 
York University since 1966, so from time to time one feels forgotten, left 
behind, but they succeed in teaching a kind of vision and appreciation for the 
otherwise regular and humdrum. In several, Carse's recently deceased and much 
beloved wife Alice plays a role, usually that of teacher, and in fact, one 
senses that it is the sheer pain of loss that has taught Carse to look over his 
shoulder or down at the street.

 TEMPORARY HOMELANDS by Alison Hawthorne Deming. (Mercury House: $18 ; 208 pp.) 
The first half of this book is set in one of Deming's chosen homes, an island 
in Maine, "fifteen miles long and five wide."It helps to be able to picture the 
landscape, to know what it feels like to take the ferry out with all your 
necessities and return regretfully home with only half of them after a 
temporary time. Indeed, there may be several words in here unfamiliar to 
Westerners: sog, dulse, weir and wrinklers (periwinkle pickers) to name a few. 
Many of the islanders make their living by the weirs, fishing for herring, an 
ancient method "handed down by the Micmac and Passamaquoddy." One islander has 
known 58 men lost at sea. Deming's descriptions of the wildlife around her are 
detailed and unsentimental -- she is a nice blend of real rural Maine, 
historian, anthropologist and hippie idealist. She had a child at 17, a 
daughter she raised alone, but this is mentioned only in passing. The last 
essays on nature and poetry I find more self conscious and less charming than 
the first few chapters, which combine Deming's observations of New England and 
the Southwest with fascinating random bits of history from these areas; namely 
the things that one would expect to stay in the soil -- like witchcraft and 
Anasazi rituals.

 CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION by Alan M. Dershowits (Berkley: $10; 398 pp.) . In 
these collected columns, the nation's best-known legal gadfly champions a broad 
interpretation of First Amendment freedoms, even if it means defending 
unpalatable opinions. He argues that most conservatives are actually 
"statists," who support the power of the state over the rights of individuals, 
and laments the intellectual mediocrity of the current Supreme Court. It will 
be interesting to see if future editions include comments on the media circus 
surrounding the O.J. Simpson case.

 AS LONG AS LIFE: The Memoirs of a Frontier Woman Physician by Mary Canaga 
Rowland, edited by F.A. Loomis (Storm Peak Press: $11.95; 173 pp., illustrated, 
paperback original). The life of Mary Rowland (1873-1966) could have inspired 
"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman." She became interested in anatomy when she read her 
husband's medical books; he encouraged her earn a medical degree. After his 
death, she practiced medicine throughout the West: Her journals, edited and 
annotated by her great-great nephew, describe the lonely realities of caring 
for isolated ranchers. A remarkable, independent spirit, Rowland saw medicine 
progress from amputations without anesthetic to bypass surgery.

 THE AMERICAN INDIAN PARFLECHE: A Tradition of Abstract Painting by Gaylord 
Torrence (University of Washington Press: $35; 272 pp., paperback original). A 
container of folded or sewn rawhide, the parfleche was used by Great Plains 
tribes from Western Canada to Southeastern Texas. Buffalo Bird Woman of the 
Hidatsa remembered that one, "might contain anything from an elk's tooth to a 
twenty-dollar gold piece." The examples in this catalogue of an exhibit at the 
Des Moines Art Center display bold patterns that anticipate the work of Max 
Bill, Frank Stella and the Color Field painters.

 SHE by H. Rider Haggard (Signet: $5.95; 317 pp.). More than a century after 
its initial publication in 1887, H. Rider Haggard's "She" remains the 
archetypal fantasy-adventure novel: Its influence can be seen in countless 
books and films, from the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs to Stephen 
Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" series.Three intrepid Englishmen visit East Africa, 
where they stumble onto the ancient Kingdom of Kor. This eerie necropolis is 
ruled by the ageless, dazzlingly beautiful Ayesha, She Who Must Be Obeyed , an 
enchantress more deadly than Circe. "She" may be read to gain a clearer 
understanding of 19th-Century attitudes toward woman and Africa -- or just for 
fun.

 SUSAN B. ANTHONY SLEPT HERE: A Guide to American Women's Landmarks by Lynn 
Sherr & Jurate Kazickas (Times Books: $18; 579 pp., illustrated). In this newly 
expanded edition, Sherr and Kazickas identify more than 2,000 sites associated 
with women's achievements, ranging from monuments to Betsy Ross, Eleanor 
Roosevelt and Gertrude Stein to the graves of vaudevillians Addie and Effie 
Cherry, once billed as "the world's worst sister act." Local points of interest 
include a mural honoring Biddy Mason, one of the founders of the African 
Methodist Episcopal Church, in downtown Los Angeles, and Dorsey High School, 
named for Susan Dorsey, the first female superintendent of schools in Los 
Angeles.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; DISNEY'S 'WHIPPING BOY' SHOWS HOW 
DISCIPLINE STARTS WITH CARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may be set in the mid-18th Century, but The Whipping Boy -- based on Sid 
Fleischman's 1986 Newbery Award-winning novella of the same name -- says a lot 
about today's relationships between family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 A new Disney Channel movie follows the adventures of two boys, the spoiled 
Prince Horace (Nic Knight) and the rat catcher turned "whipping boy," Jemmy 
(Truan Munro). 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the fictitious European country of Brattenburg, the orphaned Jemmy 
finds himself selected as Horace's whipping boy: When Horace is naughty, it's 
Jemmy who receives his punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take long for the boys to find that they have more in common than 
misplaced discipline. Both boys have lost their mothers and have had little 
parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly sounds like a modern tale: A father's work (here, Horace's dad is 
a king) keeps him not only from spending quality time with his child, but 
barely any time at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "In its way, the movie is about a single-parent household," says producer Phil 
Fehrle. "Its most important message is that even if a parent makes sure the 
child has the best of everything, the child has nothing without a parent." 
</P>
<P>
 Parental responsibility is vital, agrees actor Vince Schiavelli, who plays a 
bumbling baddie in "The Whipping Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 "My 6-year-old understood about the father, the king. He said, 'Gee Papa, he 
keeps making promises to his boy that he can't keep.' I'm not a family values 
fanatic myself, but this one definitely is good family fare. Its values are 
very straight and honest and important." 
</P>
<P>
 With its variations on "The Prince and the Pauper" and "Trading Places," 
Fehrle says, "It's really a charming story about friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, Schiavelli points out, "draws an audience by its sense of humor. It 
also doesn't speak down to kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The film's rich, theatrical look and the Dickensian feel was intentional, says 
Fehrle. "The original book, while set a century before Dickens, had some 
definite resonance of that later era and the film reflects that." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Whipping Boy" airs Sunday at 7 p.m. on the Disney Channel. For ages 6 and 
up. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 With his sofa turned racing car, host Scott Herriott drives to Walt Disney 
World Inside Out (Tuesday 8:30 p.m. Disney). For "Part 3" of the monthly 
series, Harriott focuses on the All-Star Sports Resort and visits the 
Disney-MGM Studios Muppet Theater, where he interviews Kermit the Frog about 
Muppet Vision 3-D. He also goes to the tennis and golf areas and the Typhoon 
Lagoon, where he plays sports announcer for the Hydroman triathlon with George 
Foreman demonstrating. There's also fireworks, complete with an explanation of 
how it all works by an expert. For ages 5 and up.

 They may not be everyone's cup of tea, but many kids love that dynamic duo of 
Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin. In Scared Stiff (Friday 8 p.m. Family Channel), 
the buddies are teamed up as Larry Dodd (Martin) and Myron Mertz (Lewis), who, 
on the lam from New York mobsters, find themselves in a haunted castle on an 
island off Cuba. Lizabeth Scott and Dorothy Malone also star in this 1953 
remake of Bob Hope's 1940 "Ghost Breakers." For ages 6 and up.

 Attention all who love late-nights! It's time to burn some candles and sit 
around the television. The Midnight Society holds an extra-long meeting this 
Saturday, with five back-to-back episodes of Are You Afraid of the Dark? (9:30 
p.m. to midnight Nickelodeon) to creep you out this weekend. Special segments 
in which Midnight Society members appear highlight the shows. Nick also will 
flash an 800 number on the screen that viewers can call to win 1,000 home 
videos and 1,000 audiocassettes based on the series. For ages 10 and up.

PALM LATITUDES: THE BIZ; MUSICIAN, PLAY THYSELF

 Looking to pay the rent while reaching for the musical stars? Well, if you're 
a member of the American Federation of Musicians, you can hire yourself out as 
scenery for $144 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood is hungry for musicians who'll do bit parts playing -- and sometimes 
just appearing to play -- in TV and movie scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 On-camera musicians, says union spokesman Carmen Fanzone, often only pretend 
to play; the actual music is usually recorded elsewhere by studio musicians.  
</P>
<P>
 If you play an offbeat instrument or have a distinctive look, your chances of 
getting a gig increase. Joseph Saldo, who assembles on-screen bands for shows 
such as "Matlock" and "Diagnosis: Murder," typically peoples his ensembles with 
the young and the charismatic. Rival band contractor John E. Oliver's computer 
lists 1,200 musicians; among the instruments they play: the koto (a Japanese 
zither), the African flute (made from bamboo), the balalaika (a three-stringed, 
triangular guitar). 
</P>
<P>
 John Bilezikjian plays the oud, a pear-shaped, crook-necked lute from the 
Middle East that produces music when stroked with an eagle feather. He's played 
at Carnegie Hall and on more than a dozen albums. He's also appeared on 
"Three's Company" and "Perfect Strangers." "I've been training my whole life to 
be a virtuoso," he says. "Playing at Carnegie Hall was the high point of my 
life." The TV jobs, he says, "were just entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 Fanzone, a trumpet player who is now the assistant to the union president, 
says that when he came here from Detroit 16 years ago, sidelining "allowed me 
to stay in town and compete in the industry. I couldn't have paid the rent 
without it. It still does that for a lot of musicians." Joseph Hanania

 ABSOLUTE ZHIRINOVSKY: A Transparent View of the Distinguished Russian 
Statesman by Graham Frazer & George Lancelle (Penguin: $7.95; 157 pp., 
paperback original). British journalists Frazer and Lancelle combine trenchant 
analysis with excerpts from Vladimir Zhirinovsky's speeches and writings in an 
alarming study of the ultra-nationalist politician who won 24% of the vote in 
the 1993 Russian elections.Zhirinovsky veers between shameless demagoguery and 
blatant lunacy: He threatens to use nuclear weapons to blackmail Germany, 
claims the "right" to shoot 100,000 people after his election to ensure the 
peace and demands control of Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey. The authors note 
that the popular comparison between Russia and Weimar Germany is inapt. Even in 
1932, Germany had a powerful economy; the Russian industrial base is 
inefficient and mismanaged, making any relief of the confusion and suffering 
there unlikely -- and increasing the appeal of Zhirinovsky's right-wing 
insanity.

struggle to emerge from prolonged adolescence to achieve something akin to 
maturity. In "Nerves," Charlie realizes he "wasn't a grown man, he was a grown 
boy, or maybe an ungrown man, pregrown, never-to-be grown" who finds himself 
"in the process of honing his self-pity into a kind of artifact, an arrowhead 
he could keep in his pocket, its point ever ready." A woman and her brother 
grapple with their shared past in the winning title story, while the expectant 
father in "Lightening" studies fetal development like a student cramming for an 
upcoming midterm.

ON VIEW; MALIBU PLACE; CBS SERIAL AIMS TO BE A STUDY IN CLASS STRUCTURE AND 
AVARICE -- WITH PLENTY OF GORGEOUS SCENERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In June, we got "Models Inc." on Fox. Last year, it was "Trade Winds" on NBC. 
The year before, "2000 Malibu Road" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest prime-time serial, "Hotel Malibu," has the same surface ingredients 
-- a coastline, beautiful people and sizzling situations -- but this time out 
producers say they won't feed viewers mind candy. 
</P>
<P>
 If comparisons are to be made, "Hotel Malibu's" creators prefer "Upstairs, 
Downstairs." Yes, that highbrow British import that originally aired on public 
TV in the '70s. The inhabitants of "Hotel Malibu" offer a contrast in class 
also: The wealthy, glamorous resort hotel owners -- the Mayfield family -- and 
their minimum-wage employees, always hustling to keep the guests happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about the status and separation, the ambition and envy and lust," 
says Bernard Lechowick, who created the series with his wife, Marie Latham. 
"You see the distinctions (between upstairs and downstairs), but there tends to 
be this team effort in front of the guests." 
</P>
<P>
 In the opener, Jack Mayfield (John Dye) plots a way to shut down the hotel and 
gain his inheritance early. His mother, Ellie Mayfield (Joanna Cassidy) is 
oblivious to all of this, as is his idealistic sister, Stevie (Cheryl Pollak). 
Downstairs, meanwhile, a maid beds a guest. 
</P>
<P>
 The backdrop to all of this above- and below-board activity is a hotel with a 
sweeping ocean view, tall palms, tennis courts and pools. (Redondo Beach's 
Portofino Inn serves as the Malibu location.) And then there are the beautiful 
physiques: Men with washboard abs, women with long legs and not a trace of 
cellulite. 
</P>
<P>
 Still sound like a soap? It might, but cast members say the show's dialogue is 
literate, witty and crisp. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Jack Mayfield shoots back at his sister when she appears to have 
designs on the hotel bartender: "You can romanticize the working class, but you 
don't want to have dinner with the waiter." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a snappy repartee," Cassidy says. "They write it in very lyrical 
ways. It's almost difficult to remember the lines. It's not melodramatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more, Lechowick and Latham -- who were responsible for "Homefront" and 
"Second Chances" -- got many of their ideas for the show from rank-and-file, 
real-life hotel workers, not people from the posh worlds of the Hiltons or the 
Trumps. For years, the couple when the couple went on vacation they interviewed 
bellhops and doormen, bartenders and maids. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most astonishing thing about it was everyone in the hotel business liked 
their line of work," says Lechowick, who also is the show's executive producer 
with Latham. "The salaries are not very high, but the people are happy. They 
are happy for the variety of life, the variety of incident, the people they 
come in contact with." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple also found that workers put on two faces: very cordial in front of 
guests and managers; another, more bawdy, when they were in their personal 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 Just take it from Harry O'Reilly, who plays head bartender Harry Radzimski. 
</P>
<P>
 "I once worked at a reception hall in Brooklyn, and the downstairs really 
resented the upstairs," says O'Reilly, a regular on "Homefront." "We'd go back 
and bad-mouth everyone in the room. We would be back eating all the food." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind his back, Radzimski calls boss Jack Mayfield "Lord of the Manor," and 
yearns to punch him out. But in his presence, it's, "Yes, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the show will dwell on backroom chatter. The characters have weighty 
problems. Harry's assistant, Melinda Lopez (Jennifer Lopez), was hired for her 
looks, and has never mixed a drink. But her character's got a dilemma: She's a 
virgin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an unusual thing to Latino culture, but it will be an unusual thing 
to a lot of people out there," Lopez says. "At this point in her life, she's a 
little uncomfortable because she knows that everyone around her has done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and Pepe Serna, who plays her overbearing father in the show, re-create 
their roles from "Second Chances," the CBS drama that was pulled from the 
schedule because its sets were extensively damaged in the January earthquake. 
Producers wanted to keep the Lopezes, one of television's few middle-class, 
Mexican-American families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Latinos loved my character because he is a strict disciplinarian and he 
shows the Old World values that some 90-odd percent of the Latinos have in the 
United States," Serna says. "He just doesn't believe that this is a place where 
a young woman should be working. But she wants to spread her wings without me 
being over her shoulder all of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there is room for the blonde, and she causes her share of trouble. 
Harry's conniving sister Nancy (Romy Walthall) gets a job at the hotel as a 
maid, but she thinks she should own the place. She's on the prowl for a 
powerful man. ("No married men, definitely, no smokers, no minimum-wage types, 
no more musicians," Nancy proclaims in the show.) 
</P>
<P>
 "She's completely streetwise," says Walthall, dressed in her maid's uniform. 
"She wants a lot. But her means of getting it are different that most 
people's." 
</P>
<P>
 If all of this still sounds like summer fluff, there's one final way to 
separate this from the "Dynasties" of TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a lot of shoulder pads," Dye says wryly. "That's the 
difference. We go easy on the shoulder pads." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hotel Malibu" premieres Thursday at 10 p.m. on CBS.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The well-made but very familiar 1993 TV movie The Conviction of Kitty Dodds 
(CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) is another real-life personal tragedy. The film stars 
Veronica Hamel in the title role as a battered woman serving a life sentence 
for having her abusive husband murdered. Spousal abuse is a blight that should 
be exposed, but turning it into ubiquitous, formulaic TV entertainment numbs 
the outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay the Night (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m., concluding Monday at 9 p.m.), an 
intriguing 1992 two-part TV movie, offers outstanding performances and 
fascinating character studies. In the film, platinum-blond Jimmie Sue Finger's 
(Barbara Hershey) scandalous seduction of fresh-scrubbed, 16-year-old Mike 
Kettman Jr. (Morgan Weisser) becomes the catalyst for her husband's murder in a 
sleepy town. 
</P>
<P>
 River of Rage: The Taking of Maggie Keene (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a ponderous 
1993 TV movie, stars Victoria Principal as a divorced and unadventurous mother 
talked into taking a rafting trip in Texas with her new boyfriend (David 
Beecroft). When he and a river guide are gunned down by a drug-dealing 
psychopath, she is left scrambling to escape with few survival skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Carlos Fuentes' novel, the 1989 Old Gringo (KCOP Thursday at 8 p.m.), 
a Mexican Revolution epic, becomes prettily overstuffed. But writer-director 
Luis Puenzo, and stars Jane Fonda, Jimmy Smits and Gregory Peck (as Ambrose 
Bierce) win some victories along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Light, fast, sassy and confident, the 1986 F/X (KCOP Friday at 8 p.m.) is a 
sophisticated, savvy thriller involving a New York-based movie special-effects 
man (Bryan Brown) hired to stage a fake assassination of a Mafia kingpin (Jerry 
Orbach); Brian Dennehy as a redoubtable cop co-stars along with Cliff De Young. 
</P>
<P>
 HBO's handsome 1991 The Josephine Baker Story (KCAL Saturday at 5 p.m.) gave 
"La Bakair" -- the rage of 1920s Paris, a French Resistance heroine and civil 
rights activist -- the royal treatment she so richly deserved. Highlighted by a 
knockout performance by the perfectly cast Lynn Whitfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1979 Meatballs (KTTV Saturday at 6 p.m.) is a fast, funny and sophomoric 
summer camp comedy in the "Animal House" tradition. Bill Murray stars as an 
uninhibited camp counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 The World According to Garp (KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m.), an overly literary 1982 
adaptation of the celebrated John Irving novel about a young man's offbeat 
odyssey, is memorable mainly for John Lithgow's sweetly persuasive portrayal of 
a transsexual. Robin Williams stars.

'REMINGTON' RUN-ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enough already! I have memorized every line in the midnight episodes of 
"Remington Steele."KABC keeps starting the series over at the beginning. Other 
late-night offerings are either talk shows (which I detest) or old, old movies. 
How about rerunning "China Beach" for a welcome change?

THE REAL FIRST IN SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your July 10-16 issue of TV Times, it is stated in the interview with Alan 
Shepard that he was the first man into space. That is incorrect. The Russian 
cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first man to go into space -- a month before 
Shepard's flight -- on April 12, 1961, from Star City, Russia.

 Mr. Rock and Roll (AMC Wednesday at 3 a.m.), a dramatized 1957 account of how 
deejay Alan Freed discovered rock 'n' roll, features a roster of '50s rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Street (AMC Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a potent 1942 teaming of Lucille 
Ball as a flashy, golddigging Manhattan night club singer, and Henry Fonda as a 
bus boy who worships her from afar. Based on a Damon Runyon story.

SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES; THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, BY CHRISTOPHER BUCKLEY (RANDOM 
HOUSE: $22; 272 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Wallberg, Larry Wallberg is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ability to turn readers into would-be stand-up comedians is one of the 
things that distinguishes a successful comic novel. Humor screams to be shared. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that Christopher Buckley's newest work, "Thank You for 
Smoking," is merely mouth-pleasing, a collection of quirky jokes and smirky 
turns-of-phrase. It's got some neat visuals and nifty dialogue, too. In crazy 
scene after crazy scene, the author urges you to turn on the film projector in 
your head, to watch and listen to his characters as they act out his satiric 
script. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, the luncheon meetings of the "MOD Squad" -- that's MOD as 
in "Merchants of Death." Our hero, Nick Naylor, socializes and commiserates on 
a regular basis with two other shills of shame, Bobby Jay Bliss and Polly 
Bailey, representatives of, respectively, the gun and booze lobbies. The three 
frequently spend their mealtime hours together trying to one-down each other, 
playing at being "unholier-than-thou." 
</P>
<P>
 At a place called Bert's, they sit in the smoking section, around an ersatz 
fire, and take turns complaining about society's do-gooders who want to blame 
them for berserk postal workers on shooting sprees, the prevalence of fetal 
alcohol syndrome among offspring of women who drink "a gallon of vodka every 
day in the third trimester," and the imminent cancer death of the Tumbleweeds 
Man, "for over twenty years the very symbol of American's smoking manhood in 
the saddle." 
</P>
<P>
 Naylor's adventures lead him to appear on the Oprah Winfrey show, where he 
discusses the phallic-nosed advertising icon, Old Joe Camel, with fellow guests 
-- the head of the National Organization of Mothers Against Smoking (NOMAS), 
the executive director of the National Teachers Assn. in Washington, the deputy 
director of the Office of Substance Abuse Prevention and "the Cancer Kid," a 
stricken high school senior who has told Oprah that he "no longer thinks 
smoking is cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, Naylor -- who until that telecast was in danger of losing his job to 
a good-looking protegee of the man he works for -- manages to turn in a 
matchless performance defending smoking by attacking its attackers. And that's 
the moment you've been waiting for, right there at long last in Chapter 5, when 
Buckley's manic-movie plot is finally set fully into motion. Before the tale 
burns itself out, Naylor's little odyssey-ette will have brought him into 
contact with Hollywood "hypesters," a North Carolina Tobacco squire, a Margaret 
Thatcher clone, would-be killers, a sex-wielding newspaperwoman and, yes, Larry 
King ("Author's Note: Some real people appear here under their own names, but 
this is fiction.") 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, that's also the moment, right there in Chapter 5, when you'll 
realize how thin the novel really is -- as a novel. Its cinematic strength is 
its literary downfall; you're reading a novelization. The wilder the episodes 
become, the less involved the reader does. This is no page-turner that will 
keep you lighting up into the wee hours. Instead, you'll find Buckley joking 
more now and enjoying it less. He throws his two-dimensional characters into 
outrageous screwball-screenplay situations, and they're funny, funny, funny. 
But they never really come alive, never really step out of the book and into 
our hearts. Because of that, they fail to fully engage our interest; also 
because of that, the book ultimately becomes nothing more than a collection of 
humorous plot contrivances and verbal pyrotechnics. 
</P>
<P>
 But, wow, is it going to make a terrific and hilarious Hollywood flick if the 
right creative people get hold of it and flesh those characters out with some 
high-priced actors. (Wallberg's Tip: Michael Keaton as Nick, John Goodman as 
Bobby Jay, Madeleine Stowe as Polly, Howard Stern as Larry King.) Who today 
still reads the ain't-I-clever writers of yesterday, the Max Shulmans, the 
Leonard Wibberleys or the Thorne Smiths? But sit for half an hour with an 
episode of "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis," or watch "The Mouse That Roared," 
or check out "Topper" in any of its incarnations, and you'll find yourself 
thinking you're dealing with a classic -- a minor one, granted, but a classic 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank You for Smoking" is a very enjoyable read that's going to make one hell 
of a film. Watch for it soon. But remember: No smoking in the theater.

INSIDE THE TALE; COVER STORY, BY ROBERT CULLEN (ATHENEUM: $20; 312 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Brizzolara, John Brizzolara is a novelist, the author of Wirecutter and 
Empire's Horizon. He is also a journalist in San Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her nonfiction book, "The Journalist and the Murderer," Janet Malcolm said 
of journalists: "The least talented talk about Art; the seemliest murmur about 
earning a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, journalism is a hard dollar. Anyone who is good and has been at it for a 
time will smile indulgently at phrases like "the truth" or "the public's right 
to know" even though they probably believe in those slippery and morally 
ambivalent ideals. Any reporter who has ridden the crest of a fast-breaking 
story or gotten a source to confirm something his competitors haven't unearthed 
will laugh uproariously at the idea of the fourth estate as a savvy, financial 
career move -- but they might well describe the high the way a gambler would, 
using phrases such as "the juice." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Cullen's new novel "Cover Story" is about Moscow, the Israelis, the CIA 
and an American correspondent for a weekly news magazine named Colin Burke 
(Pete Hamill meets James Bond) but it is mostly about journalism and "the 
juice." 
</P>
<P>
 The Middle East peace talks are breaking down again. Carter and Gorbachev are 
trying to dance around the fact to the press when a CNN story breaks about 
nuclear components disappearing from the dismantled Soviet military machinery 
and turning up in Syria in enough quantities to build five bombs. Burke, having 
been scooped by CNN, hits upon the idea that where there are Russian nuclear 
components, Russian scientists are likely to follow. Burke follows the money 
and it leads him to Syrian businessman Rafit Kassim. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke is very good at his job. Robert Cullen has been a journalist and 
reporter for more than 20 years and won the Overseas Press Club Award for his 
reporting in Moscow. His previous books include "Soviet Sources" and "Twilight 
of Empire"; fiction and nonfiction respectively. His evocation of the evil 
empire in ruins during the muddy Russian spring is remarkable. The sense of 
place is uncanny, the atmosphere of paranoia worthy of Kafka depicts a Russia 
so long in the habits of a bureaucracy -- phone-tapping, disinformation and spy 
vs. spy mentality long after it serves any useful purpose -- it is nearly 
comical. Colin Burke knows his way around well in this environment, and we get 
a first-class tour on his coattails. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is what it seems in this Moscow. When Burke is assigned a minor story 
on Soviet Jews in the aftermath of communism, it turns into a climactic 
confrontation between Burke and the Jews and the Russian equivalent of the Ku 
Klux Klan. We meet Ronit Evron, the beautiful, mysterious Israeli school 
teacher Burke lusts after but does not trust. She leads him to a scientist 
named Nekronov who lives and works in a "closed city." Burke is arrested there 
and not for the last time in the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Cullen's prose is clean, transparent, workmanlike. His years as a journalist 
have served him well; the reader does not trip over a mannered style while 
unraveling this complex, convincing and thoroughly unpredictable 
Chinese-puzzle-box plot. (Occasionally he'll reach for a metaphor that doesn't 
fly: a woman with "enough wrinkles to start a raisin factory." Raymond Chandler 
has little to fear from Cullen.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cullen's dialogue is crisp and believable. Burke has a touch of the wise guy, 
but is all pro even as he wrings his hands with guilt and whines about his 
drinking in the tradition of Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder and James Lee 
Burke's Dave Robicheaux. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavel Plotnikov is a fine creation: the middle-aged mathematician turned 
reporter whom we alternately trust, distrust, trust again, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 To say much more about the plot would not be fair to Cullen's carefully 
crafted thriller that partakes of both the spy novel and the detective genre. 
Comparisons to "Gorky Park" will be inevitable, but in many ways "Cover Story" 
is a superior book. What makes this novel unique is Burke's allegiance to his 
craft, the thing that makes him tick. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really terrified him, he decided, was the prospect of losing . . . 
something he could not quite define. It was wrapped up, he knew, in his ability 
to discover facts and report them. It had to do with integrity. It had to do 
with the knowledge that other reporters whose judgments he respected recognized 
those qualities in him. It was kind of dignity or sense of worth. And if he 
lost it, he would be left in ruins." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cover Story" is one of the best novels about journalism in recent memory. As 
a suspense novel it is first rate and as for Colin Burke, he's more than a 
little the worse for wear at the end of the novel, but I'd gladly visit him 
again.

 New this week:  
</P>
<P>
 THE TRIBE OF TIGER: Cats and Their Culture by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas (Simon 
& Schuster: $20). The author's stealthy observation, once again, produces 
amazing pronouncements about some of our closest animal friends.(Also available 
on audiocassette.) 
</P>
<P>
 FIRST OFFENSE by Nancy Taylor Rosenberg (Dutton: $22.95). Rosenberg's previous 
life as a probation officer authenticates heroine-in-peril Ann Carlisle's 
actions in this thriller. Suave first-time offender Jimmy Sawyer may be Ann's 
last chance in finding out who shot her. (Also available on audiocassette.) 
</P>
<P>
 SHADOWS OF DOUBT by Herb Brown (Donald I. Fine: $21.50). Former Judge Brown's 
forte is rendering the intricacies of courtroom maneuvers. Attorney Kathleen 
Sullivan attempts to defend her half-sister using the classic abused-wife 
syndrome; the one glitch in her strategy is an uncooperative client. E.W.

TOUR OF DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alice Hoffman's entertaining rumination on the frozen evolution of fictional 
characters from her latest novel ("While We Waltz Off on Book Tour," June 19) 
was no doubt intended to provide an insight into the creative process. But it 
casts false light on the lives of most authors. 
</P>
<P>
 At the risk of discouraging aspiring writers (but in the interest of 
correcting false impressions with the book-buying public), let me set the 
record straight: While Hoffman claims that "everyone tours, illustrious authors 
and first-time novelists, egomaniacs and homebodies," the facts are otherwise. 
Upward of 50,000 titles are published annually in this country, but no more 
than a few hundred authors, if that, are sent by publishers on book promotion 
tours. Of those who do tour, few are treated quite so luxuriously as Hoffman, 
with rooms in "terrific" hotels and knowledgeable, competent escorts to make 
everything seem effortless. 
</P>
<P>
 My first book tour went more like this: The publisher agreed to reimburse me 
for the cheapest possible air fare and necessary local transportation in and 
between New York, Boston and Washington, D.C. I was expected to take care of 
everything else. Since I was a typical first-time author, I had expended my 
life savings to finish writing the book. So I spent nights on living room sofas 
of friends and acquaintances and subsisted on charity, fast food or supermarket 
fruit. I made over 20 media appearances, including some on network television, 
but none in bookstores. The publisher somehow neglected to get any copies of my 
book into these establishments, so people could hear me on radio, see me on TV 
or read about me in the newspaper -- but they couldn't actually buy my book in 
a store. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the publishers of my seven subsequent books saw fit to arrange an 
out-of-town tour of any kind. Whatever publicity these books generated was 
largely due to my own efforts. And of course, it was at my own expense.

 The reviewer of "A Talent for Genius: The Life and Times of Oscar Levant," Ian 
Whitcomb, must not have been on a railroad train recently and must not have 
seen the film, "Rhapsody in Blue," recently. What George and Oscar shared was 
not a railroad sleeping car but rather a drawing room.In this drawing room, 
George was in the lower berth and Oscar in the upper berth. It was Oscar Levant 
who made the comment on this situation to the effect that "That's the 
difference between talent and genius."

 It was a pleasant surprise to find myself quoted in the review of Oscar 
Levant's biography, "A Talent for Genius" (Book Review, June 12). 
</P>
<P>
 Attributing the quote to journalist Burt Prelutsky, however, puts a misleading 
spin on it. While it is true that I first met Oscar when I interviewed him for 
my Times humor column, we remained friends for the last several years of his 
life. As a journalist, I would never have presumed to say, "Behind the facade 
of the world's oldest enfant terrible lurked the sweetest, warmest, most 
vulnerable man." It was as a friend that I said those words. Oscar died 21 
years ago, and I miss him still.

<P>
 Where did Mary Oliver get the bizarre idea that the iambic pentameter is 
somehow linked to the regular English breath ("A Poetry Handbook," In Brief, 
June 12)? Or is the reviewer merely attributing her own ignorance to Ms. 
Oliver? We breathe in many different ways. It has nothing to do with meter and 
never did.The iambic line is natural to English, and this is as true for 
Americans as it is for Australians, Canadians, the Brits and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 As for rising early and living simply and honorably, it is certainly fine 
advice, but what does it have to do with writing good poetry? Some of the 
greatest poets slept till noon, lived luxuriously and were completely 
untrustworthy. They also had deplorable politics.

DESTABILIZING THE EVIL EMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have finished reading Jonathan Kwitny's review of Peter Schweizer's book 
"Victory" (Book Review, June 12) in which Peter Schweizer documents the Reagan 
Administration's role in ending the cold war. Kwitny's thesis seems to be that 
the Reagan Administration was uninvolved in the demise of the Soviet 
Union.Kwitny apparently agrees with Strobe Talbot that the collapse of the 
Soviet Union was inevitable, and just happened all by itself, with no 
assistance from the free world and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwitny is, however, happy to believe that Reagan took the initiative to do 
anything with which he disagrees, so he condemns Reagan for taking actions to 
"psychologically destabilize" Soviet commanders. He would prefer, it seems, a 
policy of foreign affairs who makes no firm decisions, takes no actions, and 
certainly takes no risks, such as the current Commander-in-Chief of our armed 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwitny warns that "readers are not well served by the unsupported boasts of 
former officials who would like to take credit for a famous victory." The 
liberal press (a redundant phrase if ever there was one) has been remarkably 
silent in giving the Reagan Administration any credit for a famous victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwitny entertains "the suspicion that this is Soviet-style history -- 
rewritten to suit the current propaganda need." Historical revisionism is today 
overwhelmingly the province of the left.

HITLER'S REDEEMING QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "The Rape of Europa" (Book Review, June 12): It's a mistake to 
assume that because a man is a psychopath and monster, he's corrupt in every 
respect. Your reviewer states: "Hitler established an ambitious acquisition 
program -- both for himself and for the Reich."That's incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Speer, one of Hitler's closest associates, states in "Inside the Third 
Reich": "Hitler did not utilize his authority for his private ends. He did not 
keep in his own possession a single one of the paintings he acquired or 
confiscated in the occupied territories." 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that Hermann Goering stole paintings; but Speer reports that "Hitler 
was outraged by the way the Second Man in the State appropriated valuable works 
of art."

FORGOTTEN IVAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest William Gass' review of "The Wages of Guilt" by Ian 
Buruma (June 26). However, I am surprised by the implicit disregard for Slavs. 
At least three times as many Slavs as Jews died as the result of Hitler's 
aggression. Yet there is no mention of Nazi atrocities in Russia and other 
Slavic countries east of Poland. One should at least expect a discussion, for 
the historically sensitive, of why Germans do not feel as much guilt about what 
they did to the Slavs: because Stalin was as evil as Hitler, or because the Red 
Army has been an obnoxious occupier? 
</P>
<P>
 This disregard is typical of the American press, which ignored the two most 
important anniversaries of World War II -- if you count as "important" 
defeating the Nazis. These were June 22, 1941, when Hitler invaded the USSR; 
and Nov. 23, 1942, when the ring around Stalingrad was closed at Kalach, never 
to be broken. But the press also ignored the turning point of the war in the 
Pacific: June 3, 1942: Midway. 
</P>
<P>
 I am an American who turned 18 in 1944. So far as I'm concerned, the guys to 
whom I most owe the fact that 50 years later I'm still walking, I'm still 
talking, are the Red Army soldiers who resisted the Nazi invasion in 1941-42. 
The British historian Alan Clark put it best, in the preface to his 
"Barbarossa" (1965): "This book has its heroes. . . . Foremost must come the 
ordinary Russian soldier; abominably led, inadequately trained, poorly 
equipped, he changed the course of history by his courage and tenacity in the 
first year of fighting." Without this resistance, it is quite unsure whether 
the Normandy Invasion could have taken place, let alone succeeded; it is 
important mainly, in retrospect, for stopping the USSR from dominating all of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the press is right to assume that significant history is only those 
parts remembered by its constituency (the survivors of Midway must number less 
than 1% of those of Normandy). But such obliteration seems not excusable in a 
book purportedly about people's attitudes toward the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's to you, forgotten Ivan.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I must question your choice of reviewer for the three Apollo 25th Anniversary 
books ("How High the Sky," July 3).Terry Bisson makes it clear in the first 
paragraph that his politics are somewhere to the left of Alexander Cockburn, 
and the piece is sprinkled with asides that are not that relevant to the job at 
hand. The people most likely to be interested in moon landings 25 years later 
are "techies" rather than radical leftists. That said, the review does give a 
good picture of the books, but the political blather was distracting and 
annoying.

 Not far from Santa Claus Lane in Carpinteria lies an indoor pool that would 
make any sultan feel at home. Designated Santa Barbara County Landmark No. 28, 
this 20-by-60-foot Moorish-style natatorium was designed in 1927 by California 
architect George Washington Smith for millionaire playboy Albert K. Isham. 
</P>
<P>
 The pavilion, unscathed by a Pacific storm that destroyed Isham's residence 
decades ago, has recently been restored. The roof retracts for gazing at the 
sun, moon and stars, but the splendid tiles are what catch and tickle the eye. 
A wainscot resembling an Oriental carpet surrounds the pool with interlocking 
geometries in cobalt, gold and terra-cotta. Arches, columns and windows are 
embellished. And at the north end, a mural depicts an underwater fantasy of 
fish, seahorses and coral. 
</P>
<P>
 The origin of these tiles remains a mystery. Former owner David Serena says 
Smith's original plans called for "Tunisian tiles." (The MacElhenny Group of 
Santa Barbara acquired the property last year and plans to use the pool as a 
clubhouse for a new housing development.) But whether the tiles were made in 
North Africa or locally is unknown: Gladding, McBean & Co. of Glendale is the 
supplier of record; Ron Rindge, grandson of May Knight Rindge, who owned Malibu 
Potteries, speculates that his family's business was probably a subcontractor 
for many of the tiles. Enigma aside, this is a pool with a colorful past: 
Legend has it that Isham once drove his Duesenberg into the water, a 
champagne-sipping starlet on each fender.BARBARA THORNBURG

 Elyse Grinstein has a simple explanation for why, at age 65, she's still a 
full-time architect, a political activist, a board member of numerous arts 
education organizations and an art collector: "I have three children and five 
grandchildren living all around Los Angeles, and I want to leave them 
something." She doesn't want to build monuments, nor does she think she can 
change the world; but she does want "to make this a community where there is 
excitement, where people feel as if they belong to a place. Art and 
architecture can do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Grinstein's father didn't approve of her desire to become an architect, so she 
became a schoolteacher and married Stanley Grinstein, who runs Mifran-Boman 
Forklift Co. Together, they began collecting art in the 1950s and quickly 
established one of the city's preeminent collections of contemporary painting 
and sculpture. In 1968, they started the Gemini G.E.L. (Graphic Editions 
Limited) workshop-gallery-studios on Melrose Avenue and collaborated with 
artists such as Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein and Frank Stella to 
produce high-quality prints. Gemini has had retrospectives at the Museum of 
Modern Art and the National Gallery of Art, where a 1984-94 update is now on 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 With her children grown, Grinstein finally realized her dream of becoming an 
architect. After earning a master's degree at UCLA in 1978, she worked for old 
friend Frank Gehry before striking out on her own. She remodeled David 
Hockney's Hollywood Hills house and her own Brentwood house ("to make room for 
this huge Stella we had") and, with former partner Jeff Daniels, designed such 
eye-catching structures as the spiraling Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant at 
Western and Oakwood. "If people gather in fast-food joints," she asks, "why 
can't a chicken shack be a community center?" 
</P>
<P>
 That same concern for public space has made her a leading advocate for strong 
civic architecture. During Mayor Tom Bradley's administration, Grinstein served 
as president of the Cultural Affairs Commission, promoting new standards in 
street lighting, signage, awnings and other public amenities. She also has been 
involved with the Hollywood Women's Political Community and, with her husband, 
worked in Barbara Boxer's senatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, Grinstein and new partner Susan Narduli have been busy 
remodeling CalArts' quake-damaged campus in Valencia. They've redesigned walls, 
floors and lighting for several areas, including a new acoustical shell in the 
main gallery and new seminar rooms. And Narduli/Grinstein Architects in Venice 
is part of the design competition for new LAX concession facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Grinstein manages to find time to organize fund-raisers, to push the city into 
incorporating design in its landscape and to appreciate her art. "It all comes 
back to architecture, which can give us the vision we have always lacked. 
That's why I'm devising some walking tours of Los Angeles, so that visitors can 
take them and then go back to the Midwest and say: They do walk in L.A., and 
there's lots going on there." AARON BETSKY

RESTAURANTS; A WHIFF OF THE TROPICS; SOFRITOS , FUFUS , PUPUS , SIMPLES AND

<P>
 The sweet, tinny lilt of steel drums leaks out the door of Descanso, a new 
Hermosa Beach restaurant with a steamy tropical theme. Under a gaily striped 
awning, fat letters the juicy colors of banana, mango, and papaya spell out its 
name, Spanish for "little rest" or "vacation." At the handmade tile bar inset 
with emerald palm fronds, party-goers in their best beachwear sip tall, cool 
drinks with names like Havana Banana, Koala Colada or Coca Cabana Cooler. A 
wraparound mural of sherbet-colored skies, exotic birds and bright umbrellas 
gives the large dining room the look of a beachside outpost. Descanso is lots 
of fun, and the food is just as high-spirited, characterized by bold, bright 
flavors and a whimsical sense of adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu is an exuberant compendium of dishes from the Caribbean, Mexico, 
Hawaii and further afield. Owners Michael Frank and Robert Bell already had a 
California brasserie (Chez Melange), a Mediterranean bistro (Fino) and an 
Italian caffe and bakery (Misto), all in the South Bay. When they were first 
thinking of opening a tropical-themed restaurant, Frank and Bell took a 
research trip to Florida. According to a waiter (who turned out to be the 
manager), the two checked out dozens of restaurants -- some for the decor, 
others for the food. The best meal they had was at Yuca, a Cuban restaurant in 
Coral Gables. When lunch was over, they asked to meet the chef. Expecting a 
Cuban to emerge from the kitchen, they were surprised when the chef turned out 
to be 24-year-old David Slatkin -- from Tarzana. They later persuaded him to 
come back to Southern California and Descanso. 
</P>
<P>
 Slatkin, who studied at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., 
headed to Florida after graduating to learn about Cuban and Caribbean cuisine. 
He does seem to have a real affinity for this cooking -- which Frank and Bell 
have dubbed "coastal cuisine," a concept that stretches to include Morocco, 
Italy, even Bali and India. Any cuisine with a whiff of the tropics. Slatkin 
plays with textures and techniques, building flavor layer by layer with 
marinades, spice pastes and slow-cooked sofritos .  
</P>
<P>
 The adventure starts with the menus, which the waiter brings with a stack of 
brightly colored small plates. The idea here is to share everything family 
style. First-timers may be puzzled by categories like pupus and sticky fingers, 
cakes, sticks, bowls and, a little farther down the page, "simple mains." And 
no etiquette book ever explained how to combine Island style poke and 
pappardelle with beef satay, seven-onion ramen and patacones (green plantain 
crackers) topped with mango and vodka-cured salmon.  
</P>
<P>
 You can study the long menu assiduously with the help of a glossary and ask a 
lot of questions, or simply close your eyes and point. Chances are you'd come 
up with a globe-trotting mix-and-match meal that intrigues with an exotic blend 
of ingredients and influences. The warm, enthusiastic staff can help too; 
they've all tasted the dishes and can describe them well enough to gently prod 
diners into risking the unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things you have to take on faith. Who could accurately describe the taste 
of their plantain fufu , a starchy, fruity mash of fruit and applewood-smoked 
bacon? Or the smoldering sofrito , thick with tomatoes, onions and roasted 
chiles, offered one night to spice up one of the blander dishes? The best 
strategy is to order in flights, several dishes at a time. With the exception 
of a handful of mains (as in main courses) and simple mains (plainer, less 
exotic main courses for those who just want a simple grilled fish, say), dishes 
don't need to come in any particular order. Go easy the first time around; you 
can always order more. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrimp get a shaggy coat of spiced ground pumpkin seed that resembles 
armadillo hide; they're terrific with that fiery sofrito. I loved the big 
black-bean-coated fried oysters served in their shells with a scoop of salsa 
and the lamb kebab rubbed with a cumin-accented spice paste and served 
alongside a fluffy turmeric-stained couscous. Moroccan-style shrimp are gilded 
with spice and served with the same irresistible couscous. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceviche of shrimp and fish is heaped in a coconut shell with a vibrant 
cilantro-laced tomatillo sauce. None of the dishes are all that fiery, but they 
can be easily doctored with some of the house hot sauce. Jamaican jerk chicken 
comes nicely charred and spiced. A meaty block of grilled fresh tuna picks up a 
little sweetness from the stake of sugar cane threaded through its heart. 
Proceed with caution; portions are generous. And the dessert course is yet to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastry chef Kelly Keightley has had some fun with the tropical theme, too. She 
rolls tuile cookies into tall cylinders and fills them with chocolate and a 
deliciously gooey banana mousse; she sends out these "towers" upright, a loopy 
cityscape on a plate. Her thick, exotic chilled mango-coconut soup is spiked 
with rum and comes with a warm mango chutney. And when she makes flan, she 
makes it rich, topped with toasted almonds, caramelized bananas and two very 
dark, very skinny chocolate cigars. There's also a wonderful individual warm 
chocolate cake and a sundae of cinnamon, chocolate and vanilla ice cream 
scattered with chocolate-dipped macadamia nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Ed Masciana, the owners have put together a remarkable 
"world" wine list. It's filled with country wines from California, France and 
Italy, of course, but also from Spain, Greece, Australia and South Africa, and 
of some 45 wines, only a handful are over $20. Among my picks: the crisp 1993 
Pinot Blanc from Au Bon Climat ($18), a sturdy rose from Gerard Depardieu's 
Loire vineyard Chateau de Tigne ($16), which goes beautifully with spicy food, 
and the '92 Shiraz from Rosemount Estate in Australia ($18), a gutsy red wine 
for gutsy food. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a big, unwieldy menu, and some dishes still need work. The Key West conch 
chowder, for example, is too tomatoey, the conch rubbery; the key lime pie is a 
real disappointment. But in four visits spaced out over six or so weeks, the 
food at Descanso got better and better, the flavors more focused, the textures 
more refined. The kitchen is working hard, and young Slatkin is cooking up a 
tropical storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Descanso, 705 Pier Ave . , Hermosa Beach ; (310) 379 - 7997. Closed Sundays at 
lunch. Complimentary valet parking. Dinner for two, food only, $42-$66. Corkage 
, $7.50.

 BERTOLT BRECHT AND KURT WEILL: "The Seven Deadly Sins"; "Mahagonny Songspiel." 
Ute Lemper, others; RIAS Berlin Sinfonietta, John Mauceri, cond. London 430 
168-2.Back in the late '20s and early '30s among the German left-wing 
intelligentsia, the message was cozily simple: the capitalist world was rotten, 
especially America. Brecht and Weill brought out "Seven Sins," being 
particularly hard on Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Los Angeles along the 
way. Lemper gives us the vocal version designed for Lotte Lenya, singing it 
better and with more voice than Lenya ever did. But it was fashionable in those 
circles to look and sound ugly, so in this aspect Lemper fails. The Songspiel 
offers more Angst . "Alabama-Song" to the contrary, the musical invention now 
seems threadbare, the text dated. WALTER PRICE

ON THE RECORD: THE ENDURING, LUCID PIERRE MONTEUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paris-born Pierre Monteux (1875-1964) was not the kind of conductor who 
inspired polemics. He was a supreme professional who found greater satisfaction 
in serving his chosen composers -- an impressively variegated lot -- than in 
exhibiting his own ego. 
</P>
<P>
 One didn't speak of "Monteux's Beethoven" or "Monteux's Debussy" as one did of 
the specialties of such iconic figures as Wilhelm Furtwangler and Arturo 
Toscanini, both of whom were Monteux's near-contemporaries and both of whom he 
outlived. 
</P>
<P>
 Monteux didn't compete with his composers; rather, he brought to their scores 
skill and dedication in a long career with his own Paris orchestra at the 
outset; then as de facto principal guest conductor of the Boston Symphony; as 
music director not of one of America's glamour ensembles but of the San 
Francisco Symphony, and, finally, as principal conductor of the London 
Symphony, a post he took up in 1961 at the age of 86. 
</P>
<P>
 The one job where Monteux made waves was as conductor for Diaghilev's Ballets 
Russes between 1911 and 1914, where he was entrusted with the world premieres 
of Stravinsky's "Petrushka" and "Le Sacre du Printemps," Ravel's "Daphnis et 
Chloe" and Debussy's "Jeux" -- defining moments in 20th-Century music. 
</P>
<P>
 In his recordings, many of the most celebrated of which are now collected by 
RCA in the massive, boxed "Pierre Monteux Edition" (61893, 15 CDs, mid-price) 
-- spanning the years 1941-1961 -- he is shown to be the most lively, 
unaffected and clarifying of musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the material is new to CD, much of the best of it has never 
been out of circulation for long, such as the "Petrushka" and "Sacre," recorded 
with the Boston Symphony during the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Stravinsky interpretations are too familiar to occasion surprise at 
this stage of the game, they do sound better than ever in the present 
remasterings. 
</P>
<P>
 This "Sacre," recorded in 1951, remains one of recorded history's enduring 
thrillers: weighty, thunderous and dark, played with breathtaking virtuosity by 
the BSO and somehow more "modern"-sounding than the quick, steely, translucent 
interpretation that the composer himself established as a worldwide standard in 
his later years. 
</P>
<P>
 The recorded sound here, as in all the post-San Francisco recordings, is 
superb, the monophonic "Sacre," if anything, more immediate in its sonic impact 
than the stereo "Petrushka." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, there's a bright and brash Berlioz collection, including the 
"Symphonie Fantastique" and "Benvenuto Cellini" Overture, exemplifying 
Monteux's happiest days in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a gutsy Debussy "Images" with the same orchestra, although it's hardly 
in a class with the same composer's "Nocturnes," with the BSO's iridescent 
strings and gleaming solo winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Beethoven's Fourth and Eighth symphonies, likewise from San Francisco, are 
smartly paced and classically clear-eyed, but both were later to be re-recorded 
by Monteux with better orchestras and undiminished vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most questionable inclusions, all from San Francisco, is a Mahler 
"Kindertotenlieder" where the conductor's firm, idiomatic grasp and Marian 
Anderson's poignant solo cannot compensate for labored orchestral inadequacies. 
Why this was chosen over the same performers' altogether superb Brahms "Alto 
Rhapsody" is a head-scratcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Then too mezzo Glady Swarthout's pathetically short-breathed encounter with 
Chausson's ecstatic "Poeme d'amour et de la mer," is an embarrassment amid the 
riches of Monteux's firm, unsentimental way with the music of Cesar Franck -- 
here including a powerful D-minor Symphony with the Chicago Symphony -- and his 
disciples. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's a scruffy, sonically crude Strauss "Heldenleben," counterbalanced 
by the same composer's "Tod und Verklarung," led with tremendous, dramatic 
sweep and showing the San Francisco Symphony in something approaching 
world-class form. 
</P>
<P>
 Also among the collection's glories are the last three Tchaikovsky symphonies, 
with the Boston Symphony: a model marriage of lucidity and passion.

 PAUL REALE: First Sonata (1985); Piano Sonata No.2. 
</P>
<P>
 AARON COPLAND: Four Piano Blues; Piano Fantasy (1955-57).John Jensen, piano. 
Music and Arts CD-738. The output of both Copland and Reale is clearly tied to 
their mainstream, traditionalist forbears, yet distinctly stamped. Jensen 
conveys the music of Copland's foray into serialism -- the Fantasy -- 
faithfully, as largely cerebral, often uncomfortable, with fits of 
jazz-influenced musings and improvisational genialities. The Four Blues -- 
gentle miniatures -- emerge with little dynamic nuance, but admirable precision 
and conviction. Reale's two unpublished sonatas -- programmatic, accessible, 
yet inventive and intelligently constructed -- receive straightforward and 
attentive, if restrained readings. SUSAN BLISS

 CHITOSE OKASHIRO: Piano works by Schumann: Symphonic Etudes, Opus 13 and Opus 
Posthumous; "Arabeske."Mozart: Sonata in B-flat, K. 570. Pieces by Chopin, 
Scarlatti, Scriabin and Brahms. Pro Piano CD 224501. As Director of Artists and 
Repertoire for the company and co-producer of this disk, Okashiro has 
essentially provided a compilation of recital standards. The Japanese pianist 
approaches the material with discernible intelligence, but blankets it all with 
a Romantic bent. Still, the performances impress. They abound with subtle 
shadings and lively projection, all well-served by technical security and 
enhanced by a recording characterized by much -- almost excessive -- 
reverberation. SUSAN BLISS

 TCHAIKOVSKY: Nineteen Songs. Olga Borodina, mezzo-soprano; Larissa Gergieva, 
piano. Philips 442 013-2. Borodina is among the most prominent of former Soviet 
singers now active in the West.It is essentially a lyric voice, but not one 
without power. In her first solo recording available here, the gorgeous 
Tchaikovsky songs show her to best advantage. She has impressive range and is 
able to color tellingly, whether in the sustained legato of the inevitable 
"None But the Lonely Heart" or "It Happened in the Early Spring," the agitated 
"Nights of Delirium," the bright Gypsy Girl's Song and most hauntingly in the 
aching sadness of "Once Again, Alone." Gergieva's accompaniment is near 
faultless, proving that her brother Valery is not the only gifted musician in 
their family. No Russian texts or transliterations are provided -- only stilted 
English translations. WALTER PRICE

REISSUES: OUT OF THE VAULT AND INTO THE BIN GO OLD TREASURES

 Record companies continue to exploit the treasures in their vaults, releasing 
scores of selections recorded as far back as the '20s and '30s. This is good 
news for buyers who are new to the musical form as well as those customers 
looking for a regular fix.This column looks at several recently reissued 
albums.

 A tone that communicates like someone speaking directly into your ear, a style 
that places emphasis on emotional warmth and blues essence -- these aspects are 
at the matrix of the alto saxophonist's ouevre.  
</P>
<P>
 This two-CD set documents Crawford's 40-year career, which despite many highs, 
has never made Crawford a star. The first CD begins with tracks recorded with 
Ray Charles -- his employer in the '50s and early '60s -- then segues into cuts 
from several excellent small-band albums he made for Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Misty" is a nonpareil rendition of that lovely Garner ballad, phrases darting 
here and there, then slowing, like schools of fish in an aquarium tank. "The 
Peeper" is one of many back-beat blues, with crisp-as-a-new-dollar-bill phrases 
that make you want to shout. 
</P>
<P>
 Later material, which lacks some of the do-or-die urgency of his best work, is 
also included -- drawn from recordings for KuDu and Milestone. The album closes 
with Crawford accompanying B.B. King and Etta James, the latter on the Charles 
classic, "Night Time (Is the Right Time)." Albums are rated on a scale of one 
star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars (good, recommended), four stars 
(excellent). Five-star ratings are reserved for classic reissues. ZAN STEWART

 * * * 1/2 Stan Getz/Jimmie Rowles, "The Peacocks," Columbia. Recorded in 1975, 
this album brings together two giants to display their mastery and mutual 
admiration.Of the 13 cuts, five are instrumental duets; Rowles' title tune is 
the voluptuous, evocative highlight. On other tracks they are aided by Elvin 
Jones' drums and Buster Williams' bass. "Body and Soul" and Cedar Walton's 
"Mosaic" are solo piano cuts. Rowles also sings on four tunes, arguably the 
only less-than-totally-successful works: His tongue-in-cheek version of "Rose 
Marie" shows that he is no Nelson Eddy; on "I'll Never Be the Same" his 
intonation falters. The best vocal cut is Wayne Shorter's "The Chess Players," 
for which the Jon Hendricks Singers overdub Hendricks' lyrics. Another Shorter 
piece, "Lester Left Town," is a sumptuous showcase for Getz. Albums are rated 
on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars (good, 
recommended), four stars (excellent). Five-star ratings are reserved for 
classic reissues. LEONARD FEATHER

 * * * * "Up at Minton's," Stanley Turrentine, Blue Note. This two-CD set, 
recorded in 1961 at the famed Harlem jazz spot, documents a jazz style that, 
sadly, is rapidly disappearing.Turrentine, who grew up revering Don Byas and 
Earl Bostic and then went on to play with Max Roach, incorporates the 
complexities of be-bop, the assured drive of swing and the comfort and 
familiarity of the blues into a singular approach. This music cooks. 
Turrentine, guitarist Grant Green, pianist Horace Parlan and their rhythm team 
investigate "Broadway" and "Love for Sale" at brisk paces, their resilient and 
accessible statements flowing like a river: smooth and relaxed here, charged 
and forceful there. The slower tunes -- "Come Rain or Come Shine," among them 
-- are equally compelling. Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two 
stars (fair), three stars (good, recommended), four stars (excellent).

<P>
 "Big Band Record" 
</P>
<P>
 Gramavision  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 Trombonist Anderson has finally found a setting equal to his blustery, 
multicolored sound. Known for tonally adventurous slide work, Anderson has 
often overwhelmed previous material and ensembles, whether it be funk-oriented, 
like his beat-minded collaboration with Mark Helias dubbed Slickaphonics, or 
avant-garde experiments with the likes of Anthony Braxton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big Band Record" references both, while working mainly from a traditional 
base that gains inspiration from Duke Ellington ("My Wish"), Charles Mingus 
("Anabel at One") and Thelonious Monk ("Raven-A Ning"). The tunes, all composed 
by Anderson, shift gears faster than Emerson Fittipaldi, accelerating out of 
gentle brass riffs into rubber-burning fanfares, cornering hard through 
stomp-and-shout passages as soloists break from the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's voice, gamy and full of rhythmic punch, is given fine complement by 
pianist George Gruntz's Concert Jazz Band, with clarinetist Marty Ehrlich, 
trumpeters Ryon Kisor and Lew Soloff, violinist Mark Feldman and alto 
saxophonist Tim Berne all contributing spirited improvisations. But Anderson is 
clearly the standout, his solos filled with a style-conscious singer's 
repertoire of growls, grunts and whispers, topped off with soaring climaxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The only predictable aspect on the disc is Gruntz's brassy arrangements of 
Anderson's compositions. But when the entire 18-piece ensemble gets wailing, as 
it does in upbeat, danceable fashion on "The Literary Lizard," the sheer volume 
of sound overcomes any stodginess. And the disc's novelty number, "Don't Mow 
Your Lawn," despite being too long, is the perfect call to revolution for the 
suburban '90s. Not your usual big-band fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent).

rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg's talents aren't limited to music. They 
think the two can even make movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Iovine and Knight are putting their money where their mouths are -- to 
the tune of $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the price of an 18-minute film being produced to showcase Snoop as a 
big-screen presence, and Dre as a force behind the camera. The story line 
revolves around "Murder Was the Case," a song from Snoop's debut album. The 
plan is to screen it in theaters nationwide as a bonus short before the regular 
feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Another goal, of course, is to sell more records.  
</P>
<P>
 The money is coming from Knight's Death Row Records and Iovine's Interscope, 
the companies that release Snoop's and Dre's recordings, and for their 
investment they're hoping to launch Snoop's acting career, a directing career 
for rap star and producer Dr. Dre, and a film production business for Death 
Row. The companies will also release a soundtrack CD and cassette from the 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a start," says Knight. "For us to get into movies and the things Snoop 
and Dre want to do, we have to crawl before we walk. This is a big step for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Philip G. Atwell, who has produced all of Snoop's music videos, says 
that "Murder" features state-of-the-art special effects and an R-rated plot, 
which he's keeping secret. 
</P>
<P>
 (In the song's sketchy narrative, Snoop is shot down in a gangsta ambush but 
makes a deal with the Devil for a luxurious eternal life -- and still ends up 
in prison.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure a lot of people will have a lot of things to say about it and I'll 
just leave it at that," Atwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing people are sure to speculate about even before the film is released 
is the relationship between the film and the real murder charges facing Snoop. 
The rapper has been charged along with his bodyguard and another man with 
murder in the shooting death of a 20-year-old man last August in West Los 
Angeles. Snoop's attorneys are claiming self defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no connection," Knight says of the film and the real murder case, 
which could go to trial in late September. The song is from Snoop's album, 
"DOGGYSTYLE," which was released well before the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it will probably be in the minds of theater owners as they consider 
whether to screen the film, as will past associations of violence with 
rap-oriented features. (Which movie the short will be paired with is still 
under negotiation.) 
</P>
<P>
 Atwell hopes that any fears will be allayed when theater owners see the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't shoot something that would incite violence," he says. Steve Hochman

 SNOOP ON THE ROAD: As Snoop Doggy Dogg climbs onto the silver screen, the Long 
Beach rapper is also set to step onto concert stages for his long-delayed tour. 
He was originally set to be featured on a Dr. Dre-headlined tour last year, but 
that trek was scrapped, in part due to Dre's own legal troubles (he's on 
probation for a series of violent incidents and still must be at home by 9 each 
night.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Snoop will finally headline his own tour (with the group Jodeci also 
on the bill), the question some are raising is whether he has waited too long 
after the release last October of "DOGGYSTYLE." 
</P>
<P>
 "His tour will be big but it would have been even bigger if it happened when 
the album had just come out," says Wendy Day, head of the Rap Coalition, a 
nonprofit organization that looks out for the interests of rappers. "He's 
almost at a point now of over-saturation. We've had a lot of Snoop in the past 
six months." 
</P>
<P>
 The delay has also given time for some anti-Snoop forces to coalesce, Day 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pickets and protests are possible at his shows," she says. "A lot of women 
don't like what he says about women on his record. He's different when you talk 
to him in person. But it's what he says on this record that people react to." 
</P>
<P>
 Other observers also fear that the fact that Snoop is charged with murder will 
bring out pro-police protesters who have in the past targeted such rappers as 
N.W.A., Ice-T and Tupac Shakur. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of negative feeling about him out there in the mainstream," 
says one record industry source who asked not to be named. "That feeling 
clashes strongly with the feeling in the rap community about him. I wouldn't be 
surprised to see some trouble on the dates." Dennis Hunt

 DEVELOPMENT ARRESTED: There are no sure things in pop music, but a lot of 
people would have bet on Arrested Development's second album as a shoo-in hit. 
After the Georgia rap group's 1992 debut sold more than 2.7 million copies and 
the group won two Grammy Awards -- including best new artist -- the new one was 
expected to be instant Top 10.  
</P>
<P>
 Not so far. "Zingalamaduni" entered the Billboard chart five weeks ago at No. 
55 and has been sinking ever since, currently to No. 135. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no surprise to the rap community, where observers say there's been no 
real street buzz about this album. The perception is that it's a mainstream 
album by a wholesome group that's out of touch with the hip, hard-core fans. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fate that's already befallen other wholesome rappers, including De La 
Soul and A Tribe Called Quest -- each of which made an impressive debut and 
never repeated the success.  
</P>
<P>
 Is Arrested Development just too nice for people to take seriously? 
</P>
<P>
 Even Daniel Glass, president of EMI Records, which releases the group's 
albums, says that has been a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The press made them into this goody-goody group that spoke nicely about 
women, nicely about overweight people and that's nonviolent," he says. "The 
media said we finally have a group that's positive. But that's not really who 
they are. It's a polarized picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Glass also says the initial cool reception for the album is just a minor 
setback. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking long range for this album," says Glass. "We're going to keep 
putting out singles." 
</P>
<P>
 Glass also notes that a lot has changed since AD's debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not 1992," he says. "The rap business has evolved. MTV is different 
too. They haven't supported this release. They were an integral part of the 
group's success. I hope they're not fickle and forget about the group." 
</P>
<P>
 Glass, though, is confident that the same fate won't befall EMI's other 
"wholesome" rap group, Digable Planets, whose second album is due in September. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a strong street buzz about this group," he says. "That album will be 
strong out of the box." DENNIS HUNT

 BELL RINGER: Al Bell is using the success his Bellmark Records has had with 
hits from Tag Team ("Whoomp! There It Is") and Prince ("The Most Beautiful Girl 
in the World") to return to his roots. 
</P>
<P>
 The former head of Stax Records, the bastion of '60s Memphis soul, has signed 
original Stax artists Tyrone Davis and former Dramatics Ron Banks and L.J. 
Reynolds (known as 2 of a Kind), as well as R&B guitarist Johnny (Guitar) 
Watson, with hopes of making their styles work in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 He's got a head start: These artists have been sampled regularly by Dr. Dre, 
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Ice Cube. Snoop also named the Dramatics as his favorite 
group and had Banks and Reynolds guest on his song "It's a Doggy Dogg World." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Bell: "This is an opportunity to preserve the music of our culture."

 TLC member Lisa (Left Eye) Lopes is still facing criminal charges and going 
through a drug rehab program in the wake of her allegedly starting the fire 
that destroyed the Atlanta mansion of her boyfriend, pro football star Andre 
Rison. But she's been allowed to work on the group's now-delayed second album 
as an outpatient. A spokesman for LaFace Records says it's three-fourths done 
and is definitely coming out in the fall, most likely mid-October. The first 
single will be "Creep." Plans for a TLC tour are still uncertain. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A&M is planning an album of old live tracks by the Police to be released in 
September, with a greatest-hits collection from ex-Policeman Sting possible for 
the following month. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sting is also one of the artists lined up for a star-studded Leonard Cohen 
tribute album, also featuring U2's Bono, Elton John, Billy Joel, Don Henley, 
Trisha Yearwood, Tori Amos, Aaron Neville, Daniel Lanois and Depeche Mode's 
Martin Gore -- all doing songs written by Cohen. The album, titled "Towers of 
Song," is due in early '95. . . .  
</P>

Accents" by Sub Pop band Red Red Meat and a version of "Century City" by San 
Diego's aMiniature. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Boy, are we embarrassed: We got the name wrong last week on Amy Grant's duet 
partner for her upcoming video and single "House of Love." It's Vince Gill. . . 
. And while we're at it, we had bogus info on the release date for Neil Young's 
"Sleeps With Angels." The album is due Aug. 16. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Toad the Wet Sprocket fans can look for two previously unreleased live 
recordings as bonus tracks on the group's next single, "Something's Always 
Wrong." The live numbers, "Don't Go Away" and "Corporal Brown," were recorded 
in concert in the band's hometown of Santa Barbara. Toad plays Wednesday at the 
Fairfax High School Auditorium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Simple Minds has re-teamed with Keith Forsey, who wrote and produced the 
Scottish band's biggest hit, "Don't You (Forget About Me)" from the movie "The 
Breakfast Club." Forsey produced the Jim Kerr-fronted group's album "Good News 
for the Next World," due Oct. 4. . . . Joe Jackson has taken another detour 
into his classical background for his next album, "Night Music," a guitar-less 
and drum-less collection of nocturnes, also due Oct. 4. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Cowboy Junkies have recorded the traditional folk song "The Water Is Wide" for 
the soundtrack of the Meryl Streep/Matthew Modine film "The River Wild." An 
album featuring the song and Maurice Jarre's score is due Sept. 13. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Weird Al Yankovic has tried his hand at video directing for "The Redneck 
Stomp," a clip by country comedian Jeff Foxworthy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Stipe, Henry Rollins, Lou Reed, William S. Burroughs, Sandra Bernhard 
and Johnette Napolitano are among those whose work is included in the book 
"Cause: Unrest," a collection benefiting Rock for Choice. The book includes all 
the pieces performed on the 1992 "Cause" spoken-word CD plus new material. . .

 Charlie Sexton is working with producer Malcolm Burn on his first album since 
the breakup of his band the Arc Angels. Sexton has been writing songs with 
Tonio K. . . .

 Veteran L.A. rocker Carla Olson has a new album, "Reap the Wind," due Tuesday 
on the small Watermelon label. Guests include former Rolling Stones guitarist

POP MUSIC CHARTS: LABEL IT HOT

 The controversy over a warning label on Compton-based rapper MC Eiht's "We 
Come Strapped" album certainly helped boost sales. It debuted at No. 6 on The 
Times' Southern California chart and No. 5 nationally. Epic Records got a lot 
of media attention by tacking a disclaimer on the label, distancing itself from 
the anti-cop lyrics. The "Forrest Gump" soundtrack continues to be a big seller 
-- remarkable considering it's double-CD set of oldies. TOP 10 ALBUMS

 One reason "Voodoo Lounge" is being hailed as the most appealing Rolling 
Stones album in years is that it is, in part, a return to the band's early 
blues roots. "Stone Rock Blues" focuses on those roots by dishing up the 
original versions of 18 R&B or blues tunes that the Stones have recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members represented: Chuck Berry (on six 
tracks, including "Little Queenie"), Buddy Holly ("Not Fade Away"), Howlin' 
Wolf ("Little Red Rooster") and Muddy Waters (five songs, including "Rollin' 
Stone"). 
</P>
<P>
 A splendid showcase.

 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four (excellent). A rating

 * Steve Perry, "For the Love of Strange Medicine," Columbia. Is it the 
familiar soaring voice (which so often falls splat! )? The overwrought, 
self-congratulatory solos? The hit single ("You Better Wait") about a runaway 
teen-age "beauty queen," sung/panted by a middle-aged occasional rock star? 
Something sells the former Journey frontman's records, but discerning pop music 
fans shouldn't waste a minute trying to figure out what.

overall thrust is a bit meandering, the album is ultimately engrossing.

 Chinese director Zhang Yimou is to his country's film industry what Kurosawa 
is to Japan, Satyajit Ray to India. His movies, pictorially bewitching and 
culturally trenchant, open China up for us cinematically, while his star (Gong 
Li, pictured, with Li Bao-Tian), is a face for her nation: radiant, mysterious, 
ambivalent. This film, one of Zhang's breakthrough pictures, is a dazzling, 
disturbing tale of infidelity and murder in a dye factory (Bravo Monday at 8 
p.m., again at 1 a.m.). Michael Wilmington

 Regis Wargnier's lush and poignant 1992 Oscar-winning French film is a 
romantic saga spanning the last quarter-centur of French rule in Southeast 
Asia.It tells the story of a beautiful French colonial (an Oscar-nominated 
Catherine Deneuve, pictured), a rich and powerful rubber plantation owner and 
her adopted daughter, a native princess, whose destinies become intertwined 
with that of their increasingly strife-torn country. Filmed in Vietnam and 
Malaysia, the film is gorgeous to look at. Although steeped in French elegance 
and irony, it's more like a vintage Hollywood movie in its scale and scope 
(CinemaxWednesday at 8 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

 Although in some ways as capable as its ex-Marine, ex-CIA hero (Harrison Ford, 
pictured) this 1992 release could use more of the gentleman's moxie. The second 
of technomaster Tom Clancy's novels to be filmed, it's a perfectly adequate 
action thriller-that neither disappoints nor exhilarates. Now a Naval Academy 
instructor, Ford's John Patrick Ryan, in London to give a speech and enjoy a 
family vacation, almost literally stumbles on an attempt by Irish terrorists to 
assassinate a cousin (James Fox) of the queen (HBO Thursday at 11 p.m.).

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; SHEREE J. WILSON FEELS VERY MUCH AT HOME ON THE 'WALKER, 
TEXAS' RANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheree J. Wilson wanted to play a strong woman on television. She was getting 
tired of being a decoration in small, obscure movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in Israel, three weeks into the filming of yet another low-budget flick, 
"Cold to the Touch," she noticed that co-star Chuck Norris was smiling at her 
"like the cat who ate the canary." 
</P>
<P>
 To her delighted surprise, Norris informed Wilson she'd landed the role as his 
co-star in his CBS series, "Walker, Texas Ranger." After he teased her that he 
was the person who gave final approval, the role of district attorney Alex 
Cahill was Wilson's. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a role she's extremely proud of. "She's a really great character to 
play," Wilson says from her Dallas home, where she's currently shooting the 
show despite the often "miserable" weather conditions. Temperatures of 105 
degrees with 100% humidity are not uncommon, and the show, which premiered in 
April, 1993, frequently shoots outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris confirms Wilson's enthusiasm whatever the conditions: "No matter how 
demanding or difficult the schedule, she always shows up with a smile on her 
face, sure to brighten frequently otherwise dreary days." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Wilson's beatific face that got her into the entertainment world as a 
model for the high-powered Wilhelmina modeling agency. In 18 months, Wilson did 
30 commercials for Clairol, Sea Breeze, Revlon, Maybelline and Keri Lotion, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
 With two small movies ("Crime Wave," "Fraternity Vacation"), as well as 
several TV roles ("Velvet," "Kane and Abel" and "Our Family Honor") under her 
belt, she won a role on the hit series "Dallas" in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was April and started out as J.R.'s (Larry Hagman) nemesis," she recalls. 
"She was the richest woman on the show. I used to describe April as a bitch on 
wheels. Then they made me a reformed lady. I even married Bobby (Patrick 
Duffy). During the wedding, I was eight months pregnant in real life and they 
had this huge bouquet covering my stomach! But by then I'd worked on the show 
for four years and I needed a break." 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate Wilson's departure, April was "gunned down in the typical 
'Dallas' glory," while she and Bobby honeymooned in Paris, Wilson says, 
laughing. "I got to go out with a bang," she adds with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson took a break to spend time with her son, Luke, now 4, and her 
businessman husband, Paul deRobbio. When she returned to work, she chose both 
guest television roles as well as movie parts. She starred in Showtime's "Past 
Tense," which aired last month. 
</P>
<P>
 More movie roles aren't out of the picture, either. "I'm still interested in 
pursuing features. It's a totally different ball game working in television, 
where you work so quickly. It doesn't allow you time to really prepare and 
think a character and scenes through. Films give you creative license and you 
can develop idiosyncrasies for your character. On 'Walker,' we shoot two hours 
in two weeks. You do two hours in three months for a film." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the show's breakneck pace, Alex proves to be a significant woman's 
role for Wilson. "I'm getting away from that 'Dallas' stuff where the women 
were often used as decoration. I don't wear designer labels any more. They do 
dress me nice, but listen, OK, a woman can be strong, competent and hold her 
own, but I can still be a woman. Just because you're female doesn't mean you 
don't enjoy being romantic and sexy." 
</P>
<P>
 She may get to sample some of the latter in the show's upcoming season. As 
Norris puts it, "It's been great fun watching our respective characters develop 
and wondering just where the relationship may lead." 
</P>
<P>
 "Walker, Texas Ranger" airs Saturdays at 10 p.m. on CBS.

 It is the day after my birthday, Sunday Calendar (July 17), and I'm wondering: 
"Will it surprise me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Schwarzenegger has a new movie out, so we get an interview with its 
director, James Cameron. (No matter how much I liked "Terminator 2," some of us 
could care less what the boys of summer are doing now.) 
</P>
<P>
 There's the cover story on artist Bruce Nauman. Looks interesting, but I 
ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
 Give me something I want to read, please! 
</P>
<P>
 Here we go. Not one, but four stories. I've hit a birthday jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for the fine interviews with actresses Vanessa Williams. Susan Sarandon 
and Julie Walters and the female rock group 7 Year Bitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Their words transcended the superficial and mundane. Each actress spoke of her 
children in the highest light. Each expressed deep care for loved ones and 
issues outside the business of their work. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt a better birthday chant coming on: 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's smash some stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's activate some social change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's love our children. And our men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's rock 'n roll!" 
</P>

 I appreciate your article on Vanessa Williams and the mention in the lead 
paragraph of my old high school, Horace Greeley, in Chappaqua, N.Y. 
("Untangling the Web," by Patrick Pacheco, July 17): 
</P>
<P>
 I was graduated from the school in 1958, and I have many fond memories of my 
years there. I am especially proud of the fact that Williams is the first black 
Miss America. In my 13 years in the Chappaqua school system, we had no black 
students, and it was impossible for some minorities to buy a house in the 
community. Now it is a model of ethnic and racial diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and her family have returned there so that they can take advantage of 
the outstanding education system and a beautiful natural habitat.

 Thank you for Gene Seymour's insightful interview with Susan Sarandon ("She's 
Her Own Best Counsel," July 17). I have long been in awe of her craft and 
considered her beauty without equal. I applaud her (and Tim Robbins') decisions 
to place their family, politics and personal lives before the demands of 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Sarandon is not a slave to her craft is especially heartening in 
the light of the recent suicide of "Savannah," the actress who apparently 
became a helot to the lure of stardom in Tinseltown and whose story was 
chronicled in that same day's Metro section. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Fuller said: "Genius will live and thrive without training, but it 
does not the less reward the watering pot and pruning knife." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Sarandon apparently has found a bountiful spring to nourish her life, 
and it doesn't require standing before a lens.

RESTAURANT NEWS: HOW MANY COURSES DOES IT TAKE TO EARN A DIPLOMA? 20

 Citrus' Michel Richard is taking on San Francisco with the launch of Bistro M 
in the new Milano Hotel Monday, and Bay Area French chefs are preparing to meet 
the challenge. In fact, one of San Francisco's best, Alain Rondelli, has 
countered with an incredible 20-course tasting menu at his eponymous Clement 
Street restaurant. The Paris-born chef, who once cooked for the former French 
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and spent six years as sous-chef to 
three-star Michelin-rated Marc Meneau in Burgundy, insists that Richard's 
arrival on the scene has nothing to do with his new format at the modest 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy for Michel. He's a sweetheart and deserves to be successful in San 
Francisco. What I cook is very particular to me. I do great food, but I know I 
can go further and do better. And that's why I want to do this 20-course menu." 
</P>
<P>
 The prix-fixe menu, available three nights a week beginning mid-August, 
requires a two-day advance notice and is available only to parties of four or 
more at $150 per person -- and that's excluding tax, tip and wine. Although 
Rondelli won't be serving his signature tripe dish, he has other delicacies 
planned in lieu of the slow-cooked cow intestines. "I'll have some marrow, some 
ham hocks, squab, lobster. There will be two or three cold appetizers, two or 
three hot, two or three fish dishes, three or four meat courses, one or two 
vegetables and three desserts." 
</P>
<P>
 Each customer who manages to finish the five-hour marathon meal will be 
presented with a diploma. "I want to educate my customers about my culture," 
says Rondelli. "Part of being French is spending time at the table talking and 
eating. Here everybody is in a hurry." 
</P>

<P>
 ROCK CRUMBLES: Hans Rockenwagner and the Kimpton Group have parted company and 
the chef is no longer affiliated with Rox, the restaurant the San 
Francisco-based hotel and restaurant management company launched last year in 
the 140-room Beverly Prescott Hotel adjacent to Beverly Hills. Named for the 
chef, Rockenwagner was only its consultant and has no stake in the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kimpton Group asked me to run the restaurant and I've done that 
throughout the year," says Rockenwagner, who owns the California-eclectic 
restaurant that bears his name as well as the sandwich shop Rock and Rolls -- 
both in Santa Monica. "But I'm happy with the way things are now. I'm finishing 
up with a big smile and that's really all I can say." 
</P>

<P>
 VERBATIM: "Peninsula Beverly Hills Hotel announces the opening of its newest 
restaurant, the Roof Garden Dining Terrace, where the sophisticated informality 
of both the food and the fifth-floor setting far exceed expectations of outdoor 
dining in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . Through its deliberately small size, the 42-seat restaurant exudes an 
air of intimacy and exclusivity. Surrounded by large potted plants, the 
open-air dining area is casual and comfortable and patrons are shaded by 
oversized sand-colored Bahama umbrellas imported from Germany -- 'the BMW of 
umbrellas.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MORE OPENINGS: Capri Cafe & Bar has opened in the Baldwin Park Marriott. The 
Mediterranean menu features entrees in the $8.50 to $15.50 range. . . . 
National Sports Grill plans to open another branch in Santa Ana in September. 
Similar to the original in Buena Park, the new location will feature large 
portions of American cuisine, 35 brands of beer, 50 television monitors, three 
satellite dishes, a dozen tournament-sized pool tables and NTN, an interactive 
electronic game that pits patrons against players in other restaurants across 
the country. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 CLOSING: Los Angeles diners will have to find someplace else to dine on cheese 
fondue now that Andreas Tessi, the former publisher of the Epicurean Rendezvous 
restaurant guide, has quietly closed Andreas, the French-Swiss bistro he opened 
18 months ago on Melrose.

 HAPPY ANNIVERSARY: Warszawa in Santa Monica is celebrating its 15th 
anniversary by offering a special three-course dinner Monday through Wednesday. 
At the area's only Polish restaurant, for $14.50 customers can choose from 10 
entrees including salmon mousse kolduny (tiny dumplings) and pierogi (Polish 
ravioli) with mushrooms.

<P>
 STOCKPOT: Pacific Dining Car now offers a magic show on Friday evenings. Who 
knows, maybe magician Jim Warren will be able to make the fat grams disappear 
from the thick prime beef served at the venerable downtown steakhouse. . . . 
The Bicycle Shop Cafe in West L.A. now serves bouillabaisse for $15.50 every 
Friday and Saturday from 5 to midnight.

 Robert Levine's article "Coming Attractions Come On-Line" (Film Clips, July 
10), about video clips from movies being available via computer network "for 
the first time, starting two weeks ago," must have come as a big surprise to 
Paramount, TriStar, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and other studios. They've made such 
programs available to subscribers of CompuServe since last year. 
</P>
<P>
 ShowBiz Forum on CompuServe was the first to introduce these clips produced by 
Hollywood Online and has presented interactive multimedia programs from films 
such as "The Age of Innocence," "Addams Family Values" and others. Our current 
features among more than a dozen films include "Forrest Gump," "Speed," "Blown 
Away" and even cult TV shows such as "Dr. Who." For all of these, there are 
video segments, sound clips and interactive electronic magazines that include 
production notes, cast bios, still photos and story information. 
</P>
<P>
 If Levine tires of listening to hyenas on his computer, he's welcome to visit 
ShowBiz Forum on CompuServe to get Tom Hanks saying, "My name is Forrest Gump. 
People call me Forrest Gump." Or even Dennis Miller giving his hysterical 
"Happy Fellow" routine from his HBO talk show.

 I am a Brit in L.A., and your "Our Favorite Quote" on Page 2 caught my eye 
July 17.The actress's name was unfamiliar and I thought to myself, "Ah, a new 
British actress with exactly my thoughts on this town." 
</P>
<P>
 I turned to Page 24 to see who this actress was -- she's not a new actress at 
all. Her name is Julie Walters, not Rita . She played Rita in a movie. How 
could you make this glaring error? 
</P>
<P>
 I can only presume the proof-reader job is currently available and would 
therefore like to apply.

 I have always enjoyed Peter Plagens' fanciful and witty writing. But I have 
never considered his opinions the definitive statement of contemporary art 
history. I'd like to expand on his use of the theater, cast-of-characters and 
basketball metaphors in his article on Bruce Nauman ("An Artist and His Roots," 
July 17): 
</P>
<P>
 The first act of my play would be over in an instant. Donald Judd and Ed 
Kienholz would be dead. Bruce Nauman, his retrospective over, would fade away 
and disappear in a neon-lit stage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second act, the cast would be all new and enormous. Among the players 
would be the cheated-upon wives, the ex-mistresses, women gallery owners, 
primary nurturers and teachers of progeny of the disappeared good-ol'-boys 
club. These women would remember their fallen and confess their sins of 
compliance. They would make a blood oath never to be in collusion again. 
</P>
<P>
 A joyous and raucous racket would be heard as the curtain rises on the third 
act. Women artists' daughters and granddaughters (all artists themselves) would 
be engaged in a volleyball game. Occasionally a warning would be sung out: 
"Move the babies further back from the playing court!"

 1. Everyone knows that all basketball is due to a repressed desire for 
artistic ability. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The distinction between teaching and creating is false and phobic. Some 
artists, such as Cimabue, Rubens, Hofmann, Leger, Diebenkorn and Thiebaud, 
could hack and even relish the engagement; others can't -- particularly if they 
have to drag an enormous ego across town to the classroom. After all, what is 
journalistic criticism but a teacher in search of a larger pulpit?

 Thank you and Peter Plagens, for the cover story on Bruce Nauman and the 
Pasadena art scene.

<P>
 My mother was the former Elizabeth Flowers Gibbons, who modeled for Vogue and 
Harpers Bazaar from 1936 to 1947. She passed away last summer, but in the 1950s 
and '60s she was part of the Pasadena Art Alliance with Eudora Moore, et al. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she's no longer with us, I cannot ask her about Nauman, but she left 
my brother and me a Billy Al Bengston, as well as a few of the Pasadena Art 
Museum's books from that period.

CAMERON AND UNIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Can He Do Side-Splitting Action?," David Kronke's interview with 
writer-director James Cameron (July 17): 
</P>
<P>
 The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes, representing more 
than 24,000 members in Southern California who are engaged in the "below-the- 
line" crafts on motion picture productions, deeply resents James Cameron's 
statement to The Times. Quoting from your story: 
</P>
<P>
 "They really stuck it to us," he says of the unions. "But I'm not gonna be 
stuck twice. We tried to negotiate with them and I told them that if we were 
not able to come to terms that I would shoot out of the country next time." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Cameron failed to inform The Times that IATSE has negotiated 
with him on his productions, including "True Lies," where the union agreed to 
cuts in wages and working conditions. Although it was difficult, IATSE agreed 
to such changes because of his threat to take the picture out of the country 
and deprive our members of work opportunities. Now he publicly criticizes the 
craft unions and again threatens that he will deprive American workers of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 We would like him to explain to the public, our members and the motion picture 
industry why, with outrageous budgets of reportedly more than $100 million per 
picture, he can be so insensitive to the needs and very livelihood of American 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron is an example of how greed can take precedence over love of country 
and his fellow workers.

<P>
 James Cameron asserts that he is taking "Spiderman,' his next picture for 20th 
Century Fox, outside the United States because he was unable to negotiate 
satisfactory terms with film industry unions on his latest extravaganza, "True 
Lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the film technician's union scale is the same whether the picture costs 
100, 50, 25 or 10 million dollars. Naturally, the bigger the picture, the 
bigger the crew, the more paychecks to sign. But if one compares union costs to 
the creative "above-the-line" salaries, fighter jets and state-of- the-art 
special effects used in "Lies," they are merely a nick in the sign that says 
"Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron stated: "We tried to negotiate with them (the unions) and I told them 
that if we were not able to come to terms that I would shoot out of the country 
next time." This marks the first time in memory that a major director, in clear 
and forthright terms, told of his plans to eradicate jobs from the lifeblood 
industry of Southern California, not because of story, time period or location 
but solely because of the American film unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron's claims that the unions will not "negotiate" are preposterous, for 
these are anything but negotiating sessions. Producers meet with union 
representatives in pre-production and essentially decide how much the union is 
going to give up on the contract. No holiday pay, no vacation pay, the hiring 
of non-union personnel to fill more and more positions -- the list goes on and 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 This is about simple ethics. Right from wrong. What's good for the community 
and what's not. Either way, Cameron and 20th Century Fox will make millions, 
but who's going to be left to fix that sign?

<P>
 As a proud member of Local 659, International Photographers Guild, I take 
exception to James Cameron's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 The article quotes Cameron as vowing to bring down costs on his next feature 
by avoiding working with American unions. What specific unions is he speaking 
of? He is very vague. Is he referring to the unions of which he is a member -- 
the Directors Guild and the Writers Guild? 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, is a high-powered director-producer attempting to shift the blame 
for a feature film gone way over budget onto hard-working, middle-class 
craftspeople who create and execute his "carefully sculpted image"? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't begrudge the actors' high salaries. They are very talented, and using 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's name and face can garner a studio a high return on its 
investment. I don't begrudge Cameron's high salary. He is a very talented 
director-writer with a proven track record. I am hurt that these well-paid 
individuals would begrudge we union members a decent middle-class living, safe 
working conditions and health and welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 I love being a craftsperson in the film industry. I just hope that in the 
future the studios, producers, directors, and craftspeople can adhere to the 
equitable agreements already reached through fair negotiations, so we can all 
just do what we do best, make films and television. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 So director-writer Cameron feels that American unions share the blame for the 
absurdly high budget of "True Lies"? While I doubt that Cameron was willing to 
listen to the crew's feelings about his own ridiculous salary, he says that he 
asked for concessions from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the record shows that IATSE has been giving more than it has been 
getting throughout the last several contracts. Unions are in enough trouble 
without critiques from rich filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 What about Cameron and his own unions, the directors and writers' guilds, as 
well as the actors' union, the Screen Actors Guild? They cruise along quite 
nicely, even on shows without IATSE contracts, where crews are frequently 
overworked or underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 So when a big-budget show like "True Lies" comes along, under the 
self-admitted demanding tutelage of a mega-director like Cameron, featuring a 
mega-star like Arnold Schwarzenegger, with a mega-schedule, is it any wonder 
that the hard-working crew wants to benefit from the (rarer and rarer) 
opportunity to earn good paychecks? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Cameron and his ilk (remember Bruce Willis?) should consider this 
karmic compensation for past (and future) abuses and short-changing of the 
below-the-line craftspersons in the film industry.

SICK OF SEATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been a regular reader of The Times ' pop music section for over 10 
years. The July 17 issue has convinced me that you are content covering the 
latest trendy and ultimately overrated bands from the Pacific Northwest (read: 
Soundgarden and 7 Year Bitch). 
</P>
<P>
 All I can say is: Where's the beef? The interview with Chris Cornell of 
Soundgarden illustrates my point. Cornell claims his musical influences to be 
such post-punk Amer-Indie bands as the Minutemen, Husker Du and the Meat 
Puppets. If this is true, than why does Soundgarden make such derivative 
Zeppelinesque rock 'n' roll? 
</P>
<P>
 Why does The Times so nonchalantly regurgitate the nonsense that bands like 
Soundgarden are speaking to an angry and alienated younger generation? 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, The Times' own poll revealed in the same day's paper that the 
existence of a young, angry generation is a media fabrication based on bogus 
surveys. I am in my 20s, and I guarantee you that none of these Seattle bands 
speak for me or even communicate with me on a meaningful level. 
</P>
<P>
 It has to be clear to anyone with any sense of individuality or integrity that 
the whole "Seattle scene" has been nothing but a great marketing strategy to 
sell millions of records by derivative and dull bands. To twist a lyric by San 
Pedro's beloved Minutemen, "This is not Bob Dylan to me. . . ."

THERE HAS TO BE A FAIRER WAY TO SET CABLE RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Washington they say that cable rates have dropped 8.49% for the nation's 25 
largest municipalities ("FCC Claims Big Drop in Cable Subscriber Rates," July 
15). Here's what's happening in one small town: Within the past decade, Century 
Cable's rates for basic service have gone from $8 a month to the current 
$34.39, an increase of 325%.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says inflation 
during this period has risen just 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has redefined "basic" to exclude the most desirable satellite 
channels that had formerly been provided as part of "basic." "Pay channels" 
such as HBO are in addition to the $34.39 rate. They've added FCC-ordered 
"must-carries" and several new channels with programming that none of us got to 
vote on but are forced to pay for anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
 Until we can vote with our dollars and switch to another cable system in our 
area, setting a reasonable rate of return is the only fair way to determine 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, I just opened my latest mail from Century and find that their rate 
has gone up again, to $36.41 beginning now!

WHAT WILL PHONE COMPETITION COST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So the Public Utilities Commission is going to do it to us again (PUC 
Tentatively OKs Opening of Toll-Call Market," July 21). It blithely decrees 
that the local telephone companies can increase our basic rates by 35% in the 
case of Pacific Bell and 79% in the case of GTE.When was the last time any of 
us received an earnings increase of 35% or 79%? 
</P>
<P>
 This is done in the name of expanding competition. Every time some government 
entity talks about expanding competition, we the consumers take it in the neck 
-- and, of course, in the wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 One would have thought that the PUC existed to represent the interests of 
California residents, the consumers of the products sold by a monopolistic 
industry. This clearly is not the case. There can be no doubt that the PUC 
exists to guarantee profits to the utilities industry. The effrontery of that 
commission is staggering.

U.S. CITIZENS NEED A 'BUY AMERICAN' PUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To my knowledge, no major political figure is making a point of encouraging 
the American people to buy American-made products. 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S. Economic Outlook Better Than It Seems?" (July 20) reported that the 
United States ran a trade deficit of $9.2 billion in May of this year; yet 
since then, not a single one of our leaders has said much about it.Certainly 
President Clinton hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The $9.2-billion trade deficit in May meant that the United States bought $9.2 
billion more from other countries than other countries bought from us. Had the 
people of the United States kept that $9.2 billion at home rather than buying 
foreign-made goods with it, they could have used it to pay 4,600,000 
out-of-work Americans $2,000 each for working in May. 
</P>
<P>
 But they didn't. Instead they sent the money and the jobs to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 I am astounded that this seemed to go unnoticed by our leaders. I can't 
understand why Clinton or somebody else high up hasn't gone before the American 
people and said something like this to them: "Hey folks, stop buying those 
foreign-made goods and start buying American-made goods instead. How can you 
expect your fellow citizens to get jobs and pay taxes if you won't buy what 
they make on their jobs?"

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: SECTOR OFFERINGS ARE BEST TAKEN IN SMALL DOSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anyone needed evidence that any sector mutual fund can be a flash in the 
pan, it came a couple of weeks ago from the Oppenheimer funds group. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the New York firm announced it will ask shareholders in its Global 
Bio-Tech fund to vote Sept. 19 on a proposal that would change the fund's name 
and investment strategy, essentially transforming Bio-Tech into a broader 
emerging-growth portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Makeovers are nothing new in the mutual fund business, but it's rare to see 
fund companies tinker with what recently had been such a winning formula. In 
1991, Oppenheimer Global Bio-Tech had the winningest formula of all. It scored 
a sizzling 121% gain and finished as the top mutual fund that year. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 2 1/2 years since then, the threat of health care reform has 
sedated the fund, which depreciated more than 40% since January, 1992, and has 
seen shareholders dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
 This episode underscores the high-profit, high-risk nature of sector 
portfolios, which, unlike most other mutual funds, concentrate their holdings 
in the stocks of a particular industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they lack diversification, these funds can be especially volatile and 
vulnerable to investment fads. They are best handled in small doses, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of sector funds is a good one, but I think most people tend to 
switch in and out at the wrong times," says Larry Marx, co-manager of Neuberger 
& Berman's Selected Sectors fund in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 That certainly happened last year to utility portfolios, the single largest 
sector-fund category. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tail end of a decade of exceptionally good returns, shareholders 
flooded into these funds in 1993, boosting their collective assets to $27 
billion from $17 billion in 1992, according to Lipper Analytical Services of 
Summit, N.J. So what did these new shareholders get in return? An average 9.9% 
loss during the first half of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the recent woes to hit the health and utility areas, other sector 
setbacks have befallen gold, environmental, energy/natural resources and, to a 
lesser extent, real estate portfolios within the last five years. However, the 
financial and technology industries have done well. 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps people coming back to sector funds is their explosive profit 
potential. This potential was illustrated recently in a simple study by the 
Value Line Mutual Fund Survey, a fund-tracking publication based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Value Line wanted to see how well investors watching a short list of just five 
sectors -- financial, energy/resources, gold, technology and utilities -- could 
have fared if they were able to put all of their money into what turned out to 
be the top industry each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Value Line tracked the performance of these five sectors from 1973 through 
1993 and determined that someone able to predict each year's winning industry 
would have earned a sizzling 34% compounded annual return, equivalent to 
turning a $10,000 initial investment into $4.65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 This sector strategy would have done substantially better than, say, 
accurately timing every 5% move up or down in the Standard & Poor's 500 index 
over the same 21-year period. An astute market timer able to turn this nifty 
trick would have scored a 27% compounded return, converting the original 
$10,000 into $1.52 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply buying and holding an S&P 500 fund would have generated an 11% 
compounded return, boosting the $10,000 to about $96,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But does this mean investors should line up to buy sector funds? 
</P>
<P>
 No way, says Value Line's editor, Stephen Savage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main point (of the study) was that fund managers can add more value 
through wise security selection than they can by trying to time the market," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sector funds were merely used to illustrate the highest potential of astute 
stock-picking. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither scenario outlined in the Value Line study is realistic. Nobody could 
time every 5% swing in the market for more than two decades. Nor could a sector 
investor pick the top industry for 21 consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 So how should investors regard sector funds? 
</P>
<P>
 Savage recommends that investors keep their sector-fund holdings to a maximum 
10% of assets. But even these should be long-term plays rather than bets on 
next quarter's or next year's hot industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Investing heavily in what turned out to be the worst sector each year would be 
more disastrous than missing every market turn, Savage adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Another approach would be to let a fund manager do the sector surfing for you. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Marx and co-manager Kent Simons focus the Neuberger & Berman fund 
around five or six sectors at any one time, as opposed to the much broader 
diversification typical of most funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The managers follow a value-oriented investment style to reduce the odds of 
buying into an industry near its peak. Currently, most of the fund's assets 
have been put to work in financial, technology and media/entertainment firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuberger & Berman Selected Sectors (no-load; (800) 877-9700) got off to a 
rough start after it was renamed and restructured in 1989, but it bounced back 
to beat the market in 1992 and 1993, and it's slightly ahead so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other funds with decent track records that tend to follow a 
sector-concentrated approach include the Clipper fund (no load; (800) 
776-5033), Crabbe Huson Special (no load; (800) 541-9732), New Economy (5.75% 
load; (800) 421-0180), Putnam New Opportunities (5.75% load; (800) 225-1581), 
Third Avenue Value (4.5% load; (800) 443-1021) and Warburg, Pincus Growth & 
Income (no load; (800) 257-5614). 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than take big bets on just one sector, all of these funds tend to 
spread their holdings among at least half a dozen industries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wrap-fee accounts that make use of mutual funds aren't necessarily cheaper 
than those that utilize individual stocks and bonds, warns Cerulli Associates 
of Boston. Even so, the consulting firm reports that fund-oriented wrap 
programs are on the upswing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the traditional wrap program, a broker helps an investor select and monitor 
an appropriate money manager, who tailors a portfolio of stocks or bonds for 
that person. All trading commissions as well as compensation for the broker and 
manager are wrapped into a single fee of 2.5% to 3% a year. 
</P>

 With wrap programs built around mutual funds, the broker's yearly pay runs 
about 1% to 1.5%, but regular fund expenses also must be considered. "Adding 
the two types of fees, the total costs of participating in mutual fund wraps 
can surpass 3% in some programs," says Cerulli Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 A more obvious benefit for investors is that fund wrap programs typically 
require only a $25,000 minimum investment, compared with $100,000 on programs 
built around individual stocks and bonds.

 The Invesco Funds Group of Denver is coming out with two new global sector 
funds in August. The company's Worldwide Capital Goods fund hopes to profit 
from the global restructuring trend, which has made manufacturers more 
efficient. Invesco's Worldwide Communications fund will invest in telephone, 
computer, entertainment and similar types of firms around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Both funds ((800) 525-8085) require a $1,000 minimum investment and are 
marketed without a sales charge or load.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: TAX LAW AND THE REPLACEMENT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. We are buying a new house for less than we sold our old home. However, the 
new residence requires improvements. Will those count toward the purchase price 
and reduce or eliminate any potential tax we might owe on our deferred profit? 
Also, because my husband is older than 55, we are able to transfer our property 
tax base from our old house to our new one. However, we know this transfer 
works only if the new house is of equal or lesser value than the old. Will the 
improvements we make increase the value of the home and wipe out our chances to 
transfer the property tax base? -- C.P . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Permanent improvements made to a newly purchased home within 24 months of 
the sale of the old home are considered a part of the purchase price of the new 
home. So, if you complete your remodeling within the required time, the costs 
of any permanent improvements would reduce or eliminate any potential taxable 
gain you face on the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 You should have little or no problem transferring your old property tax base 
to your new home. So long as one of you is older than age 55 and the price of 
the home you purchase is equal to or less than the home you sold, your old 
assessed value will be carried forward to your new home. (These transfers are 
allowed for moves within each of the state's 58 counties and between a handful 
of counties that have elected to participate in the intra-county transfer 
program.) 
</P>
<P>
 The value of any improvements you make after purchasing the home would be 
added to its initial assessed value; the improvements will not trigger a 
wholesale reassessment of the house. Furthermore, if the improvements are 
completed within 24 months of the home's purchase and if their cost plus the 
purchase prices does not exceed the sale price of your current home, you would 
not be subject to any increase in your property tax base. 2-Year Rule on Home 
Replacement Is Firm 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is there any way to apply for an extension on the time the government 
allows us to purchase a home with the untaxed proceeds from a home sale? Due to 
a divorce and a job loss, I have not been able to purchase a home within the 
24-month period the tax code specifies. My replacement period expires next 
month. -- T.F.N . 
</P>
<P>
 A. The government allows almost no exemptions to the 24-month home replacement 
period. You must purchase a replacement home within 24 months of selling your 
house or pay taxes on any profit realized from the sale. The replacement home 
can be purchased 24 months before or after the original home is sold; the 
government allows either. 
</P>
<P>
 The only taxpayers exempted from this regulation are members of the armed 
forces called to active duty and workers whose jobs require that they move 
overseas. Care and Feeding of U.S. Savings Bonds 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I have found it difficult to purchase U.S. Savings Bonds at my branch bank. 
What can I do? Also, will you explain what interest rate these bonds are 
currently paying and what rate I am guaranteed to get? How is that interest 
paid? It seems more complicated that it really should be. -- B.L . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Several years ago, the Federal Reserve Bank reorganized and streamlined its 
Savings Bond sales operations. As a result, only one Federal Reserve bank, the 
one in Kansas City, actually issues Savings Bonds. Private banks, which used to 
keep a stash of bonds of all denominations on hand for immediate sale to 
customers, now only process applications for bonds for issuance in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers can get bond applications from their local banks or call the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Kansas City at (800) 333-2919 for an application. The form must 
be mailed to Kansas City along with a check for the appropriate amount. Bonds 
are returned by mail to the purchaser within several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly issued Series EE bonds currently pay a guaranteed minimum interest rate 
of 4% for the first five years after issuance. Bonds held longer than five 
years pay the higher of the 4% guaranteed rate or the then-current market 
variable interest rate. Bonds held more than five years are currently paying 
4.7%. The market variable interest rate is adjusted twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds are purchased for half of face value. They accrue interest as they are 
held and upon maturity may be redeemed at face value. Series EE bonds issued 
now mature in 18 years. Interest on general purpose U.S. Savings Bonds is 
exempt from state and local taxes, but is subject to federal income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, bonds purchased for a child's college education may be exempt from 
federal taxes if the family qualifies for the program. Eligibility for the 
College Saver program depends on a family's adjusted gross income at the time 
the bonds are redeemed. College Saver bonds must be issued in the names of the 
parents, not the students. Property's Original Tax Basis Survives 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I sold a piece of property several years ago and accepted installment 
payments. I am still owed about $73,000, most of which is pure profit. I am 
getting on in years and wonder about the tax liabilities on this note my heirs 
may face. -- W.A.  
</P>
<P>
 A. The tax basis of a property subject to an installment sale note or trust 
deed is not treated to a step-up in value upon the death of the note holder. 
Your heirs will inherit your original tax basis on the property in question and 
when they collect on the $73,000 note, they will be subject to the same income 
tax requirements as you if you collect on it. The payoff of an installment note 
after the beneficiary's death is one of several items the government considers 
"income in respect to a decedent."

LEADING SCHOOLS AREN'T ONLY PLACES FOR MBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "In Terms of Quality, Some MBA Schools Succeed Only to a Degree" (July 10), 
Judy B. Rosener leads the reader to believe that MBA students have access to 
full-time faculty members only at the top "five-star" MBA programs.She states 
that most courses offered by other programs are taught by part-time lecturers 
or working professionals. This is certainly not the case at Loyola Marymount 
University. This fall, 91% of our MBA courses will be taught by doctorally 
qualified full-time faculty members.

 No matter who wins the race, history will be made at the 1995 America's 
Cup.This time, for the first time in 144 years, there will be an all-women team 
competing in the waters off San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 And these women aren't landlubbers thrown together for novelty's sake. Between 
them they've earned Olympic medals for rowing, championed yachts, learned to 
design boats and wind surfed a Peruvian lake in a day. They've navigated great 
lakes and cruised through a few sounds. These women are sailors . 
</P>
<P>
 They'll be one of three American teams competing against eight teams from five 
countries. It won't be easy. But trailblazing never is.

 In our fair city, the crape myrtles, jacarandas, oleanders and jasmine add 
perfumy sensual flair to the flowering oaks, the breeze-blown palms, the leafy 
sycamores and the stately eugenia hedges. Who can resist alfresco? It's the

 Classical: Doing it outdoors recently were Joan and Frank Thompson in 
Pasadena. They hosted an elegant musicale on their acoustically perfect terrace 
with Los Angeles opera stars Suzanne Guzman and Daniel Ebbers. Then came the 
sit-down dinner for 70 on their grassy front lawn. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 And Calypso in Mood: Around the corner, good neighbors Fran and Rob Lynch 
kindly canceled a calypso steel band they had hired for their Caribbean 
Evening. They thought vibes might waft over to the Thompsons' space and spoil 
their opera. But, the cottons were swaying and the pin a coladas were 
flourishing around the Lynch pool. And, later, the Lynches moved about 80 onto 
their front green for a seated dinner around brilliant cloths spiked with palms 
fronds in the shadows of the San Gabriel Mountains. The party didn't break till 
past midnight.

 Summery Siesta: Of such is the Southland's summer. At the Thompsons, toasts 
came in dozens celebrating Dr. Frank Thompson's birthday. Because the Thompsons 
actually are celebrating his birthday today at Irvine Cove, the early dinner 
caught friends off guard. But innovative types such as Joe Coulombe, Art 
Pizzinat, John Maechling and Sue Femino have vibrant minds and are never at 
loss for accolades. Special friends from Atlanta, Bob and Ann Holder (he's 
co-chair of the Atlanta Organizing Committee for the Olympics in 1996), flew in 
for hugs and kisses.

 Private, but Fund Raising: Julio Iglesias has been thrilling audiences for 
children's fund-raisers since he became involved with UNICEF in 1989. This

Iglesias' cause -- children of Mexico and El Salvador.

 Splash: At the party for artist-New Mexico rancher Bruce Nauman, whose show 
opened last week at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Joan and Fred Nicholas were 
standing near their London house guest, theatrical agent Eric Flackfield, when, 
splash, Eric inadvertently plunged into host Dan Melnick's Beverly Hills pool. 
Flackfield and Melnick agreed the misstep was cooler than battle -- they met in 
Africa during World War II. At the party Richard Koshalek, with his wife, 
Betty, was getting compliments on his new five-year contract as museum 
director.

Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens. He succeeds Marion 
(Mrs. Earle M.) Jorgensen, who has been elected Trustee Emeritus. Mullin is 
also the newly elected chair of Occidental College (his alma mater) and is 
serving as chairman of the Music Center Foundation . . . And the St. John's 
Hospital and Health Center Foundation trustees, revving up for fund raising 
after the devastation of the Jan. 17 earthquake, have elected four prominent

Donna F. Tuttle, according to Waldo H. Burnside, trustees president. Elsewhere

Rodeo Drive merchants raffled at "Bach Hits the Beach -- the Sequel!" Of

while the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra played Bach, Mozart, Handel, Vivaldi

LAKESIDE ROMANCES; L'AUBERGE DU PERE BISE, LAKE ANNECY, FRANCE; LIVING IT UP AT 
TWO EUROPEAN LUXURY HOTELS, WHERE WATERS LAP AT SHORELINES, THE SURROUNDINGS 
ARE INTOXICATING AND THE DINING IS POSITIVELY SINFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS, Andrews, editor of Traveling in Style magazine, is working 
on a book on the cooking of Nice and Liguria. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes I wonder if I deserve Pere Bise. Sometimes, as I turn through the 
gates of this remarkable old hotel-restaurant in the Haute Savoie region of 
France, into the little gravel courtyard ringed with flowers and flowering 
trees, I ask myself if I've really been all that good. 
</P>
<P>
 L'Auberge du Pere Bise, to give it its full name, inspires that kind of 
thinking because it seems so much like paradise. Located on the banks of Lake 
Annecy, in the village of Talloires, about 350 miles southeast of Paris and 30 
miles south of Geneva, Pere Bise is a splendid place, at once elegant and 
easygoing, charming and sophisticated. It is hardly the most luxurious hotel in 
France (or even on Lake Annecy), and its restaurant, though very good, can seem 
old-fashioned. But in its exquisite geography, and in the way it matches its 
services to its setting, Pere Bise is nonpareil. 
</P>
<P>
 I fell in love with Pere Bise for the first time by long distance when I saw a 
photo of it in some travel magazine or other, circa 1965. The shot showed a 
small complex of alpine-flavored buildings with tile roofs peaked and overhung 
like wimples, surrounded by trees and flowers and separated from a pristine 
lake by nothing more than an expanse of thick green lawn. On a stone terrace 
facing the lake were tables napped in white and chairs with luminous blue 
cushions. Rippling reflected sunlight danced around two or three small boats 
out in the water. Across the lake were a few large chalets couched in green and 
behind them rocky hills, rising steeply and turning from deep green to greenish 
blue as they approached the powder-blue sky. It all looked so perfect that I 
wondered if ordinary tourists would be, or even should be, allowed to visit the 
place. I also thought that I would surely like to try. 
</P>
<P>
 I finally got to Pere Bise in the early '80s. By that time, I had traveled 
reasonably widely elsewhere in France, and in Italy and Scandinavia, and had 
seen plenty of pretty lakes and (at least from a distance) plenty of 
exquisitely situated hotels and restaurants. I was looking forward to finally 
seeing Pere Bise, but at the same time I had become, quite frankly, a bit blase 
-- and, anyway, I half feared that I'd find the fabled beauty of the place 
somehow diminished with the years, or learn that it had been exaggerated in the 
first place -- a question of clever camera angles, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 I needn't have worried. I pulled into the aforementioned gravel courtyard and, 
before even registering, walked out across the lawn to the edge of the lake and 
just stopped and stared. Then I turned back to look at Pere Bise and stared 
some more, like a schoolboy transfixed by a beautiful woman, and as much by the 
implications of her past as by her beauty. Then a young man in a crisp white 
shirt and black trousers appeared, greeted me, asked if he could fetch my bags 
and led me into the reception desk. I signed in, and in so doing, though I 
didn't realize it at the time, signed a contract promising to myself that I 
would come back here as frequently as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that first visit, I've managed to return maybe half a dozen times, which 
is not as often as I'd like. Besides, though it may be paradise, it's expensive 
as hell. 
</P>
<P>
 My most recent stop at the place, earlier this summer, was a brief one. I had 
to catch a plane back to Los Angeles from Geneva, but instead of spending the 
night in that Swiss city, I decided to sneak in a visit to Pere Bise (it's not 
much more than a 45-minute drive from the Geneva airport). I arrived in 
Talloires around 3 in the afternoon, checked into my attractive but hardly 
luxurious $200-a-night room, freshened up and then strolled out to drink in the 
intoxicating surroundings. (The glass of Champagne on the terrace would come 
later.) 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Annecy occupies part of a glacial valley framed by the Bauges mountains 
to the south and the Alpine foothills that stretch up to Geneva in the north. 
Its form is eccentric: Its top portion, the so-called Grand Lac, is an 
irregular oval with an elongated tip, tilting slightly to the northwest; then 
it constricts, jogs to the east and ends in the droopy Petit Lac, shaped rather 
like a teardrop about to fall. Talloires overlooks the narrows between the two 
parts of the lake, and the views from its hills and shoreline are defined and 
partially limited by small promontories and curves of land up and down the 
lake. This lends the town's relationship with the lake an appealing intimacy. 
It seems manageable, inviting even, especially looking north and west from the 
auberge -- and indeed it is a pleasant place to swim, its water pure and clean, 
though icy even in summertime. 
</P>
<P>
 When I had arrived, in mid-afternoon, the sky had been mostly fleecy gray, and 
the sun could be felt but not quite seen. Because the lake is ringed with 
mountains, there are often clouds overhead, usually quite dramatic in shape and 
color -- but, on the other hand, the weather changes swiftly here, and by the 
time I had emerged from my room and started to stroll along the little web of 
gravel paths that spin through the hotel's rose garden, the sky had cleared but 
for a few smoky wisps, and the sun was shining. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked out the front gate and past the Villa des Roses, a faint pink 
three-story mansion with pale green shutters that contains about half of the 
auberge's 34 rooms and suites. (The rest are in or immediately adjacent to the 
main building, which also houses the restaurant and kitchen.) I took a quick 
turn around the tiny Talloires port, with its little covered-bridge-like 
boathouse and its side-by-side population of other hotels and restaurants -- 
some of which are quite nice (one is even a member of the prestigious Relais & 
Chateaux luxury hotel association), but none of which, of course, is Pere Bise. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, heading back past Pere Bise again, I walked uphill into "downtown" 
Talloires, a small cluster of shops and more hotels and restaurants (these less 
grand than the ones by the lake), most built in that gingerbread cut-out Alpine 
style that inevitably suggests the architecture of fairy tales. Nearby Annecy, 
a pleasant city of about 50,000 with an attractive 17th-Century old town, dates 
its origins from prehistoric times and was later the site of an important 
Gallo-Roman settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Talloires, about eight miles from Annecy, halfway down the eastern flank of 
the lake, is of more recent vintage. Though there may have been a few fishermen 
on this bit of shoreline previously, the first significant population arrived 
after a Benedictine abbey was founded here in the 9th Century. (Later abbey 
buildings, dating from the 17th and 18th centuries, now house the 
aforementioned Relais & Chateaux, which is called L'Abbaye de Talloires.) 
Fortunately for its picturesque simplicity, Talloires never grew beyond a 
village -- its present permanent population is little more than 1,000 -- and 
since as long ago as the 18th Century, it has been a popular site for vacation 
villas. 
</P>
<P>
 When I returned to Pere Bise, a crew of 10 or 12 was setting up a commercial 
photographic shoot at the little covered landing. A tall, thin model with long 
raven-colored hair emerged from a camper, wrapped in a terry-cloth bathrobe and 
looking rather chilly as twilight approached. One of the crew said something to 
another and pointed up behind me. I turned and saw four para-gliders, their 
sails in bright primary colors, hovering high up -- seemingly frozen in space, 
like birds caught in a strong wind -- off the dentate outcropping of Mt. 
Entrevernes, which looms behind Talloires. 
</P>
<P>
 I took another stroll through the rose garden and then across the lawn to the 
edge of the lake, where the branches of one weeping willow almost kissed the 
water. A goose sailed past, oblivious. I heard the faint echo of a distant 
splash and turned to see that the model had just dived off the Talloires pier. 
I decided it was time for an aperitif and so repaired to the restaurant 
terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiters and busboys stood at attention between the tables as I sat down. 
Unfortunately, they weren't looking my way. They were staring at the water, 
from which the model was beginning to emerge. It was obvious that, whatever 
product she was selling, it wasn't bathing suits because she wasn't wearing 
one. Glancing up at the restaurant terrace, though, and at the audience of 
formally attired men and boys she had attracted, she shouted something to one 
of the assistants. A moment later, a bathing suit was tossed to her in the 
water. She slipped into it gracefully and then splashed up onto the bank and 
into her bathrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff lost interest, and I ordered my Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 By now the lake had turned four different colors, according to its depth, what 
its surface was reflecting and how the light was hitting it -- baby blue, 
sea-foam green, silvery blue and dark moss green. The hills lost surface 
definition as the light faded, turning into strong, dark shapes. The weeping 
willows were becoming lacy silhouettes, while mild spotlights illuminated the 
linden trees and pollarded elms along the terrace's edge. Streaks of artificial 
light began to spill across the lake from street lights along the port, from 
tiny boats heading home and later from the bateau-mouche -style dinner cruise 
ship down from Annecy. I ordered dinner of my own. 
</P>
<P>
 Pere Bise dates its origins from 1901, when one Francois Bise, who had worked 
as a maitre d'hotel on the dinner ships that, then as now, cruised Lake Annecy, 
bought a small restaurant on the site called Le Petit Chalet. Fried fish from 
the lake was the specialty, and Bise quickly earned a local following as a 
genial host -- though according to "Larousse Gastronomique," the authoritative 
encyclopedia of food and cooking, he once turned away Paul Cezanne, who was 
penniless but had offered to pay for a meal with one of his paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1924, Francois' son Marius, who had by that time apprenticed as maitre 
d'hotel at several top restaurants in Paris, took over the place from his 
father, installing his wife, Marguerite, as chef. Rooms were soon added, and 
the name changed to La Petite Auberge. Before long, it had become known as 
L'Auberge du Pere Bise, in honor of Marius -- which was ironic, because it was 
Mere Bise, Marguerite, who elevated the establishment to the level of a serious 
restaurant.The Guide Michelin recognized Marguerite's skill by awarding the 
place its coveted three-star rating. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, the auberge passed into the hands of Marius and Marguerite's second 
son, another Francois, with his wife, Charlyne. But Francois had health 
problems, and became unable to oversee the property properly. In 1983, shortly 
before his untimely death (and despite Charlyne's best efforts to uphold the 
restaurant's standards), Michelin took back one of its stars. After the Bise's 
daughter, Sophie, moved into the kitchen in 1985, alongside longtime Bise 
sous-chef Gilles Furtin, the restaurant won that star back briefly. Now it has 
two stars again, though Furtin and Sophie Bise continue to produce food that is 
difficult to fault, other than for its perhaps excessive respect for tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 I love that about the place, though. The cooking is classic; an occasional 
raspberry sauce for the sauteed foie gras or salmon-trout with ginger 
mayonnaise aside, nouvelle cuisine might never have penetrated this far 
down-lake. This is hearty, unapologetically buttery and creamy, intensely 
flavored food of a kind all too difficult to find in France today -- rich (and 
genuine) lobster bisque beneath a puff-pastry dome; baby sole braised in port 
wine; an opulent tarte of potatoes, black truffles and foie gras; a formidable 
pa te chaud sauce poivrade (meatloaf gone to heaven -- a warm, coarsely ground 
pate, perfectly seasoned and enclosed in pastry, then moistened with assertive 
black-pepper sauce); an extraordinary rack of lamb with crisp baby green beans 
and a textbook gratin dauphinois (which is not so much potatoes baked in cream 
as potatoes drunk on cream); a whole repertoire of wonderful desserts 
(including eight or nine kinds of souffle) and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, though, to my taste, are the delicate freshwater fish, straight 
from Lake Annecy, that are sometimes served -- perch, fera (a kind of salmon 
found only in the Haute Savoie), burbot and most of all the sublime omble 
chevalier or char. (This is one of those restaurants where the "daily catch" is 
really that; if it isn't caught that day, and by local fishermen, it won't be 
available.) One of these, simply prepared -- a perch in butter sauce, say, with 
maybe some buttery spinach on the side -- and a bottle of faintly sparkling 
Seyssel, a fresh, lemony local wine, is about as fine a meal as any diner could 
demand. And that's exactly what I had. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the greatest pleasures of dining at Pere Bise is the warm, hazy 
realization, which usually occurs sometime between the last sip of wine and the 
first sip of cognac, that you get to spend the night. The rooms are comfortable 
and furnished in a slightly corny French-mountain-provincial style (lots of 
knotty pine), with big fluffy beds, discreet floral patterns on the walls and 
chairs, and, if you're lucky, a terrace giving onto the lake. I was lucky, and 
so, retiring after dinner, I left the TV off and stood outside instead, 
watching the lake and the mountains and the sky for, well, not long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the trouble with looking at beauty. Built into the very act is a sort 
of sweet longing because you can't really do anything with it, except watch it, 
breath it in, and finally leave it, so that you can come back later and watch 
it again. And come back to Pere Bise I certainly will. GUIDEBOOK: Inn on the 
Bank of the Annecy 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Swissair flies nonstop from Los Angeles to Geneva, the nearest 
international airport to Talloires, several times a week; lowest restricted 
round-trip fare is about $1,130. Numerous connecting flights are available for 
approximately the same fare, including British Airways via London, Delta via 
JFK in New York, TWA via JFK, KLM through Amsterdam, etc. From Geneva to the 
hotel, the best bet is a rental car (all the major companies have offices at 
the Geneva airport), which will also give you the mobility to explore the 
stunning countryside around the lake. From Paris, there is train and plane 
service to the town of Annecy, about eight miles northwest of Talloires. There 
is no train service to Talloires, but both taxi and boat service from Annecy. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel: L'Auberge du Pere Bise, Route du Port, Talloires; telephone 
011-33-50-60-72-01, fax 011-33-50-60-73-05. Closed Tuesday lunch and from Nov. 
15 to Feb. 15. Rates: $160-$300 per night for two; suites $260 to $700. Dinner, 
$225-$325 for two with a modest bottle of wine.

TRAVEL INSIDER: A GOOD CALL: FEWER HOTELS ARE DIALING FOR YOUR DOLLARS; FEES: 
MORE AND MORE ESTABLISHMENTS ARE DROPPING IRKSOME ADD-ON PHONE CHARGES, 
ESPECIALLY ON CARD CALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The war is far from won, but consumers can claim another small victory in the 
struggle for reasonable hotel room telephone fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Marriott Hotels announced that most of its lodgings are 
eliminating their 75-cent phone-card access fee on guest room toll calls -- 
following a move made a year ago by most domestic Hilton hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Choice Hotels, a conglomerate that includes roughly 2,600 Clarion, 
Quality Inns, Comfort Inns, Rodeway, Sleep Inns, Econo Lodges and Friendship 
Inns in the United States, a spokeswoman reports that half of all U.S. Choice 
properties now offer free phone-card, 800 and local calls -- twice as many 
properties as last year at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marriott announcement, which affects 15 hotels in Southern California and 
more than 140 of its 207 hotels in the United States, was principally aimed at 
business travelers; the hotel company also pledged elimination of fees on 
incoming faxes and some reductions in fees for photocopying and outgoing faxes. 
But travelers of all kinds have long been frustrated -- and sometimes 
justifiably outraged -- over the nickels, dimes, quarters and dollars that 
hotels extract from them in exchange for simple telephone services. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of Val Ponomaroff, a traveler from Shell Beach who checked 
into Whiskey Pete's in Stateline, Nev., one day last month. Ponomaroff paid $31 
a night for his room -- not a bad deal -- but then he dialed his wife in 
California three times. He got no answer each time, yet the next day found that 
his hotel bill included $3.30 for each unanswered phone call. There was no 
mistake. Under the system in place at that hotel, management confirms, guests 
can be charged if they let an unanswered outgoing call ring more than three or 
four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, sorting out hotel phone charges can be a tricky business. Hotels 
negotiate varying contracts with different communications companies, sometimes 
using one for local calls and another for long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hotels assess no fee for phone-card calls or 800 calls, but will add 25 
cents to $1 to your bill for local calls or directly dialed long-distance calls 
not made with a phone card. Even a local call can be a complicated proposition: 
some cross-town numbers, though within the same area code, nevertheless carry 
added costs. Sometimes, these charges are clearly disclosed on or near guest 
telephones; sometimes, a guest needs to do detective work. If you're not clear 
on the situation, call the hotel operator and ask for a cost rundown. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. hotels, the most consumer-friendly phone fees are usually at the 
cheapest lodgings. The 768 Motel 6 properties in the United States, for 
instance, add no fee for calling-card calls, 800 calls or local calls (a policy 
that was in place before Hilton made its move last year). At Forte Hotels, 
which includes 450 Travelodge Hotels in North America, guests pay no added 
charges for phone-card or 800 calls but do pay varying rates for local calls. 
(Under its Frequent Guest program debuting in October, repeat Forte customers 
can qualify for free local calls.) 
</P>
<P>
 Charges crop up more often among mid- and high-end hotels, which are often 
accused of exploiting the expense accounts of business travelers. In apparent 
response to such complaints, some chains have set up programs specifically 
aimed at business travelers who will be making a lot of phone calls. At Hilton 
Hotels, guests at 85 locations can pay a higher room rate to qualify for a 
BusinesSavers program, which offers free local calls and other perks. Hyatt's 
Business Plan, unveiled in January, and Sheraton's Club Level promotion, 
introduced in April, are similar. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you're in a lavish hotel or bare-bones motel, if you have to 
direct-dial a long-distance number from your room phone (rather than using a 
phone card), or get operator assistance on a long-distance call, you can expect 
to pay substantially more than you pay at home. If you don't mind the 
inconvenience, using a lobby pay phone is almost invariably cheaper than using 
the phone in your room -- but be careful you don't end up doing business with 
an alternative long-distance company with rates substantially higher than those 
charged by companies such as AT&T or MCI. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the current move to reduce phone fees seems to have grown from 
Hilton's announcement a year ago. In that move, 130 of the 244 Hilton Hotels in 
the United States abandoned the practice of charging 75 cents to $1 for each 
phone-card call, 800 call and collect call. Hilton continued its fees of 75 
cents to $1.25 for local calls and directly dialed long-distance calls, 
however. (Since then, a spokeswoman says, the number of participating Hiltons 
has increased to more than 150.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some chains have not seen fit to change their phone-charge policies. At 
Sheraton's 273 North American properties, fees remain where they were last 
year: 800 calls are free, and costs run up to 75 cents for local calls, $1 for 
phone-card calls. Hyatt Hotels, with 103 properties in North America and the 
Caribbean, is another company sticking to its rates so far: 800 calls are free, 
but from most rooms, local and phone-card calls carry a fee of 75 cents.

 The movie "Schindler's List" has turned the grave of Oskar Schindler in the 
Latin Cemetery just outside the Old City of Jerusalem, into a tourist 
attraction, according to the Israel Ministry of Tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one's officially counting, there's been a "tremendous upsurge" in 
visitors to the grave, a spokesperson said. "Before the film, hardly anyone 
asked about it." The guard now opens the gate from 9 a.m. to noon daily at the 
Catholic cemetery, where the German businessman who saved 1,200 Jews from the 
Holocaust was buried 20 years ago.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; PUERTO RICO HOTELS COPE WITH DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA BLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Grace Chamberlain arrived at the Radisson Ambassador Plaza Hotel in San 
Juan, Puerto Rico two weekends ago, the Denver resident was looking forward to 
a long hot shower and a good night's sleep before setting sail on a Caribbean 
cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 She got the sleep, but not the shower. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to stringent new conservation measures imposed in the wake of 
Puerto Rico's worst drought in nearly 30 years, the Ambassador Plaza had cut 
off water to its 233 guest rooms for all but a few hours a day. As a result, 
recalls Chamberlain, "I couldn't even flush the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
 Chamberlain isn't the only visitor who's been affected by the dry spell, which 
is most pronounced in the San Juan metropolitan area but has disrupted routines 
for about 2 million of the U.S. commonwealth's 3.6 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a spokesman for the Puerto Rico Tourism Co., most San Juan-area 
hotels have their own wells or rooftop cisterns, and are operating normally, 
with the help of tanker trucks delivering water from other, less-parched parts 
of the island. Cruise lines that call at San Juan, such as Carnival and Royal 
Caribbean, are picking up water at other ports and report no problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the drought, American Airlines, which operates 60 flights a day 
from San Juan, is waiving penalties on changes or cancellations for 
reservations on San Juan flights through Aug. 8. An internal memorandum to the 
airline's station managers, issued July 18, noted that some Puerto Rico hotels 
were limiting capacity or canceling guest reservations. And New Jersey-based 
GoGo Tours, a major tour packager to Puerto Rico, reports its July business to 
the island is off by 50% from the same month last year. The company is allowing 
Puerto Rico-bound clients to cancel without penalties through Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last week, according to the Puerto Rico Tourism Co., only two major 
hotels -- the Ambassador Plaza and Normandie -- were still restricting water to 
certain hours. But most were distributing letters asking guests to follow such 
conservation measures as reusing towels whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the American Society of Travel Agents and the Puerto Rico Tourism 
Co. advise would-be travelers (or their agents) to check directly with their 
hotel before leaving. LAURA BLY

WEEKEND ESCAPE: YOSEMITE; BABES IN THE WOODS; WATERFALLS AND WILDERNESS BEAUTY 
MORE THAN MAKES UP FOR HEAVY BACKPACKS AND RELENTLESS MOSQUITOES ON AN 
ALL-WOMEN HIKING ADVENTURE 
</P>

<P>
 When you put men and women together in the wilderness, you sometimes get a 
sort of Math Class Phenomenon: The women all of a sudden defer. 
</P>
<P>
 I see it when my stepdaughter Christa, my husband, Keith, and I camp together. 
As the most experienced camper among us, Keith always does the more difficult 
tasks: lights the propane stove, starts the campfire, carries the heavy stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that we really mind, most of the time. It's awfully nice to wake up in the 
woods to the smell of brewing coffee, and warm your hands on a fire someone 
else chilled himself to set. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Christa, 22, succinctly put it: "Girls need to know this stuff too." 
The occasion for such an observation was the last home-cooked meal before 
Christa and I set out for the Yosemite wilderness with 13 other women. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in February we had plunked down $135 each for the early July outing. The 
first detailed information packet about our adventure came soon after, carrying 
with it the following admonition: "Backpacking basics will be taught; but you 
need to prepare yourself adequately in advance for the trip." 
</P>
<P>
 That meant training at the gym and on hiking trails near home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yosemite Assn., a nonprofit organization that sponsors about 70 such trips 
a year, also sent along an exhaustive equipment list that started with tent and 
ended with food and along the way included my favorite description: "Sleeping 
bag: Warm, lightweight; down or synthetic filled. The car-camping kind lined 
with flannel printed with cowboys or spaceships is not warm enough." Christa 
and I together had most of the necessary equipment, save for the backpacks, 
which we rented from an Adventure 16 store. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much needs to be said about the drive to Tuolumne Meadows, where we camped 
the night before our backpack trip began. Basically you take California 99 
north and hang a right at Fresno. The trip runs about 350 miles and takes about 
seven hours; if you read maps the way I do, add 20 miles and 30 minutes. If you 
like country music on the radio, you'll be in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
 We drove into the base camp at around 5 p.m. on Thursday night, with enough 
time to pitch our tents, get used to the breathlessness of 8,600-foot 
elevations and make the 8 p.m. meeting to get acquainted with our new hiking 
partners -- a group that ranged from a pair of 17-year-old newly minted high 
school grads named Jessica and Jennifer, to Jaclyn, a grandmother recently 
retired from the Stanford University library. The highlight of the fire-lit 
meeting was Jessica's reason for taking the trip: "My parents won't let me go 
backpacking with just Jennifer." 
</P>
<P>
 By 9:30 a.m. Friday, we had strapped on our packs and set off on the trail to 
the Glen Aulin campsite. The leader of our pack was Suzanne Swedo, who told us 
she had hiked Yosemite for 42 years. Swedo, who is in her late 40s, walked 
"point," while her assistant, Elizabeth Pomeroy, walked "sweep" to look out for 
stragglers. The Tuolumne River meandered on our left past Cathedral Rock. Soda 
Springs, where water tinged with sodium bicarbonate bubbled from the ground, 
was the first stop for a quick equipment check and the first of many natural 
history lessons from Swedo, who pointed out mule's ear and deer's eye gentian, 
sagebrush and lodgepole pine. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours later we broke for lunch and a map-reading class. By this time we 
were filthy, slicked with sweat and gritty with dust, coated with a sheen of 
sunscreen and insect repellent. We could smell ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so many things I could have left at home," Christa moaned, suddenly a 
much more efficient packer. "My sweats, my jacket, my sandals." Two days 
earlier, the only thing she could think of leaving behind was a swimsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch, in a meadow beside the river, was crackers and cheese, Hershey's 
chocolate and apples, lots and lots and lots of water. About an hour later, we 
headed off again, packs increasingly heavy with our growing fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 On we hiked for nearly three more hours, over granite domes, through stands of 
lodgepole pine, around every corner a revelation: waterfalls and a lava post 
pile, miniature tiger lilies and waist-high lupine. You cannot see the things 
we saw unless you walk in -- or maybe come on horseback, and there was ample 
evidence of the latter option all along the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 A little after 3 p.m. we found our campsite -- any farther and any campsite 
would have done. We were very, very tired. Up went the tent (everyone pitched 
their own; there were no Sherpas on this trip), out came the water filter, and 
we replenished the quarts we had drunk along the way: fresh, cold Tuolumne 
River water (strained for Giardia lamblia ); you can't match it anywhere. 
(Unfortunately, the protozoan that causes giardiasis), a nasty intestinal 
infection, is rampant in untreated High Sierra water.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner was quick and hot and dehydrated: Natural High brand chicken stir fry, 
followed by Backpacker's Pantry apple cobbler. And chocolate, always chocolate. 
Not everyone was as perfunctory about food: Candace and her daughter Adrienne 
brought bags of baby lettuces, low-fat Caesar dressing and an entire English 
cucumber ("It won't make you burp," promised Candace). 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner around the campfire, came a fire-lit fauna lesson, specifically 
what to do about the two most voracious creatures in the wilderness: mosquitoes 
and bears. There's not much you can do about mosquitoes; even with strong 
insect repellent, I ended up with 77 bites by the end of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The only possibility is revenge: Wait until the mosquito alights on your arm 
and gets her proboscis (the females do the biting) into your flesh. "Hold your 
skin really tight," Swedo instructed. "They can't withdraw. Your heart pumps 
blood into them and they explode." 
</P>
<P>
 Bears are a different story. The best bet is keeping a bear-proof campsite, 
with food stored in bear canisters ($3 a day to rent, about three pounds added 
to your backpack) or strung up in bear bags high above the ground. We lucked 
out: no lost food, no bear sightings, only some fresh bear scat in the center 
of one campsite when we arrived and one tin cup found crushed and punctured. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of Day Two was an eight-mile round-trip hike -- without heavy 
packs -- over glacier-polished granite, through fields of deep ferns to 
Waterwheel Falls. Waterwheels are a type of falls formed when a river runs over 
deep grooves in rock that cause the water to be thrown back up in a perfect 
circle. The recurring drought had taken its toll this year, however, and the 
waterwheels were merely amazing instead of spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike out on our last day was proof of how groups can work so well. Christa 
had strained her Achilles tendon scrambling on the rocks. The injury, though 
relatively slight, was aggravated by the heavy backpack. She struggled mightily 
to keep up but felt terrible about having to hike slowly. At our first long 
rest stop, Terry -- a nurse and one of three wonderful women who adopted 
Christa on the trip -- suggested that we split up Christa's gear among us all. 
"We're a group," she lectured Christa. "This could have happened to any one of 
us. If it had, you'd have taken some of our things, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 When we emerged from the woods it was just after noon, and many of the women 
with whom we had spent the last three days headed home. Although the whole trip 
could have been easily accomplished in four days, Sunday night Christa and I 
decided we were too filthy to drive and checked in at the Marriott Tenaya Lodge 
in Fish Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 For a decent tip, someone else carried my backpack. The showers were long and 
hot, the room service dinner of pizza and Caesar salad was not prepared over a 
camp stove. We hashed over what we had learned in the last three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked being able to do everything without having a man around," Christa 
said. Then she laid aside her dinner dishes, reached for the TV remote control 
and sighed with contentment: "And I like hotels."

DESTINATION: HAWAII; LIFESTYLES OF THE NOT-SO-FAMOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DALE PAGET and SUSAN PAGET

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is time-share consultant Mark Keeling's unlucky day. Out of all the live 
bait arriving for a sales presentation at the Lawai Beach Resort in Poipu, he 
has been allocated the Pagets. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I'm asking is for you to keep an open mind," he says as he hands us 
sandwiches and a lifestyle survey to fill out. 
</P>
<P>
 The lure of 2-for-1 luau tickets has drawn us to the south coast of Kauai and 
what we were promised would be a "hassle free, no obligation" time-share tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the relative safety of this presentation, a storm is on the horizon. 
From the windows of the Lawai Resort we can see the ocean churning, fueled by 
Hurricane Emilia that, as it turned out, safely spun 200 miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer is hurricane season on the islands and there are constant reminders of 
the last one, Iniki, that devastated Kauai nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was terrible," our taxi driver told us soon after we landed in Lihue. "But 
it made Kauai famous. We were even on CNN," she adds, pulling onto Hawaii 56 
toward the modest but clean $54-per-night Kauai Sands in Kapaa, on the east 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
 From the window of our taxi the landscape is still a little roughed up. 
</P>
<P>
 We pass by the famous Coco Palms Resort, where Elvis filmed "Blue Hawaii." The 
resort is another hurricane victim and now lies vacant in insurance limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Mr. Coco Palms" is alive and swinging twice a week at Hawaii's favorite 
muumuu and souvenir store, Hilo Hatties in Lihue. For 41 years -- before the 
hurricane hit -- entertainer Larry Rivera was the Coco Palms' resident lounge 
act. 
</P>
<P>
 Now to the right of a rack of shell leis and the left of a stand of 20%-off 
aloha wear, he sings along, karaoke style, with his Coco Palms video. In the 
good old days Larry was on a first-name basis with guest celebs such as "Elvis, 
Bing and Frank." 
</P>
<P>
 "Elvis was a big fan," Larry confides to us during a break over Kona coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me a $55 tip for singing a song. He should have given me a Cadillac," 
he says laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those stars were the nicest people you could ever meet," Larry says warmly. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping warm has not been a problem on our Hawaiian journey, until sunset in 
the mountains, northwest of Lihue, at Kokee State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature "plummets" to 60 degrees -- freezing by Hawaiian standards -- 
and we pull out our sweats for the first time on this trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Our tents are surrounded by a jungle of ornamental ginger. Vines drip with 
passion fruit. Wild plums are waiting to be picked. Henri, 7, and Matilda, 5, 
gather handfuls of fruit for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we lived here we'd never have to go to the supermarket," Henri says. 
</P>
<P>
 Just up the road at the Kalalau lookout we walk to the edge of the Garden 
Island, high above the Na Pali coast. There's a 4,000-foot drop to the sea and 
an unforgettable view of narrow, wedge-shaped peaks carpeted in green. 
</P>
<P>
 Our tropical trek heads northeast to Anahola Beach Park, a campground on 
Hawaiian Homestead Land. But the local families, camping here for their 
vacations, do not exactly roll out the welcome mat for us. There's a Hawaiian 
sovereignty flag flying and bumper stickers urge land rights and say "Go 
Native." 
</P>
<P>
 "I see friends here!" Matilda says, running toward a group of kids playing on 
the grass. But to our shock, their parents pull the children away. We say 
"hello" but get the cold shoulder. At other Hawaiian campsites on the islands 
we've made many friends, but here no one seems to want to have anything to do 
with us. 
</P>
<P>
 We decide it's time to hit the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the time-share presentation in Poipu Beach, people are much more 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Keeling, our disappointed time-share salesman, is getting ready to say 
goodby to us -- his last prospect of the day. Our summer job as bargain-hunting 
travel writers is the final blow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in the business 20 years, and I can tell right away that time share 
is not for you," he says, signing our 2-for-1 luau voucher while asking us not 
to recommend a time-share presentation as a way to get travel discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll put us all out of business," he smiles. He is only half joking.

BOOKS TO GO: ALL THE BASES OF BRAZIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IN THE CITIES AND JUNGLES OF BRAZIL by Paul Rambali (Henry Holt & Co., $23 
hardcover).  
</P>
<P>
 As much an anti-travel as a travel book -- in the sense that it will probably 
put more people off Brazil than it will attract -- this nonetheless is a 
colorful, energetically anecdotal, often riveting portrait of South America's 
largest and most varied nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rambali, a former magazine editor who now makes TV documentaries in Paris, has 
been traveling to Brazil for half a dozen years, often staying months at a 
time, prowling its streets and forest paths. In researching his book, he 
interviews since-impeached Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello and the 
children's television superstar known only as Xuxa (which means "caress" in 
Portuguese, he reminds us twice in one page) and becomes involved with a 
Brazilian woman named Marly, whom he meets on the beach buying frozen green 
coconuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In crisp, colorful prose, he covers all the bases -- soccer, samba, favelas 
(shantytowns) and telenovelas (the cartoonish TV soap operas that seems to 
rivet the entire country), race car drivers, popular criminals, transvestite 
prostitutes, "dental floss" bikinis, the African-inspired Macumba cult. 
Rambali's view of Brazil, ultimately, is vivid, entertaining and not a little 
terrifying. Better he did and saw some of these things, some readers are liable 
to think, than they. 
</P>
<P>
 MAIDEN VOYAGES; WRITINGS OF WOMEN TRAVELERS, edited and with an introduction 
by Mary Mor ris in collaboration with Larry O'Connor (Vintage, $14 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 In her introduction to this rich collection of travelers' impressions, Mary 
Morris cites John Gardner's contention that there are only two plots in 
literature: You go on a journey or a stranger comes to town. Though women have 
traditionally been denied the former option -- denied the right to travel 
independently by law, by social custom, by practical concerns -- continues 
Morris, "It is our hope that this volume will make it clear that both plots are 
available to women." 
</P>
<P>
 If there remains any doubt in anybody's mind that this is true, these varied 
excerpts from the writings of 52 well-traveled females -- starting with Lady 
Mary Wortley Montagu's report on fashions and mores in Adrianople in 1771, and 
including selections by such luminaries as Mary Wollstonecraft, Edith Wharton, 
Willa Cather and Margaret Mead -- should make the case. 
</P>
<P>
 AMERICA'S MOST CHARMING TOWNS & VILLAGES by Larry Brown (Open Road Publishing, 
$14.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 The cover of this minor masterpiece of small-town boosterism shows a 
fly-fisherman in waders standing in dark blue water. Above him, overhanging the 
river, is a barn-red, wood-slat structure that appears to be a covered bridge. 
In the background is a white frame church, a cluster of tall trees, a 
greenery-covered hill and a clear blue sky. Talk about charm! 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 American municipalities, in which scenes not dissimilar in tone to 
this one may presumably be enjoyed, are included here -- each with a bit of 
general description and notes on special attractions and places to stay. A 
warning, though: The author compiled his list of charmers from the 
recommendations of state tourism offices, regional magazines, state historical 
societies, travel guides and bed and breakfast directories. The final decision, 
he writes in his introduction, "was . . . made on the basis of information from 
travel guides, personal visits and/or recommendations by people familiar with 
the communities." How many personal visits he made is not specified. His 
assessment, then, may be second-hand. 
</P>
<P>
 HEY DAD! ARE WE THERE YET? ONE MAN'S TIRELESS SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT FAMILY 
VACATION by Harold Smith (Navpress, $7 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Travel humor is a difficult genre. It's hard to be funny about our 
frustrations on the road without seeming arrogant, spoiled, even racist (not to 
mention simply banal). Some of the most successful travel humor avoids the 
problem by taking a detour into self-satire, laughing not at the inefficient 
natives and their curious customs but at the author's own inability to deftly 
deal with same. "Hey Dad!" is that sort of book, in which the butt of the jokes 
isn't the strangeness of Korean cuisine or the dangers of trekking the Badlands 
but rather the engaging frailty, and dogged resilience, of the human spirit. It 
is worth noting that the publisher is a religious press. The jokes are pretty 
funny anyway.

DESTINATION: AUSTRIA; ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE; NEW AUSTRIAN BIKE PATH OFFERS 
EASY ROUTE THROUGH ALPINE SPLENDOR AND HISTORIC SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM JOHNSON, Johnson is a free-lance writer based in Millbury, Mass. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 2-year-old Tauernradweg (Tauern bike path) in Austria is a bicyclist's 
dream come true. It cuts across some of the world's most mountainous terrain, 
yet it's almost all downhill. It passes through dozens of picturesque towns and 
villages, yet it stays almost totally clear of the traffic of daily life and 
commerce -- meandering instead through Alpine meadows and woodland and along 
the banks of the Salzach River. And it's clearly marked, with signs at every 
turn, for worry-free riding. 
</P>
<P>
 The path starts in Krimml, a mountain village at 3,400 feet in central 
Austria, and ends 100 miles and 2,000 vertical feet later in Salzburg. While 
some fanatics ride the route in reverse, I preferred to pack my rental bike, a 
hybrid -- a cross between a mountain bike and a street bike -- and gear and 
take the train from Salzburg to Krimml, a three-hour trip to the west. From 
there I would let gravity take over for the four-day return. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several companies transport luggage and offer guide services to 
cyclists, I toted saddlebags and invested $10 in a route map and book. I'd 
booked my hotels in advance, allowing for about 25 miles of bicycling a day. (I 
carried none of the usual spare tire or repair kit since there were repair 
services in gas stations, inns and restaurants along the route.) 
</P>
<P>
 When I arrived in Krimml, I realized I had underestimated the impact of 
altitude (and, perhaps, jet lag) on endurance. Even a test ride around the 
village left me winded. A 90-minute walk midway up the 1,000-foot Krimml 
waterfall, the highest in central Europe, almost did me in. After dinner -- a 
local seasonal specialty of fried wild mushrooms -- at the Hotel Post, I sat at 
my window and watched the lights in the valley fade, one after another. I was 
exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted -- and with no other choice -- I took off the next morning, pushing 
off from the "Start" sign at the base of the waterfall along the path, which, 
at this point, was paved. A light mist washed over me as I looked out past the 
steeple of the 13th-Century parish church into the cloud-filled valley below. 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds, and without pedaling, I was hitting 15, then 20, then 25 
m.p.h., as the village disappeared behind me. I braked as I came alongside the 
bank of the Salzach, whose waters would guide me toward Salzburg for the next 
four days. As the clouds burned off, snow-topped mountain peaks came into view. 
From both river banks, meadows stretched to the base of the mountains, becoming 
nearly vertical as soil hit rock. My fatigue vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tauernradweg runs along the northern boundary of Hohe Tauern National 
Park, Europe's largest, complete with 246 glaciers and 304 mountains over 9,000 
feet. Ibex and other Alpine creatures run wild. 
</P>
<P>
 I paused again and could hear the wind in the trees, the birds, small brooks 
and distant waterfalls. The scents of fresh-cut hay and moist moss hung in the 
air. Overhead lay the first of several ruins I'd spot along the way, the stony 
outcroppings of the ancient Friedburg castle. I'd found paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 The sounds of cowbells jolted me from my reverie, as I made way for a dozen 
bovines crowding down the path. A bull with menacing horns glared at my bright 
red jersey, then thought the better of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The path carried me through tiny hamlets, some no more than a few farmhouses 
and a chapel. In larger villages, such as Bramberg, life centered around a 
small market square bordered by a medieval parish church, several shops and an 
inn. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, however, the path wound through farms and fields. At one 
point a sign even asked cyclists to close the gate behind them to keep the cows 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 It was September harvest time, and I passed whole families toiling with 
scythes and rakes, cutting and stacking hay. Husbands and wives worked side by 
side, the women in puffy peasant blouses and skirts, the men in green-trimmed 
leather pants and work shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of most homes, trees brimmed with apples, pears and plums, and I 
stopped to see if I could buy some from an elderly farmer. "Moment, bitte ," he 
said and disappeared. He returned with a small sack and filled it with ripe 
fruit. He refused money, pushing it back with leathery hands. After I rode 
another 50 yards, I stopped and looked back. His wife had joined him, and the 
two waved as if bidding farewell to an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the bend, a neighbor displayed similar hospitality with a sign offering 
"Fresh Water for Cyclists." I filled my bottle with ice-cold water flowing from 
the mouth of a wood-carved knight. Behind it, a wooden home lay bathed with 
waves of impatiens and petunias. A few minutes later, I entered Hollersbach, 
nicknamed "the blossoming village" both for its proud floral displays and for 
its botanical garden with more than 500 different kinds of flowers and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 After three hours, 21 miles and a vertical drop of nearly 1,000 feet, I 
arrived in Mittersill, the first sizable town along the route. I locked my bike 
in the market square, entered the Meilinger Tavern and enjoyed a lunch of soup 
with dumplings, spaetzle (a kind of dense noodle) with native cheese and, for 
dessert, strips of crepe mixed with blueberries and powdered sugar. That's 
another benefit of riding: gorging without guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 14th to 16th centuries, Mittersill lay at the crossroad of two major 
trade routes. From Italy came wine, olive oil, fruit and silk. In return, 
Austria sent salt, mined nearby and known for centuries as "white gold." Celts 
and Romans followed the same route, and I passed a Roman mile-marker later in 
the day. A medieval watchtower still stands, serving today as a museum marking 
a millennium of commerce and local history. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that afternoon I arrived at my first day's destination, Zell am See, an 
idyllic lakeside town encircled by mountains. My itinerary called for a 
one-night's stay in Zell, but I wished I'd planned several. Zell is a 
year-round tourist resort, and I soon found out why. First, due to strict 
pollution controls and restrictions against gasoline boat engines, the lake 
itself is known as the cleanest bathing lake in Europe. Others may be cleaner 
-- but far too cold for bathing. As I walked my bike along the promenade, I saw 
windsurfers, sailboats and paddle boats. Families fished from docks, and 
teen-agers water-skied behind electric-powered motorboats. 
</P>
<P>
 Zell am See and neighboring Kaprun also draw thousands of hikers weekly, from 
casual day-trippers to more dedicated climbers who spend their nights in 
mountain huts. 
</P>
<P>
 A local cycling map and brochure described nearly 40 routes, ranging from 
seven miles along the lake to 60 miles winding over nearby mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time. 
</P>
<P>
 I awoke the following morning to the sound of rain splashing on my window. 
After a breakfast of fresh fruit and muesli in my hotel, the Sporthotel Alpin, 
I retrieved my bike from the hotel garage, loaded my packs, put on my rain gear 
and headed out. Luckily, as the waters of the Salzach widened, most of the 
hard-packed dirt route was sheltered beneath a leafy canopy. The rain 
splattered on the leaves and misted downward in a symphony of sounds and 
scents. 
</P>
<P>
 As the symphony reached a downpour crescendo, however, I took refuge in a 
small restaurant in the village of Taxenbach. Even my mother's chicken soup had 
never tasted better -- or warmer. 
</P>
<P>
 After lunch, the rain stopped, and I took one of several hillier side options, 
climbing nearly 600 feet to a ledge overlooking the river. It was exhausting, 
but rewarding. At the top, I shared the view with a pair of weary Dutch 
cyclists who noted, with some understatement, that their country offers flatter 
cycling. Clouds puffed like cotton through the valley. I slept well that night, 
just outside the town of St. Johann. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the route had run due east. The next morning, the Salzach and I 
turned north toward Salzburg. By midmorning, the powerful Hohenwerfen castle 
came into view in the distance. The route passes by the base of the castle, and 
I walked up the steep path through a series of mighty walls. Built in 1077 and 
rebuilt over the centuries, the fortress today stands a peaceful watch over the 
river. Its dungeons are closed, the guns just for show. 
</P>
<P>
 Just north of Werfen, two mountain ranges come together, and the Salzach roars 
through the narrow chasm, kicking up 15-foot standing waves. Cars and trains 
can take a tunnel through the mountains. Bicyclists, however, must climb 
through the Lueg Pass, which the river has carved between two sheer cliff 
walls. As I approached the pass, the walls seemed to merge. To the right, 
mountain. To the left, the surging Salzach and more mountain. Ahead, a sign 
warning of falling rocks. I pedaled faster. It was great. 
</P>
<P>
 After the only real climb of the main route, I coasted downhill into the town 
of Golling, a manicured medieval town lined with outdoor cafes. I detoured 
along a path into the deeply wooded Bluntau Valley, sharing the way with 
families, young couples walking hand in hand and more cows. 
</P>
<P>
 I doubled back and passed St. Nikolaus', a small Gothic pilgrimage church set 
atop a craggy outcropping, where a wedding was just ending. I got off the bike 
and walked 10 minutes to the 250-foot Golling waterfall. Even after the 
1,000-foot Krimml waterfall, I stood in awe of its power and beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Within an hour I was standing in Hallein, a town of nearly 20,000 residents 
and the final overnight stop of my journey. Hallein had been the center of the 
millennia-old salt industry until the mines closed in 1989, and the streets 
were lined with the pastel-painted high facades of affluent merchant homes. 
Medieval alleyways ran in every direction, and I parked my bike to explore. In 
the distance I saw the entrance to the old mines, a popular attraction where 
visitors tour the caverns by whooshing down giant wooden slides, walking on 
ramps across underground lakes and riding in a small miners train. 
</P>
<P>
 I eventually passed through the marketplace to the 12th-Century Romanesque 
Dekanats Church, where "Silent Night" composer Franz Gruber once served as 
choir director. His grave lay outside the door, his home just beyond. After a 
dinner that ended with Salzburger Nockerl, a souffle-like specialty, I took a 
final walk around town and went to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 My final day of riding carried the anticipation of seeing the famous 
Hohensalzburg fortress that dominates the Salzburg skyline. Only nine miles lay 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The bike path ran through dense forest, and I heard Salzburg before I saw it. 
It was Sunday morning, and the city's church bells rang in chorus. Finally, 
through a break in the trees, I saw the fortress towering over the baroque 
spires of the city. I'd made it. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week, cars clog the city's narrow streets. On Sundays, pedestrians 
and cyclists rule. I rode along the Getreidegasse, Salzburg's most famous 
medieval alley. I slowly made my way past the palatial Residenz, former home of 
the ruling archbishops, now a museum, to the cathedral, where street musicians 
played their guitars and artists drew chalk Madonnas on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 I parked the bike and climbed up to the fortress. On previous visits to 
Salzburg, I'd spent hours there looking out over the city. This time, I looked 
instead to the south, where I could see the bicycle path along the Salzach 
disappear gradually into the mountains. Memories of the past four days came in 
a flood, buffeted by the bells of the city calling the faithful to Mass. 
Despite the glorious view below, however, the feeling that lingered was 
somewhat bittersweet; on a bicycle tour, after all, getting here is all the 
fun. GUIDEBOOK: Austrian Coasts 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: From Los Angeles to Munich -- easier and cheaper than flying 
into Salzburg -- Lufthansa flies nonstop; U.S. carriers Delta, American and 
United have connecting flights; high-season round-trip fares, with 
restrictions, about $1,100. Trains run every two hours from Munich to Salzburg 
($18) or, with advance reservations, take a van direct from the airport to 
Salzburg ($38). Trains, which can carry bicycles, run several times daily from 
Salzburg to Krimml via Zell am See (about $18 per person, plus $6 per bike). 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: I booked my lodging ahead of time with the help of the Salzburg 
Provincial Tourist Office, which provided me with a list of local tourist 
bureaus. While this kept me on schedule and offered peace of mind, I met some 
travelers who were taking potluck on accommodations, ranging from hotels and 
pensions in the towns and villages to private rooms in farmhouses on the bike 
path. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-quality hotels, such as the Hotel Zur Post in Krimml (011-43-6564-358) and 
the Sporthotel Alpine (Gartenstrasse 11, Zell am See; 011-43-6542-7131) range 
$50-$100 a night. Rooms in private homes go for $10-$30. 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycles: Airline policies differ on transporting bicycles, the cost and to 
what degree you have to disassemble your bike. I recommend renting there. 
Rentals are available throughout the Salzburg area. VELOaktive 
(Willibald-Hauthaler-Strasse 10, A-5020 Salzburg) rents bikes for $15-$20 per 
day or $60-$90 per week, even for state-of-the-art 21-speed hybrids and touring 
bikes. The Salzburg Provincial Tourist Office provides lists and rental 
assistance. Make sure you try your rental out first -- ideally on a local day 
trip -- before you embark on a long journey. Carry rain gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour companies: After my solo trip along the Tauernradweg, I joined up with a 
tour outfit for a ride down the Danube. I enjoyed the company of a dozen 
international guests, the services of a guide, luggage transport, van support 
and tours of important attractions, as well as two meals a day and overnight 
lodging. Tour companies offer similar services on the Tauernradweg for about 
$750 per week. For those who still want some independence, these companies will 
also provide luggage transport and lodging only for about $500 per week.

PHOTOGRAPHER'S PORTFOLIO: GALAPAGOS ISLANDS; DAY OF THE IGUANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was like setting foot in a prehistoric scene, or perhaps, on another 
planet, says Times photographer Veronika Andrasovsky of her trip last December 
to Ecuador's Galapagos Islands. What she found in those Equatorial isles was 
surface-of-the-moon topography -- fields of twisted lava that erupted from the 
sea 4 million years ago.She also found animal life so untainted that it still 
trusts humans. In short, a photographer's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Dragon-like land iguanas -- the only ones in the world -- drew close enough to 
touch. Curious mockingbirds landed on spectators and peered into camera lenses. 
Visitors watched as mothers, just a few feet away, pushed their baby sea lions 
into shallow waters for swimming lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 83-foot motor yacht Eric, customized to sail the Galapagos, 
Andrasovsky and a friend joined a dozen other travelers and a crew of 10, 
including two guide-naturalists who lectured each evening. They explored many 
of the Galapagos' 13 major and six minor islands and found each to have its own 
unique ecology, often with endemic species of plants, birds, animals and 
insects. 
</P>
<P>
 On one island, they nearly stumbled upon an albatross nested in an open field, 
the young one looking like a big cotton puff. And, of course, there were the 
tortoises for which the islands are named and that served for centuries as meat 
for pirates and early settlers, who nearly destroyed the population. 
</P>
<P>
 But not every moment was plump with natural beauty. At the Charles Darwin 
Research Station on Santa Cruz Island, home to various breeding programs to 
preserve the tortoises, Andrasovsky saw Lonesome George, the giant tortoise who 
can never mate to carry on his lineage because he is the sole survivor of his 
subspecies.

TAKING THE KIDS: HOOKED ON FISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On her first try, Reggie cast her brand-new Snoopy fishing pole so hard that 
the little yellow rod and reel went right over the side of the boat into the 
deep, blue Minnesota lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie looked stricken. Her brother guffawed. Luckily, Dad came to the rescue, 
snaring the pole with his net just as it was about to sink and Reggie about to 
burst into tears. Good thing, too. On her very next cast, she caught a 
largemouth bass big enough for dinner. "Wow!" was all a flabbergasted Reggie 
could say. Just 6 at the time, she's been hooked on fishing ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother Matt, meanwhile, has loved to fish since before he went to 
kindergarten. It didn't matter that we didn't allow him to keep any: reeling in 
the blue gills from the edge of the dock, throwing them back and watching them 
swim off was thrill enough. I spent much of that trip to Minnesota threading 
slimy worms on Matt's hook . . . true motherly devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Matt and Reggie have their own tackle boxes and earnestly discuss the 
merits of various lures, hooks and bait with their dad, leaving me totally out 
of the loop on this one. The "lucky" Snoopy pole now belongs to 3-year-old 
Melanie, who is still happy to have Mom bait her hooks. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad to do it. There's something really wonderful about watching kids 
fish, no matter what their ages: their triumphant look when they reel in that 
first "big one"; their discovery that television and video games aren't 
necessary to life itself; learning that patience does get rewarded . . . 
sometimes, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other payoffs, too. "Fishing gives kids a much greater appreciation 
for the environment and what they can do to help preserve it," said Harv 
Forsgren, who oversees education and fishing programs for children at the U.S. 
Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also the chance to luxuriate in some truly unstructured time together, 
away from the phone and the office and the press of soccer practice and flute 
lessons and dentist appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the kids get hooked on fishing, they'll be patient when it's slow. 
That's a natural opportunity to visit with one another -- a chance you don't 
get at home," said Forsgren, who fishes with his two daughters regularly near 
his Washington, D.C., home. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents must agree. Forsgren notes that interest in fishing is growing 
steadily. Today, there are more than 45 million anglers -- 9.5 million under 
age 16. Just last month, during National Fishing Week, more than 50,000 kids 
and 40,000 adults took part in hundreds of fishing activities across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even a group called Hooked on Fishing International, sponsored by the 
American Sportfishing Assn., that organizes fishing programs for kids across 
the country with local recreation departments and state and federal agencies. 
This year, more than 1,300 communities will participate. "To keep the sport 
going, we've got to get more kids involved," said co-founder Gordon Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 That includes kids from single-parent homes, and kids from the inner city who 
may never have held a fishing pole. 
</P>
<P>
 (For a free "Guide to Fishing Your National Forests," complete with local 
forest service contacts and information on where you can catch which kinds of 
fish, write the USDA Forest Service, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, D.C. 
20090-6090.) 
</P>
<P>
 But hold on a minute before getting carried away by the notion of spending 
hours out in a boat communing with nature and a son or daughter. "Kids don't 
have the attention span adults do. They get tired and bored. You'll do best to 
keep it short and sweet," said Gary Nordlie, veteran Minnesota fishing guide. 
</P>
<P>
 One day last August, Nordlie took Reggie and me out on Lake Vermillion in 
northern Minnesota to show us what he meant. "Fish when the kids want to fish 
and take them home when they're sick of it," he said. "Remember that fishing is 
supposed to be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure to pick a nice day, and bring along plenty of drinks and snacks, as 
well as sunscreen and sweat shirts in case it turns cool. "Don't get hung up on 
catching a big fish," Nordlie said. "The thrill for kids is having something on 
their line," and having Mom and Dad make a big fuss over their "catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the Kids appears weekly.

 Ann Salmeron's "Churros and Chocolate" (June 12) had our mouths 
watering.Eating hot churros dipped in chocolate pudding is one of life's early 
morning pleasures -- and one that became a habit for us during a month's visit 
to Spain. The so-called churros that are sugar coated and kept warm in a cart 
here have nothing to do with Spain's delectable treats. Is there anyplace in 
Los Angeles where you can enjoy the real thing?

LOW FAT MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carol Isaak Barden's well-written article, "Low Fat Desert" (July 3), brought 
back many memories of when I discovered Rancho La Puerta in the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend had recommended the ranch as an ideal place for a rest.After spending 
a week there, I was totally addicted. For $125 a week, per person, we got a 
small cottage with a fireplace, three good meals (mostly vegetarian), one 
massage and a facial a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, we started going down for weekends whenever we could. Those 
weekends were not as restful as they should have been, as we spent many 
Saturday evenings at the local pub, sneaking back in long past curfew. They 
have since built a guarded gate and their rates have been inflated to the point 
of making it available only to the super-rich. Sad!

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * WESTLAKE HOUSING: Authorized the Community Redevelopment Agency to loan $1.2 
million to CASA Carondelet for the development of an 18-unit housing complex at 
130 S. Carondelet St. Construction of the apartments is set for the beginning 
of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * WATTS HOUSING: Authorized the Redevelopment Agency to loan $283,000 to 
Westworld Construction Inc. for two 1,800-square-foot homes at 104th Street and 
Wilmington Avenue in Watts. The four-bedroom, two-story homes will be built on 
25-foot-by-130-foot lots, common in Watts, and will be sold to lower-income 
families for $160,000. If the development proves to be a marketable, the agency 
intends to use the design to establish a Watts single-family housing 
construction program. Construction of the homes is expected to be completed by 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 * SENIOR CITIZEN HOUSING: Authorized the Redevelopment Agency to provide a

POP MUSIC; A COUNTRY BOY ON A HIT STREAK; SHY, GENTLE ALAN JACKSON IS NO GARTH

SONGS,' HE SAYS. 'OTHER THAN THAT, I'M NOT REALLY THAT CRAZY ABOUT THE AWARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Garth Brooks' massive record sales in the '90s have overshadowed what is, in 
its own right, one of the most remarkable hit streaks ever in country music. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Jackson's 1990 debut album, "Here in the Real World," has sold 2 million 
copies. The follow-up, "Don't Rock the Jukebox," passed the 3-million mark, and 
1992's "A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'Bout Love)" has reached 4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The new one, "Who I Am," should bring him close to a grand total of 10 million 
before long -- a bit short of Brooks' 30-million-plus, but impressive enough. 
Jackson's singles haven't done badly either. The current "Summertime Blues" is 
his 14th No. 1 country single. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson, who plays the Greek Theatre on Wednesday, is no Garth Brooks -- 
and he doesn't want to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just recently, TV Guide had a picture of Alan and it said, 'Garth's Worst 
Nightmare,' " recalls Gary Overton, a longtime friend of Jackson's who became 
his manager in March. "Alan looked at the story and he looked at me and said, 
'Boo. Do I scare you? I don't believe I scare Garth either. I'm never gonna be 
Garth, and I don't want to be.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He really would like to pattern himself after a George Strait," Overton 
continues. "We do our music, we do our shows, and we do a few interviews, but 
that's pretty much it. He said, 'Everyone's kind of lookin' at us right now to 
take that big spotlight out there because Garth's not really doin' anything. 
But it's not me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That's putting it mildly. Where Brooks is flamboyant, driven and in-your-face, 
Jackson is low-key and relaxed, striving to balance career demands with his 
family life. He's not given to grand gestures or controversy, and he plays it 
straight and simple on stage. When pressed for an opinion, he'll preface it 
with an elaborate apology, as if afraid of offending someone, or unable to 
comprehend why people would be interested in his views. And instead of 
cultivating celebrity with a high profile, he heads for the hills at every 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson escapes from the music and its business by holing up with his wife and 
two daughters at their home in Center Hill Lake, Tenn., keeping his distance 
from both guitar and telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 He tries his best to avoid country's social swirl. When Overton took over his 
management, Jackson asked if maybe he could get out of co-hosting the Academy 
of Country Music Awards telecast (it was too late, so he presided, a game but 
never-quite-comfortable master of ceremonies). 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that work for me call me a hermit," says Jackson, 35. "I just 
don't really like the star part of the business. I like makin' records and 
singin' and writin' songs. Other than that, I'm not really that crazy about the 
award shows and all the things that jab into your personal life. . . . I guess 
I'm just kind of introverted. I really like people. I've just always been that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife, this is exciting for her, to come out here to Los Angeles. She can 
go shoppin' and all that. And me, I'd rather just be at home foolin' with my 
cars or up at the lake doin' somethin'." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his Universal City hotel suite, Jackson seems almost painfully shy. 
With a 6-4 frame and fine features, he resembles some exotic land bird as he 
gazes out the window at hills where cowboys once rode and soldiers fought for 
Hollywood's cameras. Another escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love old movies, old actors . . . ," he says softly. He becomes gradually 
more open as the interview proceeds, but never fully dispels his reserved 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Wayne, people like Jimmy Stewart and Gary Cooper. I could sit here and 
name 'em all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see biographies about some of the older actors, they remind me of some of 
the singers I've been talkin' about, Hank Williams and them. They came from 
rural backgrounds, and all of them went into World War II and they came out of 
that and . . . they end up out here in the movie business. They had lived , and 
they were real people when they walked onto the screen." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of rich sense of nostalgia flows directly from Jackson's childhood 
just outside the town of Newnan, Ga., where he and his four older sisters grew 
up in a house that was built around an old tool shed. His grandparents had 
divided their acreage among their children, so there were other relatives on 
adjacent plots. It was a poor but close-knit upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were like the Waltons kind of," he says. "The family and all my cousins 
lived around us, my grandmother lived next door. I feel like sometimes I grew 
up in a time warp where I was 30 years behind other people." 
</P>
<P>
 That rural and small-town life would later provide the material for Jackson's 
biggest hit, 1992's "Chattahoochee," a warm account of adolescent, waterfront 
high jinks. At the time, though, he had no idea he'd ever write or sing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and his wife, Denise, a schoolteacher, were both young when they 
married. Jackson worked a series of jobs, including driving a fork lift at a K 
mart, and began playing with a band in local clubs. When he started going to 
see name acts at a new country music park nearby, he got hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided, 'I'm gonna move to Nashville and just give it a try.' A buddy of 
mine said he was gonna be an airplane pilot . . . and the next thing I know he 
was workin' for American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, he had a dream and he went for it and he made it. I said I need to 
at least give mine a shot. I'd never been to Nashville, or hardly anywhere. I 
told my wife I wanted to sell everything and move, and everybody thought I was 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That looked like a reasonable opinion five years later, after he'd been 
rejected by every record company in town. He was ready to pack it in when one 
final batch of demos and a live showcase led to a contract with Arista 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why everybody passed, but I do know why I signed him," says Tim 
DuBois, president of the label. "I saw in him a unique writing talent, coupled 
with an identifiable voice. There was just an honesty in what he did and who he 
was that I thought would work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a Vince Gill, he's not a Garth Brooks and he doesn't try to be," 
continues DuBois, who wrote several country hits himself before becoming an 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love songwriters and love songs, and in Alan there was a simplicity in what 
he did and what he said as a writer that really attracted me. He hadn't been in 
Nashville so long that he had been polluted by the way we Nashville tunesmiths 
write things. . . . He still was doing things a little bit different. It was 
neat and it was fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 If Jackson's life seems devoid of conflict and drama, there was at least that 
first unsettling year of stardom, when the suddenly accelerated pace turned his 
lifestyle upside down, making him rich and famous while yanking him away from 
family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a lot to swallow," says Jackson. "I think I got kind of caught up 
in it there for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't take long for him to sort things out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't grow up with a guitar in my hand, I didn't live and breathe music," 
he says. "I love this job and have been real successful at it, but I don't 
commit my whole life to it. I have to have my family and I have to have my 
personal life, and that's what I finally realized there after a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Arista's DuBois: "Obviously nobody can sell 10 million records and win 20 
major awards without it affecting you in some way. But when the foundation is 
there of a good person, someone who is very humble and who realizes where he 
came from -- he's really still the same shy, gentle, but very strong-willed 
person that he was in the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Associates say that Jackson is both more mischievous with friends and more 
assertive in business dealings than his reserved manner would indicate, with a 
keen sense of his audience and the direction of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson pauses when asked to name the key turning point in his career. He 
finally singles out the end of his struggle for a deal in Nashville, when he 
made his set of winning demo recordings. In previous attempts, he had let 
producers tell him what songs to cut and how to sing them. This time, he got 
Keith Stegall, the producer he'd been after, and he got it right. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were my songs, and I finally cut my songs the way I wanted to do 'em, 
and that's what got the attention of the label. I tell people now when they ask 
me, I say, 'Do what's in your heart and don't let people change you. Do what 
you want to do.' "

 Calling all upper crusts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. and Mrs. Oscar de la Renta and the Thirteen/WNET Gala Committee invite 
you to salute a cast of legendary talent," said the invitation to a black-tie 
fund-raising dinner and dance at the Plaza on behalf of New York City's 
high-profile public-television station earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Duchin and his orchestra would provide the music for these society 
swells. Table cost: $1,000 to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio photographs of the evening's five "honorees" bannered the invitation 
below their names: Brooke Astor, a prominent philanthropist; Joan Ganz Cooney, 
head of Children's Television Workshop, which begat "Sesame Street"; Beverly 
Sills, opera's transcendent super-diva; Gay Vance, wife of former Secretary of 
State Cyrus R. Vance, and Charlayne Hunter-Gault. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter-Gault: tall, stunning and adored. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter-Gault, a featured reporter on that PBS flagship "The MacNeil/Lehrer 
NewsHour" and anchor of an underdog weekly public-TV series titled "Rights & 
Wrongs." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter-Gault, the first black woman to attend the University of Georgia, where 
some of the first words she heard were "Nigger, go home!" (She later recalled 
her response in a TV interview: "And I'm lookin' for the nigger. Where's the 
nigger? I know it's not me, 'cause I'm a queen.") 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter-Gault, author of a big-selling memoir, "In My Place." It recounts her 
youth in Covington, Ga., and Atlanta, when her icon was ivory-skinned, 
flame-maned comic-strip reporter Brenda Starr. Hunter-Gault became homecoming 
queen and a top student at her all-black high school and, after more than a 
year at Wayne State University in Detroit, she and classmate Hamilton Holmes 
were persuaded by civil rights leaders to break the University of Georgia's 
color barrier. When a 1961 court order popped open the legal doors, the Old 
South's first successful college desegregation was tumultuously under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Yanked from obscurity, the two teen-agers initially faced walls of jeering, 
snarling segregationists, and their 2 1/2-year journey to graduation wasn't 
easy. Among the few white students who befriended Hunter-Gault was Walter 
Stoval, her future husband. They amicably divorced after a few years of 
marriage, and Hunter-Gault now lives in New York with her second husband, 
investment banker Ronald Gault. Their son, Chuma, recently graduated from Emory 
University, and her daughter from the first marriage, Suesan Stoval, is a 
singer and actress in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter-Gault's career has earned her awards galore and honorary doctorates 
from eight universities. A paparazzo's banquet, her office's bright white walls 
are a carpet-to-ceiling gallery of photographs of her with VIPs of enormous 
fame and clout: Hunter-Gault with Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton. With the 
President alone. With Nelson Mandela. With Jesse Jackson. With "60 Minutes" 
star Ed Bradley. With South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. With a former 
First Couple above the inscription: "To Charlayne Hunter-Gault, with best 
wishes, Barbara Bush, George Bush." 
</P>
<P>
 On and on it goes. To Charlayne, with best wishes from everyone who's anyone, 
including Bill Cosby, who threw a glittery bash in his home to celebrate the 
publication of "In My Place." And there's Hunter-Gault of the ordinary folk 
too, flattered on the streets by doting "MacNeil/Lehrer" viewers who cite 
stories she did weeks, months, even years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter-Gault, age 52 and looking 42 max, on her game, on her mark, aiming 
high, riding high, flying high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm soaring," she said a few hours before attending the WNET gala on one of 
those liquefied muggy evenings that turn Manhattan into a concrete sauna. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm drowning at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Someone who has achieved so much . . . drowning? Her voice edged with 
frustration, she recrossed her long legs, leaned forward and unloaded: 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do I go? I mean, where does someone like me now go? At a certain point, 
with this much time invested, I should have a series of my own where I make the 
decisions, where I decide what goes on the air. I'd like to be on the air every 
night. Like Charlie Rose -- I could do that," she said, referring to the host 
of a weeknight interview program on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the texture of her life and career, she could do many things. 
</P>
<P>
 Flashback. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the daughter of an Army chaplain who kept reminding her that her mind 
was first-rate, and of a mother who did most of the child-rearing because her 
husband was constantly traveling. But it was her grandmother who inadvertently 
sowed the seeds of Hunter-Gault the journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 "She read three newspapers a day, and sitting at her knee I would read the 
comic pages, and my favorite character was Brenda Starr. There she was, the 
center of attention in the newsroom, getting all the best assignments and all 
the wonderful romantic adventures." 
</P>
<P>
 As Hunter-Gault grew older, Brenda still bloomed in her thoughts: "I just knew 
there was a universe of experiences out there that was different from what most 
black people had who were college graduates. If you were a woman, you became a 
teacher, you know, or if you were a man, you worked for the post office." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with her University of Georgia journalism degree, Hunter-Gault worked 
briefly as a Talk of the Town reporter for the New Yorker magazine and then as 
a reporter for a Washington TV station. She spent the next decade at the New 
York Times, at one point operating a one-person bureau in Harlem. In 1978, she 
joined the "MacNeil/Lehrer" program as a correspondent and backup anchor, 
ultimately becoming one of the program's most visible and valuable components. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flash forward now to the 1990s, when Hunter-Gault's career is at its zenith. 
Not everyone is a Hunter-Gault fan, however. At least one group of Jewish 
activists in the United States, for example, complained bitterly that her 1993 
interviews with Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East were 
overwhelmingly pro-Arab. "Some of their criticisms were valid," she 
acknowledged. "There were some facts in dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, though, comes the flood of accolades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The special skill she has is the ability to sit down with somebody and get 
them to talk," said Washington-based "MacNeil/Lehrer" co-anchor Jim Lehrer. 
"She's terrific at it." 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a very good instinct for spotting the heart of a story in the field," 
said Lester Crystal, "MacNeil/Lehrer's" executive producer. "Flaws? I don't 
talk about flaws." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of the most formidable field reporters in our industry," said PBS 
journalist Bill Moyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's such an imposing figure," said Steve Futterman, an NBC/Mutual Radio 
reporter who was wowed by Hunter-Gault's work in Saudi Arabia when he was there 
during the Gulf War. "She was always prepared, always seemed to know the 
answers to the questions she was asking. The generals were very impressed with 
her. And her reports from Iraq before the war were brilliant, very thorough. 
She cared more about the story than the sizzle." 
</P>
<P>
 It's that sizzle less Hunter-Gault -- the never-glib, never-showy, low-decibel 
messenger -- who is most visible on television. Her subtle intelligence and 
porch-swing Southern rhythms are in lock stride with the strolling pace that 
the "MacNeil/Lehrer" program uses to travel its journalistic high road. 
</P>
<P>
 But television viewers see only one side of her. "She's very outgoing and 
loves parties, friends and laughing," said Kathi Fern-Banks, a longtime friend, 
former classmate and sorority sister at Wayne State University. "I would have 
thought, prior to this job, she didn't have a serious bone in her body." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rory O'Connor, co-executive producer of "Rights & Wrongs" (with Danny 
Schechter): "She can be very intellectual and very focused. But she also can be 
very spacey and earthy. She constantly surprises me. We were up at this college 
for her to get this award, and after she had given her speech to all these 
Irish Christians there, she came back at the end and started singing, 'I ain't 
gonna let nobody turn me around.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "She sings so badly, I get embarrassed for her," Fern-Banks said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was a gregarious but intense Hunter-Gault -- alternating flashes of 
laughter and down-home chattiness with glimmers of irritation -- that emerged 
while evaluating her life and career during an interview in her large, 
blue-carpeted office at WNET, where New York portions of the program originate. 
Striking without makeup (she hadn't anticipated a Times photographer), she was 
almost slinky-looking in her ankle-length dress. And she'd recently changed her 
hair, giving up the distinctive, snaky braids she'd worn for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to write this piece, 'Reflections on a Year in Braids,' " she said. 
Although she mostly got favorable mail about the braids, some viewers wrote 
"the meanest" things. "What's next, (anchor) Robert MacNeil with a ring in his 
nose?" asked one. "Why don't you go back to the bush?" asked another. 
</P>
<P>
 The nastiness was a reminder that Hunter-Gault will always be defined by her 
race in some circles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to be assessed on the basis of my ability," she said. 
"That's why I'm so frustrated at always being identified as the first black 
woman to go to the University of Georgia. I wanted to be famous for the ability 
that I had. I had the raw material and then went on to the experience that 
would hone the raw material into something that was professionally good. I got 
my fingernails full of dirt in the real world of reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 "A consideration of this show when they chose a third correspondent to come on 
(with MacNeil and Lehrer) was that they wanted a woman, and it turned out that 
I was black, and that was fine too. But they couldn't have hired just any black 
woman. There was an effort to match qualification with that. So I have all 
those things -- qualified and a woman and black. 
</P>
<P>
 "And now, when I look at all that and look at where I am, and the way the 
world is changing, hear the rhetoric of station managers and news directors, 
especially in public television, which has always talked a good game -- well, 
all I can say is that public television is resting on its past laurels. In the 
system's prime hours, its principal (public-affairs) programs are anchored by 
white males." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding from Washington to the charge of racial and gender monotony at PBS 
during peak viewing hours, Jennifer Lawson, the network's executive vice 
president for national programming and promotion services, cited Hunter-Gault's 
own presence as exemplifying "our commitment to diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson, who is black, also mentions PBS appearances by black journalist 
Clarence Page, but he is a regular on "The McLaughlin Group," which airs 
weekends, and only an occasional essayist on "MacNeil/Lehrer." In addition, she 
mentioned David Suzuki, who hosted just one PBS series, the four-part "Secret 
of Life," in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other narrow cracks in the white-male monolith. Former Newsweek 
reporter Margaret Warner is No. 3 anchor on the "MacNeil/Lehrer" program, 
succeeding Judy Woodruff in that high-visibility job a year ago. Woodruff hosts 
the PBS documentary series "Frontline." And the host of the long-running "Tony 
Brown's Journal," which also airs weekends at off hours, is black. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, as Hunter-Gault noted, this is meager diversity, making it clear 
that the public-affairs face of PBS remains predominantly white and male (from 
her colleagues MacNeil and Lehrer to Charlie Rose, Bill Moyers, Louis Rukeyser 
and Ken Bode). 
</P>
<P>
 "So if you have in your repertoire, in your stable, somebody who is different 
than that, and you are committed to diversity," Hunter-Gault went on, "why is 
it I've reached the glass ceiling? Why is it that others who are not white and 
male can't find some place in this universe of public television? All of the 
men who have these programs are people whose journalism I respect and admire, 
and they should have those spots. But are they saying in the end that there's 
no room for anyone who's different from them?" 
</P>
<P>
 A job that Hunter-Gault didn't get at PBS was the one on "MacNeil/Lehrer" that 
Woodruff abandoned for CNN, creating the impression that Hunter-Gault was 
passed over in favor of Warner, whose on-camera work remains raw. "Charlayne 
was there, she was on the program, she didn't get the gig," said O'Connor, the 
"Rights & Wrongs" producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure I would have wanted it," Hunter-Gault said. "I don't want a desk 
job. What I want to do is be on the air more, doing what I do best." 
"MacNeil/Lehrer" chief Crystal said that was his choice too, which is why he 
preferred her as a reporter instead of an anchor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The series that is Hunter-Gault's own, in effect, is "Rights & Wrongs," a 
refreshingly uncommon half-hour produced by Globalvision, whose earlier series 
"South Africa Now" was loudly lambasted by some conservative activists. Wearing 
a renegade's mantle, the small, scrappy independent production company operates 
out of a modest suite of offices on the seventh floor of an unpretentious 
building only a 10-minute walk from the swankier WNET digs where 
"MacNeil/Lehrer" and its New York staff are headquartered. 
</P>
<P>
 Symbolically, though, "Rights & Wrongs" might as well be in Newark, if not 
Newfoundland, for despite Hunter-Gault's tight fusion with the series and the 
comprehensive and incisive way it covers human rights globally, it has been 
jettisoned to the outback of public TV, having been rejected for national 
distribution by PBS since early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "MacNeil/Lehrer" is her main livelihood, Hunter-Gault is "Rights & 
Wrongs" to a large extent -- anchoring, interviewing and recording voice-overs 
for the series, while also being its "super-editor" and providing star power 
when it comes to raising money to keep it breathing. Her own financial 
contribution was her acceptance of a 50% pay cut this year to help the 
struggling series remain upright. 
</P>
<P>
 "Journalism is her No. 1 value to us," O'Connor said. "But Charlayne moves in 
so many worlds, from the streets of Harlem to the Council on Foreign Relations. 
She moves in high levels of black and white circles. She's been to the White 
House three times for small dinners. She's very well-connected. She and her 
husband know the highly placed African Americans in most corporations. So we 
can give Charlayne five names and phone numbers, and between 10 and noon she'll 
make the calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even she has repeatedly slammed into brick walls while trying to induce 
her network to run her series, and those numerous PBS rejections are a gnawing 
irritation for the producers and Hunter-Gault. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Charlayne Hunter-Gault, the most experienced African American journalist, 
can't get her own show on her own network -- someone with her credibility, with 
her distinction, with her diversity, with her global awareness -- who can get 
on?" co-executive producer Schechter wondered aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable," Hunter-Gault exclaimed about the PBS dismissal of "Rights 
& Wrongs," which, though lacking elegance, offers the kind of laser-focused 
insights into human rights rarely available in mainstream TV. "Given the 
resources it has, this is a wonderful program," she said. "But if it had more 
resources it could be a hell of a lot better. PBS could have said, 'Look, we'd 
like to work with you. This is a wonderful vehicle for one of our major people 
in the system. We'd like to give you some support; here are the problems we 
have with it and the way we think they can be resolved.' But no. Instead it was 
'We don't like it. We don't want a thing to do with it. Go away and don't come 
back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 PBS executive Lawson put it more bureaucratically, contending as she had 
previously that human rights alone is "an insufficient organizing principle" 
for a PBS series. And as he had all along, Schechter mocked Lawson: "And 
cooking and stock tips are a sufficient organizing principle?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson faulted the show's concept -- covering countries "purely from a 
human-rights perspective" -- as well as its execution, saying that the 
"MacNeil/Lehrer" program covers the same ground "with more flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, instead of getting PBS to beam "Rights & Wrongs" to its 346 member 
stations, Globalvision has had to peddle the series to traditionally timid PBS 
outlets individually, via the alternative American Program Service. The result? 
Only two dozen stations now carry the series, and most of those relegate it to 
relative obscurity, a la the 1:30 p.m. Saturday time slot it gets here on 
KCET-TV Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
 And in what Hunter-Gault seems to regard as a personal affront, one of the 
balkers is WETA, the major Washington station where portions of 
"MacNeil/Lehrer" originate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm baffled," she said, adding that the president of another big PBS station 
failed even to return her call when she phoned to make a personal plea to carry 
her show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to "MacNeil/Lehrer," it's her own drawn-out absences that 
increasingly concern Hunter-Gault. "I don't want to be on every now and then," 
she said. "I hate it when I walk out on the street that people say, 'Oh, we 
haven't seen you for a while. Have you been away?' No, I haven't been away. 
I've been waiting to get on the air." 
</P>
<P>
 How often does she surface on "MacNeil/Lehrer"? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not enough," she shot back like a comic batting a straight line for a grand 
slam. "I haven't done anything for a week now. I haven't done anything for 
today. I haven't done anything for the rest of the week." 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters always want more time or space, noted "MacNeil/Lehrer" chief 
Crystal, who joins others in praising the "conversations" -- clusters of chats 
with individuals or groups on topical issues -- that have become Hunter-Gault's 
big, looping signature. "There are certain periods where Charlayne's on a lot, 
like when she was in South Africa," he said. "But you can't be in the middle of 
a breaking story continually." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter-Gault is not easily mollified, and her ambition and appetite remain 
great. "I guess my problem is that I unapologetically want it all," she said, 
"because I energetically worked for it." 
</P>

COVER STORY; HAS ATTITUDE BROUGHT THE STONES THIS FAR? YEAH.; THIRTY YEARS 
AFTER THEIR FIRST U.S. TOUR, THE STONES ARE HITTING THE ROAD AGAIN. COULD THIS 
BE THE LAST TIME? EVEN THEY DON'T KNOW. ON THE 'VOODOO' ROAD WITH MICK, KEITH, 
CHARLIE, RON (AND THAT NEW TYKE ON BASS). 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We're backstage at the RPM Club, deep in the heart of the Rolling Stones' 
inner circle, trying to answer the question hovering over every Stones tour for 
the past two decades: Is this finally the last time?  
</P>
<P>
 The band has been in town for a month, rehearsing for the mammoth tour that 
begins Monday in Washington, D.C., and the guest list for this warm-up date is 
filled with longtime friends and associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those eager to see the Stones in the intimate setting: comedian Dan 
Aykroyd, who hosted the group a few days earlier at his country estate near 
here, and Rolling Stone magazine publisher Jann Wenner, who flew here from New 
York to see what he still regards as the world's greatest rock band. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, including those who work with the Stones, is surprised by the question 
about whether this will be the last tour. Didn't a twentysomething Mick Jagger 
once say he couldn't imagine singing "Satisfaction" when he was 40? 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 31 years since the Stones began defining the renegade attitude in 
rock, and the band's co-founders -- those who have survived -- are all past 50 
with the meter running. Bill Wyman, the bass player who is 57, called it quits 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely the last time," says one insider, standing in the shadows 
near the crowded bar in the waterfront club's upstairs VIP area. "The only 
reason they haven't announced it is they think the idea of a farewell tour is 
tacky. . . . Like you are trying to drum up extra business by saying, 'See us 
before we are gone.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But that's an extreme view. Most of the others questioned feel the issue is 
more fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 "If age was going to intimidate them, they would have quit long ago," says one 
high-ranking member of the production team, standing by a rail overlooking the 
dance floor where 1,200 fans are restlessly awaiting the show. "It's not a lot 
of fun being called wrinkly rockers, but they kind of take it as a badge of 
honor. They are intrigued with seeing how long they can keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the answer has to come from the band members themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Mick Jagger, who is 11 years past the once-dreaded 40, frowns when asked about 
the Stones' future. "Next question, please." 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Charlie Watts, who at 53 is the oldest Stone, weighs the matter before 
politely saying, "Well, that's the big one, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Richards, sitting alone in a backstage lounge area, sets down his beer 
and shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Jagger likes to joustc with the media in a teasing attempt to keep you 
away from the family secrets, Richards, 50, enjoys bringing you into the 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's part of you that feels the Stones will be here forever, but you know 
that can't be," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is things were a lot more fragile for us during the '80s than 
anyone realized, including the band. It's only now that I can look back and see 
how close it came to coming apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Richards -- whose bluesy guitar riffs on such hits as "Tumbling Dice" and 
"Honky Tonk Women" are as much milestones in rock as a great Dylan lyric -- 
pauses to light a cigarette and look across the room at a guitar case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that Bill has left, we are down to the hard core, aren't we? We are able 
to continue without him, but if anyone else decides he's had enough, that will 
be the end . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "That uncertainty makes you (savor) every moment now . . . even the 
rehearsals, because you don't know how much longer it'll last. One phone call 
and it could all be over." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate finish line for the Stones isn't the only provocative question 
swirling around the legendary British band as it rolls into a five-month U.S. 
tour that arrives at the Rose Bowl on Oct. 19. (National tour grosses could 
reach $135 million. The tour is expected to continue around the world for most 
of 1995, and attendance for the entire tour could total 6 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 Another key concern is whether the Stones can still compete in the Pearl Jam 
world of '90s rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is important because box-office success could be a factor in the 
Stones' decision about future tours -- and the news about ticket sales hasn't 
been all good so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the band sold out four stadium shows in the Los Angeles area on the 1989 
"Steel Wheels" tour, promoters are only committed to two so far this trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Cohl, the Toronto promoter who is handling the entire tour, says he's 
not worried. He's counting on response to the new album, "Voodoo Lounge," and 
strong word-of-mouth from the early shows to spur ticket sales. "My feeling," 
he says, "is that in the end, the tour will be at least as big as 'Steel 
Wheels.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But are the Stones still relevant? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an outfit that has been attacked as over-the-hill for more years than 
most bands stay together. People have been calling for their scalps off and on 
ever since the rival Beatles disbanded in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Though strong albums (such as 1978's "Some Girls") or dynamic tours (1989's 
"Steel Wheels") quieted the grumbling at key points, the rise of a new 
generation of young bands raises questions about the Stones again. 
</P>
<P>
 Such songwriters as the late Kurt Cobain, Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor and 
Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder explore contemporary alienation and rage in ways that 
give today's rock its strongest sociological kick in years. 
</P>
<P>
 What does that do to the Stones, whose lyrics continue to deal with sex and 
rock 'n' roll (no more drugs, please) more than with trying to understand 
adolescent Angst ? 
</P>
<P>
 Critics are divided over the value of the Stones and the new album. (See 
PopMeter, Page 57). 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling Stone magazine speaks of the collection, which entered the U.S. pop 
charts at No. 2, as a musical rebirth: "The new album is ragged and glorious, 
reveling in the quintessential rock and roll the Stones marked as their own 
some 30 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 But the New York Times finds it "hollow." 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek declares it, "The most muscular and exciting work from the band in a 
decade. . . . Nice one, lads." Yet England's Q magazine feels it represents the 
Stones at their "least newsworthy." 
</P>
<P>
 The best test of relevance, however, may rest with today's young rock fans -- 
and there was no question about the Stones' relevance to most of the young fans 
who started lining up at 8 a.m. for the group's show at the RPM. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think of them as just a history lesson, but as a band that is still 
great, " says Rick Lee, 18, who is wearing a "Lollapalooza" T-shirt as he waits 
in the club for the Stones to walk on stage for the first time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 He and the rest of the crowd surge forward as the lights go down just before 
10 p.m. It's the band's first show with Wyman's replacement Darryl Jones, who 
formerly played with Miles Davis and Sting. 
</P>
<P>
 The band opens up with "Live With Me," a tale of nasty habits from 1969's "Let 
It Bleed," and Jagger springs to life with his trademark marionette moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the severe lines in his face, Jagger looks remarkably youthful. 
He's been a dedicated jogger for years, but he has now added weights to his 
exercise routine. The once skinny arms and chest are noticeably muscular. 
</P>
<P>
 As the band continues through such trademark hits as "Brown Sugar" and such 
surprises as an acoustic "No Expectations," the room is filled with rock 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the crowd stands quietly, looking at the stage as if mesmerized. In 
the abstract, it's easy to joke about the Stones and whether Jagger will 
someday be singing "Satisfaction" from a wheelchair. Put them on stage, 
however, and they remain masters of the form. 
</P>
<P>
 On the stadium dates, the show will be expanded into a massive spectacle. 
Joseph Rascoff, longtime business manager for the band and producer of the 
tour, said the stage will be bigger than the "Steel Wheels" set. The dimensions 
will be nine stories high, 100 feet deep and as much as 300 feet wide in 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd see a setting more spectacular than 'Steel Wheels,' but 
the band enjoys pushing the envelope . . . creating a thrilling rock 'n' 
spectacle," says Rascoff. "This is a whole new show. We're not talking 'City 
Slickers II' here." 
</P>
<P>
 But the music alone wowed the local media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Satisfaction!" declared the headline in the Toronto Sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Concert of a lifetime," cheered the Star. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gathering no moss," reported the Globe and Mail. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of relevance, Jagger says, "I can understand when someone says we 
are irrelevant, because when I was twenty-something, I thought people over 40 
were just dead . So the idea of someone 50 being in a rock band is a bit 
ridiculous to someone 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, you don't think it is ridiculous when you are 50. To me, it's 
still a terrific thing to do and so you go on doing it just as you go on making 
films after you have made successful ones. If you are a singer, you go out and 
sing. Beyond that I don't think you really need to look." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four hours before the RPM show, the atmosphere is even more intimate as 
the Stones rehearse in the gymnasium of a private boys' school in suburban 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Paper is taped across the windows to keep the light out during the 
late-afternoon-to-midnight sessions -- and to discourage curious fans from 
trying to get a peek at the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Titles of 60 to 70 songs, from such album tracks as "Monkey Man" to such 
signature numbers as "Street Fighting Man," are written on the bulletin board 
-- tunes that will be rehearsed so that they can be added at will to a 
particular show. 
</P>
<P>
 Given all the public squabbling between Jagger and Richards in the mid-'80s 
over Jagger's decision to make a solo album, it's disarming to see them so 
playful together -- almost like brothers -- in the rehearsal room. 
</P>
<P>
 Between songs, Jagger frequently walks over and puts his arm around Richards 
as they have a private chuckle. Watts, sitting behind the drum kit, chats with 
guitarist Ron Wood, 48, who joined the band in 1975. Adding to the family 
atmosphere is the fact that Richards' father is seated nearby, watching the 
whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the support musicians seem like family. Most, including saxophonist Bobby 
Keys and keyboardist Chuck Leavell, have toured with the band before. During a 
dinner break, the whole cast sits together with the crew in the school dining 
room rather than go to separate rooms. Video games and a large-screen TV are 
positioned nearby for relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been very embracing, very warm," says bassist Jones, a 32-year-old 
Chicago native who has also worked in the studio with Eric Clapton and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a different work ethic than some of the people I've worked with. 
With some artists, if we are going to be rehearsing from 6 to 12 at night, we 
are going to be rehearsing from 6 to 12 . . . not a lot else is going to go 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys work in spurts. We might work one tune or three or four tunes for 
a good period of time and then have a break. They work hard, but they play 
equally hard . . . watching sports on TV or lots of joking around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always so harmonious. 
</P>
<P>
 In all the media attention over the Richards-Jagger feud about their 
respective commitment to the band, an even greater threat to the Stones' future 
went largely unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said over and over at the time, it wasn't just Keith and me," Jagger 
explains during the dinner break. "It was the whole band and people didn't 
believe it. They just wanted to talk about the two of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Wyman wanted out after the band's 1981 tour -- agreeing to come back for a 
final tour only after constant urging from Jagger. 
</P>
<P>
 Watts, too, thought about calling it quits at the time. The jazz-loving 
drummer has always been the most dignified Stone -- the one who seemed furthest 
from the group's sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll image. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, he was almost invisible on the road -- keeping away from interviews 
and the assorted tour hoopla. Even now, he stays at the band's headquarters 
hotel here rather than at private homes in the countryside like Jagger, 
Richards and Wood. It's less fuss, he says, and he avoids the 45-minute 
commute. 
</P>
<P>
 But Watts speaks easily now about his problems during the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty ill, for me, very ill . . . lots of drugs and lots of drink," he 
says, tugging at the crease in his sharply tailored trousers. "I nearly lost 
everything. I nearly lost my marriage and the band as well through it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only after he straightened out himself and the marriage that he agreed 
to go on the road again for the "Steel Wheels" tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he understand how Wyman could walk away from the most celebrated rock 
group in the world? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I know why Bill left," Watts says without hesitation. "He got fed up 
being on the road and in the studio. . . . He wanted to spend the rest of his 
life, which he considers not very long now, 20 years maybe, at home." 
</P>
<P>
 And how does Watts feel now? 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the tour, I asked myself if I wanted to stop now at the age of 53 and 
I thought that is a bit young," he replies. "The problem is I think that once 
you do stop, and you can afford to sit at home, you become a person that sits 
at home, you know what I mean? 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, there is an awful lot to be said for that and I miss (being home) at the 
moment, but I didn't feel it was the right time. Maybe in a couple years' 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Jagger, too, says he understands Wyman's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't want to go through what I'm going to go through for the next year 
or so," he says straightforwardly in a separate interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every so often, I think about what else I could be doing. Someone will call 
me up from France and say it's a pity I'm not there because there are all these 
people coming over and they're going out to the country or whatever. I can 
imagine the scene, but I'm sitting here in the school and think maybe next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Richards, he agrees that the Stones would be over if Watts decided to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Short of that, what would tell him that it is time? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea," he says, somewhat wistfully. "I'm sure I'll know when I see 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the Stones, Richards appears the one pledged to rock on forever. It's 
ironic because he once seemed like everybody's best bet in the "ghoul pools" 
that speculated on who would be most likely to join Janis Joplin and Jimi 
Hendrix as rock casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 The memory of those wild days is on Richards' mind in Toronto because it was 
here that he was arrested for heroin possession and faced a seven-year prison 
sentence. He was finally sentenced in 1978 to one year's probation and ordered 
to give two benefit concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dressing room of the RPM, Richards recalls that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I hit the bar at the right time," he says of the arrest. "It just 
happened to be here. It could have happened anywhere. For me, it turned out to 
be the kick in the ass that I needed. I realized I was screwing my family and 
the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what seven years of hard time meant and I wasn't going to enjoy it, 
but I knew it wasn't fair to everybody else. That was too much to bear . . . 
enough for me to shake out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Jagger and Watts, Richards shrugs when asked if he ever thinks of 
hanging up his rock 'n' roll shoes. Even if the Stones call it quits, he says, 
he'll continue, probably with the Winos, the band he put together in 1988 for 
his first solo album. 
</P>
<P>
 He seems wistful, though, at the thought of the Stones' last days. His mood 
brightens as the club doors open and he hears the excitement of the crowd as 
they race for positions near the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't imagine anything ever happening to the Stones," he says. "The 
attitude in the band is so strong now that we are like snarling tigers. If this 
is the last time, it's going to be a hell of a time." They Do 'Voodoo' 
</P>
<P>
 The Rolling Stones' "Voodoo Lounge" tour kicks off Monday at RFK Stadium in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Stones' 12th U.S. tour; so far, they've announced 22 shows in 16 U.S. 
cites and the number is expected to more than double. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way they'll sell about 2.5 million tickets and gross up to $135 
million. They're expected to go international next year and will be seen by 
another expected 3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The only announced West Coast date is Oct. 19 at the Rose Bowl, with the Red 
Hot Chili Peppers and Buddy Guy opening, but a second show there, Oct. 20, is 
expected be added.

 In the morning's mail there is a manila envelope with Mark's return address in 
Berkeley. I heft the parcel: just a few pages. As usual I go through all the 
other things first -- the bills, a weekly solicitation for an environmental 
cause, a magazine from the college sorority of which I was briefly a member. 
Skimming this silly publication, habitually tossed in the trash immediately 
upon receipt, briefly delays the moment I will finally pick up the envelope and 
open it. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside there is a Xeroxed copy of an article and a brief note from Mark in 
handwriting that is not his since he has none; he has been unable to hold a 
writing instrument in his hand since he was paralyzed with polio at the age of 
6. Now 45, he seldom leaves the massive iron lung that fills his chest with air 
18 times a minute, its sibilant gasp measuring the rhythm of his days and 
nights. Different attendants handle his personal correspondence, and the 
handwriting varies accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 I let out a little sigh. The reminders of Mark's gargantuan physical 
incapacity drift over everything, like a sandstorm that seeps not only through 
the closed doors and windows but beneath the rolled-up towels pressed against 
them. Even this simple note dusts my fingers with the powdery residue of fear 
and discomfort that taints so many encounters between the crippled and the 
able-bodied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the skull on the desk," Mark said once, matter-of-factly. The what? 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, the skull, the death's head, the reminder of death." Mark O'Brien, 
memento mori, the ultimate party pooper. This was his explanation for the 
disquietude I'd encountered when I told people about him. I myself believed it 
wasn't the fear of death that O'Brien evoked but the specter of a life so 
circumscribed that most people assume it is not worth living, and therefore not 
worth considering: condemned to eat, drink, laugh, cry, urinate, sleep, awaken 
and someday sicken and die while encased from the neck down in a 6-foot-long, 
650-pound steel cylinder. His head is permanently turned to the right and his 
view of the world is from a prone position; his scoliosis, or curvature of the 
spine, is so severe that if strapped upright in a wheelchair, his lungs and 
diaphragm would crumple and he could not breathe. Most of the time, O'Brien is 
alone in his apartment; almost all the time he is without the touch of another 
human being -- except the people he pays to come three times a day to feed, 
wash and dress him. If he has an itch, he cannot scratch it; if a roach crawls 
across his face, he cannot bat it away. 
</P>
<P>
 A published poet and journalist, he connects to the world outside his shabby 
apartment off Telegraph Avenue by means of a single crude instrument: a 12-inch 
stick with a plastic bulb on one end that he seizes between his teeth. With 
this mouthstick, he can rotate a small, revolving table next to his head that 
holds his radio, tape recorder and phone switch, and operate each in turn with 
a series of firm taps. He types on an old computer with the stick, and he uses 
it to turn the pages of books and magazines propped on the table. Once when the 
stick broke, O'Brien was helpless, unable to even call 911, until his roommate 
came home seven hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it gain us to consider such an existence? Our first reaction is to 
turn away, an act that further diminishes those whose bodies have failed them. 
"When polio first appeared as an epidemic malady at the end of the 19th 
Century, people who were paralyzed were treated like the victims of a wasting 
disease, suddenly lifted out of the mainstream of life and transported to a 
special alternate universe reserved for those who are waiting to die," wrote 
Jane S. Smith in "Patenting the Sun," the history of the Salk vaccine. "The 
only problem was, they weren't dying. . . . They were simply crippled." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the machine that enables his child-sized recumbent body to breathe, 
O'Brien is a forgotten relic of a disease that has faded from the public 
consciousness. Polio was once more virulent than AIDS in this country: 333,000 
cases were reported in the decade between 1946 and 1956 -- more than the total 
number diagnosed with AIDS between 1982 and 1992. Even the March of Dimes has 
distanced itself from polio, no longer raising funds in its victims' behalf and 
focusing instead on birth defects. For Americans under 35, most of whom were 
vaccinated in early childhood, polio arouses no more dread than smallpox, which 
is now extinct. Today only 120 iron lungs are still in use by aging polio 
victims, according to Lifecare International, the Colorado firm that maintains 
the old machines with March of Dimes funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The iron lung was invented to assist people whose breathing muscles or 
respiratory nerve centers were paralyzed, until they recovered sufficiently to 
breathe on their own. Unlike modern positive-pressure ventilators, which push 
air into the trachea, the iron lung forms an airtight chamber around the body 
and momentarily creates a vacuum inside the chest. This mimics the natural 
action of the diaphragm, causing air to rush into the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its bulk, immobility and generally horrific aspect, the iron lung 
wasn't intended to be a permanent way of life. This was the worst fear of the 
doctors who tested the first primitive devices 60 years ago -- that they would 
enable the sickest "polios," those with the poorest prognosis, to linger on and 
on. "Many of the patients were so severely handicapped that often we felt 
guilty at saving their lives," recalled Dr. James L. Wilson in his book, 
"Memoirs of the Respirator." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien was that kind of patient, and he has had his fill of this sort of 
talk, the way guilt slides so easily into regret, a smooth segue from "You poor 
sonofabitch, how can you live this way?" to "You shouldn't have to live this 
way," and, finally: "You shouldn't have to live." It's a slippery slope to 
negotiate as the national health care debate raises questions about whose life 
we can afford to prolong, and whose we can't. 
</P>
<P>
 In an essay for Pacific News Service a decade ago, O'Brien deplored the 
publicity given Elizabeth Bouvia, a disabled woman who at that time was seeking 
a court order allowing her to starve herself to death in a California nursing 
home. A former social worker with a college degree, she told reporters she was 
tired of living with cerebral palsy, which had paralyzed her since birth. 
(Bouvia lost her lawsuit and now lives in a Los Angeles hospital.) O'Brien saw 
Bouvia as a whiner, and a dangerous one at that, for spreading the notion that 
death is preferable to disability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Along with other disabled people, I resent her saying this," wrote O'Brien, 
who was far more handicapped than Bouvia. His own Irish Catholic upbringing in 
blue-collar South Boston instilled a stoicism perfectly fitted to what some 
clinicians term the classic "polio personality" -- determined to achieve, loath 
to complain. "We fear able-bodied people will think her longing for death and 
pity is typical of all of us. It isn't. We want to live. We don't want pity." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet long after meeting O'Brien, I still did not know how to write about him 
without succumbing to pity and worn cliches. "I think the fact of Mark's 
existence can defeat writing, defeat interpretation, without bathos or some 
vice creeping into it," says John Carnahan, O'Brien's longtime attendant. "It 
always struck me as a very difficult thing. Even in the writings of disabled 
people themselves, disability is something they don't get around." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the mail arrived containing the note from O'Brien and a short story from 
The Sun, a literary magazine out of North Carolina in which his work has 
occasionally appeared. This story, however, was written by Gillian Kendall, the 
roommate of one of O'Brien's former attendants. Its narrator is a young woman 
who takes care of a paralyzed man four days a week, and as her emotional 
attachment to "Joe" grows, so does her disconsolate guilt over her pleasantly 
aimless postgraduate life, complete with lover, while Joe suffers alone. The 
story is dedicated to Mark O'Brien: 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time I thought about Joe's disability this way: I regretted it had 
happened to such a nice guy -- as if polio would've been OK for, say, Phyllis 
Schlafly or Al Haig -- but I wondered if he was so nice partly because of what 
he'd been through. Was he made patient by hospitals or humbled by pain? No, I 
thought, no one else's character improved under stress: Susan's eating disorder 
didn't mellow her snobbery, Tim's awkwardness didn't make him more eager to 
please, my own vague loneliness didn't lessen my critical nature. If Joe were 
de-paralyzed, I thought, he'd still speak quietly, sit straight but relaxed, 
remember birthdays, laugh at all jokes, return phone calls promptly and visit 
the sick. He would remain reliable and sweet, better than my friends and I." 
</P>
<P>
 I, too, had pondered the genesis of O'Brien's character and his remarkable 
ability to endure. Polio had altered his experience of life so profoundly it 
was impossible to extricate the de-paralyzed O'Brien from the real one. You 
hear of people "struck down" in their prime; Mark never had a prime. Most of 
his childhood, and all of his adolescence and adulthood has been constricted, 
to an extent barely imaginable, not only by his paralysis but also by the tank 
that cradles him in its permanent grasp. He never rode a bike, never drove a 
car, never had a girlfriend, never slept over at a friend's house, never played 
baseball. A list of all his nevers would fill a book. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet. Meeting O'Brien, being with him, one gets no sense of this at all. 
Observant, funny, seemingly without self-pity, O'Brien doesn't talk like a man 
sequestered from the world, but who seeks engagement at every turn. Stripped of 
the physical realm of ordinary existence, he reveals the human spirit laid bare 
to the bone, its ravenous hunger for life -- for one more day, one more hour, 
another breath, a tick of the pulse. In Mark's oddly youthful face, soft and 
still unlined in his mid-40s, you can almost see a naked beating heart, vital 
and frighteningly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Joe's caretaker, I wished I could right the wrong of his misfortune. But 
I could not reconfigure the universe. All I could do was brush away the dust of 
fear and guilt, and get on with the job of telling Mark's story.  
</P>
<P>
 IT WAS SEPTEMBER, RIGHT BEFORE HE WAS TO START FIRST GRADE IN Dorchester -- 
the natives pronounce it DAH-chestah -- in South Boston. It would be more than 
20 years before he entered a classroom again. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen O'Brien: "He was complaining about pains in his stomach and we sent him 
to the hospital right away. Remember? It was evening time after supper. I put 
the kids to bed and he was complaining. He wasn't the sort of kid to complain 
unless something was bothering him anyhow. So we took him right to the 
hospital. He was able to walk in. They did a spinal tap and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter O'Brien: "Most of the kids around him died there." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen O'Brien: "The ones that were real bad did, yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter O'Brien: "No worse than Mark."  
</P>
<P>
 There is a haunting sameness to the stories of polio children during the 
epidemic years of the 1940s and '50s. From the precipice of robust, youthful 
health, they fall suddenly ill. Their families suspect the worst. There is the 
doctor's hurried visit, for those were the days when doctors still made house 
calls; the rush to the hospital; the spinal tap, the dreaded diagnosis, the 
polio ward. 
</P>
<P>
 From this point on, their stories rupture: Most got better, miraculously 
better. Some did not, a failure deemed faintly shameful. The American myth held 
that one did not succumb to polio, but fought, overcame, surmounted it by 
strength of will -- like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who locked his 
limp legs in braces to appear to be standing on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter O'Brien: "Even in the March of Dimes, they always showed those little 
kids walking with sticks, you know: This ain't too bad. A cute kid. Send money. 
They always showed the very least disabled. They never did show the iron lung 
concept, they tried to keep that quiet. That's my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen O'Brien: "People said, oh well, my kid -- he fought, he came back. Well, 
maybe he fought, but they don't all come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark got polio in 1955, along with 28,984 other people in the United States. 
Only a few months earlier, Dr. Jonas Salk had gained worldwide celebrity for 
developing the first poliomyelitis vaccine. But after children in California 
and Idaho contracted polio from a batch of hastily formulated vaccine, the 
Massachusetts medical society halted inoculations. While doctors argued over 
the safety of the vaccine, a polio epidemic hit the Boston area that summer. 
Mark was among the last stricken. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of his arrival at Children's Hospital in Boston, he was put in an 
iron lung. There were 1,043 deaths from polio that year, but children of the 
'50s knew that the truly unlucky victims were those in the iron lungs. Their 
bodies were swallowed up by machines that would forever define the concept -- 
as any child could plainly see -- of a fate worse than death. 
</P>
<P>
 Poliomyelitis is a notoriously capricious virus, usually no more disabling 
than the flu, which its early symptoms resemble. For centuries, human beings 
have fallen ill with polio and recovered with no ill effects. Mark was part of 
the small minority -- less than 4% -- in whom the virus penetrates the inner 
core of the spinal cord and brain stem, where motor impulses arise and are 
transmitted to the muscles. Inside this slender channel -- the switching 
station, so to speak, for voluntary movement -- the disease causes lesions that 
rapidly kill off large motor nerve cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Once destroyed, they cannot regenerate themselves as do cells in other large 
organs. Paralysis results, sometimes within hours of the first symptoms. Though 
statistically infrequent, cases of paralysis mount up alarmingly during a polio 
epidemic such as the one in 1952, which infected nearly 58,000 people in the 
United States. Thus polio became famous not for its normal mild manifestation, 
but its worst-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the paralysis strikes depends on what microscopic portions of the spinal 
cord are affected, and how many motor neurons ultimately survive. A patient 
might walk, but be unable to chew or swallow; use one arm and leg, but not the 
others. Limbs that are paralyzed at first may later regain movement. This 
happens when motor neurons are merely shocked by the swelling caused when 
adjacent nerve cells are destroyed; after the swelling subsides, those living 
cells begin to work again. They may overcompensate, sprouting new connections 
to muscle fibers that had been inactivated by dead neurons. The sprouting 
phenomenon, as much as strength of will, is responsible for the satisfying 
sagas of polio victims who managed to cast off their leather braces and 
wheelchairs, and walk. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the years, the multibranched neurons tend to burn out, something like 
an electric outlet burdened with too many extension cords. This is one of the 
leading explanations for post-polio syndrome, which paradoxically afflicts many 
of those who were most successful in "overcoming" polio. Their number includes 
Roosevelt, whose weakened condition prior to his death in 1945 was caused, some 
polio experts say, by post-polio syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 At Children's Hospital in Boston, where pivotal research in the battle against 
polio had been carried out, Mark refused to die. And his limbs and trunk 
refused to move, despite the hospital's arsenal of rehabilitative weapons: 
rocking beds (which used gravity to aid breathing), hot baths, physical 
therapy. "The dominant theory was stretch it till it hurts, then stretch it a 
little more," he says, a painful and outdated regimen that led to a lifelong 
fear of being lifted, moved or immersed in water. When there was nothing more 
to be done, the doctors sent him home, where he lived in an iron lung. Outside 
it, he could breathe for only a few hours before the effort exhausted him. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen O'Brien: "Actually we fought to get him home because we didn't like the 
situation there. We felt as though he wasn't getting the attention he needed. 
We felt as though we could do it. And we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter O'Brien: "Which was a big mistake. The doctor told me at the time, you 
don't realize what you're getting in for. And we both were righteously 
indignant . . . (but) he was correct. From the first grade on through high 
school, Helen had to take care of him day and night, feed him three times a 
day, bathe him, bowel movements. Twelve years of school she handled. She had to 
do all the work. Helen kept the therapy up for a long, long time with no 
result." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen O'Brien: "The limbs, the arms, the legs, lifting the torso. You could 
only push him so far, because the joints were terribly stiff and, of course, I 
didn't want to hurt him." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter O'Brien: "And for all those years . . . we just kept going. All those 
years we were never able to go anyplace together -- one of us always had to be 
home. That was every day of the week. I think Helen deserves tremendous credit. 
I think a lot of women would have walked away, years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen O'Brien's large blue eyes, Mark's eyes, blink as if she's fighting back 
tears. "Another thing that made it easier," she adds, "was he was a very 
intelligent person, an easy person to live with. He didn't complain. Never." 
</P>
<P>
 THEIR OLDEST CHILD'S POLIO WAS THE FIRST IN a series of tribulations for the 
O'Briens. Mark's sister Karen, three years younger, died suddenly of pneumonia 
when she was 7. His other sister, Rachel, born after Karen's death, is diabetic 
and already a widow; her young husband died of kidney failure. (Only Mark's 
43-year-old brother, Ken, a trial lawyer in Sacramento, has escaped serious 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark's siblings played alongside him at home, and sometimes his mother wheeled 
him outside on his hospital cot to watch the games of neighborhood children. 
But for the most part he lived on the periphery of activity, the iron lung 
relegated to converted garages and back bedrooms of the family's various homes 
-- first in Boston and later in Sacramento, where his father was chief counsel 
of the Sacramento Army Depot. Aside from his mother's stretching exercises, he 
received no rehabilitative physical therapy. He never returned to school; 
visiting teachers supervised the course work for his high school equivalency 
degree. There was no such thing as "mainstreaming." His Catholic confirmation 
took place not with the usual ritual in the church sanctuary, but in the 
sacristy, out of sight of parishioners. "The priest said he didn't want Mark to 
be embarrassed," says Walter O'Brien, the memory still rankling him. "It wasn't 
Mark he was thinking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the logistics involved, there were few family vacations. Once the 
O'Briens traveled to Quebec, an excursion that started out pleasantly enough 
until they got to the Cathedral of Ste. Anne-de-Beaupre, where a hidden agenda 
was revealed. As Mark described in his 1982 article, "How I Became a Human 
Being": 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I recall most vividly is the enormous stone wall covered with 
casts, crutches and various devices associated with illness. All of these 
things, we were told, had been discarded by people who had made the pilgrimage 
to the shrine of Ste. Anne, had prayed with devotion to the saint and had 
sprinkled themselves with the holy water which was available there. I realized 
that the purpose of the trip was not to see the red-jacketed Canadian soldiers 
in the Citadel or the Canada Dry bottling plant in downtown Quebec. The purpose 
of the trip was to find some means whereby I could get out of the terrible bind 
which polio had put me in. . . . To think that all of these strangers should be 
praying for me, that my parents should have gone to the trouble and expense of 
bringing us all up here and that thisentire religious enterprise was directed 
towards people like me was more than I could bear." 
</P>
<P>
 After his brother started college, Mark's isolation increased. He weighed only 
65 pounds but was getting harder for his mother to lift and care for. "To keep 
from hurting her, I began to spend more and more of my time in my room reading, 
watching television and listening to the radio. Except for medical 
appointments, I never left," he wrote. "I could see . . . that life was passing 
me by." 
</P>
<P>
 The depth of his loneliness is seen in a passage from his unfinished 
autobiographical novel, in which a social worker probes the paralyzed "Paul" 
for details about his personal life. Paul answers warily: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what you want to know. My life's been pretty much boring since I 
got polio." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll let you in on a secret, Paul," she said, smiling again. "My life's 
pretty much boring, too. Filling out reports, sitting on staff committees, 
drinking stale coffee because the vending machine's broken. But everybody's 
bored in a different way. So tell me how it's been boring for you. Do you get 
out often, have any friends, know any women?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No. Not really. I mean . . . none of those things. I just stay in my room, 
watch TV. I have subscriptions to Newsweek and Esquire, so I read a little." 
Jesus Christ! How could she ask such stupid questions? Of course, I don't know 
any women! I never leave the goddamned house. And she can see how ugly and 
deformed I am. Women don't unbutton their blouses for bony monsters like me . . 
. His right eye began to tear, although he did not know why. 
</P>
<P>
 It was blunt-spoken Walter O'Brien who pushed his son out of the nest after 
reading about the Physically Disabled Students Residential Program at UC 
Berkeley. The state Department of Rehabilitation paid tuition and expenses for 
qualified students, who lived in a dorm on campus with a 24-hour attendant and 
learned the skills they needed to live on their own. The elder O'Brien 
contacted the agency, but was told by the staff that Mark "couldn't physically 
do it, couldn't go through college with his disability." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, a former worker at the Boston Navy Yard who had gone to school on the 
GI Bill, bulldozed his way to Ed Roberts, the agency director. (He now heads 
the World Institute on Disability in Oakland.) Roberts was a Berkeley graduate 
who also slept in an iron lung. "I made it very clear that I wanted Mark to 
have the same opportunity he had," recalls Walter O'Brien. "So he said sit 
down, we'll talk. I talked about Mark's condition. I said it was very bad, but 
if anyone can do this, he can. Shortly after that, we got him into the 
program." But it would be another two years before he could actually begin 
classes at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, at the age of 27, Mark and his iron lung were loaded into a van and 
he left home for good. He entered the Kaiser Foundation Rehabilitation Center 
in Vallejo for evaluation -- supposedly a first step on the route to Berkeley. 
He had mixed feelings about going. "I knew I had to get out. It was something I 
wanted to do but either I was too afraid or too passive to do it. I could see 
my parents getting older, too old to take care of me. I had them scared 
shitless. I was just like them -- I didn't know what else to do." 
</P>
<P>
 After he left home, his parents got their chance to travel -- to Europe, 
Hawaii, the Caribbean, Hong Kong. Mark has never been back to their comfortable 
ranch-style home outside Sacramento. Compared to the 20 years of unnatural 
intimacy forced by his paralysis, his relationship with his parents seems 
distant now, suffused with sadness. "They've had a terrible life, just dealing 
with their children -- all this disease and disability," Mark says. He believes 
they never recovered from the loss of his younger sister -- the healthy child, 
not the sick one -- whom he recalls in a poem from "Breathing," a collection of 
his poetry published in 1990.

 At Kaiser Hospital, O'Brien underwent a new kind of physical therapy, reviving 
his childhood hopes that his paralysis would miraculously improve. Though every 
day he felt stronger, Kaiser soon rendered the same bleak prognosis O'Brien had 
gotten at Children's Hospital in Boston: His motor neurons were beyond salvage. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Medi-Cal would not pay O'Brien's bill at Kaiser if there was no possibility of 
rehabilitation, so within a month he was shipped off again -- to Fairmont 
Hospital in San Leandro, a large county-owned hospital that provided nursing 
care for quadriplegics. "They had a polio ward and people just got warehoused 
there," recalls Karen Topp Goodwyn, a former Department of Rehabilitation 
counselor. From the moment he moved into the room he shared with a comatose 
patient, O'Brien hated Fairmont, but the doctors refused his pleas to return to 
Kaiser. He applied to Berkeley but was rejected. He was trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Two things gave him hope: enrolling in classes at Cal State Hayward (the 
college sent a van to the hospital to pick him up) and learning how to operate 
a British-made typing device called a Possum. Each character on the keyboard 
responded to a pattern of beeps activated by microswitches that O'Brien bumped 
with his chin. The Possum was clunky and slow, but it gave O'Brien a way to put 
on paper the words that were piling up in his brain.

<P>
 IT TOOK TWO MORE YEARS AND A RELENTLESS LOBBYING EFFORT BY Walter O'Brien 
before his son was finally admitted to Berkeley in June, 1978. Mark was almost 
30 years old, full of yearning and without a clue as to how to manage his own 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 He soon found out. At Berkeley, a bold effort was under way to give severely 
disabled young people an education at one of the finest public universities in 
the country. At Goodwyn's behest, the Department of Rehabilitation funneled 
dozens of quadriplegics into Berkeley's residential program for disabled 
students, which set them up in a dorm with a full-time attendant during their 
first year. (After that they were usually expected to make their own living 
arrangements.) Critics carped at the cost -- about $12,000 per student, paid by 
the state -- but it was cheap compared to a room in a nursing home. And it 
offered a crucial dividend: a chance for an independent life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really trying to get people into a university setting because that 
opened so many doors," Goodwyn says now. "Some of these people truly did not 
have the academic prowess to succeed at Berkeley, but I still wanted to give 
them the opportunity to develop independent living skills and get out. So we 
took a lot of risks. There were no other options for a lot of people at that 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 During the heyday of the program in the '70s and '80s, about 250 severely 
disabled young people entered Berkeley through the residential program. O'Brien 
was ecstatic to be one of them. Television news cameras filmed his yellow iron 
lung as it swung by a crane through a dormitory window. Attendants pushed him 
to class in a reclining wheelchair and treated him as he had never been treated 
before -- as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Society didn't expect much of them and we expected a lot," says former 
director Susan O'Hara, a polio survivor herself. "We expected that everybody 
would be able to function on their own. There was rarely a person who didn't 
make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalls O'Brien: "They helped me with practical things like dealing with the 
bank. Also they insisted on making me pretend I was living by myself so I would 
have to deal directly with the attendants I hired. I couldn't expect some daddy 
figure to deal with them. I had to accept the idea I was in charge, which was 
very difficult for me in the beginning. I had to be my own social worker, 
dealing with four or five different agencies. I had to learn not to be 
intimidated by the bureaucracies and to insist, insist, insist and make myself 
a real pain in the ass." 
</P>
<P>
 AFTER MUCH TRIAL AND ERROR, rehabilitation engineers at Stanford University 
built a customized electric gurney, which he could operate with pressure from 
his left foot and knee -- the only parts of his body below the neck he can 
move. It was another milestone, giving O'Brien the means to go where he wanted, 
when he wanted, by himself. Flat on his back, he used mirrors to negotiate 
bumpy sidewalks, through crowds of people; startled students wondered if he was 
being guided by remote control. 
</P>
<P>
 Steering the gurney was exhausting and dangerous; he once careened over a curb 
and dumped himself into busy Telegraph Avenue. It took him an hour and 15 
minutes to go from one side of campus to the other. But he wouldn't give up. "I 
wanted to show I could be like all the other cripples in Berkeley. It's some 
big manhood ritual to be independent and control your own wheelchair," O'Brien 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Quadriplegics commonly take six or seven years to graduate from college, but 
O'Brien made it in five, earning a BA in English and a 3.4 grade-point average. 
Then came another reversal of fortune. Shortly after entering graduate school 
in journalism, his health collapsed. To his surprise, post-polio syndrome had 
caught up with him. "I didn't think my physical condition could get any worse," 
he said. He was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 His capacity to stay outside the iron lung diminished dramatically, and he 
dropped out of school. He could no longer go on outings alone or without a 
portable respirator. The electric gurney, symbol of his struggle to become 
independent, sat unused in his apartment. Eventually he gave it to a medical 
mission in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 Post-polio syndrome spun O'Brien to the outer margin of the statistical 
backwash from the polio epidemic of the '50s. Of the estimated 600,000 or so 
survivors of paralytic polio who live in the United States, a tiny minority are 
-- like O'Brien and Ed Roberts, who now uses a ventilator full time during his 
waking hours -- wholly dependent on mechanical ventilation. However, their 
number is growing as thousands of polio survivors are newly weakened by the 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 15 years, O'Brien's home has been the living room of his small 
apartment near the Berkeley campus. (His roommate and emergency attendant, 
Bruce Ward, has the single bedroom.) Living independently "is not a matter of 
individual heroism, as a lot of people would like to think," he cautions. "I 
need money from the government." In addition to Medi-Cal services, he receives 
about $18,000 a year from a variety of sources: Social Security, county welfare 
and a federal rent subsidy program. It would cost taxpayers two times as much 
to support him in a nursing home, according to figures provided by the World 
Institute on Disability. 
</P>
<P>
 The same bureaucracy that gives also takes away. Whenever O'Brien earns more 
than $85 a month, the Social Security Administration requires him to turn over 
roughly 50 cents of every dollar he makes as a free-lance writer. After a 
nonprofit literary foundation awarded O'Brien a $17,000 grant, the government 
docked his monthly disability checks. Not until his father appealed did the 
agency stop; most of the $4,000 it withheld was never refunded. Things that 
would make O'Brien's life easier -- a better computer, for instance -- aren't 
easily acquired, even as gifts, because there are severe limits on the value of 
personal property disability recipients may own. The old Toshiba on which 
O'Brien now writes is on loan from a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The linchpin of independent life for the disabled in California is the In Home 
Support Services program, which enables O'Brien to pay the half-dozen 
attendants who each work for him four to 10 hours a week. They make about $8 an 
hour -- the going rate in Berkeley. Part secretary, part practical nurse, part 
companion, they do everything from shopping and cooking to emptying his bedpan 
and changing his urine bag. Many days, his attendants are the only people 
O'Brien sees. 
</P>
<P>
 He interviews and hires them and, when necessary, fires them. "That's 
something people have to learn, to fire people who aren't doing the job or who 
are abusing them in some way," says O'Brien. "Sometimes it's very rough 
emotionally." When one of his favorite attendants refused to take orders one 
day, O'Brien felt forced to let him go. "It was awful. I kept thinking about 
what a shit he was and how much I hated him, and I cried because I missed him, 
and I hated it that things were this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark continues to write book reviews, essays, poems and occasional journalism 
pieces, tapping the words one letter at a time with his mouthstick. His 
articles for Pacific News Service have appeared in the San Francisco Bay 
Guardian and the Oakland Tribune, and recently he edited the disability section 
of the upcoming Millennium Whole Earth Catalog. Several of his poems are about 
baseball, his lifelong passion, and in the author's description for one of his 
poetry articles, he wrote: "In baseball season he roots for the San Francisco 
Giants; in winter he gets depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Though most of his work deals with disability, he resists being a 
standard-bearer for the cause. Hence his dismay when he attended a news 
conference hosted by the noted physicist Stephen Hawking, who is paralyzed and 
speechless as a result of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and found a radio 
reporter's microphone thrust in his own face: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked me whether seeing Dr. Hawking gave me hope. This struck me as an 
awfully stupid question. Hope for what? Could Dr. Hawking change my life, make 
me walk, get me a lover? I tried to think of a polite way to answer her. 'It's 
not that, so much, as uh . . . He gives me a sense of 'hurray for our side.' "  
</P>
<P>
 "What was I saying? God knows. I just didn't want to get sucked into being 
cast as a Spokesperson for the Disabled in a dreary story headlined "Disabled 
Inspired by Dr. Hawking."  
</P>
<P>
 -- From "The Unification of Steven Hawking" in The Fessenden Review. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking, who married, fathered children, separated and now has a girlfriend, 
did not became disabled until early adulthood, which O'Brien believes is an 
advantage. "You see that with disabled veterans, with people who were disabled 
when they were teen-agers or in their 20s. They have more confidence, more 
self-esteem. The experience of going through puberty makes a person more 
independent. I envy that. It's something I missed." But is it possible that the 
sense of loss is more heightened in those people, that they are angrier with 
their fate? 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien's answer makes it clear only an able-bodied person would ask such a 
dumb question. "We're all angry," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN CARNAHAN KNOWS Mark O'Brien in ways that a lover might, or a mother. 
Before he came to work for O'Brien five years ago, his girlfriend Chandra had 
shared O'Brien's apartment and worked as his attendant for eight years. "My 
best friend," O'Brien calls her. It is an axiom of disabled life that one's 
closest relationships are often formed with one's employees. "Mark has had to 
spend a long time learning how to interact with people -- Chandra helped him a 
lot with that," says Carnahan. O'Brien was characteristically persistent in 
achieving sociability. "He's a very stubborn person, an indomitable person, 
very relentless." 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate student at Cal State Hayward, Carnahan says he became an attendant 
because "it was the only job I could get. I'm not qualified to work at Jack in 
the Box. In addition to that, I'm doing something personal and useful. I don't 
have the contempt for this job I might have for others." 
</P>
<P>
 Carnahan speaks to O'Brien in such a low, gentle voice that I cannot make out 
what he's saying, though I'm sitting only six feet away. He makes a sandwich 
for O'Brien's lunch, tears off pieces and feeds them to him with bites of a 
pickle and sips from a bottled drink. He cleans O'Brien's glasses and settles 
them on his face. He opens the iron lung to take off the clothes the morning 
attendant had put on O'Brien a few hours earlier, clothes he no longer needs to 
wear because he doesn't feel strong enough for an outing today, has not felt 
strong enough for weeks now. 
</P>
<P>
 (Carnahan quit in March, married Chandra and is now concentrating on his 
graduate work. O'Brien has since hired a new attendant.) 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving the room, I notice O'Brien is wearing a handsome multicolored 
shirt of a vaguely ethnic weave, and that his small body is lost inside his 
clothing. Only his hands are revealed, slender and seemingly boneless, like 
empty white gloves, with an invalid's long fingernails. There is a small teddy 
bear beside him on the narrow mattress that slides into the iron lung. Its 
name, O'Brien informs me later, is Maurice. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in O'Brien's kitchen, I get a whiff of the smell of a urine bag being 
changed. (O'Brien's paralysis does not affect bladder and bowel control, sexual 
potency or ability to feel; the external catheter he wears is for convenience, 
not necessity. "Except for my lungs," he has noted ironically, "all of my 
internal organs work well." In fact, he seldom sees a doctor.) Time passes with 
exaggerated slowness, not only because I am lingering awkwardly in the kitchen, 
but because O'Brien's voice is getting weaker as the oxygen leaks out of him. I 
can hardly wait for the iron lung to start up again, and it occurs to me that 
O'Brien must feel that way, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Bristling with metal gauges and locking levers and screwed-down portholes, the 
massive yellow tank aroused such a strong sense of dread during our first 
interview that I could scarcely think of anything else. It overwhelmed the 
cramped living room and swallowed O'Brien up, its huge padded collar clamped so 
tightly under his chin that he appeared to have no neck, not to mention a body. 
His Boston-accented speech was breathy and flat and the words ran together in 
bursts, on the exhale, punctuated by the rhythmic wheezing sound of the leather 
bellows on the iron lung. Though it was sunny out, the room was dark; it hasn't 
been painted since 1979 and faces a bleak alley. Little roaches occasionally 
darted across the table next to O'Brien's head. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was time to go, I almost bolted for the street. I walked for a long 
time in the late spring afternoon, gulping air and taking long strides. My arms 
and legs -- how strong they felt, how perfectly coordinated. Everyone, 
everything in Berkeley seemed full of life. The students were young and 
beautiful. Even the old hippies looked healthy, vigorous. The town gardens were 
bursting with new roses and tangled vines of jasmine, seasonal glories that 
seemed a world away from O'Brien's depressing quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I have dreams where I figure out how to walk," he says. "In the 
dream I think, oh, all I have to do is that! It's something I go round and 
round in my head about. Like why can't I walk? Is it me that can't walk or is 
it my body that can't walk? Is it my mind, my brain or my body? If it's me that 
can't walk, then it's my responsibility I got polio. Why would I get polio? It 
just goes on and on and on. . . . Part of the problem with getting a virus is 
not only is a virus invisible, it's very abstract. It'd be easy if I'd been hit 
by a truck because I could see the truck." 
</P>
<P>
 The iron lung is an umbilical cord that keeps growing shorter. "We used to be 
able to go to a restaurant and he could stay out for an hour and a half without 
his ventilator," says his father. "His lungs are very weak now." He has been to 
only two movies in the past year -- "Much Ado About Nothing" and "The Crying 
Game" -- and hasn't been to Candlestick Park to see his beloved Giants play 
since 1990. Perhaps because polio warped the skeletal structure of his 
breathing cage so young, he doesn't tolerate ventilators well; after only three 
or four hours he needs the tank again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's more likely to push his limits than not. He's the kind of person who 
will go out and ride around until he becomes very sick," says Carnahan, who was 
with O'Brien in 1991 when he became ill at the California Shakespeare Festival 
at Orinda. They couldn't get the Berkeley "crip van" to pick them up early, and 
O'Brien had to be hospitalized for dehydration. He quickly developed pneumonia, 
and there was talk about putting him back in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided I'd rather be dead than in an institution. There's a doctors' myth 
that disabled people need 24-hour care. If you never ever want anything to go 
wrong, I guess you could say that, but I'd rather take my chances," says 
O'Brien, whose memories of hospitals and the nursing home include being left 
for long periods of time with his naked bottom in a bedpan when he failed to 
defecate upon command. "Here I have control over my body, what I eat, what I 
do. I'd like to be able to write and listen to baseball games. I figure if I'm 
in a hospital, someone would steal my computer and there'd be so much noise I 
wouldn't be able to listen to a radio. Anything valuable in a hospital gets 
stolen." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the grave risks O'Brien faces is that the machinery that keeps him 
alive will fail. Years ago he heard about a patient who had lived on his own in 
Berkeley and suffocated when the fan belt on his iron lung broke. If the power 
to his iron lung goes out, O'Brien can switch to the portable ventilator -- but 
only if someone is there to turn it on for him. Without a key to his apartment, 
no one can enter to help him because the electronic switch that he taps to open 
the door doesn't work. So far he's been lucky; none of the blackouts have 
lasted more than 45 minutes. During a recent outage, his screams attracted the 
attention of a neighbor, who called 911. Firefighters carrying a portable 
generator were ready to force their way in when the power came back on. 
</P>
<P>
 Death is one of the subjects his parents don't bring up. "We never discussed 
it," says his mother. "We've always tried to act as if nothing was wrong." Says 
his father: "He's always accepted it could be any day. He don't get depressed 
about it. We talk sports a lot. We talk about writing. It'll take more than 
this to lick him. The doctors said he's not gonna last, and he did. He's got a 
great will to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Another verboten subject is sex. Nine years ago, at the age of 36, he happily 
lost his virginity with a professional surrogate, a woman who is paid to help 
men work out their sexual difficulties. In a moving article he wrote for The 
Sun, O'Brien described seeing his naked body in a mirror that the surrogate 
brought to one of their assignations. He had not seen his genitals since he was 
6 years old, before polio had twisted his body out of sight below his chest. 
"No one in my family had ever discussed sex around me. The attitude I absorbed 
was not so much that polite people never thought about sex, but that no one 
did. . . . I wanted to be loved. I wanted to be held, caressed, and valued. But 
my self-hatred and fear were too intense. I doubted I deserved to be loved. My 
frustrated sexual feelings seemed to be just another curse inflicted upon me by 
a cruel God." 
</P>
<P>
 After his experience with the surrogate, O'Brien bought a futon for his 
apartment in case other sexual opportunities presented themselves. So far none 
has. When asked why he doesn't hire a prostitute -- there are prostitutes in 
Berkeley who specialize in disabled men -- he replied that he wasn't interested 
in sex for the sake of sex. The next day, he wanted to clarify his answer. "I 
talked about wanting a relationship more than sex, which I guess is true, but 
it's only part of the truth. I think I sounded too noble. Part of it is I'm 
just too scared, too shy, too cheap. The thing that gets me is if she still has 
to be compensated monetarily, that means she must think it's really icky and 
horrible to be with me in a sexual way."  
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-nine years of quadriplegia afford ample time to contemplate what the 
poet Gerard Manley Hopkins called the mountains of the mind -- ". . . cliffs of 
fall/ Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed." Though O'Brien casts himself as a 
timid man, beset by many fears, it is impossible to know him without being 
struck by his courage. I searched for another word to describe it, but there it 
was, courage, rooted so deep I could not fathom the source. Faith is probably 
part of it; O'Brien keeps the Bible on his reading table and used to go to Mass 
regularly. He is an admirer of Matthew Fox, the self-described 
"post-denominational" Oakland priest who was silenced by the Vatican for 
outspoken teachings that challenge traditional church doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien has also been in counseling since 1982. His therapist works primarily 
with disabled and chronically ill people, including those who are HIV-positive. 
She thinks polio survivors tend to have a "different mentality" from many other 
disabled people, one that fits the polio stereotype of being fighters -- "they 
push and push." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien no longer has hopes of becoming de-paralyzed. Instead he imagines a 
wheelchair that he can control with his thoughts. Turn left here. Go this way. 
Faster. When asked what would make his life better now, his wish list is 
practical, restrained: "I guess I'd want a bigger apartment. There's barely 
enough room for me to get in the wheelchair. I'd like to be able to pay my 
attendants better. I've been told that my pay scale is about average -- I'd 
like to get in the upper reaches. I'd get a big four-door filing cabinet. I've 
been wanting one for years. I think I'd like a better computer so I could store 
everything in memory, and so I could play games." 
</P>
<P>
 Like all quadriplegics, he is vulnerable to pneumonia, urinary tract 
infections and other disorders that, in his weakened state, could kill him. But 
the most dangerous ailment that threatens O'Brien and other severely disabled 
people is depression. He is hoping his doctor will prescribe medication to lift 
the cloud of despair that darkens the days when O'Brien is too tired to write, 
to get dressed, to go out. On other days, it takes surprisingly little to cheer 
him up. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was seeing the surrogate, I was the opposite of depressed. I'm happy 
when I'm writing something that's hard but good. And when I get a new toy -- a 
tape recorder or computer. When I'm talking with people. When I'm caught up in 
a baseball game. Baseball is the only thing that makes me yell and cheer. It's 
astonishing. Boom -- there's a field, it's huge and it's green and I just want 
to stay there forever. My fantasy is getting my iron lung there behind home 
plate." 
</P>
<P>
 During the '80s, O'Brien went to games at Candlestick with a friend, Lance 
Howland, an editor and former Berkeley resident. "He's a little more of a 
fanatic than I am," says Howland. "When the Giants blew a 10-game lead to lose 
the pennant (in 1993) it was like driving a stake through his heart." 
</P>
<P>
 He has known O'Brien for 16 years, ever since he interviewed him for a story 
and "sensed he was kind of alone -- he needed a friend." Over time, he has 
watched O'Brien decline physically but grow in other ways. "He's much more sure 
of himself as a writer and as a person now." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, O'Brien's ambition was to go to Candlestick Park just once before 
the season ended. He didn't make it. Now he's hopeful again. He'd even settle 
for a game at the Oakland Coliseum, "if I can just overcome my pathological 
hatred of the A's." He makes it sound carefree -- a day at the ballpark! -- 
though this single excursion will take more stamina than he's mustered for many 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the beauty of baseball, as O'Brien would be the first to tell you, and 
its indisputable advantage over our ordinary lives: There's always another 
season. The hopes of the baseball fan are reborn perennially, endlessly, a 
cycle of renewal as old as the game, as easy and natural as breathing itself.O'

MOVIES; FORBIDDEN PLEASURES; RETURN WITH US NOW TO THOSE TITILLATING DAYS OF

<TEXT>
<P>
 Think of it as a tawdry and tarnished golden age, a five-year period, 
unprecedented in Hollywood history, when a single studio turned out dozens of 
raffish, exuberant films made with a frankness not seen before or since. It's 
an era that's become known as "Forbidden Hollywood," and it's easy to see why. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they were produced only from 1930 to 1934 and usually lasted barely 
more than an hour on screen, the films turned out by Warner Bros. and its 
subsidiaries were considered such strong stuff that they led directly to the 
enforcement of an industrywide censorship mechanism known as the Production 
Code that effectively snuffed out any kind of cinematic candor for the next 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the code did its job so effectively that the existence of these 
pre-code movies, which cheerfully shattered taboos about sex, violence and drug 
use, has been largely unknown except to devotees. Now, however, with a 
generous, monthlong 48-film series beginning Thursday at the Nuart in West Los 
Angeles (plus a strong reissue program undertaken by MGM/UA Home 
Entertainment), "Forbidden Hollywood" can be experienced in all its distinctive 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
 As befits any self-contained universe, these movies had a distinctive cast of 
characters. Some performers -- like Ruth Chatterton, Lyle Talbot and the 
ever-smooth Warren William, a.k.a. "the king of pre-code" -- did their best 
work in this period and are consequently little known today. Others -- Bette 
Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson, Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable and 
even John Wayne -- were just getting started and are visible in fascinating 
roles as near-beginners. 
</P>
<P>
 And while some prominent pre-code directors, like William Wellman, went on to 
major careers in later decades, others, like Mervyn LeRoy, who directed a 
heroic 26 features during the period, and the underappreciated Roy del Ruth, 
who directed 22, were not quite as successful outside its confines. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitting their stride just after the 1927 Al Jolson-starring "The Jazz Singer" 
thrust an unready and unwilling industry into the sound era, pre-code movies 
are characterized by the kind of verbal brashness we associate with precocious 
children, so excited to discover how well they have learned to talk that they 
refuse to shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Epitomized by Lee Tracy, who played rakish newspapermen who could have won 
Pulitzer Prizes for nonstop chatter in both "Blessed Event" and "Love Is a 
Racket," pre-code movies are filled with torrents of snappy repartee. And their 
clever, sarcastic and wised-up characters -- given to saying things like "You 
are the limit," "On the level, sister" and "What's the gag?" -- are loaded with 
verbal attitude and don't care who knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 What everyone talked about as often as not was sex. In a way that the 
Production Code would scrupulously stamp out, people in these films leered, 
flirted and very obviously lusted after one another in the most carnal way. 
Married couples had affairs, single folks slept around, and no one was at a 
loss for a provocative line of chat. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Beauty and the Boss," for instance, a banker chides his secretary with a 
"don't squirm, I know you have hips," and she comes back with "when you dictate 
so fast, I never know where my skirt is." In other films, an innocent "you look 
familiar" would be answered with an eyebrow-raising "I'd like to be." And if a 
woman on the prowl could claim, "I'm all alone and going to waste, hanging over 
your head like a ripe peach," a man in a similar mood might say, "Must it 
always be the great love? No little detours?" 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of glib frankness extended, in a way that now looks quaintly sexist, 
to the visuals as well. In no period of American film was as much screen time 
given to backless gowns and elaborate, revealing negligees. Women were forever 
hopping in and out of tubs or changing their clothes, and when Barbara Stanwyck 
is caught in dishabille by a leering intern in "Night Nurse," he cracks, "You 
can't show me a thing, I just came from the delivery room," and she responds 
with a blase: "I guess everyone around here's seen more than I've got." 
</P>
<P>
 Other areas that the Production Code was to make taboo were also fertile 
ground for pre-code films. Murderers could go scandalously unpunished in these 
films, heroes could turn bad (as in the Paul Muni-Mervyn LeRoy classic "I Am a 
Fugitive From a Chain Gang"), homosexuality was acknowledged, albeit in a 
cliched way, and drug use was as well. In "Three on a Match," for instance, 
Humphrey Bogart makes a hand-to-nose gesture indicating another character is a 
woebegone user. 
</P>
<P>
 And if these films were not afraid of sex, they weren't timid about melodrama 
either. Absurd, preposterous plots gave no one pause, and if things got slow, 
characters could be counted on to swallow poison, leap out of high windows or 
even steal milk to feed starving children. Those were the days. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the Nuart series are a pair of the most enjoyable and representative 
of the pre-code films, "Employees' Entrance" and "Baby Face," two tales that 
have an especially contemporary feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Employee's Entrance," directed by Roy del Ruth, stars Warren William in a 
remarkably abrasive and compelling performance as the heartless manager of a 
major department store who regularly lives up to his "smash or be smashed" 
motto. 
</P>
<P>
 Given to ruining lives without a second thought, he casually forces a hungry 
Loretta Young to trade sex for a job and then tries to alienate her from her 
husband, Wallace Ford, by turning him into a workaholic. The ensuing battle for 
Ford's soul has a remarkably modern tone to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more notorious was the Barbara Stanwyck-starring "Baby Face," one of the 
most outrageous of the pre-code films with a tag line of "She had IT and made 
IT pay." Forced to be a tramp by her speak-easy-running father, Stanwyck 
decides to take revenge by turning her sexual attractiveness into a weapon to 
ruin every man in town. And New York is a very big town. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanwyck, whose role here prefigures her performance in "Double Indemnity," 
can also be seen in "Night Nurse" as a sister of mercy going toe-to-toe with a 
mustache-less Clark Gable. Also getting a workout in sex-object parts was Bette 
Davis, cast as a society glamour-puss hooked on the thrill of crime in "Fog 
Over Frisco" and a svelte working girl in "Three on a Match." 
</P>
<P>
 And though she apparently hated the result ("A piece of junk; my shame was 
only exceeded by my fury"), Davis also had one of the most interesting women's 
roles, as an artist who loves her work and wants to live her own life in 
"Ex-Lady." "I don't like the word right ," she informs lover Gene Raymond. "No 
one has any rights about me but me." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most eye-opening of the pre-code independent woman films was 
"Female." It starred Ruth Chatterton as a decisive titan of industry who used 
the handsome men in her company as sexual toys, dismissing them with bonuses 
when she got bored. When a school chum asks, "Is it old-fashioned to want to be 
decent?" the unmoved Chatterton merely shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the pre-code films had a strong fantasy content, and liked to feature 
men in tuxedos and women in fancy gowns, they also tended to reflect the tenor 
of the times. Gangsters and bootleggers figured prominently, as did 
speak-easies where booze was drunk in teacups and taxi dance emporiums where 
dime-a-dance veterans didn't ask too many questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially suited to playing this end-of-the-Jazz-Age despair was Edward G. 
Robinson, giving little-known but memorable performances as a steelworker who 
marries the wrong kind of woman in "Two Seconds" and a newspaper editor who 
callously trashes the lives of decent folks in Mervyn LeRoy's forceful "Five 
Star Final." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, two of the best known of the pre-code films (both directed by William 
Wellman) unflinchingly reflected the killing desperation spawned by the 
economic depression the country was living through. 
</P>
<P>
 The best known of the pair is "Wild Boys of the Road," starring Frankie Darrow 
as one of a small army of young people forced to become vagabonds because of 
impoverished parents. Basically good kids, they are overwhelmed by the miasma 
of joblessness and end up fighting anarchic pitched battles with unfeeling 
police. "Ain't you afraid?" Darrow asks a young lady riding the rails alone. 
"Wouldn't do me any good if I was" is her edgy reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more tough and gritty is Wellman's "Heroes for Sale." It stars sad-eyed 
silent film hero Richard Barthelmess as a World War I veteran who gets a 
morphine addiction instead of the medals he deserves and then experiences bread 
lines, labor unrest and the scrutiny of the sour-faced Red Squad. An 
impressively honest if far-fetched film, "Heroes for Sale" actively explores 
the idea that Depression America was close to total collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the movie industry's Production Code had nominally taken effect in 
1930, it wasn't until 1934, after these films and their brethren had so 
outraged the Catholic Church that it threatened nationwide boycotts and formed 
the Legion of Decency, that Hollywood acquiesced and finally put teeth into the 
document. Almost overnight, "Wild Boys of the Road" gave way to Andy Hardy, and 
realism began a 30-year retreat from the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 (Almost simultaneously with this pre-code series, the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art is putting on an intriguing "Censorship in Hollywood" program, 
showing familiar films like "The Outlaw," "From Here to Eternity" and "A 
Streetcar Named Desire," as well as rarities like "The Story of Temple Drake" 
and "Rain," all of which ran afoul of the implacable censorship bureaucracy.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although in terms of nudity, profanity and bloodshed considerably more is 
allowed on today's screens than the pre-code films could have imagined, the 
freshness of these Warner Bros. movies, their casual and unfettered 
sophistication, enables them to feel surprisingly more adult than Hollywood's 
current predilection for lead-footed sex and violence. Breezy, inconsequential 
and proud of it, these films knew better than to take themselves too seriously, 
and even 60 years after the fact, it's a pleasure to make their acquaintance.

<P>
 Listen to the rhythmic beat of drums, ethnic tales that spotlight the city's 
diverse cultures and the chanting of old ballads. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are just a taste of "The Sounds of Little Tokyo," this year's theme for 
the 54th annual Nisei Week Japanese Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 From Saturday to Aug. 14, a myriad of events and exhibits will inform and 
entertain festival-goers about Japanese customs and traditions, as well as 
about other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want (Nisei Week) to be fitting of our community and the things that go on 
in our community," said Chris Naito, the event's general chairwoman. "We are 
hoping that everyone comes, not just Japanese people." 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights include tales of Hawaiian, Chinese, Mexican, African and Japanese 
cultures from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday at the Maryknoll Japanese Catholic 
Center, 222 S. Hewitt St., and a traditional taiko drum performance from 1 to 4 
p.m. Sunday outside the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A parade through the streets of Little Tokyo will be held at 4 p.m. Sunday. 
Mayor Richard Riordan is scheduled to join Mayor Takeyoshi Nishio of Nagoya, 
Los Angeles' sister city for 35 years, in the two-hour procession of dancers, 
bands and performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nisei Week earned its name from the nisei, or second-generation Japanese 
Americans, who first organized the festival in 1934 during the Great 
Depression. Their hope was to generate jobs, attract business in the Little 
Tokyo area and promote goodwill. Today, it's planned and run by volunteers from 
the Japanese American community.

THE GRINGAS OF SAN MIGUEL DE ALLENDE; THEY CAME, THEY SAW, THEY SET UP CRONING 
CEREMONIES -- HOW A COMMUNITY OF WOMEN GREW AND FLOURISHES IN THE LAND OF 
MACHISMO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jeff Spurrier, Los Angeles journalist Jeff Spurrier writes frequently about 
Mexico; he is currently building a house in San Miguel de Allende. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Mexicans, San Miguel de Allende is the birthplace of independence; although 
Father Miguel Hidalgo issued the grito , or shout for independence, in 1810 
from neighboring Dolores Hidalgo, the annual re-enactment takes place in San 
Miguel's main plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 A new grito is heard in San Miguel these days, not shouted, but murmured. 
Quietly, in meetings at the Unity Church, in the waters of Escondido hot 
springs, over cups of espresso at El Buen Cafe, wherever the expatriates hang 
out. San Miguel is not as spacey as Sedona or as precious as Taos -- there 
aren't graphic ads proclaiming "Death begins in the colon!" in the local weekly 
-- but here, in the heart of the country that invented machismo, you can now 
find hypno-therapy, lymphatic cleansing massages, ozone treatment, book clubs, 
goddess workshops, a local channeler, art classes, dressage classes, tai chi, 
yoga, crone ceremonies under the full moon and nearly daily AA and CoDA 
meetings. To regular visitors, the change is apparent: male to female, hedonism 
to introspection, bars to coffee houses. All this in a town that just a few 
years ago had a reputation as a hard-drinking, ass-kicking hangout, a blend of 
cowboy and Colonial where even a married woman would not be safe from unwanted 
attention if her husband left her side. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hundred and fifty kilometers north of Mexico City and a mile high in the 
heart of the Bajio, the agricultural heart of Mexico, San Miguel de Allende is 
a window on a Mexico of centuries past, when New World silver fueled the 
world's economy and the Inquisitor held court. For nearly 70 years, it's been a 
National Monument, a status that has kept the town of 49,000 free of neon, 
traffic lights and fast food. A long day's drive from Texas, it has for several 
decades been a favorite destination for Americans: Artists discovered it in the 
'30s and '40s, followed in the '50s by ex-servicemen stretching out GI Bill 
benefits. In the '60s and '70s came hippies, backpackers and retirees. During 
the winter and summer, the transient population swelled with Canadian 
snowbirds, Spanish students and fledgling artists, drawn by the Instituto 
Allende, one of Mexico's best art schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the '80s, word spread through travel articles, and the gringas began 
to arrive. Unlike their male peers, many stayed. And they're still coming. Over 
some gender-based network, the word has gone out: If you're a single woman in 
search of deeper meaning, San Miguel is the place to live. You can work on 
yourself in Colonial style, complete with cable TV, maid service, weekly 
massages and a sense of safety difficult to imagine back in El Norte. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who come are familiar with Mexico and know of San Miguel from past 
visits; others have never been south of the border. They have drastically 
skewed the gender balance among the 5,000 or so expatriates -- four single 
women to every unmarried man, says guidebook publisher Joanie Barcal. They are 
twentysomethings to geriatrics, although most are in the 30-to-50 range. They 
are a tossed salad of political types, hard-core feminists and free-spirited 
space cadets. They come to retire, to set up a business, to study art or 
Spanish, to write, to escape an abusive relationship, to heal from a painful 
divorce, to join a lover, to pursue a cowgirl dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many come to hang out and drift through the two-hour siestas and cheap 
margaritas at La Fragua bar -- that can be done anywhere. San Miguel is for 
finding out who you are or who you can be: an artist, a publisher, a designer, 
a masseuse, a spiritual teacher, a writer, a therapist, a champion horse rider. 
And unlike Manhattan or L.A. or Houston or Boston, there is a concentrated and 
easily accessible community of women of all ages and backgrounds. The town 
itself seems to be a medium for healing and growth. Maybe it's the air or the 
water or underground chakras or magnetic forces or simply the understood 
trade-off that one has made by coming here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Amazon Village," says sculptor Rita Torlen, 50. "Never have I met 
so many accomplished women. I love it. I never understood what sisterhood was 
until I moved to San Miguel."  
</P>
<P>
 "There is a force here," agrees Barcal, 47. "This place has a strong female 
component. Single women feel safe here. There's a sense of community and 
potential. I knew when I came it wasn't find-a-mate paradise, but that wasn't 
my purpose. My purpose was to be fuller, however that is." 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy Parrish, 28, sits in the courtyard of La Parroquia restaurant, eating 
little black bean sopes and sipping coffee. "If you're trying to make something 
work with someone else, possibly you're ignoring what's going on with 
yourself," she says. It's 11 a.m., and tiny brown sparrows hop around on the 
tiles at her feet, looking for crumbs. A large bougainvillea curves up along 
one wall and spills over onto the roof. She's been in town for three years, 
studying art, helping out in local film projects and looking for answers in 
weekly therapy sessions. "I came here knowing there wouldn't be anything 
serious or ongoing. It would be insular. You're forced into dealing with your 
self.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think people in this town are either running away from something or trying 
to find something or don't know what they want but didn't want what they had in 
the States," she adds. "Something about San Miguel makes you ask yourself what 
you're here for. Obviously not for a career, so why did I leave? You start 
asking a lot of questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Walking around the cobblestone streets of San Miguel, one has time for such 
questions. The hours are marked by the tolling of bells, the months defined by 
fiestas, the seasons by flowers, food and thunderstorms.  
</P>
<P>
 "In New York, you're brainwashed into living in the Big Apple," says Susan 
Porter-Smith, 47, a former scientific research editor for Reader's Digest 
(where she filed, and settled, a landmark sex discrimination suit). She is now 
the head of the San Miguel Audubon Society. "I came to San Miguel, the people I 
met were bright, all my needs were satisfied. I thought, 'What a fool I've 
been, spending so much time in New York.' My friends (in Manhattan) thought I 
wasn't utilizing my talents and wasn't going to get ahead in life." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I left New York and gave up my job at CBS," says Torlen, a former scenic 
artist who has been in San Miguel for six years, "my friends said I needed to 
see a psychiatrist because Mexico was so dangerous. And I was in New York! Give 
me a break. I don't hear gunshots at night, I hear firecrackers." 
</P>
<P>
 FROM EL MIRADOR, A LOOKOUT POINT HIGH ON THE FLANK OF MOCTEzuma Hill, San 
Miguel flows away gracefully, an Impressionist landscape of purple 
bougainvillea, jacaranda and faded pastel walls, anchored in the center by the 
spires of La Parroquia. Sounds drift up on the wind: crowing roosters, braying 
donkeys, clanging church bells, the piping of a wandering knife sharpener 
looking for customers, the asthmatic chug of buses.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not difficult to see why the gringas are drawn to this place, despite the 
knowledge that they will never truly be part of it. No matter their numbers, 
they will always be foreigners, will never totally blend into the local society 
if for no other reason than their presence itself breaks some of the culture's 
most basic expectations. In San Miguel, men are supposed to gain identity and 
self-esteem through work while women are supposed to marry, bear children and 
devote themselves to their families. The American women have chosen a third 
path, establishing their own culture that revolves around freedom of choice, 
independence and appreciation of nature.  
</P>
<P>
 Native San Miguelense are typically reticent about remarking on the behavior 
of the female foreigners, but the women's influence has been felt. "The women 
here have been working on themselves," says Sergio Orrozco, a San Miguel 
psychologist. "That has had a very positive impact on the community."  
</P>
<P>
 Croning ceremonies and ozone therapy may not translate easily into Spanish, 
but they're far easier to live with than the happy-hour-fueled headaches of 
past visitors. Machismo aside, Mexico has a pre-Columbian appreciation of 
goddess-based religion, and younger Latinas are starting to participate.  
</P>
<P>
 Less easily comprehensible to the locals is the gringas' willingness to 
sacrifice the joys of family. In San Miguel, a woman must have male protection 
to be a good woman. To choose otherwise is not fully understood, either by 
local Mexicans or friends back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my Mexican friends feel sorry for me," Torlen says, "but my 
friendships are all that more important. We make our own life here. Maybe it's 
a Disneyland world, I don't know, but I think it's great."  
</P>
<P>
 "A single woman after 23 is an old maid here," says Kris Rudolph, the 
29-year-old owner of El Buen Cafe, a small coffeehouse on a quiet street near 
the main square. "The Mexican women feel so sorry for me because no one will 
marry me. If they heard of a woman not wanting to get married, they wouldn't 
believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph works long hours during high seasons -- winter, Easter, August -- 
juggling the problems of any small business plus some she didn't expect when 
she came here 3 1/2 years ago: unreliable water and electricity, a nonstop 
search for supplies, bureaucratic red tape. Her friends back in Houston, she 
says, are moving up the corporate ladder and starting to have children, but 
when she goes home and sees the lifestyle, she doesn't regret her decision. 
"They work all day, come home, watch TV and go to bed. They do that every 
single day. I like the pace here. I'm always in awe of how pretty it is." 
</P>
<P>
 She's straddling a hammock on the roof of a house down the street from her 
cafe. As she talks, Miguel, the six-foot bell in La Parroquia tower, begins 
clanging out the hour. She pauses until it's quiet again and begins talking 
about the lack of eligible men in town. "I realize that if I stay in San 
Miguel, I'll never get married. You'll be alone the rest of your life and never 
have a family -- so what's more important? I'm used to having my two-hour 
lunches on the patio with the bougainvillea." 
</P>
<P>
 But a solitary life in a foreign country has its drawbacks, even in Colonial 
splendor -- especially if you're not earning many pesos. By Mexican standards, 
the poorest of these women would be considered middle-class. On a frugal 
$500-a-month budget, though, an extra $10 is a fortune, the weekly food 
allowance is $20, a phone is impossible, and shopping for clothes means pawing 
through the second-hand piles at the Tuesday market. The scariest times, 
however, are illness. "I got sick for five days last year before anyone knew it 
-- that's lonely," says Jane Evans, 47, a Canadian artist. She pauses and adds, 
"But I'm not as lonely as I was when I was married." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the bottom line. Here a solitary life doesn't mean loneliness and 
endless questions about when you're going to get married and have kids. The 
single status is considered normal throughout San Miguel's resident foreigners. 
Although the women are not necessarily delighted to be single, they accept the 
situation with some equanimity. There are no singles bars or marriage 
workshops; few of these women are looking for life partners among the small 
foreign male population, many of whom are there for the cheap beer, the 
accessible dope and the few interested women. Meaningful female friendship is 
not high on their agenda, although that situation is starting to change. "I 
belong to a men's group that was sustained for more than a year, and there are 
other groups of mixed sex in which men do participate," Orrozco says. "It's 
like a small version of what is happening with the women." This is not 
surprising; after big-screen football at Casa Mex's, a group is the best show 
in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since there aren't so many entertainment-type distractions here, the depth of 
friendship is what you do," says Tina Estes, 40, one of the few openly gay 
women in town. "It's what you rely on for entertainment, like the old days. We 
have meetings talking about the mysteries of the universe and the deepest parts 
of our personal lives, what we're doing creatively. I didn't have the energy to 
do that in the U.S., to feel those things, much less talk about them."  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, San Miguel is a small town in Mexico, and women living on their own 
must face a certain amount of suspicion, says Ana Roy, knowingly shaking her 
head. She should know. She's an Arizona expatriate who has lived in Mexico for 
36 years, the last seven in San Miguel. However, she adds, "San Miguel is a 
place where women can be alone. It's acceptable, it's conceivable. But we also 
have the assumption, very deep and basic, that every gringa is a puta ."  
</P>
<P>
 Even though hordes of more sophisticated chilangas , Mexico City residents, 
invade the town every weekend, strutting around in tight shorts like Charo 
wanna-bes, it is the gringas that are clucked about. "It stems from the 
differences in independence and sexual freedom and openness about (sexual) 
matters," Orrozco says. "In Mexico, a woman doesn't acknowledge that she likes 
sex. It's just a difference in culture." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small-town thing, where if you do something, within an hour the whole 
town knows," says Rudolph. "When I was with my Mexican friends and trying to 
fit into the culture, I was becoming who they thought I should be. After a few 
months of that, I started hanging out with Americans because it was too 
stressful. It's hard to have a relationship with a Mexican woman because they 
think all Americans are sluts." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a different dynamic with the men -- more distant, but less 
judgmental. Evans, who came four years ago on a grant, says she's a committed 
feminist, and she finds many of the gringo attitudes toward gender roles 
infuriating. But she forgives, even appreciates, the sexual vibe of the local 
men: "Mexican men take a no. They expect a no, but they feel obligated to try. 
Whether you're having sex or not, you have the option to say yes or no, which 
seems to have disappeared back home among my friends who are single."  
</P>
<P>
 IN THE FRENCH-STYLE JARDIN THAT IS THE MAIN PLAZA OF SAN MIGUEL, REtirees, men 
and women, sit on benches checking the stock market and the sports pages of the 
Mexico City News, the only English-language daily in Mexico. They chat with 
friends, letting the morning slip away until it's time for lunch and siesta and 
drinks. Locals call them Los Momios, the mummies. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Momios represent another strata of San Miguel expatriates. They are 
generally older, the few men awkwardly trying to adjust to life after the 
office and business and expense accounts and power. Their wives sit nearby, 
happily making appointments for bridge and cocktails and considering perhaps an 
art class at the Instituto. And they see young women like Rudolph and Parrish 
and ask them what they're doing here. Why are they wasting their youth here in 
this tiny town in Mexico? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this notion (in the U.S.) that we're all on this racecourse, and if 
you step out for a year or five, you'll be 20 laps behind," says Barcal, 
formerly a mental-health teacher-trainer for Los Angeles County and now the 
publisher of a bilingual guide to San Miguel. "But what you do with that time 
could make you 20 laps ahead in life experience. It's not like you're going 
into an absence of experience. You're just having a different one." 
</P>
<P>
 When Barcal first arrived six years ago, she knew only one word of Spanish: 
cerveza (beer) . Now fluent, she and three other women have just bought into a 
two-acre parcel of land 20 minutes from San Miguel, where they plan to build 
houses. The land is typical of the countryside: gently sloping arroyos and 
plateaus of mesquite, chollo, sandstone and granite, punctuated here and there 
by hot springs. Her neighbor on this parcel is Cilla Zweig, a buyer of Mexican 
folk art for Melrose Avenue's Soap Plant.

 Like Barcal, Rudolph and a handful of others, Zweig has carved out an economic 
niche for herself through the manufacture of folk crafts for export, giving 
steady work to tinsmiths, iron workers and ceramists.  
</P>
<P>
 Along with the lack of available men, limited work opportunities form the 
biggest obstacle for the gringas. Compared with other Mexican towns, San Miguel 
is not cheap, and therapy, massage, hot springs and maid service don't come 
free. It took Zweig four years to develop her line of products, which now sell 
coast to coast in many different stores. Her success, she claims, is partially 
due to a change in perspective, from material acquisition to spiritual 
exploration. Ironically, she says, the less time she spent trying to make 
things happen economically, the better her situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be this self-willed person thinking it was me doing it all," she 
says. "I started asking myself -- what do I really want? I started looking 
deeper within and discovering something big, and it's changed my life 
dramatically. In L.A., it was all gossip, work and fashion and what's the 
latest thing," she says. "I forgot about something bigger than myself. I don't 
search madly for external things to bring me happiness because I know it 
doesn't last."  
</P>
<P>
 Spirituality is at the core of the American women's culture here. Not 
necessarily the spirituality of organized religion but a looser definition: 
getting in touch with an inner self in whatever medium works, be it therapy or 
yoga or goddess rituals. The latter are particularly popular in San Miguel, 
says Ana Roy, because they symbolize "a recognition of the planet as a living 
single thing, and we're all parts of it. It means the sacred nature of the 
whole reality: the cat, the rock, the cactus. It's all alive, all part of the 
same system and all sacred."  
</P>
<P>
 Near Zweig's half-acre of land is Escondido hot springs, a series of outdoor 
pools, some covered, where Roy and her friends hold croning ceremonies for 
women turning 50. During the full moon, they gather around a mesquite fire and 
troop into the covered grottoes, discarding their bathing suits as they enter 
the hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time the women held a ceremony at Escondido was two years ago, after 
an intensive goddess workshop. "At the last pool in the grotto, there's a 
narrow entrance way," Roy says, "and seeing one form, one body, one goddess 
emerge into the candlelight and down the stairs and into the water -- it was a 
remarkable experience. Everybody was totally naked, and this was heavy stuff, 
especially if you're older and fat. Crone comes from chronos , time. It means a 
woman who has grown wise with the passage of time. It's a hard subject for 
women, especially someone who has invested all her energy, her whole life into 
looking right."  
</P>
<P>
 If it sounds like life in San Miguel is a bit too New Age, a bit too odd, 
sometimes it feels that way too. April Wolfe, 46, one of the town's two 
therapists, moved to San Miguel three years ago with her lover, Tina Estes. A 
year and a half later, she woke up one day overcome with the realization that 
she had sold her house in Portland, given up her title at the school where she 
taught and cashed in her retirement. Suddenly she panicked. She called Gail 
Keene, the leader of San Miguel's Friends of Unity Church, and after a 
wide-ranging conversation, she calmed down. "(Biblical) Abraham went through 
that too," Keene told her.  
</P>
<P>
 "My appointment book was jampacked in the States," she says. "Then it all 
quit. Tina said to me, 'You're forgetting the magic here. Trust.' Now I don't 
even have a calendar."  
</P>
<P>
 "You're out there swimming toward you don't know what," Estes says. "But 
you're definitely leaving one shore, so you'd better keep swimming through the 
uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
 Life is full of uncertainty. Perhaps that's what makes San Miguel so 
attractive to the gringas. Here the uncertainties are when the rainy season 
will start, when will the water supply be turned back on, who will have corn 
mushrooms in the Tuesday market. For most, the biggest unknown, the one that is 
hardest to confront, is how long to stay in San Miguel. For the younger women, 
there's the possibility of starting a family; the older ones worry about 
getting sick. But for no one, it seems, is there a fear of being alone. The 
community is the family, the town is the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Life is full of trade-offs, and you always come back to the question, what 
makes you fulfilled? Is it your new PowerBook or the sound of the bell tolling 
from La Parroquia?

VOICES / COMMENTARY ON LOCAL ISSUES, VIEWPOINTS OF RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITY 
LEADERS, AND LETTERS.: HOMEGIRLS; WITH THEIR GANG TIES STILL STRONG, 'N-OWL' 
AND 'SMOKEY' TALK ABOUT THEIR SMALL ROLES IN THE FILM 'MI VIDA LOCA,' REFLECT 
ON THEIR 'CRAZY LIVES' AND PONDER THE FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Allison Anders' movie "Mi Vida Loca," Echo Park homegirls Mona and Maribel, 
known as "Sad Girl" and "Mousie ," break off their friendship when both get 
pregnant by the same gang member. But real-life Echo Park homegirls Marlena and 
Monica, who have small parts in the movie, say they would never get pregnant by 
the same man and would certainly not fight over him. Marlena and Monica, who 
are known as "N-owl" and "Smokey," were active gang members in Echo Park when 
"Mi Vida Loca" was filmed two years ago. Today, Marlena, 21, is working at a 
day-care center and Monica, 20, is working on a mural, both sponsored by El 
Centro del Pueblo, an Echo Park-based social service agency. Although they 
still consider themselves homegirls, they are struggling to find lives separate 
from their gangs. They were interviewed by Leila Cobo-Hanlon.  
</P>
<P>
 Monica: When Allison came around, at first we thought she was a cop because 
she would come around with a tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlena: We didn't trust Allison at the time. We were busy doing our own 
thing. When she came with the script we would say, "Hey, we wouldn't say that, 
and why don't you change that?" We weren't helping her, we were criticizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica: She didn't change her story though. Her mind was made up. The movie is 
just a love story; it's not based on the way we really are. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlena: But, you know, everyone's upset and it's just a movie. I don't know 
why everyone's all, you know, bent out of shape about it. Everyone's putting 
the movie down. Why don't they give it a chance? Really look at it. I liked the 
movie. I like Allison. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica: I give her a lot of credit 'cause she did a lot for us. She was there 
when we really needed something. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlena: To tell the truth, I don't care what anybody says about the movie. 
That kind of thing, asking other gangs their opinion about the movie, like 
asking the 18th Street gang, of course they're gonna say they don't like the 
movie. That's their problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Monica: That 18th Street gang jumps in (initiates) anyone. When Marlena and I 
met, I was already jumped in. I was only 13 years old when I was jumped in by 
the girls in Echo Park. I grew up here all my life. We all knew each other. 
Everyone got jumped in, started gangbanging. I started getting into it because 
I grew up around gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlena: I would get up, get all creased down (dressed sharp), just to even 
sit in my neighborhood. Feathers and everything. Walk up and down my 
neighborhood. It was just firme (bad, cool) back then, walk around with nothing 
on our shoulders. It was my barrio, and no one would dare go by my barrio. 
There was no conflict over the guys and the girls (as in the movie); everyone 
was happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica: We were one big happy family. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlena: We were. But when them drive-bys started happening we had to watch 
our backs.  
</P>
<P>
 Monica: There's supposedly no drive-bys anymore. All gangs supposedly have a 
peace treaty with everyone. Now you see a lot of the blacks, they stick 
together, but the Mexicans would always be fighting and killing each other. We 
should all stick together, like the blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlena: But now, we're just kicking back, thinking about our future. Things 
are changing. We're getting older. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica: Back then there was nothing better to do 'cause I was always ditching 
school, messing around. I didn't finish school, but I want to try and get my 
GED (general equivalency degree). 
</P>
<P>
 Marlena: I want to go get my GED or get a high school diploma, but I want a 
job. I started working at the day-care center two weeks ago. I like it. After 
the summer I'll go back to school, take up typing, and after that I'll start 
looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica: Before the movie I used to do office work at City Hall. Now I'm 
working on a mural with El Centro. It's hard to break away from gangbanging 
'cause you live right there in the neighborhood. I have friends outside the 
neighborhood, but mainly they're from here, and it's hard to let go. If I had 
the money, I'd move away real quick, somewhere else where nobody knows me. I 
love my neighborhood, I love my homeboys and I love my homegirls. But for me, 
it's too hard to stop gangbanging. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marlena: I regret what I did a lot. My dad died when I was about 9. I just 
live with my mom. And now I'm realizing that I shouldn't have been out there on 
the streets partying and giving her a hard time. The truth is, if I had money 
right now, I'd give it to my mom to pay the bills. When kids ask us for advice 
we tell them to go back to school. I mean, the education's there, take it. It's 
the only thing that's free. Jump on it. I would if I had a chance to turn back 
and do everything again. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica: I just wish I was 13 again so I could go back to school, and who 
knows? I know for a fact that I wouldn't be the way I am. And sometimes, when I 
go to job interviews, I know they don't hire me because of the way I look, 
because of my tattoos. I have tattoos, and I can't take them off. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlena: I'm working with the kids, I gotta think about the way I look. One of 
the kids asked me, "What's that on your hand?" (pointing to her tattoo). I said 
it was (from) a marker. I didn't say "That's a tattoo, go get one."  
</P>
<P>
 Monica: I don't want my little cousins to grow up to be the way I was. I want 
them to have a better life. If someone comes to our neighborhood, we'll still 
kick them out, nothing's gonna change. But I'm not gonna go out looking for 
trouble anymore.

VOICES / COMMENTARY ON LOCAL ISSUES, VIEWPOINTS OF RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITY 
LEADERS, AND LETTERS.: A QUESTION OF CHARACTER; EVERYWHERE HE LOOKED IN 
SOUTH-CENTRAL, JERVEY TERVALON SAW COMPELLING STORIES. FINALLY HE HAD TO START 
WRITING THEM DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jervey Tervalon, 35, grew up on 2nd Avenue, attended Dorsey High School, 
graduated from UC Santa Barbara and earned a degree from the UC Irvine writers 
program. His first novel, "Understand This," was published this year. It tells 
the story of a murdered teen-ager through the voices of the boy's friends, 
relatives and acquaintances. Tervalon drew on his experiences growing up in 
Central Los Angeles and as a teacher in South-Central. He lives with his wife 
and baby daughter in Pasadena.  
</P>
<P>
 I grew up on 2nd Avenue between Exposition Boulevard and Jefferson Street in 
Southwest Los Angeles. The African American neighborhood I was raised in was a 
microcosm of the world. All of humankind was represented there; from those who 
commit the stupidest crimes to those who were more law-abiding than an honest 
police chief; from neighbors who worked from sunup to sundown and then some, to 
those who preferred another path, a more direct way of finding that almighty 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a small boy I knew that there were stories on my block, hanging ripe 
and so heavy that if you wanted one all you had to do was reach. And, as Ice 
Cube says, "You better tell somebody," and I did. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, when I attended Foshay Junior High, I'd sit on the bench with the 
rest of the guys who hated dressing for gym and I'd tell them what I had been 
reading as though I made it up myself. I dramatically told the entire novel 
"Dracula" to those guys and kept them pretty entertained as our physical 
education grades slipped ever lower. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I realized then I needed to write because it was hard to find such a captive 
audience and mentally taxing to try to remember all the events of a Victorian 
novel and jazz them up for the junior high set. I wrote a poem for my 
eighth-grade English teacher and used her name as the refrain, and she really 
liked hearing her name over and over again and gave me a good grade. From there 
I sold a silly love poem to Scholastic magazine and made $15 and I was sold. It 
was the writing life for me.  
</P>
<P>
 I continued winning writing contests at Jefferson branch library and made a 
few more dollars. As a freshman at Dorsey High I took a creative writing 
course, and though I had horrible grammar, even worse spelling and penmanship, 
I earned an A in the class. I hoped I would be able to write science fiction 
novels to earn a living, but I realized that while I liked reading about 
spaceships and monsters, I just couldn't write about them. 
</P>
<P>
 I discovered I could write about my neighborhood. I could write about being a 
black teen-ager. I was interested in my life and the lives of my friends. I 
didn't see them on television, at the movies or much in books. 
</P>
<P>
 Where I saw the complexity of black life represented was in the music. Two 
songs by War were very descriptive of my neighborhood in the early '70s: "Why 
Can't We Be Friends?" and "Slipping Into Darkness." Stevie Wonder, too, made a 
great impression on me with his albums "Talking Book" and "Inner Visions." And 
like a lot of the young folk coming up in the '70s, I was divided between the 
spirituality of Earth, Wind and Fire and the funk of the Funkadelic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This diversity in black music helped me see more clearly the complexity of the 
black life going on around me. I felt I didn't need to explain black life or 
black people to anyone. What I needed to do was write truthfully about my life. 
I wanted to bring to the page the wide range of people I knew in South-Central 
Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 My best friend in high school decided he wanted to read the Encyclopedia of 
Philosophy from A to Z, all six volumes. It was such a task that between 
chasing girls, playing chess for money and boning up on philosophical terms he 
didn't have time to attend class and eventually left school. 
</P>
<P>
 I had another friend who in the ninth grade decided he wanted to be a 
filmmaker right then and there and he did it. He had a film career all through 
high school. He made at least a dozen soundless shorts; kung fu movies, vampire 
movies, mad scientist movies. I was cast as an evil genius who would direct 
maggots to do my dirty work, and of course the maggots devoured me. I had to 
lie motionless while Chester engaged in primitive animation, slowly moving 10 
pounds of rice upstairs and eventually covering me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I remember my older brothers' eccentric friends who called themselves the 
Fellas. They'd sit for hours on the corner telling elaborate stories that to my 
ear sounded like an elevated kind of gossip/history. They could talk the paint 
off walls, and if they didn't chase me away for being too young, all I had to 
do was listen to develop an ear for dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew that if I could avoid the pitfalls of sociology and just go ahead and 
set the landscape and let the characters come forward to inhabit it, something 
good would be written. 
</P>
<P>
 My first novel, "Understand This," was based on my experiences teaching in 
South-Central. It's selling well and I've gotten great reviews, but I'm not too 
surprised. I'm just following the same rules I set for myself all along; show 
the life and let the characters speak. Everything else will take care of 
itself.

 Team California, a traveling basketball squad laden with L.A. talent, won the 
22nd annual Boston Shootout played at Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, which included UCLA's Toby Bailey, Kris Johnson, omm'A Givens, and 
USC's Cameron Murray and Cal's Tremaine Fowlkes, was the first California team 
ever to win the tournament, held July 15-27. Teams from Atlanta, Boston, 
Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans, New York and Virginia also participated. The 
California team is coached by Donovan Blythe, a Nike-sponsored AAU coach from 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, Johnson and Murray all made the All-Tournament team. An interesting 
footnote: Every member from Team California will attend a Pac-10 school in the 
fall.

 USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett and Roman Catholic Cardinal Roger M. Mahony 
broke ground for a new gymnasium and athletic field at Verbum Dei High on July 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 The J.F Shea Co., a Southern California-based construction firm, made the 
renovation possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome R. Porath, archdiocese superintendent, said, "Thanks to the Shea gift, 
current and future generations of youth residing in South-Central will continue 
to have the advantage of a quality Catholic school education, including 
developing the foundation necessary for success throughout their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The final phase of building plans calls for construction of a new 
state-of-the-art basketball gym along with an up-to-date football and soccer 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1962, Verbum Dei has never had a home field or home court advantage 
because it lacked facilities that would meet the standards set by the 
California Interscholastic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Other participants in the ceremonies included Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy 
Svorinich Jr., John Shea, president of the J.F. Shea Co., and Verbum Dei 
Principal Deacon Marvin Threatt.

 "I am a classic battered and abused wife," Roseanne said when she filed for 
divorce in April. The TV star accused her husband, Tom Arnold, of physical and 
emotional abuse, claiming he "hit me, struck me, threw objects at me, pushed me 
against walls." The sensational charges made headlines everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But three days later, Roseanne changed her tune. She dropped divorce 
proceedings and withdrew her abuse charges, saying: "I must apologize for 
letting nasty gossip and lies break me down. I just lost it." 
</P>
<P>
 When the TV star filed for divorce again three weeks later, her fans, not to 
mention people concerned with the issue of domestic violence, were left 
confused and outraged. Was she really a battered wife? Was she emotionally 
unstable? Or were the charges just a publicity stunt to help her TV show's 
ratings? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the awful truth: In Hollywood, the truth doesn't count for very much. 
It has become a casualty of the increasingly fractious skirmishes between the 
media and Hollywood celebrities and studio brass, overwhelmed by an onslaught 
of image- making, spin control and tabloid-driven gossip-mongering. 
</P>
<P>
 In show business, where the game is truth or dare, veracity has many delicate 
shadings -- the half-truth, the white lie, the damage-control denial and the 
publicity-stunt whopper. This is the town where the truth comes in more 
varieties than the cappuccino at Starbucks. 
</P>
<P>
 One day it's a studio marketing chief inflating his new film's opening-weekend 
box-office numbers. Another day it's a publicist's claim that all's well with 
actress Drew Barrymore's marriage -- a claim that came mere hours before the 
19-year-old starlet filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 It might even be a bogus cover story, like the one Nirvana's management firm 
put out that described group leader Kurt Cobain's champagne-and-pills collapse 
in Rome in March as an accidental overdose -- when in fact it was a suicide 
attempt, the latest flare-up in a tragic downward spiral of drugs and 
depression that led to his shotgun suicide the following month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The media's skepticism has now become part of the story. When Washington Post 
columnist Lois Romano printed a Roseanne "apology" statement in April, Romano 
began the item: "Not that we believe anything she says at this point. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 A Newsweek story last August about hypocrisy in Hollywood quoted a telling 
conversation between two industry executives, overheard at breakfast at the 
high-tone Four Seasons Hotel. "Damn it, you're lying to me!" said one exec. "I 
know, you're right," said the other. "But hear me out." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if you're looking for the high-road approach, you can't depend on 
the celebrity-obsessed, tabloid-driven entertainment press either. Publicist 
Michael Levine, who represents Michael Jackson and other celebrities, said the 
media have sunk so low they now offer "a proctologist's view of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Other celebrity-handlers say it's no longer unusual to see mainstream 
publications pursuing unsubstantiated, anonymous-source-fueled speculation 
about what executive jobs are in jeopardy, what movie will be the big summer 
flop and who Julia Roberts might be dancing with while hubby Lyle Lovett is out 
of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Journalists are much more cynical, much more prying and much more desirous of 
causing a sensation than actually getting a good story," said Pat Kingsley, 
whose PMK public relations firm represents a host of top stars and film 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me ask you: Why was the New York Times the first mainstream publication 
to print the name of the alleged William Kennedy Smith rape victim? Why would 
the Los Angeles Times put Roseanne Arnold's divorce action on the front page of 
the paper? It's all about the press becoming more tabloid-driven." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 With the explosion of media interest in celebrity profiles and entertainment 
insider stories, relations between Hollywood and the press have become charged 
with hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environment is as toxic as it can get," said Columbia Pictures publicity 
chief Mark Gill. "Every time a new reporter comes to the Hollywood beat, they 
get immediately overwhelmed by the cacophony of lies. One of the consequences 
of the lack of truth-telling is the enormous level of hostility between 
Hollywood and the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much distrust now that it's dehumanizing. It makes it easy for 
many reporters to write something extraordinarily nasty about someone, to a 
large degree because they don't think of them as real people anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 To hear entertainment reporters and gossip columnists tell it, the climate of 
cynicism and distrust has cast a dark cloud on the way they cover virtually 
every aspect of the Hollywood scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the 40 people I speak to every day," said Anita Busch, a respected 
entertainment writer formerly at the Hollywood Reporter and now at Daily 
Variety, "39 of them are lying to me, and the other one is my mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a top executive swear to me on the head of his daughter that he was 
telling the truth. And knowing what I know about Hollywood, my first reaction 
was 'Hey, maybe he doesn't even have a daughter.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Garrison Keillor recently gave an address to the Radio and TV 
Correspondents Assn., he said that when he was 16, his parents were uncannily 
similar to the media of today: 
</P>
<P>
 "They felt they were entitled to know a great deal more about my life than 
they knew. They were watching me at all times, and whenever they saw anything 
unusual, they always read something dark into it. They were journalists -- you 
couldn't talk to them because they kept dragging down the conversation to new 
depths of suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
 The media have always covered celebrities. From 1930s fan magazines to 
"Entertainment Tonight," the public has had an insatiable curiosity about the 
lifestyles of the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
 What's different today is that show-biz reporters have adopted the aggressive 
Woodward-and-Bernstein-style mind-set, which evolved out of the '70s-era boom 
in investigative journalism, even when the particular topic -- the tawdry 
relationships of Ted Danson or Burt Reynolds, to cite two recent examples -- 
hardly seems to have the same heft as Richard M. Nixon's bungled attempts to 
subvert the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm as staunch a supporter of freedom of speech as anyone, but it's 
ridiculous to lump celebrities in with politicians when you deal with the 
public's right to know," said Danny Goldberg, president of the ACLU Foundation 
of Southern California and before that president of Atlantic Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "If entertainment reporters think they're going to become Woodward and 
Bernstein because they find out the goods on Roseanne and Tom's personal life, 
they're crazy. Morally, it's just on a totally different page." 
</P>
<P>
 Often the problem is as much a matter of style as ethics. Mary Matalin, the 
celebrated political consultant who handled George Bush's failed 1992 
reelection campaign, says an "adversarial wall" has gone up between reporters 
and campaign operatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't lie when I talk to the press," she said recently while talking to -- 
surprise -- the press about her upcoming book, penned with James Carville, her 
husband and '92-campaign foe. "But if you come in with an attitude and try to 
beat me up with every question, I'm going to spin you -- I'm gonna give you as 
little as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Kingsley contends that the media have more than just an attitude problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The press lies over all sorts of things," she said. "It can be when they're 
going to run a story or whether they've pulled a story that they've promised 
they were going to run at a specific time. I can't tell you how many times a 
magazine has taken one of my clients off their cover after we'd had an 
agreement that the piece would be a cover story." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the press is willing to make such deals is a useful reminder 
that much of Hollywood reportage isn't only journalism -- it's marketing. For 
magazines such as Vanity Fair, a celebrity cover is a valuable trade-off: The 
star gets to promote his or her movie, the magazine uses the star to attract 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
 As Tom Selleck explained to a reporter at a recent Washington press banquet, 
"My business and your business, they should be mutually beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
 In his new book, "The Kid Stays in the Picture," Hollywood producer Robert 
Evans boastfully recounts how he conned a reluctant Sharon Stone into playing 
the lead in "Sliver," 1993's much-hyped erotic thriller. Desperate for Stone to 
lend her sexual swagger to the part, Evans set about stoking the actress's 
competitive instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 First he told her manager that Demi Moore was desperate for the role. It was a 
total lie, Evans cheerfully admitted. When Stone turned him down, he concocted 
an even bigger lie. He sent her a copy of Vanity Fair with Geena Davis on the 
cover, saying Davis (labeled by the magazine as "Hollywood's new femme fatale 
") would be in makeup on the set the following Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly -- if you actually believe Evans' story -- the ploy worked. Stone 
caved in and took the part. As it turns out, Davis had turned down "Basic 
Instinct," the movie that made Stone a star. So, as Evans put it: "Sharon 
didn't want the part, but she sure in hell didn't want Geena to have it." 
Stone, through her publicist at PMK, said she had no comment on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 In a business defined by hype and self-promotion, where you are judged as much 
by image and relationships as by actual achievements, the temptation to lie is 
enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody lies in Hollywood for a simple reason: It works," said John 
Richardson, a senior writer at Premiere magazine and author of the serialized 
Hollywood novel "Blue Screen." "Every day, the trades are full of stories about 
guys touting projects that'll never be made. But a lot of people who read those 
stories think, 'Gee, that guy must be a player.' " 
</P>
<P>
 During the Heidi Fleiss media frenzy last year, Richardson did a lengthy piece 
in Premiere asserting that the alleged Hollywood madam was largely a creation 
of her own hype. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never had 10% of the clients she claimed -- she made up all sorts of 
ludicrous claims," he asserted. "But it made her a star -- it gave her a buzz. 
That's the lesson she learned from Hollywood. An effective lie has far more 
impact than a carefully modulated truth. She created the image that, in her 
world, she was a player." 
</P>
<P>
 This strategy also applies to the art of creating an image for your movie. As 
Hollywood coverage increasingly focused on the spiraling cost of movie budgets, 
the rule of thumb became: Inflate your box-office gross, downplay your 
production costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the basis of everything here is money, not art or creativity, almost 
all of the lying in Hollywood deals with movie budgets," says Bernard Weinraub, 
who covers Hollywood for the New York Times. "Producers, agents, studio 
executives -- everybody constantly underestimates the cost of a film. Does 
anybody really know how much 'True Lies' cost?" 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmakers expend enormous energy persuading journalists to report a low-ball 
budget estimate, knowing the lower the number, the less likely their film will 
be portrayed -- as "Last Action Hero" was last summer -- as a symbol of bloated 
Hollywood excess. Weinraub points to a movie legend whose upcoming film was 
recently described by two prominent show-biz columnists as having a modest 
$22-million budget, excluding above-the-line costs (such as actor and director 
salaries). 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, when you add in the actors' fees on this film, it really becomes a 
$35-million movie," Weinraub notes. "But by skillful manipulation, the figure 
that has surfaced is $22 million, which will be quoted by all sorts of 
reporters, without any reference to the added above-the-line costs; $22 million 
becomes the perception, and if enough reporters repeat that perception, then it 
becomes the reality." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Control the perception -- and you control the information. Celebrities 
routinely deny revelations about their personal life -- that is, until they can 
offer the scoop to a friendly columnist or give it the appropriate positive 
spin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paula Abdul and Emilio Estevez denied breaking up -- and then filed for 
divorce the next day," recalled Linda Stasi, who writes the New York Daily 
News' Hot Copy column. "Julia Roberts and Lyle Lovett denied being involved -- 
and then got married a few days later. It happens all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Once burned, twice shy. Montreal Gazette columnist Doug Camilli gave big play 
to the tabloid tales of Roberts' "dancing-smooching outing" with actor Ethan 
Hawke earlier this year. After running Roberts publicist Nancy Seltzer's 
explanations, the columnist impishly added: "Seltzer is the same hired hand who 
told reporters 10 months ago there was nothing going on between Roberts and 
Lovett -- and three days later they got married." 
</P>
<P>
 Seltzer said the only wedding-report denial she made was to Time magazine. 
"And at the time I talked to Time, I didn't know about the wedding myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrity publicist Kingsley admitted having lied to the press in her "younger 
years" but said it was done out of inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned that it doesn't do any good to lie, because you always get 
caught," she said. "If one of my clients doesn't want to answer a press 
inquiry, then I'll just say, 'We're not going to comment.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A "no comment" is better than a lie, but a "no comment" rarely prompts a 
reporter to back off from a story. When a powerhouse Hollywood deal is in the 
works, industry moguls often issue denials to steer a reporter away from a 
story until the studio can orchestrate its own announcement of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this lack of candor derives from the high-pressure atmosphere that 
pervades Hollywood executive suites. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ground is so unstable that it creates an absolute fidelity to the 
moment," says Newsweek reporter Charles Fleming. "If it's smart to tell a lie 
right now, you just do it. A week later, when you have to deal with the 
consequences, you apologize, you threaten or you lie again -- but you worry 
about it a week later." 
</P>
<P>
 Hype and untruth have also become part of the Hollywood marketing machinery. 
Associated Press entertainment reporter John Horn pointed to the widely covered 
announcement last year that the steamy Madonna thriller "Body of Evidence" 
would be released with an NC-17 rating. The story gave the film an instant aura 
of controversy. But Horn contended that the film's producers never had any 
intention of releasing the movie with an NC-17 rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a naked publicity stunt," Horn said. "When the producer got on the 
phone with me, I offered to buy him lunch in any restaurant in town if they put 
out the film as NC-17 because I knew they'd never do it. It would've been a 
totally implausible business decision. But to say they were going to do it 
created a great news story." 
</P>
<P>
 Other media observers focus on the practice of airing stories filled with 
charges leveled by unidentified sources, which by nature of their very 
anonymity can't be verified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reporters will often tell me they hear a film is in trouble, but when I ask 
who's told them that, they say, 'Oh, I can't reveal my sources,' " said Harry 
Clein, whose public relations firm handles director Tim Burton and producer Ed 
Pressman. "But too often, these unidentified sources only know half the truth. 
And if they don't have an ax to grind, why won't they put their names on their 
quotes?" 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the media can't -- or don't -- always do an adequate job 
of assessing the veracity of every resume-padded movieland reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I'm doing a story about a con man who did an incredible amount of 
business in Hollywood," said John Richardson. "This is a guy who, in the real 
world, got arrested time and again on felony and fraud charges. But when he 
went to Hollywood, he managed to have a 15-year career without ever getting in 
trouble. He went right under everyone's radar. It's just the nature of the 
business -- everything's a con." 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Quayle was making the rounds recently, helping her husband, Dan, 
promote his new book, when she sounded off on the media's lack of credibility. 
Her complaint: "I can't pick up a newspaper or watch the evening news and 
believe anything I see or read." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, almost anything. Mrs. Quayle made the charge while sitting in the green 
room at "Larry King Live," just minutes before her husband plugged his book 
during a friendly chat with the popular talk-show host. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes one wonder: Is the truth a more precious commodity in Hollywood than 
say, in Washington, home of one President who insisted, "I am not a crook," and 
another who claimed, "I didn't inhale"? 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who covers both Oscar candidates and White House aspirants, the 
Post's Lois Romano will opt for chronicling politicians every time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a remarkable difference between Washington and Hollywood," said 
Romano, who writes the paper's spicy Reliable Source column. "If you ask a 
politician a direct question, by the end of the day, 99% of them will tell you 
the truth or say 'no comment.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But a lot of celebrity publicists have absolutely no compunction about 
misleading you. They'll tell you anything to get you off a story -- that 
there's no truth to it, that they don't know anything about it or that you're 
acting like the National Enquirer." 
</P>
<P>
 Romano believes that lying is less prevalent in Washington because politicians 
have more reason to fear the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the celebrities, if the publicist lies, you blame the messenger -- it 
doesn't rub off on the client," she said. "But in Washington, a press secretary 
is considered an extension of the politician, so if he lies, then by extension 
the politician has lied as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Having spent 12 years covering political campaigns and the White House for the 
New York Times before taking the Hollywood beat, Weinraub sees equally striking 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Washington, lying is more subtle and perhaps more devious. Here, because 
there are no checks and balances, it's done quite flagrantly. It's out in the 
open. People have no problem telling you a movie only cost $40 million when in 
point of fact, it cost $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know they're B.S.-ing you and you know they know they're B.S.-ing you, 
but because it's not public information, they know it's almost impossible for 
you to really find out." 
</P>
<P>
 Having covered other industries before becoming a Hollywood reporter, Anita 
Busch is convinced that the entertainment business, by its very nature, lends 
itself to truth abuse: "The problem is that in Hollywood, perception is 
reality. So everyone is trying to manipulate the press, because whoever 
controls the flow of information controls the flow of power." 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever you discuss celebrity candor, the debate eventually turns to the 
issue of privacy. Is it fair game to write about a celebrity who has AIDS? Who 
tried to kill himself? Who is married and having an affair? Who is dying? 
</P>
<P>
 Most journalists say they have the right to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you become a celebrity, you give up your privacy," Busch said. "That's 
part of the trade-off." 
</P>
<P>
 But each privacy question usually results in a judgment call. Several 
Hollywood celebrities -- most notably Rock Hudson, Freddie Mercury of the rock 
group Queen and "Brady Bunch" dad Robert Reed -- went to their deaths, or at 
least to their deathbeds, without acknowledging they were dying of AIDS. In one 
celebrated instance, when Liberace was hospitalized in January, 1987, his 
manager said the performer had anemia caused by a watermelon diet. His 
manager's statement: "We are categorically denying that Liberace has AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later the flamboyant showman was dead -- of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 People magazine Insider columnist Mitchell Fink said that weeks before Jackie 
Kennedy Onassis announced she had cancer, he received a tip saying she was ill. 
"I had a moral decision to make," he recalled. "Do I pester Jackie O? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tempted, but my wife said, 'Leave it alone.' And I decided, if 
someone's sick, let them be sick in private." 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily News' Linda Stasi said she sat on her scoop that TV star Jerry 
Seinfeld was dating a 17-year-old high schooler. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then I took my daughter to a Knicks game where we saw the two of them 
together at courtside. My daughter looked at the girl through our binoculars 
and she said, 'Mom, I know her. I play basketball against her in high school!' 
</P>
<P>
 "Once he took her to a Knicks game, all bets were off. When I called his 
people for confirmation, they denied everything. But once the story came out, 
nobody denied a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Fink said he has never written about a celebrity having AIDS or going to a 
rehab clinic. Yet he's critical of Kurt Cobain's management for putting out a 
fake accidental-overdose story a month before the rock star killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd gotten a tip that he'd actually tried to commit suicide, I would've 
written about it," he said. "It's fair game. His people were making an economic 
decision to protect their client, not a moral decision. Maybe if the whole 
world had known what really happened in Rome, it's possible his behavior might 
have changed. Maybe he'd be alive today. Who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg, who was Cobain's manager before he joined Atlantic Records, heatedly 
took issue with this attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think the media have a God complex," he said. "I actually read 
some rock writer comparing the handling of Kurt's drug problem to Nixon's 
Watergate. We're dealing with private torment here, not public issues. If all 
the people close to him couldn't stop him from doing drugs, when everyone was 
confronting him in every way possible, do you really think some story in a 
newspaper could've changed anything? 
</P>
<P>
 "What it comes down to for me is that sometimes the media simply want a better 
backstage pass to the tragedy."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: ADMAN'S NIRVANA; BUS MOVIE 
STRIKES 'BUDDHA' CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took a while, but advertisements for "Little Buddha" are finally up to 
"Speed." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bernardo Bertolucci's film about an American boy who is believed to be 
the reincarnation of an important Buddhist lama opened in May, distributor 
Miramax Films created an ad campaign that tried to capture the mystical nature 
of the fable. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the creator of 'The Last Emperor,' " read the opening-day print ad, 
"comes a magical journey to a place where the past and the present meet." 
Pictured beneath was a blond boy surrounded by robed Buddhist youths. The boy's 
face, bathed in light, looked back toward the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 But in case you didn't notice, the movie starred Keanu Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference a few weeks have made. 
</P>
<P>
 Since "Little Buddha" debuted, Reeves has become one of Hollywood's hottest 
stars with his role as an LAPD cop trying to defuse a bomb on board a bus in 
"Speed." The 20th Century Fox movie has grossed more than $100 million and 
Reeves has attracted a large female audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Miramax is belatedly trying to cash in on Reeves' star status in its 
latest round of ads for "Little Buddha." 
</P>
<P>
 The new ads show a virile Reeves, shirtless from the waist up, his hair 
braided and cascading down his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keanu Reeves, the summer's most explosive star in the season's most dazzling 
spectacle!" gush the latest newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas the old ads stressed the spectacle of the movie itself -- "A richly 
entertaining, visually stunning masterpiece," read one review quoted in the 
opening day ad -- the new ones use portions of reviews that focus on Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keanu Reeves' carefully nuanced turn, alongside his performance in 'Speed,' 
shows he is here to stay!" the ads quote the New York Post. "Bertolucci's 
choice of Keanu Reeves pays off!" says Time magazine in another. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramax officials said they are not trying to mislead the public into 
believing that "Little Buddha," a thoughtful period piece, is either somehow 
like "Speed" or filled with sexy scenes of Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to sex up the ad," said David Dinerstein, vice president of 
marketing. "We're trying to utilize Keanu. We feel this film has a lot of 
different elements to it and Keanu is one of the more important roles." 
</P>
<P>
 Dinerstein conceded that Reeves' success in "Speed" prompted Miramax to alter 
its print advertising, but he explained that the company often changes ad 
campaigns in midstream to keep alive interest in its films. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Piano," for instance, the initial ad campaign depicted close-ups of 
Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel, but this was later changed to a shot of Hunter 
on the beach with a piano. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hallmark is the ability to keep films in theaters four to six months," 
Dinerstein explained. "Like Water for Chocolate," he noted, is in its 75th week 
of release. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramax expects "Little Buddha" to play into the fall, Dinerstein said. There 
are financial reasons for keeping the movie going. Miramax reportedly spent $7 
million to $9 million to acquire the North American rights. The film has 
grossed less than $4.5 million.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: 'MASK' MAKES DARK HORSE 
INTO SURE BET FOR SPINOFFS; THE BOOMING COMIC-BOOK PUBLISHER GETS A 
MULTI-PICTURE DEAL BEFORE THE JIM CARREY FILM EVEN OPENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before its first weekend box-office results rolls in, New Line Cinema's 
"The Mask" has worked more than a little magic for its comic-book progenitors, 
Dark Horse Entertainment. The film, expected to be one of late summer's biggest 
hits, has led to a deal with producer Larry Gordon for the comic-book wizards 
to develop eight films, many built around other well-known Dark Horse 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Dark Horse President Mike Richardson and Executive Vice President Todd Moyer 
will co-produce all films with Gordon, formerly of Largo Entertainment. The two 
are also in discussions with several studios, whom they will not name, for a 
separate production deal they hope will be announced later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the suitors, sources say, is Universal Pictures, home of September's 
Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle "Time Cop," which Dark Horse also helped to 
create for Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Dark Horse comics that Richardson and Moyer will help Gordon adapt for the 
screen include "X," written by Steven Grant; "Pit Bulls," with "Mask" writer 
John Acrudi; "The Machine," written by Randy Stradley, and "Cemetery," written 
by Mike Barron on Gordon's original concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others will be based on titles owned by Dark Horse: a wisecracking spy 
thriller called "Accident Man," written by Pat Mills, and "Black Cross," 
written by Steve Grant and Chris Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Verheiden, who shares story credit on "The Mask" and screenwriting credit 
on "Time Cop," will write the remaining two films for Gordon, neither of which 
will be based on Dark Horse Comics: "Al & Gene," a fantasy similar to "The 
Mask," and a second that has yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon is not the only producer eager for a piece of Dark Horse: Gale Anne 
Hurd's Pacific Western Productions will produce "Virus," a story by 
screenwriter Chuck Pfarrer ("Hard Target," "Darkman"), who also helped create 
Dark Horse, about an alien intelligence invading a Chinese frigate at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 What Dark Horse is doing with Gordon "is really sort of a first-time 
screenwriters' program for our comic-book writers. Dark Horse has become much 
more than just a comic-book publisher," says Moyer. In addition to "The Mask," 
Dark Horse's RoboCop was the inspiration for the three Orion "RoboCop" films 
and the TV series. 
</P>
<P>
 Dark Horse, which graphic artist Richardson started in Bend, Ore., in 1980 
with $2,000 against his Visa charge card, was originally planned as a small 
retail store where Richardson could sell comic books while he wrote and 
illustrated children's stories in the back of his shop. Now it's one of the 
nation's largest comic-book publishers with 150 employees, a growing production 
company that hopes to develop a TV series based on "The Mask" and a related toy 
line for Hasbro. The company has publishing operations in both suburban 
Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles, as well as eight retail outlets, including 
Universal CityWalk's Things From Another World. Comic-book sales for 1993 were 
$32 million. 
</P>
<P>
 It can thank "The Mask" for its exploding growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Richardson began creating his characters in the back of his small store, 
he began to network, tapping into other writers and artists. Eventually he 
hooked up with Moyer, then an agent with Ira Schecter Co. in Los Angeles. Moyer 
left the agency in 1988 to join Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Moyer and Richardson first approached New Line about adapting "The 
Mask" for the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had bigger offers," says Richardson. "Warner Bros. wanted it, but (New 
Line president of production) Mike De Luca guaranteed us that he would make the 
movie. We didn't want to take the chance of selling it and never see it made." 
</P>
<P>
 The character went through several transformations, and the project was 
stalled a couple of times, Richardson says. "In the beginning, the comic book 
was very violent. When I pitched the project, it was around the time of all 
those 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sequels," which were produced by New Line. "But 
I didn't want this to be the next Freddy Krueger. I wanted the main character 
to be more like Tex Avery. The characters began to evolve and Stanley Ipkiss 
(the main character) became more of a repressed romantic." In the film, the 
nerdy Ipkiss finds an ancient, cursed mask, puts it on and is transformed into 
a whirling dervish embodying all of his repressed desires. 
</P>
<P>
 "The delays at New Line worked in my favor," says Richardson. "When they 
bought 'The Mask' in 1989, the project was on a two-year production schedule. 
If the project had been made then, it wouldn't have had Jim Carrey (who plays 
Ipkiss) and it wouldn't have had the unbelievable special effects of Industrial 
Light & Magic." 
</P>
<P>
 There is already a "Mask" children's book in the works, called "Merry 
ChristMask" -- a tale in which Santa Claus is hurt and a little boy dons the 
mask and saves the day. There's even talk of doing a live stage show, adds 
Moyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under way are a CD-ROM interactive game based on Dark Horse's comic 
"Alien," plus video games based on the upcoming "Time Cop." 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the mean time, Dark Horse wants to continue focusing on the origin of 
all this merchandising: the comic books themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted autonomy in developing all of our comics, particularly into 
screenplays," says Moyer. "Thanks to Larry Gordon, we now have that. It's 
something we plan to continue."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: ONLINE CHATTER; FORREST 
GUMP, MEET CHARLES FOSTER KANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This summer, Gump not only happens, it happens online. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Robert Zemeckis' "Forrest Gump," a movie about a mentally slow man 
who unwittingly influences recent U.S. history, hasn't only attracted large 
numbers of summer moviegoers, it has also inspired a sometimes heated 
discussion in America Online's Hollywood Online area. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer-savvy film fans have long been able to discuss movies on online 
services by leaving messages on movie-oriented electronic message boards, but 
while messages about such movies as "Speed" tend to focus on rather one-note 
praise for the movie and its stars, the message board for "Forrest Gump" has 
some interesting messages -- and some surprising questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Forrest Gump went to Vietnam, there is a joke about how they are always 
looking for 'Charlie' and everybody laughed?," said a message posted by an 
America Online writer using the name Meeska. "What does 'Charlie' mean. I have 
asked people and they don't really know either." 
</P>
<P>
 Meeska, who had asked who Abbie Hoffman was in another message, got a response 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle3R posted a message asking for help settling a question. Was the lyric 
John Lennon quoted during a scene where he appears with Gump on the Dick Cavett 
show from "Imagine" or "With a Little Help From My Friends"? The line was from 
"Imagine," of course, and the answer appeared promptly on the message board. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "Forrest Gump" board isn't just a place for apparently young 
moviegoers to brush up on the film's historical references. It's also a place 
where some of America's amateur film critics are taking great pains to analyze 
the movie -- and arguing with one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Most messages praised the movie, calling it touching and funny, and there was 
even some talk of possible Oscars for Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise. Other online 
critics, however, were less than kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "IT WAS THE SPUIDEST MOVIE I EVER SAW," commented one user, whose 
movie-evaluating skills may be somewhat ahead of his or her spelling. 
</P>
<P>
 A more serious posting by a user called nativeson said "Forrest Gump" 
trivializes the political movements it portrays and "plays into our inability 
to learn nothing from the past but how to repackage it for profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later, EMBASSYWAY posted a message responding to nativeson's lengthy 
criticism and saying nativeson was unable to enjoy the charming movie because 
of his "disease (of) analysis paralysis." 
</P>
<P>
 Another user said criticizing such an inspirational movie was like "kicking a 
dove because you don't like the song it sings." 
</P>
<P>
 "Forrest Gump" so far has generated more than 300 messages, on topics ranging 
from its soundtrack to its special effects. One user posted a message asking 
about the meaning of "stupid is as stupid does," one of Gump's trademark 
phrases, while others complained that the movie had a left-wing or right-wing 
political slant. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of discussion is "a clear sign that 'Forrest Gump' is touching a 
large number of moviegoers," according to Stuart Halperin, executive vice 
president of Marketing for Hollywood Online, the Santa Monica company that runs 
film-oriented areas on several online services, including America Online. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's touching different moviegoers in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
 MrRobert1 praised "Forrest Gump's" originality and called it "the best movie 
since 'Citizen Kane,' while ScorpLfty said it was " 'Citizen Cane' (sic) pared 
down for the masses and spruced up for an MTV generation."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AD THE MOVIES: 'MASK' MASTERMIND; BUT 
AREN'T ALL SCREENWRITERS FORMER TEEN-AGE GEEK LOSERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stanley Ipkiss wore "The Mask" to escape geekiness. Mike Werb wants to strap 
it on in hopes his own teen-age geekiness can be recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
 Werb, screenwriter of the New Line Cinema film that opened Friday, based much 
of the dweeby character of hapless bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss, the character 
played by Jim Carrey, on his own awkward teen years. And now, in line to write 
the sequel to "The Mask," he is hoping to relive those inglorious adolescent 
moments one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Werb, who has just wrapped writing on three other projects, says he hasn't 
begun discussions with New Line or director Chuck Russell yet. But Werb and 
Russell both have first shot at creating the sequel, which could begin filming 
as early as next year if the original is a hit. And a hit, says New Line's 
president of production Mike De Luca, means the film would make about $80 
million at the box office. (Carrey has already reportedly been signed to star 
in a sequel, for as much as $7 million to $10 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just hoping the first warrants a sequel," says De Luca. 
</P>
<P>
 So Werb, 35, is prepped to go digging once again in his trunk of teen- Angst 
memories and dust off a few more unpleasantries to integrate into Ipkiss' 
sad-sack character. 
</P>
<P>
 "This movie, in many ways, is not at all like the comic book," says Werb of 
the Dark Horse comic that inspired the film. "In the beginning of the comic 
book, it's very dark and Stanley ends up killing hundreds of people, including 
police officers." He says Russell tapped him after reading his script on the 
children's book "Curious George" for Imagine, the story of a manic monkey loose 
in New York City. The two decided to turn "The Mask" into a wild romantic 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck always envisioned Jim in this role and the script was really written 
for him. But for me it was more than a little bit challenging emotionally," 
says Werb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stanley is me, sort of. I was pretty much of a loser geek in high school. I 
weighed 90 pounds and grew six inches, from 5-feet-4 to 5-feet-10, in one year. 
I have stretch marks on my knees for this! They called me 'The Worm' because it 
was close to my name; the kinder ones called me 'The Whip.' You don't know how 
many times I wished I had the mask." 
</P>
<P>
 When Carrey's Ipkiss puts on the ancient cursed mask, the milquetoast clerk 
transforms into a Tex Avery cartoon -- a green-faced, zoot-suited, wisecracking 
phantom. "The Mask" also stars Cameron Diaz as Stanley's love interest, comic 
Richard Jeni as his pal, Peter Greene as the wicked villain and Peter Riegert 
as the befuddled cop. 
</P>
<P>
 Werb even has a bit role in the film. "It's outside the Coco Bongo Club. I'm 
supposed to look like a swank record executive who can get into any club in 
town. I ended up looking more like a William Morris agent." 
</P>
<P>
 He won't be appearing in his several upcoming projects, however. They include 
the action thriller "Face-Off" for Paramount, which he co-wrote with Michael 
Colleary; the action comedy "Hamlet," about a drug-sniffing pig, for producer 
Dawn Steel at Turner; "Sherman's Shadow," a comedy for producer Larry Mark at 
Universal; "Stretch Armstrong," a comedy based on the children's toy, for Joe 
Roth's Caravan Pictures at Disney, and "Machine Gun Kelly," currently in 
development at Columbia Pictures. Werb calls the last a "sweeping epic 
Depression-era romance about the gangster who never took a shot at anyone 
despite his name. I think it's my best work to date."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: LOTTO PROMO; CALIFORNIA 
BETS ON FILM ABOUT N.Y. WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "It Could Happen to You," which opened nationwide Friday, tells the story of a 
New York cop whose $4-million win at the New York state lottery changes his 
fortune in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the California Lottery, knowing a golden opportunity when they 
saw one, agreed to help TriStar Pictures promote the film in California, 
despite the fact that Cage's character wins big in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "How often do you have a wholesome movie with a good theme that involves a 
lottery ticket?" said Linda Barton Macdonald, the lottery's product publicity 
manager, on why it agreed to the joint promotion. "We thought it would be 
really fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the California Lottery has previously participated in corporate 
tie-ins, it had never promoted a movie before. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a good lottery story," Macdonald said, "we were really excited 
to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 California Lottery tickets purchased last Monday, Tuesday and Friday, the day 
the film opened, read: "Who's Next? It Could Happen To You!," and preview 
audiences in Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles received free 
"Scratcher" tickets and a chance to meet local lottery winners. The California 
Lottery also printed up promotional notepads with its logo for TriStar. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the theme that winning the lottery could happen to anybody, 
Macdonald said, "we compiled a collection of everyday folks who struck it rich. 
We want to be able to say to an audience, 'Here's a millionaire!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen other state lotteries, including New York, have agreed to promote "It 
Could Happen to You," which was inspired by a true story. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the business of producing big winners," Macdonald said, "and this 
film gives an audience a chance to see what life's like for a winner."

THEATER / COMMENTARY; WHEN A PLAY TRANSCENDS ETHNICITY; 'THE SISTERS 
ROSENSWEIG' REACHES BEYOND ITS ETHNIC ROOTS. HOW DOES WENDY WASSERSTEIN MAKE IT 
HAPPEN, AND WHY DOES IT WORK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, Laurie Winer is The Times' theater critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In New York there is a saying: Only three kinds of people go to the theater -- 
Jews, homosexuals and Jewish homosexuals. Clearly this is not literally true, 
but it does acknowledge that commercial theater has traditionally catered to a 
specific audience. 
</P>
<P>
 These two (or three) groups are not only avid theatergoers, but they also 
write and are the subject of more than a representative share of commercial 
hits, from works by Arthur Miller to Herb Gardner to Tony Kushner to Wendy 
Wasserstein. This raises an interesting question: At what point do playwrights 
transcend the concerns of their communities, particularly when those 
communities routinely support the theater? 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the so-called AIDS plays, for instance, speak to audiences largely 
untouched by the disease. Some do not. For example, David Drake's 1992 one-man 
show about growing up gay, "The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me" (brought to the 
Tiffany Theatre last year), struck this critic as parochial and 
self-congratulatory. But it attracted an enthusiastic following that needed to 
hear what it had to say. Far less exclusionary was William Finn's "Falsettos" 
(1992), which reached both a gay audience and a straight audience that could, 
for whatever reason, translate a character's death from AIDS into any number of 
different kinds of losses. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that Wendy Wasserstein's rueful 1992 comedy "The Sisters 
Rosensweig," making its L.A. premiere at the Doolittle Theatre, flatters a 
Jewish audience that enjoys seeing itself portrayed on the stage. One 
character, a furrier named Merv, pours himself a large Scotch while speculating 
on the cliche that Jews don't drink. "It's a myth," he muses, "made up by our 
mothers to persuade innocent women that Jewish men make superior husbands." 
</P>
<P>
 The line has drawn howls from all three audiences with whom I've seen the 
play; it's the howl of recognition and pleasure that punctuates most of the 
evening. But Wasserstein's play, modeled after the well-made Broadway comedies 
the author saw as a girl in the late '50s and early '60s, goes well beyond its 
own joking attention to Jewish concerns, and beyond many of the popular 
comedies that inspired it. "The Sisters Rosensweig" may be a polished 
drawing-room comedy, but it is also a play about loss of identity, Jewish or 
otherwise, and it is especially rich when it touches on the painful process of 
reconnection. 
</P>
<P>
 The play tells the story of three sisters: Pfeni (Joan McMurtrey), the 
strangely passive travel writer in love with Geoffrey (Richard Frank), a 
theater director whose bisexuality doesn't seem to trouble her; Gorgeous 
(Caroline Aaron), who favors fake Chanel suits and words like funsy and who is 
utterly aware of the cliched Jewish housewife people see when they look at her, 
and Sara Goode, whose story this really is. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara (in a lovely performance by Mariette Hartley) is a Brooklyn-born Jew who 
has assimilated seemingly beyond recall; note her mastery of the British 
pronunciation of the word schedule. Twice divorced, she heads an international 
bank and lives in stylish, if goyish, splendor in London's Queen Anne's Gate. 
Aside from the small matter of a husband, Sara appears to have it all. But when 
her sisters show up for her 54th birthday, it becomes clear that Sara, the 
oldest and apparently most stable of the sisters Rosensweig, has forgotten who 
she is. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Sara is dating a Nazi named Nick Pym (Ian Stuart). At least, 
that's how Gorgeous sees it. Nick is actually only a former Thatcher MP, with 
an alarming habit of asking questions like "So many Jewish American men wear 
those shirts. Why is that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat more left-leaning, Sara's daughter Tess (Debra Eisenstadt) is 
threatening to join her boyfriend (Barry McEvoy) as a Lithuanian freedom 
fighter. In the meantime, though, she is studying a recording her mother made 
as a Radcliffe undergrad with her singing group, the Cliffe Clefs. Tess is 
captivated by the younger, softer Sara she hears there, a woman who felt free 
enough to sing in public. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sara has become, according to Gorgeous, "a hard woman." And Sara is 
particularly hard with Gorgeous. With her faux Louis Vuitton bag and penchant 
for Yiddishisms, Gorgeous is Sara's most vivid reminder that she is, in fact, 
Jewish and she once was something less finished than the brilliant success we 
see now. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular weekend, Sara is besieged by her roots. Gorgeous insists on 
putting a schmata on her head and reciting the Sabbath prayer. (Sara forces 
Pfeni, the youngest sister, to blow out the ceremonial candles that Gorgeous 
has just lit.) But worst of all is the appearance of Geoffrey's friend Merv 
(Charles Cioffi), the furrier who comes to dinner and will not take no for an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 To Sara, Merv is declasse and pushy. He brings up the Holocaust immediately 
upon entering a dinner party. His presence puts Nick Pym -- and his Hitlerite 
mustache -- in stark relief. Sara would be shocked to know what the audience 
senses immediately -- Merv the furrier is exactly what Sara needs. 
</P>
<P>
 In their brief courtship, Merv croons along with Sinatra to "Just the Way You 
Look Tonight." When it's Sara's turn, she refuses. "I just can't sing for you, 
Merv," she says, a little regretfully. But there is hope: She can sleep with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Sara listens to the Cliffe Clefs record that fascinates Tess. Riveted 
by the sound of her own 18-year-old voice singing "McNamara's Band," she sinks 
into a deeply buried memory (a moment aided immeasurably by Pat Collins' 
shadowy lighting). Sara refinds a part of herself that is very far away. She 
begins to sing a Yiddish-ized version of "McNamara's Band," a version she must 
have learned long before Radcliffe, before she knew to be ashamed. The audience 
at first laughs at the strange sounds coming out of the mouth of Sara Goode. 
But the laughter turns almost immediately into a kind of awe -- here is the 
mysterious, essential act of reconnection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Critics sometimes accuse Wasserstein of being glib, in the way they complain 
that Neil Simon sacrifices character development for gags. Certainly 
Wasserstein's characters are clever; often they can't resist cracking jokes. 
This is a comedy, however rueful, and in a comedy it helps to have witty 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, though, the play suffers from self-consciousness in its more serious 
vein, specifically when it pays tribute to Chekhov. With the three sisters 
gathered on the sofa (one of them brings up a samovar at this point), the talk 
turns to what they wish for. "That each of us can say at some point that we had 
a moment of pure, unadulterated happiness! Do you think that's possible, Sara?" 
asks Gorgeous, in an uncharacteristically poetical mode. The moment curdles; 
it's an emotion that should have been conveyed to us and not force-fed. 
</P>
<P>
 But a little overwriting notwithstanding, "The Sisters Rosensweig," is a 
breakthrough play for Wasserstein. Earlier this year I interviewed the 
playwright for the Paris Review, and we talked about her youthful tendency, 
along with other writers developed at Playwrights Horizons in the late '70s, to 
write plays made up of episodes, ending in blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could say we were the first generation who grew up watching 
television and going to the theater," she said, noting that she, Christopher 
Durang, William Finn and others were breaking form from the generation before, 
playwrights like Lanford Wilson and John Guare, who were all breaking form too, 
from Edward Albee and Arthur Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserstein recalled that, while serving on a committee at the Yale School of 
Drama, she spoke to a young directing student whose desire was to "explode 
text." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought of Miss Julie exploding over the Yale School of Drama saying, 
'There goes the Seagull!' " Wasserstein said. "And I thought, 'Well, before you 
explode it you should know how to do it.' And I thought I would just like to 
try to do this because in fact playwriting is like making stained glass. If it 
is becoming a more and more obscure craft, then it would be interesting to know 
how to master that craft, and I would like to try and do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserstein clearly was shooting for something more ambitious in her 1988 play 
"The Heidi Chronicles." But it was the classic structure of "The Sisters 
Rosensweig" that freed Wasserstein to write her most moving scene yet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it so powerful to see a character reconnect with a younger self, 
particularly on the stage? It currently happens every night at the Universal 
Amphitheatre when the title character in "The Who's Tommy" gazes in a mirror. I 
am still haunted by a scene at the end of Caryl Churchill's 1979 play "Cloud 
Nine," in which an older woman embraces her younger self. That the younger 
woman was the ridiculously sheltered wife of a British colonialist and was 
played by a man made the moment no less moving. 
</P>
<P>
 There's always something disturbing about a Jew who's embarrassed by Jewish 
things, or any comparable denial of the imperfections of the self. That 
embarrassment signals a disassociation, a jangled note, a tension we all know 
in one way or another. The embrace of self -- in "Cloud Nine" it was a literal 
one; in "The Sisters Rosensweig" it occurs when a woman sitting in a chair 
sings to herself -- offers relief, release, the admitting of a painful truth. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an archetypal moment, a primal moment, a moment when a person forgives 
himself for everything he has failed to become. It's a transcendent moment. It 
allows for possibility. It only happens once in a great while. And it's 
happening right now onstage at the Doolittle Theatre. 
</P>

 PRIME WATCHER: Two dozen local women told ABC-TV's "Prime Time Live" as a 
group last year that former Tustin gynecologist Ivan C. Namihas had sexually 
molested them. Namihas denies it, and the show aired after local prosecutors 
said it was too late to charge him. The women's efforts paid off. . . . An 
executive in the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles watched the show with 
interest. Result: A year later, federal prosecutors have charged Namihas with 
mail fraud related to false billing.

 NEW FIRE FACE? If you live in Westminster, you've likely seen the dramatic 
cover on the city's brochure for signing up for its paramedic subscription 
program. It shows a firefighter, face blackened with soot, carrying a child 
clutching her teddy bear out of a burning house. But you won't see it anymore. 
. . . That firefighter, Paul Gilbrook, was fired recently. He argues it was for 
his activities as president of the Westminster Firefighters Union. The council 
says it was for other reasons. New brochures will be sent out to residents 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 BY DESIGN: KLOS-FM radio (95.5) is giving you an extra reason for 
participating in its annual, weeklong blood drive, which starts Monday in Santa 
Ana: You get a free T-shirt. . . . The shirt's life-saving message was designed 
by Teresa Acosta, 9, of West Covina, a leukemia victim who's received nearly 
100 blood units in her treatment. The local American Red Cross chapter's Judy 
Iannaccone, above, says you can donate at its office at 600 Parker Center Drive 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 SNOOPING AROUND: If you were worried about Arsenio Hall being out of work 
since his talk show closed, he's still in demand. Hall will be among the guests 
at a Celebrity Basketball and Comedy Jam at the Bren Events Center at UC Irvine 
Tuesday night. . . . Comics such as Hall and Robert Townshend will perform 
before the game. Other names playing: Teri Hatcher, who is Superman's Lois Lane 
on ABC-TV, and rap music's Snoop Doggy Dog. Game proceeds go to young people 
with brain disorders.

A CHILD VANISHES AND A MOTHER GRIEVES; NEW YORK: FOUR-YEAR-OLD KALI POULTON 
DISAPPEARED MAY 23, JUST MINUTES AFTER FETCHING HER TRICYCLE. HUNDREDS OF LEADS 
AND SIGHTINGS HAVE FIZZLED AS THE TRAIL GROWS COLD.

 Everywhere she went, the raggedy doll went with her, a faithful companion in 
the sandbox, at day care and on her pillow. Then one day the doll was suddenly 
nowhere to be found and 4-year-old Kali Poulton, heartbroken, learned a hard 
lesson about growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had wanted to keep it in a bag and show her someday when she got older, 
take it out and say, 'You loved this doll!' " her mother said. "And she would 
be, like, 'Ah, I don't believe that, Mom.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now, out of the blue, it is Kali who is gone, apparently whisked from in front 
of her suburban house in Upstate New York. She disappeared in the space of a 
few minutes on May 23, after getting her tricycle out of the shed. 
</P>
<P>
 No witnesses have emerged. Hundreds of possible leads and sightings, notably a 
drawn-out hoax in Illinois, have fizzled. Abduction seems the most likely 
answer, by someone brazen enough to snatch a little girl from a fenced-in 
subdivision and then reach back for her pink-and-white Big Wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morning and night are the worst times," said Judy Gifford, a single mother 
with an only child. "My daughter used to always wake up and come in my bed, and 
that's something that doesn't happen anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 And when she climbs the stairs at night, passing Kali's room, Gifford still 
absent-mindedly contemplates tucking her in. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel like a part of you dies a little bit every day," she said. "No 
parent should ever have to go through something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks turn into months, and the white ribbons flutter in the warm breeze from 
doorways and fences around Gleason Estates -- a dead-end loop of 300 townhouses 
obscured by a profusion of spruce and locust. The communal lawns are lined with 
boulders and 15-m.p.h. signs enforced by speed bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 All over metropolitan Rochester on the southern shore of Lake Ontario, Kali's 
photo smiles from car windows, office walls and storefronts. On Interstate 490, 
muffled by sound barriers behind Kali's home, a billboard appeals to passers-by 
to "Think Hard" if they've seen this face. 
</P>
<P>
 Now western New York has one, just like innumerable other places: a lost child 
with dimples and waist-length blond hair who knew not to go with strangers but 
wasn't quite old enough to reason why. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year in America, an estimated 300 children are kidnaped by strangers. As 
many as half of them are killed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like any other Monday. Gifford, a legal secretary, picked up her 
daughter at the day care after work. Kali went out to play with a friend. The 
mothers chatted, then Gifford went inside to make dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt very safe here. People watched each other's children," said Gifford, 
peering down the sidewalk that curls around the two-story apartment houses to 
the small parking lot where she suspects Kali was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 When the other girl went home, Kali wobbled back and forth on her bicycle with 
training wheels, her mother glimpsing her periodically through the window. 
Around 7 p.m., she came in for her tricycle. Gifford remembers hesitating -- 
she wanted to drop by a McDonald's restaurant -- then giving in to Kali's 
entreaties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her we were leaving in five or 10 minutes. She said OK, as she always 
does. And that was it. That was the last time I talked to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Kali's parents separated in 1992, but their relationship was amicable. Her 
father, David Poulton, was happy to let her live with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides of the family took polygraph tests and were cleared of any 
involvement, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes soared in June, when a man in Naperville, Ill., said he had spotted a 
blond girl bound and gagged in the back of a van. After a three-day hunt, he 
confessed that he had lied. 
</P>
<P>
 Gifford tries to talk matter-of-factly but the tears flow easily, dabbed with 
a handkerchief wrapped around her index finger. 
</P>
<P>
 She talks about her daughter -- how she wore glasses to correct a lazy left 
eye; how she was pretty enough to compete in the "Little Miss Petite" state 
finals; how she often caught Kali telling bedtime stories to her favorite doll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there's a lot of other parents out there just like I am and their 
hearts are breaking just like mine is," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Kali's disappearance, thousands of volunteers have handed out posters, 
trekked over railroad tracks and wasteland, and kept vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel helpless, and the whole world, the whole community feels helpless," 
Gifford said. "Everybody says, 'I don't know what to do for you.' 
</P>
<P>
 "You just think positively and think she is safe, that someone took her 
because they wanted a little girl. She'll be home. I believe I will see her 
face again."

LAND ISSUE COULD DERAIL GIANT TELESCOPE; ASTRONOMY: A EUROPEAN CONSORTIUM IS AT 
ODDS WITH DESCENDANTS OF A CHILEAN WAR HERO OVER A PERFECT MOUNTAIN SPOT FOR A 
HUGE TELESCOPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A consortium of eight European countries envisioned an 8,635-foot mountain as 
an ideal site for what would be the world's largest telescope. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the consortium believed it had the right to build the telescope under 
a 1963 treaty with Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 But the consortium has run into a snag: Descendants of a 19th-Century Chilean 
war hero say they have rights to part of the mountain and have gone to court to 
halt construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The European Southern Observatory, owned by the eight countries, wants to 
construct the 16-meter Very Large Telescope, VLT, on the mountain 75 miles 
south of Antofagasta. Chile donated the land on Cerro Paranal where the 
$500-million installation is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The VLT would be an extension of the 14-telescope observatory the consortium 
already owns at La Silla, a 7,874-foot mountain about 310 miles south of 
Paranal on the southern edge of the Atacama Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Descendants of Adm. Juan Latorre, who served Chile during the 19th-Century War 
of the Pacific against Peru and Bolivia, say they have rights to part of 
Paranal and filed suit to annul the land donation. 
</P>
<P>
 The European Southern Observatory, or ESO, contends that it received 
diplomatic immunity in its original 1963 La Silla agreement with Chile and 
wants the court to extend the immunity to Paranal. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-week halt, a judge allowed site preparation to resume in April 
while considering the immunity issue. If immunity is not granted, the suit 
could drag on for years, jeopardizing the project, according to the consortium 
of Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Italy, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit is only the latest problem for ESO, which has been criticized by 
labor unions, Chilean astronomers and the Chilean Congress for its operation on 
La Silla. 
</P>
<P>
 The unions argue that the observatory should follow local laws for its Chilean 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilean astronomers demand a fixed amount of telescope time annually. 
Currently, they can use the telescopes only if their proposals are selected by 
a competition committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes with ESO it was not clear why (a) proposal was rejected while other 
proposals of lesser quality were accepted," said Hernan Quintana, an astronomy 
professor at Catholic University. 
</P>
<P>
 The observatory has claimed immunity from the labor laws and emphasized that 
Chile did not ask for guaranteed telescope time in the 1963 agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the Chilean government and ESO negotiated a supplementary 
agreement to address these issues, but it has yet to clear a critical Chilean 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, observatory representatives and government officials met to modify the 
agreement. Neither side would provide details, but both called the meetings 
productive. 
</P>
<P>
 ESO is one of three international observatories built in the 1960s to take 
advantage of the clear nights and ideal observation conditions in Chile's 
north-central region. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerro Tololo, 7,218 feet high with seven telescopes, is one of the United 
States' National Optical Astronomy Observatories. Las Campanas, at the same 
altitude with three observatories, is operated by the Carnegie Institution, a 
Washington-based nonprofit foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atacama Desert is the driest place on Earth, with little rain and few 
clouds to impair astronomic research. The observatories lose only about 30 
nights annually to clouds. By contrast, European cloudy nights number 150 to 
200 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Like ESO, the other observatories are building bigger telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
 An 8-meter telescope is planned for Cerro Tololo and will be the twin of one 
being built in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The two telescopes will be coordinated to 
view the entire sky simultaneously. The telescopes, costing $176 million, are 
funded by the United States, Britain, Canada, Chile, Brazil and Argentina. 
Construction of what is called the Gemini Project is expected to be completed 
by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Campanas has leveled one of its mountaintops to build a 6.5-meter 
telescope, costing between $35 million and $40 million. Miguel Roth, director 
at Las Campanas, said there is a 90% chance that a second telescope of the same 
size will be built.

ANCIENT KINGDOM STRUGGLES TO CONFRONT 21ST CENTURY; MOROCCO: KING HASSAN II AND 
HIS BAND OF TECHNOCRATS ARE TRYING TO MAKE A FREE-MARKET MODEL FOR THE THIRD 
WORLD, RAPIDLY SHAPING AN EXPORT-DRIVEN ECONOMY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The peasant woman and her children barely looked up from reaping wheat when a 
fleet of limousines roared by, full of dignitaries who had just pushed the 
world trading system into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Morocco's leaders want to take their ancient kingdom there too, but will have 
to make radical changes first. 
</P>
<P>
 King Hassan II and his band of technocrats are trying to make a free-market 
model for the Third World, rapidly shaping an export-driven economy that will, 
they hope, become to Europe what Mexico has been to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But the impressive strides made in textiles, electronics assembly and 
agriculture coexist with poverty, illiteracy, corruption and enduring, if 
declining, human-rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morocco dreams of being a new dragon," said Abdelaziz Benani, vice president 
of the Moroccan Human Rights Organization. "Well, to be a new dragon, you can't 
be illiterate. You can't wait for people to have decent lives to give them 
political freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Political reforms are coming to Morocco more slowly than economic change. 
International pressure on Hassan to loosen his authoritarian rule eased quickly 
after Islamic fundamentalists began an insurgency in neighboring Algeria in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to modest democratic reforms in the last two years, the United 
States and Europe now portray Morocco as an island of stability in an uncertain 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 The seal of approval was the April conference of delegates from 120 nations 
who signed a trade treaty in Marrakech, an oasis city refurbished for the 
occasion with road repairs and new paint. Officials of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade described Morocco as an economic succcess story worthy of 
emulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups say the government lured hundreds of unemployed people off 
the streets of Marrakech before the conference with promises of work, then sent 
them to a military camp. Police officials confirmed that about 3,000 people 
considered undesirable were cleared out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most other African countries, Morocco strictly followed World Bank 
directives over the last decade, slashing spending and the national debt. The 
currency is convertible and 112 state-owned companies are being sold to private 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Mexico, Morocco has become a low-income manufacturing center for a richer 
neighbor, in this case the European Union, which grants preferential import 
duties. Eventually, Morocco wants to become an EU member. 
</P>
<P>
 Wealth is unevenly distributed in Hassan's kingdom. Industrial workers earn 
the equivalent of 75 cents an hour and peasants lead a hand-to-mouth existence 
little changed since the Middle Ages. The rural poor migrate to cities in 
search of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Morocco's economy cannot generate enough jobs for its 26 million people, 
three-quarters of whom are under 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the men cannot read or write. Illiteracy among women is 68% 
nationally, 90% in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate people seek to emigrate to Europe, which is closing the doors to 
deal with its own high unemployment. Some people have drowned in boats that 
sank trying to cross the Strait of Gibraltar to Spain. Officials are 
occasionally arrested for selling visas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinary people complain of police brutality and official corruption, but are 
careful not to criticize the king. That can bring a long prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 An oft-recounted illustration is the fund raising for the world's largest 
mosque in Casablanca, named for the king and opened last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan asked his subjects to donate what they could. Most interpreted that to 
mean a few dirhams, worth about 10 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
 Widely circulated stories have it, however, that officials at every level took 
their cut and local police shook people down for arbitrary sums, threatening 
them with jail if they refused to pay. Authorities deny the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foreigners think Morocco is the desert, but it's more like the sea -- the big 
fish eat the little fish," said a Marrakech man who would not give his name for 
fear of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The sea is becoming a little safer, at least for recognizable fish. Hassan 
named a deputy minister for human rights in 1993 and some well-known political 
prisoners have been freed. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year's U.S. State Department human rights report cites evidence that 
three prisoners died of police torture, and human rights groups say dozens of 
people have "disappeared" in the last 20 years while in custody.

GI JOE AND HIS BOO COO SLANG HIT THE DECK IN WARTIME; WORDS: A NEW DICTIONARY 
RECORDS THE TERMS AMERICAN GRUNTS, DOUGHBOYS AND DOGFACES HAVE COINED, FROM 
CHOW IN THE CIVIL WAR TO CAMEL MEAT IN THE PERSIAN GULF. 
</P>

<P>
 Along with blood, sweat and tears, war produces words. A new dictionary 
records the words American doughboys, dogfaces, GIs and grunts have thought up 
in every war they fought. 
</P>
<P>
 The list goes beyond terms that have crept into civilian vocabularies -- jeep, 
AWOL, gizmo and snafu -- to others whose military origins may not be as 
obvious, such as scuttlebutt, goldbrick, baptize by fire, bite the dust, big 
wheel and Dear John, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 "War Slang: American Fighting Words and Phrases from the Civil War to the Gulf 
War" by author Paul Dickson, shows that as long as Americans have gone to war 
they have also taken a sardonic view of the environment of battle -- the mud, 
the food, the enemy, the petty rules and the chances of survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Food, death, disfigurement and discharge, this dictionary shows, have been 
soldier preoccupations forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Chow and grub date back to the Civil War. But the GIs of World War II came up 
with the most slighting terms for food. Fried liver was alligator bait; corned 
beef was GI turkey. Prunes were army strawberries -- and were also known as 
looseners. Sausages were bags of mystery; beans were commissary bullets; 
spinach was marsh grass; toast was shingles; sauerkraut was shrubbery. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Vietnam War, canned ground beef patties in gravy were called 
Gainesburgers. In the Gulf War, any unappetizing entree was camel meat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gulf, MRE stood for Meal Ready to Eat, the successor to the C-ration of 
World War II. Those forced to consume MREs said the name consisted of three 
lies. From MREs, it was simple for soldiers to shortcut the name to simply 
Rees. 
</P>
<P>
 Death spawned a vocabulary. Kick the bucket was used in the Civil War. In 
World War II, to die was to check out. In Korea, the term became to buy the 
farm or to go to the big PX in the sky. In Vietnam, to waste was to kill but to 
be killed was to be greased, as in, "Anything you do can get you greased, 
including doing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The body bag of Vietnam was officially called the human remains pouch in the 
Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 In World War I, a basket case was a soldier who had lost all four limbs and 
was brought home as a head and a torso in a basket. The War Department issued a 
bulletin on March 28, 1919, saying it had no record "of an American soldier so 
wounded during the whole period of the war." 
</P>
<P>
 Korea produced hit the sack for going to bed and hit the deck for getting up. 
That war also gave currency to the panic button and to a fatalistic meaning for 
the term had it, as in "We've had it, we're defeated." In Korea, something 
petty was chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 American soldiers have been adept at assimilating French terms. In World War 
I, doughboys said hello by saying barn door, a play on the French bonjour . 
Goodby was bonswar, from bonsoir . And the French comme-ca was Americanized as 
cum-sah, meaning what's its name, what is it? Sergeants still say boo coo when 
they mean many; it comes from beaucoup . 
</P>
<P>
 A short-timer is a soldier whose tour of duty is nearing an end. Getting short 
was another way of putting it. In Vietnam the short-timer became a single-digit 
midget when he or she got below 10 days to go. The last day of the tour was 
known as wake-up, as in, "I've got five days and a wake-up." Then the lucky 
soldier would fly home on the freedom bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the great war cliche in recent years was generated by Saddam 
Hussein, who vowed to win "the mother of all battles" in the Gulf. Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney said Saddam instead fathered "the mother of all 
retreats." The Boston Globe said he had painted himself into "the mother of all 
corners" and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf crowed over the war's end at a session 
that became known as the mother of all briefings.

NUTRITION, MEDICINE MERGE IN CHAPEL HILL; HEALTH: NORTH CAROLINA IS FIRST 
MEDICAL SCHOOL TO LINK THE PROGRAMS. FOUR OF THE SIX LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH -- 
DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, CANCER, OBESITY -- ARE RELATED TO EATING HABITS, 
PROFESSOR SAYS.

<P>
 Surely, Peter Bream thought, that short segment on diet in a biochemistry 
course was not all his medical school planned to teach him about nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was. And his school, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
was not alone in neglecting the subject. In fact, a survey of medical school 
graduates conducted by the American Medical Assn. in 1990 showed that 65% did 
not believe they had adequate training in nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed strange to me that was all that was taught," said Bream, a 
third-year medical student. "It never really was touched upon again." 
</P>
<P>
 The University of North Carolina ended its neglect last year when it became 
the first to make its nutrition program part of the medical school and part of 
the school of public health. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that the clinical specialties realize that nutrition has a role to 
play in clinical medicine," said Dr. Bruce Bistrian, professor of medicine at 
Harvard Medical School and an adviser for the medical nutrition curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Stuart Bondurant, dean of the University of North Carolina's medical 
school, said having the department in both schools means nutrition study "goes 
from the individual through the public and it goes from prevention through 
treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 The training is important because about 50% of patients who visit primary care 
physicians have problems related to nutrition, according to Dr. Steve Zeisel, 
nutrition department chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the six leading causes of death -- diabetes, heart disease, cancer and 
obesity -- are related to nutrition, he said. Specific examples are 
demonstrated links between high fat intake and breast cancer, and between 
insufficient fiber and colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many doctors don't ask questions about diet until the patient has a heart 
attack," Zeisel said. Doctors should receive enough training in nutrition to 
identify patients who need advice on their diets before they have heart 
attacks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pairing nutrition with medicine also may benefit research projects, Zeisel 
said. As doctors become more familiar with the benefits of good nutrition, they 
may become more active in pushing the National Institutes of Health to fund 
nutrition research, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Focusing on nutrition also may save money, Zeisel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not very expensive to help people learn how to eat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapel Hill's nutrition department also will conduct a lot of its own 
research, Bondurant said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the department received a grant from the National Cancer Institute 
to find ways to increase the intake of anti-cancer fruits and vegetables among 
blacks in North Carolina. And the National Institutes of Health gave the 
department training funds for seven students who want to be nutrition 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools also will be able to benefit from the North Carolina program. An 
interactive computer course that can be used at any school will debut in a 
class this fall, Zeisel said. The course allows students to work with a 
computer-generated patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Bream, 26, was one of the students who tested the computer curriculum. He said 
the patient interaction was especially useful. 
</P>
<P>
 "You actually worked up a patient and went through all the steps of the 
interview, the lab work and diagnosis, and you worked along with a doctor in 
this virtual world," he said.

RECOVERING ADDICTS AND ALCOHOLICS RISE FROM ASHES AT PHOENIX HIGH; MARYLAND: 
FOR 15 YEARS, THE SCHOOL HAS HELPED HUNDREDS OF TEEN-AGERS STAY SOBER AND 
DRUG-FREE AND COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION. IT CURRENTLY SERVES 52 STUDENTS AND HAS 
A WAITING LIST.

 For years, whenever Danny Harper wanted to get high, he did. Now when he feels 
the urge -- even if it's 4 or 5 in the morning -- he calls his teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know they don't want to talk to me then," he said. But they do. It's part 
of the job at the Phoenix School, a public high school whose students are all 
recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
 Kris, 18, calls the Phoenix School "a place of safety, hope, acceptance and 
unconditional love on the front lines of the war on drugs." He credits his 
classmates and teachers there with saving his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have stuck by my side, making even my most difficult dreams and goals 
attainable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreams for teen-agers who once had only nightmares, whose aspirations seldom 
went beyond finding that next high or a warm place to sleep at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to college. I want to do a lot of things in my life," said 
Danny, 16, who has been clean for eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 This from a kid who stuck a key in an electrical socket, drank three bottles 
of cold medicine and slit his wrists, all trying to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug use among teen-agers is on the upswing after a decade of decline, 
University of Michigan researchers reported earlier this year after surveying 
51,000 students in grades 8, 10 and 12. Even more telling, they say, is that 
fewer teen-agers recognize the dangers associated with drugs, 
</P>
<P>
 Kris, who like the other students asked that his last name not be used, said 
he started using drugs and alcohol at age 11. By high school, when he was 
taking "anything I could get hold of that would change my mood," his 
grade-point average had dropped to .02 out of a possible 4.00. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had two options," he said. "I could get help or kill myself." He went to a 
30-day rehabilitation program and then was enrolled at Phoenix School's campus 
in Silver Spring, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 years, the Phoenix School has helped hundreds of Montgomery County 
teen-agers stay sober and drug-free and complete their high school education. 
It currently serves 52 students here and in Silver Spring, and there is a 
waiting list of others trying to get in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to support these kids and remove any obstacle to their recovery," 
said Sally Eller, principal of the school's Gaithersburg campus. It's also to 
see them graduate from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory behind the school is simple: provide the students with a drug-free, 
alcohol-free environment to pursue their studies, and help them learn to 
understand and manage their addictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been handed a way to fight back," Kris said. "The school gives us 
consistency in our lives. We have structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Recovery High School was established five years ago in Albuquerque, N.M., with 
a similar purpose. "By grouping kids together and giving them support and 
making them a team, it creates a better environment," said Rick Murray, 
director of community relations for the city school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Students usually stay a semester or two; the goal is to try to integrate them 
back into a regular class situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The school serves 40 to 100 students at any one time; Murray said 60% to 70% 
get their high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 The graduate rate for Phoenix students is 86%, school officials said. Most of 
the students continue their education, either in college or vocational 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Murray nor Eller know of any other schools like theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the emphasis on helping students overcome their addictions, Eller is 
quick to remind visitors that Phoenix is a school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very good at honing down to the basics," Eller said. "We do required 
English composition and read the required novels. It takes a little longer to 
do Algebra I. Our science curriculum is in a hands-on environment. We're not 
memorizing the Periodic Table of the Elements." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's where similarities with other schools end. While other high school 
students might choose shop or band or foreign language in addition to the 
required courses, electives at Phoenix are focused on recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Students attend 12-step recovery meetings originated by Alcoholics Anonymous, 
and meet in small groups. At the Gaithersburg campus, they also participate in 
"adventure therapy" -- rock-climbing, rafting, backpacking, skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a chance to laugh," said Danny. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Spring students participate in drama therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hand-lettered signs in classrooms refer to the different components of 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers -- there are four of them at the Gaithersburg branch -- all have 
training as counselors. Teachers and students are on a first-name basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't feel inferior to anyone," said Kristen, a 15-year-old sophomore at 
the Silver Spring school. "When it comes to the classroom, teachers are the 
authority. Outside, they are your friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Students are required to submit to urinalysis once or twice a week. If a 
student's test comes back positive, a community meeting is held. If it comes 
back positive a second time, the student is referred to a residential program. 
"We don't have students in our school using drugs or alcohol," Eller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are required to attend weekly support meetings 
</P>
<P>
 Eller said it costs about $1,000 more to educate a student at Phoenix than at 
a regular high school. 
</P>
<P>
 It's money well spent, said Kristen, who started using alcohol at age 9, drugs 
at 11 and had a heart attack at 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be robbing their houses, we'd be in jails, we'd be in public 
institutions if we weren't here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an alumni group that meets once or twice a week to help the teen-agers 
continue with their recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristen, who failed seventh-grade but is now on the honor roll at Phoenix, 
said she's considering transferring to a private school rather than her old 
high school. "I'm not afraid of seeing people I used to use with," she said. 
"I'm used to smaller settings (now), more individualized help." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny is moving to Florida in time for the next school year.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION BREAKS SECRECY BARRIER; GOVERNMENT: EVERY DAY, 2,000 
REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION COME IN, BUT ANSWERS CAN TAKE YEARS. CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION PLEDGES TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah, the American people. They think that the government belongs to them, and 
that they have the right to know what it is up to. 
</P>
<P>
 So, 2,000 times a day, people write Washington and ask for copies of 
government records, sometimes a single piece of paper, sometimes tens of 
thousands of documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 28-year-old Freedom of Information Act (known as FOIA and invariably 
pronounced "foya"), requests can come from anyone -- reporters, citizens with 
tax troubles, immigrants trying to keep from being booted out, scholars, 
corporations, city and state governments, public interest groups, anybody with 
a yen to know what is in government files. They don't have to say why they want 
to know. 
</P>
<P>
 And, more often than not, they get what they want. But the emphasis, and the 
complaints, have been on the "not" -- on the times the government has said "no" 
to FOIA requests, on the times it has come through with incomplete files and, 
chiefly, on the time it takes to act on requests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is promising to throw open its file cabinets. It 
says it will say "no" less often, even when it could find legal grounds for 
doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizations that monitor FOIA actions are skeptical, although one requester 
said that under the new policy he got more information than he dared ask for. 
</P>
<P>
 What is less clear is whether the Administration will be able to shorten the 
time it takes for FOIA to work. Requests can hang fire for months or years, and 
budget cuts are taking a toll on agency staffs that work on FOIA requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Stern knows the frustration of waiting for FOIA to release something. 
When he was an NBC reporter covering the Justice Department, he once asked 
whether Billy Carter, President Jimmy Carter's brother, had paid customs duty 
on a saddle given to him during a visit to Libya. Stern sent in the FOIA 
request in the 1970s -- and got the answer in the 1990s. (It was no; Billy 
Carter did not declare the saddle.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is the chief spokesman at the Justice Department, and one of those 
pressing to streamline the administration of FOIA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I carry my old war stories around with me," he said. "Anytime I'm asked to 
assess a policy I think of my old situation." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno issued directives telling FOIA 
officers -- every agency has one -- to be more forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general said the grounds for rejecting a FOIA request should be 
invoked "only after consideration of the reasonably expected consequences of 
disclosure in each particular case." 
</P>
<P>
 And, putting teeth into the policy, Reno said the Justice Department would no 
longer go to court to defend denials of requests for information if no harm 
could be foreseen from putting the information out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ronald Reagan and George Bush administrations, the department defended 
any agency's rejection of a FOIA request if a "substantial legal basis" for the 
denial could be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the law provides a number of grounds on which requests for information 
can be refused, FOIA officers have considerable discretion. And some of the old 
FOIA officers are still at work, with the old mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
 As for exemptions: 
</P>
<P>
 National security secrets aren't covered. Information that would harm law 
enforcement or foreign policy isn't covered. Information that would violate the 
privacy of individuals or give away business trade secrets is exempted. So are 
the internal communications of government officials in the process of making 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodded by Stern, Justice took another step: It said requests for information 
concerning issues of government integrity should go to the head of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, a community of nonprofit organizations has grown up to help 
requesters, or become requesters themselves -- the Reporters Committee for 
Freedom of the Press, National Security Archive, Public Citizen, American Civil 
Liberties Union, Landmark Legal Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 One would think they'd be happy with the new system. And most are, mostly. But 
they say departmental practices haven't yet caught up with the new principles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Department of Justice is talking a very good fight," said Jane Kirtley, 
executive director of the Reporters Committee. "But there still seems to be a 
great deal of resistance among the people on the line doing the day-to-day 
processing of these requests. It boils down to this: Until the day comes when 
information officers feel they have more to lose by withholding a document than 
releasing it, nothing fundamental is going to change." 
</P>
<P>
 David Vladeck, chief lawyer for Public Citizen, scored what was probably the 
biggest FOIA victory under the new policy: He got the government files in the 
Kurt Waldheim case -- the Reagan Administration's decision to bar the former 
Austrian president from entering the United States on grounds that he 
participated in Nazi atrocities in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladeck sued on behalf of two journalists who wanted to report what the 
government had learned about Waldheim's past, and the case was still in 
litigation when Clinton took office. The new Administration abruptly decided to 
release the papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave us the documents . . . including documents even we didn't have the 
temerity to ask for. . . . The new policy ended up with sweeping and beneficial 
disclosures that otherwise would not have been made," Vladeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Levin, director for legal policy at the Landmark Legal Foundation, has no 
such success story. He's been trying to get information on what role Justice 
Department figures may have played after the firing of White House travel 
office personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FBI responded recently with a form letter, after 10 months, which did not 
even address our FOIA request," Levin said. "I think this Administration has 
been the least responsive of any in recent memory." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern, for his part, criticizes reporters who put in "fishing expedition" 
requests that can tie up FOIA personnel for months. He cites a reporter who 
asked for all the phone records of the U.S. attorney's office in Little Rock, 
Ark., over a two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Making such a request is easy, but processing it is time consuming. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedom of Information Act is far more than a journalists' tool. 
Reporters' requests for records account for less than 10% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 "Records" is the key word. Agencies are only required to look for existing 
documents, not to create new records or to do research. FOIA is not intended to 
turn the government into a reference library. Requesters must be fairly 
specific in describing what they want. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration invites requesters and FOIA officials to talk things over 
by telephone rather than engaging in fruitless correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans seem to be catching on to FOIA's existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Hammitt, who publishes the Access Reports newsletter, which monitors 
FOIA operations, calculates that the government got 589,000 FOIA requests in 
1991, the latest year for which he could assemble figures. That was an increase 
of nearly 100,000 in a single year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is costly. Although searching and photocopying fees can be assessed, most 
agencies provide 100 pages free and many often waive fees, especially on the 
least time-consuming requests.

FARM A HAVEN FOR ONCE-CHIC PIGS; PETS: WHAT DO YOU DO WITH A 'PINT-SIZE' PORKER 
THAT GROWS TO 300 POUNDS, THEN STARTS BITING THE KIDS? TWO MEN PROVIDE A HOME 
AND HOPE FOR REJECTED ANIMALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dale Riffle is dedicated to the once-chic, but now homeless. His beneficiaries 
wallow in the dirt, grunt rudely, and always act piggish. 
</P>
<P>
 Riffle has turned five acres of farmland into a sanctuary for Vietnamese 
potbellied pigs, the fad pets of the 1980s whose lives now often end at the dog 
pound or slaughterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of the general public thinks these pigs are going to weigh 30 to 
40 pounds and can live in the house just like a cat or a dog," Riffle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were lied to. The pig got bigger than what they were told it would get. 
The pig is much more work than they were told it would be. It's more than they 
can handle." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, Riffle, 32, and partner Jim Brewer, 41, have provided a nonprofit 
home to "miniature" porkers as they work to find them futures that don't 
include bacon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out that people were dumping them alongside the road or wherever 
they could to get rid of them," Riffle said. "We thought, 'Somebody's got to do 
something. Why not us?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Riffle gave up a home near Annapolis, Md., and a career as head of a 
mail-order catalogue department for a Washington nonprofit agency. He runs the 
farm with the help of tax-free donations and some monthly stipends from former 
pig owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The native Asian pigs, less than one-fifth the size of a domestic pig, first 
entered the United States in 1988 for zoos and quickly became a novelty pet for 
the wealthy, selling for as much as $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "A litter of six could be worth $50,000," said Susan Armstrong, president of 
the 250-member North American Potbellied Pig Assn. "It became a very lucrative 
business for a very short time." 
</P>
<P>
 With excessive breeding, prices dropped to $400 by 1990 and pigs surfaced at 
flea markets and auctions, and in newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as the new house pet, the pigs were promoted as intelligent, friendly 
animals that could live in apartments and condos with no fuss or, just as 
important, no muss. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riffle says size was relative and many of those "miniature" pigs grew to 
more than 200 pounds. Too many times, the pigs showed their nasty sides, 
turning on spouses, visitors and children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swallowed the bait on my first pig," said Barbara Boughton, 39, of 
Winchester, Va. "He was supposed to be cute and weigh 40 pounds. Not true. This 
guy was somewhere near 300 pounds and mean as a snake. Anyone that came to 
visit had to put their running shoes on because he would go after everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 He said more than half the 82 pigs at his sanctuary were left because they 
were what he calls "attack pigs." Many involved owners who found their child's 
arm or leg in the pig's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Potbellied pig breeder Gerald Brown Jr. of Honeybrook, Pa., calls that kind of 
criticism hogwash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eighty-five percent of the problem pigs this man is talking about can be 
straightened out," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's poor training. That's letting that pig rule you. They'll outthink a 
human quicker than you would even know. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some crazy pigs, but a majority of the pigs can be corrected by 
putting that pig in his place." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first 14 pigs were brought to the country through Canada in the late 
1980s, the nation's potbellied pig population now numbers more than 200,000, 
and an Indiana registry service, the largest of three, has papers on more than 
21,000, Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said people also are drawn to potbellies because they don't bother 
allergy sufferers, have no odor-producing sweat glands, don't get fleas and can 
be trained to use a litter box. 
</P>
<P>
 They are normally between 18 and 24 inches tall and can be 4 feet long. The 
pigs also have a swayed back and a potbelly, while a domestic pig has an arched 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the curly tail of the domestic pig, potbellies have straight tails 
that, like dogs, wag when they are happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can teach a pig to do anything," Brown said. "You can teach a dog 
something and a pig will do it better." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong, who sees the pigs' popularity continuing to spiral upward, says 
Riffle merely sees the worst cases. Riffle argues that it was just unfair to 
bring them into the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the United States, 12 million dogs and cats are killed every year because 
they can't find homes for them," Riffle said. "Why do we need another domestic 
pet? We can't even take care of what we've got." 
</P>
<P>
 Riffle's pigs are kept in a dozen herds ranging in size from two to 14, living 
either in barns or sheds. Each area has a fenced run where the pigs can roam or 
take a dip in a plastic wading pool during warm weather. 
</P>
<P>
 But finding new homes for the pigs is a problem. Just 10 left the sanctuary 
last year despite tours and advertisements. "About half of the calls were 
people who wanted to eat them," Riffle said.

DINING A LA FOOD STAMPS IS CATCHING ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER JACKSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Angelina LeClair, being able to use food stamps in certain restaurants 
means a hot breakfast -- a blueberry muffin, bacon and coffee -- in the 
cafeteria adjoining the housing complex where she lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm there every morning," said LeClair, 69, who is among the 128 elderly or 
disabled residents of the Marcotte Congregate Housing center in Maine's 
second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Androscoggin River in Auburn, in one of the textile and shoe 
factories that have been converted into subsidized housing, Ruth Trosper says 
even the $10 a month in food stamps that she receives is enough to eat out 
occasionally at a small restaurant down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can have my breakfast down to the diner, where otherwise I couldn't afford 
it," said Trosper, 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Maine is one of the most recent states to sign up for the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's food stamps-in-restaurants program, which has existed in some 
form for 20 years but remains unused by most states. 
</P>
<P>
 Participation is limited to food-stamp recipients who are at least 60 or their 
spouses, disabled people who receive Supplemental Security Income and the 
homeless. Maine restaurants cannot be certified for the program unless nearly 
all of the meals they offer can be purchased for less than $5, including a 
beverage. The restaurant rules vary from state to state. 
</P>
<P>
 The program presents "another opportunity for a warm meal" for people who 
otherwise might go without, said Peter McCarron, food stamp director for the 
Maine Department of Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 But, nationally, only 16 other states allow food-stamp recipients to use the 
coupons in restaurants, according to the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, 
which administers the food stamp program. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in many states that do participate, finding restaurants that accept food 
stamps may be next to impossible. Fewer than 200 restaurants around the country 
accepted food stamps as of last fall, the most recent figures available, and 
half of those were located in New York state. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Webster of the National Restaurant Assn. in Washington said the program 
has not been publicized enough but said that restaurateurs also may have 
reasons for not wanting to participate, such as adding to their paperwork 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Shanholtzer, a spokesman for the Food and Nutrition Service in 
Alexandria, Va., said it is up to the states to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program is there, and the states know that," Shanholtzer said. "There 
really aren't a lot of resources for going out and promoting it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Maine officials initially applied for the program because they 
thought the federal government required it. When they learned it was optional, 
they decided to press ahead anyway because it seemed like a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government spends about $27 billion a year providing food stamps 
for nearly 27 million Americans. The benefit varies based on income -- up to 
$112 a month for a single person -- and averages $68 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Maine has been in the restaurant program for only a couple of months, 
it already is among the most active participants. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20,000 households are eligible for the program, out of the 63,000 that 
receive food stamps, with senior citizens making up the vast majority of those 
who qualify, McCarron said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the New Auburn Diner, where Trosper likes to eat breakfast, co-owner Louise 
Giguere said she serves no more than a half-dozen people who use food stamps 
even in a busy week -- not enough to make much difference in her bottom line. 
But she thinks older people appreciate the new program.

COLLEGE SPORTS ADVENTURE PROGRAM OPENS DOOR INTO OUTDOOR CAREERS; RECREATION: 
TWO-YEAR CURRICULUM IS DESIGNED TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR MIDDLE-MANAGEMENT 
POSITIONS IN THE SPORTS INDUSTRY, FROM SKIING TO WHITEWATER RAFTING.

 Four years after earning a degree in business from the University of Iowa, 
Tony DeCianni was bouncing from job to job in Chicago, working for a custom 
clothes shop, a cabinetmaker and car-rental and insurance agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch one day, he saw a tiny blurb in Backpacker Magazine describing an 
adventure sports program offered through Garrett Community College and 
Frostburg State University in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always loved doing things outdoors," DeCianni said, sitting on a rock 
during a lunch break of his rock climbing course. "I am so happy I made that 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
 DeCianni is one of 23 students from seven states enrolled in the program, 
which is completing its first year. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent hot day, students in the rock-climbing class went to Carderock, a 
popular climbing spot with 50-foot cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The class was simulating a day teaching others safety and rock-climbing 
techniques. One acted as the instructor while the others took the roles of 
would-be students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wear our helmets to protect the largest muscle in our bodies -- our 
brain," Lana Hill, an adventure sports enrollee from Bethel, Me., told her 
students. "You don't want to leave with a different personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Climbing is kind of like dancing. If it doesn't look or feel like dancing, 
you probably need to rethink what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 While other students spend all their time hitting the books, students in the 
adventure sports program also hit the ski slopes, mountain bike trails and 
whitewater rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year adventure sports program is designed to prepare students for 
middle-management positions in the adventure sports industry, from skiing to 
whitewater rafting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to make this a career, you're not going to be taking people 
on rafts down a river and giving ski lessons," said Michael Logsdon, program 
director. "If they break into a career in this, they'll do business 
management." 
</P>
<P>
 Students interested in the program have two options. They can attend Garrett 
Community College and earn an associate degree in adventure sports. Or they can 
earn the associate degree, transfer to nearby Frostburg State University for 
two more years and a bachelor's degree in recreation with an emphasis on 
adventure sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is one facet of the Adventure Sports Institute, which works to 
advance public appreciation and participating in these sports. The institute, 
which organized the U.S. Canoe and Kayak Team Olympic Trials on the Savage 
River in May, 1992, also is interested in using adventure sports as an economic 
development tool in western Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is replete with whitewater rivers, lakes, forests, ski slopes and 150 
miles of public trails, all within an eight-hour drive of 63% of the U.S. 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy Cardin, 18, of Appleton, Wis., graduated from high school in May, 1993, 
and didn't know what she wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something in the outdoors, in the recreation field," she said. 
"I didn't want to be working in an office." 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents weren't too keen on the idea, but she convinced them she was 
determined to take the program and she arrived in western Maryland in January. 
She already has taken rafting classes and has reddish bruises on her tan legs 
to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friends were equally skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, you're going to camping college," she quoted them as saying. "What are 
you going to do after that?" 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the college equivalent of basket weaving. The program combines 
courses in business management, science, marketing and leadership development 
with adventure sports. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the sports, students take courses in communications, 
literature, mathematics, environmental science, natural history, computer 
science and economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same economics course that an economics major would take," said 
Logsdon, who teaches physics at Garrett Community College. "It's the same 
English 101 you would take at the University of Maryland. Out of 66 credit 
hours, only 10 are credit courses in the skill areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The adventure sports course includes mountain biking, scuba diving, fly 
fishing, backpacking, wilderness survival, winter camping, search-and-rescue 
and horsemanship. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the adventure sports program founders invited 11 professionals from 
adventure sports-related businesses to a round-table discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned not to just teach people how to push a raft down the river, but 
how to help people understand the science of moving water," Logsdon said.

DIGITAL TELESCOPE TO MAP 25% OF THE SKY; ASTRONOMY: TECHNOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT 
IN HOME VIDEO CAMERAS WILL BE USED TO SCAN THE HEAVENS FOR LIGHT PARTICLES AND 
STORE THEM ON HIGHLY SENSITIVE COMPUTER CHIPS. 
</P>

<P>
 A new telescope that uses the same chips found in many home video cameras will 
provide the most extensive survey ever of about 25% of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers hope that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey scheduled to begin late 
this year or early next year will reveal clues about the structure and 
beginning of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which will be conducted at Apache Point Observatory near Sunspot, 
N.M., is a joint collaboration of researchers from Johns Hopkins University, 
Princeton University and five other institutions, according to Edwin Turner, an 
astrophysics professor at Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers expect the survey will take five years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike home telescopes that allow the user to view one portion of the heavens 
with the naked eye, the Sloan Digital Telescope will "plow" the skies. The 
telescope will scan long, thin strips of the night sky for photons, the actual 
particles of light. 
</P>
<P>
 Light focused by the telescope will land on a bank of 30 chips, and the 
information recorded by the chips will be stored as digital computer 
information, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the chips in the telescope resemble those found in home video 
cameras, those in the telescope have been modified to much higher sensitivity. 
Four of the devices in the giant, 200-inch Hale telescope in California can 
detect a lighted cigarette 700 miles away. Other variations are also used in 
spy satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 When finished, the researchers will have images in five different colors, 
which scientists can use to determine the characteristics of various stars, 
quasars and other galactic objects. They will also have a useful reference tool 
that can be stored on computer disks or retrieved from a computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be imaging approximately a quarter of the whole sky. In that area there 
are almost a hundred million galaxies; to have that kind of multicolor data for 
such a large area is going to be an incredible resource," said Marc Postman, an 
associate professor of astronomy at Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey is one of several in the planning stages that should provide a 
broad overview of the universe, said Stephen Strom, chairman of astronomy at 
the University of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not only yield important scientific results on its own, but will 
provide a very important tool for selecting sources of study with the new 
generation of telescopes that are coming on line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Sloan survey will measure the visible light spectrum, others will 
deal with infrared and other non-visible light, Strom said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other institutions involved in the Sloan project are the University of 
Chicago, the University of Washington, the Institute for Advanced Studies at 
Princeton, Fermilab in Illinois, the Naval Research Lab and a group of Japanese 
astronomers, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey will also help scientists get a better idea of what the universe 
looks like and the motion of various galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being an ant crawling around on a piece of art. Understanding this 
large-scale structure we hope will be a key to how the universe formed and 
evolved," Turner said.

AMERICAN DREAM JUST THAT AT INNER-CITY PHILADELPHIA SCHOOL; EDUCATION: THERE 
ARE 14.6 MILLION CHILDREN LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LINE IN U.S., INCLUDING 90% 
OF THOSE AT STANTON ELEMENTARY. SCHOOL HAS MADE PROGRESS, BUT ITS STUDENTS 
STILL LAG BEHIND, AND ITS INNOVATIVE PRINCIPAL HAS RESIGNED.

 Nadia, 8 years old, showed up on the old man's front steps every afternoon 
like a stray cat wanting to be fed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of her parents were crack addicts and, except for the abandoned house 
they used as a shooting gallery, she was homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like she said, 'I'm not leaving,' " James Spruill explained with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, the man Nadia refers to as her "grandfather" still sees her 
off to school each morning, gives her money for the movies on weekends and 
gloats over her honor-roll report cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a survivor," said Deanna Burney, former principal of Stanton Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators say there are 14.6 million children like Nadia in the United States 
living below the poverty line, and there are thousands of elementary schools 
like Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadia is one of the students featured in this year's Academy Award-winning 
documentary, "I Am A Promise: The Children Of Stanton Elementary School." 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at this school as a microcosm," said Alan Raymond, who made the 
movie with his wife, Susan. "Philadelphia is the seat of American democracy and 
freedom. We thought these children's lives and how they have to grow up had 
symbolic meaning. They are growing up in another America. They are outside the 
American dream." 
</P>
<P>
 The only grass a child at Stanton will see for blocks in any direction is 
painted on a wall in the schoolyard. Above the lush green is a blue sky filled 
with puffy white clouds. Children skip and play and turn cartwheels. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural almost mocks the real children as they turn out at recess. Although 
the shattered glass is swept to the edge of the 12-foot fence and the crack 
vials and hypodermic needles are picked up by security guards every morning, 
the children play penned in by streets of boarded-up row houses, a corner store 
with bars on the windows and adults idling on the corners. 
</P>
<P>
 These children bring to school with them the problems of two, sometimes three, 
generations, educators say. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the problems of the community are dropped at the doorstep of the 
school," Burney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotan Lee, president of the Philadelphia School Board, said inner-city schools 
are trying to do too much, and are doing too little of it well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school district has become almost a surrogate parent," Lee said. "We have 
to get back to reading, writing and arithmetic." 
</P>
<P>
 Many inner-city teachers agree. Given the choice, they say, they'd much rather 
teach than parent the students. But, increasingly, they have no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't overlook a hungry child, a cold child, a child who's been awake all 
night, a child in dirty clothes," said former Stanton teacher Dina Davis. "You 
can't just say, 'Teach him math.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony, a second-grader at Stanton, pretends not to know his crack addict 
mother as she works her way up and down a nearby street. She smiles and waves 
to her son as he passes on his way home. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a third of all children in North Philadelphia, Anthony is being reared by 
someone other than a parent. Unlike Nadia, he did not pick out a kind-looking 
face in the neighborhood and attach himself. He is being reared by his paternal 
grandmother, Alberta Whitfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitfield, who has three grown children, didn't want to rear another. But she 
felt she had little choice but to take her troubled grandchild out of foster 
care and try to give him family roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell the teachers, 'If you don't work with me, if we don't do something 
with this kid now, when he's 16 he'll be breaking into your car and busting 
your head,' " Whitfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety percent of the students at Stanton are being reared below the poverty 
line and by a single person, according to school district statistics. Last 
year, 75% of the students tested below the city average in reading; 67% tested 
below average in comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
 Five first-graders finished the year unable to identify one letter of the 
alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
 The results are worse than the national results for inner-city black children 
in grades K through 6. According to a 1992 report by the Council of the Great 
City Schools, 67% of black children in inner-city elementary schools scored 
below average in reading tests. 
</P>
<P>
 As poor as they were, the results showed improvement over the scores recorded 
before Burney arrived. Still, the frustration helped lead her to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Burney's departure was a blow to the school, several teachers say. Reared in 
foster homes herself, Burney said she understands inner-city students. In 
return for her understanding, she was loved by students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Burney's reputation as an innovative, dedicated leader was the deciding reason 
Stanton was chosen for the film, Raymond said. She not only boosted morale by 
cleaning up a leaking, rotting school building, she got parents into the 
classrooms and won districtwide awards for academic progress three consecutive 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Burney became dispirited after a bureaucratic funding formula prevented her 
from getting an administrative assistant to take over mundane tasks. Only 
schools with 740 students could have an assistant, the rules said. Burney was 
15 students short. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton teacher John Coates worked with Burney to develop a pilot program for 
boys identified as problem learners. As a boy, Coates had encountered a similar 
experience and credits it with his success. 
</P>
<P>
 The two agreed they would admit girls as well if any parent challenged the 
program. None did, and parents worked to get their sons into the class, which 
was limited to 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Coates got nine of his boys on the honor roll. 
</P>
<P>
 When the American Civil Liberties Union asked why there were no girls in the 
program, the new principal canceled it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration proposes to increase funding to poor schools by 
$700 million -- from $6.3 billion to $7 billion. The "Goals 2000" bill that the 
President recently signed outlines national educational standards for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Smith, undersecretary of education, said the Administration wants 
school-based management and community-oriented programs in inner-city schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is release the restraints, cut out a lot of rules and 
stimulate reform," Smith said.

YALE OFFERS ITS EMPLOYEES BONUSES TO LIVE NEARBY IN BID TO HALT CREEPING BLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE LAVOIE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 With urban blight creeping ever closer to its ivy-covered walls, Yale 
University has turned to cold cash to entice middle-class employees into 
settling down in New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ivy League school is offering up to $20,000, or $2,000 a year over 10 
years, as an incentive to buy a home in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our continued strength and the city's strength are very much linked," said 
Yale Secretary Linda K. Lorimer, one of the university's top officers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an approach that has been tried by some other urban universities. The 
University of Chicago, for example, offers a second-mortgage program to faculty 
and senior staff who buy homes in a 1 1/4-square-mile area near campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Only blocks from Yale's Gothic buildings and spires sit decaying neighborhoods 
where drug dealers ply their trade from graffiti-covered houses. A block from 
the towering Yale gymnasium known as the "Temple of Sweat," squatters have 
moved into some of the boarded-up homes on Fraternity Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Many middle-class families who once lived near Yale have fled to the suburbs 
to escape the high crime rate and high property taxes and to send their 
children to better schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about a third of Yale's 10,000 employees live in New Haven. About 20% of 
the city's 130,000 residents live in poverty. Renters outnumber homeowners, 2 
to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Yale's offer, good until 1996, was met with some skepticism after it was 
announced in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anywhere away from here," said Dee Dee Emery, a food service worker who rents 
an apartment in the city. Last year, her 15-year-old son was fatally shot on 
city streets, she said, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there have been more than 150 inquiries, and 15 employees have been 
approved, including clerks and low-level administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a brilliantly thought-out plan, one that is designed to guide people to 
the type of middle-level housing found near the campus," said Douglas Rae, a 
political science professor and New Haven resident who served as the city's 
chief administrator in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, $2,000 a year is not going to have much appeal for some 
faculty member with a six-figure income, but it will mean a lot to a 
$31,000-a-year middle manager," Rae said. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidy made the decision to move to New Haven easier for Jill Schneider, 
who already was thinking about moving from suburban North Haven to be closer to 
city arts and cultural events. She recently closed a deal for a condominium in 
New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
 "It basically pays for the difference in taxes between living in the city and 
living in the suburbs," said Schneider, a business manager at Yale Medical 
School. "I think it's a great way to draw people into the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacquelyn Accettullo, a financial analyst at Yale, left the city and bought a 
house in North Haven last year when her oldest child reached school age. She 
refused to send her kids to New Haven schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We laughed when we saw it because we said, 'What would you use the $2,000 
for?' You could use it to pay for private school for your kids or pay for the 
taxes, which are exorbitant," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the city has had to cut back on services even as property 
taxes have soared. Property taxes last year on a home with an assessed value of 
$125,000 would have been $4,473 in New Haven and $2,874 in North Haven. 
</P>
<P>
 Yale has also committed $14.5 million for downtown improvements, including a 
major new apartment and retail complex. But the last department store abandoned 
New Haven last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home ownership is always a stabilizing factor in the neighborhoods," said 
Mayor John DeStefano, who strongly endorses the new Yale program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the connection of living and working in the same community creates a 
feeling of empowerment. It knits the city together."

GILBERT LE COZE; INNOVATIVE SEAFOOD CHEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gilbert Le Coze, 49, a French-born chef whose innovative way with seafood 
influenced a generation of cooks. Le Coze had a major influence on the 
technique of treating fish the way one treats meat -- basing cooking times on a 
particular fish's texture and character, not according to a fixed formula.His 
first restaurant, which he and his sister bought in 1972, was named "Le 
Bernardin" after a folk song their father had sung to them as children -- "Les 
Moines de St. Bernardin." The New York restaurant drew rave reviews and 
influenced chefs from coast to coast with Le Coze's presentations and unusual 
techniques. A typical Le Coze dish might be sheets of black bass flecked with 
coriander and basil and lacquered with extra-virgin olive oil; black bass with 
a coriander infusion; saffron-tinted sea scallops served in their shells, or 
fresh sea urchins with truffle juice. Le Coze learned his trade from his 
father, also a chef, and his grandfather, who had been a fisherman. At 13, Le 
Coze began working in the kitchen of an inn his parents owned in Port Navolo, a 
seaport town on the coast of Brittany. In New York City on Thursday of a heart 
attack.

DOROTHY HODGKIN; WON NOBEL PRIZE FOR VITAMIN RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dorothy Hodgkin, whose research into vitamins won her the Nobel Prize in 
chemistry and whose interest in world peace led her to help found the Cold 
War-era Pugwash conference on nuclear weapons, has died at 84. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Hodgkin, who died Friday at her home in Shipston-on-Stour, is best known 
for mapping the molecular structure of penicillin, insulin and Vitamin B-12. 
Her research on Vitamin B-12 won her the 1964 Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a founding member of Pugwash, the international organization of 
scientists who, during the Cold War, tried to further communication between 
scientists on both sides of the Iron Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Pugwash was started in 1957 in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, to examine problems 
related to the development of weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 For her efforts Mrs. Hodgkin was given the Lenin Peace Prize in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Mary Crowfoot was born in Cairo, where her father worked for the 
Egyptian Ministry of Education and her mother was an expert on ancient 
textiles. 
</P>
<P>
 She was educated in England and studied chemistry at Oxford University's 
Somerville College before going to Cambridge from 1932 to 1934 for her doctoral 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 She returned to Somerville to teach and was Wolfson research professor of the 
University of Oxford from 1960 to 1977. One of her students was former Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgkin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1947 for her analysis of 
penicillin. In 1956, she produced a three-dimensional analysis of Vitamin B-12, 
which is essential to the life of red blood cells. In the late 1960s, she 
created a three-dimensional map of insulin. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgkin was the first woman since Florence Nightingale to become a member of 
the Order of Merit, the most prestigious of Britain's royal orders. It is 
restricted to 24 men and women who have excelled in art, literature, science or 
the armed services and is a personal gift of the monarch.

VENTURA TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS FALL 32% IN 6 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Traffic accidents in Ventura have dropped by nearly a third in six years due 
to an intensive city traffic safety program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, initiated in January, 1988, involved both police and traffic 
engineers in a joint effort to make the city safer for drivers. Car wrecks on 
city streets have declined 32%. 
</P>
<P>
 But budget cuts this year have forced police to disband their traffic unit, 
and the department fears the reduced vigilance will reverse the accident trend, 
pushing insurance rates up. Traffic engineers, however, believe their work will 
keep accidents at the current level. 
</P>
<P>
 But police officers say law enforcement is an integral part of any accident 
reduction effort and worry that the number of car accidents will rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We noticed the reduction in accidents," said Cpl. John Turner, who sits 
behind a desk this summer doing the traffic-related paperwork half a dozen 
officers participated in last year. "We've also noticed an increase too, now. 
It's generally allowed, that when the cops are writing less tickets, people are 
less cautious." 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials call the officers alarmist and their warnings exaggerated. 
They point out that the police lobbied heavily against the budget cuts and 
suggest they may still be trying to turn public opinion their way.  
</P>
<P>
 Both the city and the police said they did not have the time to pull together 
accident statistics for the first half of 1994. Officers say, however, that if 
there is an increase as they believe, the consequences will hit motorists in 
their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 A low accident rate "means the community as a whole enjoys a lower (insurance) 
premium," Turner said. "We will all end up paying higher premiums because no 
one's issuing tickets for the right things." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's traffic safety program began in January, 1988, soon after Ventura 
hired Nazir Lalani as its top traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to the city in '87, the accident rate was going nuts," Lalani 
recalled. "Then we started the safety program and boom!" 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately, the number of accidents citywide started to decline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 First, city employees identified all intersections and city blocks that had 
three or more accidents a year. Engineers attended to the most hazardous areas 
first, working their way around the city until, by this year, the program is 
nearly completed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Workers slathered corner curbs with red paint, to prevent parked cars from 
blocking the views of drivers making turns. The city erected new traffic 
signals at problem cross streets, synchronized many of the city's existing 
signals, and planted stop signs and curve warning signs where none had stood 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 The results for even one improvement measure could be dramatic. When Ventura 
coordinated all the traffic signals along a busy stretch of Victoria Avenue, 
car crashes on that street dropped by 25%, Lalani remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vigilant police traffic enforcement helped, but it was not the reason for the 
decline, Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers "geared up in 1985, but it had no impact," he said. Studies 
done by Ventura's engineering department show a nearly 99% correlation between 
engineering improvements and reduced accident rates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the Police Department," Lalani said, "feels very strongly that their 
department caused it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cpl. Turner explains it like this: "When you are trying to reduce the accident 
rate, you have the 'Three Es,' " he said. "Educate, Engineer, and Enforce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enforce -- that's the one being dropped currently." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the Police Department still had a traffic unit, Lalani said, his office 
would tell the police what areas the public was complaining most about and the 
traffic unit would then send officers out to issue tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Turner said, the traffic officers held monthly meetings to 
discuss congestion on the city roads, reckless driving at key intersections and 
what they planned to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 City traffic engineers would attend those meetings and "diligently take 
notes," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 But communication between Ventura traffic engineers and police officers has 
declined precipitously since the traffic unit disbanded in January, both sides 
agreed. Even traffic monitoring within the department has disintegrated since 
former traffic officers were farmed out for general patrol, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, these officers are smeared with a ton of other things to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic safety specialists -- many of whom are former police officers 
themselves -- say that when a police department takes its focus off traffic 
enforcement, accidents do indeed become more frequent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There definitely is a connection" between the number of traffic cops 
patrolling the streets and the number of accidents occurring, said Lloyd 
Turner, a traffic safety consultant with UC Berkeley's Institute of 
Transportation, and a former highway patrol officer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's Cpl. Turner insists that the hobbled enforcement rate will 
eventually translate into more car crashes. The increased accident rate, in 
turn, will cause insurance rates to soar, he concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 John Millan, media relations director for Farmer's Insurance, said the 
relationship between accidents and insurance premiums is not quite so immediate 
and simple. 
</P>
<P>
 If an area's collision rate continues to rise steadily over a period of eight 
to 10 years, he said, then rates will climb. But six months or even a year of 
increase, especially when compared to a steady decline in accidents for the 
last six years, is a "blip" on the statistical horizon, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lalani, however, is not yet convinced accidents are increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly supportive of the police disgruntlement," he said. "They're 
definitely overloaded." 
</P>
<P>
 But traffic collisions are not necessarily rising as a result, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the decline in the accident rate is also over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our program is pretty much finished," he said. "There's not much left we can 
work on. What's happening now is a very strong curve is flattening out." 
</P>
<P>
 And since the economy is picking up again, resulting in people driving more 
than they have been, it may contribute to a slight increase in the accident 
rate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the accident rate can fluctuate month to month, even season to 
season, Lalani said he'd want to see statistics for the whole year before 
making a judgment about the direction the accident curve is headed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury's still out, in my opinion, on where we are in 1994," he said.

TAKING STEPS TO CREATE A COASTAL TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Naturalist Tom Maxwell is preparing for a walk on the beach, an extremely long 
walk. Forty-one miles to be precise. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of August, the 70-year-old Thousand Oaks man plans to set out with 
a group of about 30 to spend five days tracing the entire Ventura County 
coastline, from Rincon Point in the north to Leo Carrillo State Park at the Los 
Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just an idle stroll Maxwell has planned. As the local coordinator of 
the statewide organization Coastwalk, Maxwell and his companions will hike to 
promote Coastwalk's goal: the establishment of a trail running the considerable 
length of California's 1,072 miles of coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like an impossible utopian fantasy? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are huge obstacles to getting it finished," acknowledged statewide 
coordinator Richard Nichols, who has been with the group since its inception in 
the 1970s. "It may be years and years until it is completed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nichols pointed to the 2,638-mile Pacific Crest Trail, which winds through 
mountains and deserts from Canada to Mexico, as an example of just such a 
fantasy come true. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A lthough the idea for the Pacific Crest Trail first came about in the 1920s, 
work on the path did not begin until 1968. The final link of the trail was 
purchased by the federal government in 1993, a full 25 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even Nichols agrees that pioneers of the Pacific Crest Trail had a 
distinct advantage over his group: Their trail runs through miles of desolate 
and difficult terrain, not along the kind of sunny beachfront property that 
everyone from home builders to the Navy wants to claim as their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastwalk became a nonprofit organization in 1983, and has been staging 
coastal walks since then. But this summer will be the first time the hike will 
pass through every coastal county. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols, who will accompany Maxwell and his band of hikers on the Ventura 
trip, said Los Angeles and Ventura are the only two of the 15 California 
counties bordering the Pacific that haven't been hiked in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County was only left out of previous hikes because the group could not 
find a local organizer. But then Nichols heard about Maxwell, a retired Cal 
Lutheran University anthropology professor who knows the county's trails well 
from leading nature hikes for Conejo Valley schoolchildren. And so he asked him 
to take on the task. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they couldn't find anyone else," Maxwell joked. So for the past few 
months, Maxwell has been busy timing himself on different routes along the 
Ventura coast, arranging for permits to enter the Point Mugu and Port Hueneme 
Navy bases and finding guest lecturers to explain the area's history, native 
plants and animals while the group passes by. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning jaunt down Emma Wood State Beach in Ventura, where the 
group will camp on the first night of the hike, Maxwell pointed out a baby sea 
lion stranded on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to find someone to talk about sea lions," he said. "But if I can't 
find anyone, I'll do it myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Toting a weathered leather backpack and clad in hiking boots that look like 
they have been up and down the entire coastline a few times, Maxwell said he 
has already arranged talks by local geologists, history teachers, marine 
biologists and bird experts. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of July, Maxwell went on the Sonoma Coast walk, where the 
first coast walk took place in the 1970s. Many of the walkers on that trip were 
retired people, he said, who have the time to commit to a weeklong walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Hikes along Ventura County's coastline will range from six to nine miles a 
day, over easy to moderate trails, he said. A chuck wagon loaded with tents, 
sleeping bags and food will meet the hikers each night, and participants will 
only have to carry a lunch, water, sunscreen or whatever else they need during 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If someone needs a break from walking, Maxwell said a shuttle will take them 
to the next night's campsite. Between the shuttle and the chuck wagon, the trip 
may border on the luxurious, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bit of an incentive," Maxwell said. "Many people are reluctant to do 
the beach walk as a vacation, even though they'll go to the beach and stay for 
a week at a hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 Though much of the California coastline is beautiful, both Maxwell and Nichols 
stressed that the hikes are about more than enjoying nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole purpose of this in the beginning was to have a vehicle to educate 
people about their right to walk on the beach, their rights to access," Nichols 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the state Constitution technically guarantees that the public can 
use all of California's ocean frontage, gaining access is not always easy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California Coastal Commission, 42% of California's coastline 
is publicly owned, but about 58% is either privately owned or federally 
controlled. In theory, as long as citizens stay to the seaward side of the high 
tide mark, they can gain access to any shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically we say you can walk on the wet sand," said Jack Liebster, spokesman 
for the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the wet sand and sticking to it enables the public to pass by many 
private beach communities, but inside federally controlled areas, the state 
Constitution goes out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At military bases like the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station and the Naval 
Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme, whether the sand is wet or not 
is immaterial. Beach-goers are simply not welcome without permission. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when the Coastwalk group arrives at Point Mugu, they will be 
greeted and transported by bus to Mugu Lagoon to look at wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell plans side trips to McGrath Lake, where 10,000 gallons of crude oil 
spilled after a Bush Oil Co. transfer pipe ruptured last December, and into the 
La Jolla Valley to see how the area burned by November's wildfires has 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will also pass by nesting areas for the endangered least terns and 
threatened snowy plovers. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the most developed areas yield interesting lessons, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something special about being in the place where ocean meets the 
land," Nichols said. "There are qualities about that wherever you are. Relative 
to what man can do to the land, there is little they can do to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, the state Legislature enacted the Coastal Act, which called for a 
continuous trail connecting cities and towns with parks and natural resources 
all along the coast and established the concept of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 But the money to turn the idea into reality has never materialized. Coastwalk 
subsists on small donations and the fees for its walks (about $30 per day, 
including meals). 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols said funds are needed for trail development, construction and putting 
up signs, as well as land purchases and fighting for easements. The closest the 
group has come to realizing its two-decade-old dream is the hope that by next 
year they may be able to put up some signs.

3,000 CELEBRATE COMPLETION OF SATICOY BRIDGE; TRANSPORTATION: PROJECT REROUTES 
CALIFORNIA 118 TRAFFIC AROUND THE COMMUNITY, EASING CONGESTION AND MARKING 
BIRTH OF A NEW DOWNTOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, residents of Saticoy had to live with commuters zigzagging through 
their tiny community on California 118. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came two years of dusty construction work to improve the highway and 
widen the aging, two-lane Saticoy Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, residents celebrated the end of all that as officials marked the 
completion of the project and heralded the birth of a new downtown in the 
unincorporated community. 
</P>
<P>
 After a colorful midmorning parade over the new bridge -- featuring classic 
cars, an old-time steam engine and Chumash Indian rituals -- state and local 
officials congratulated themselves and the residents of Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a new bridge and you have your town back," Ventura County 
Supervisor Susan Lacey told a crowd of about 3,000. "It's been rough going at 
times, but I'm glad we reached this day. It's all been worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many speakers at the dedication ceremony -- including state Sen. Cathie Wright 
(R-Simi Valley) and Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) -- credited 
Lacey with shepherding the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey acknowledged making countless lobbying trips to Sacramento to secure 
funding for the $22-million project from the California Transportation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what helped convince them that we needed this project was when I was 
able to get them to visit and see for themselves," Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the new, realigned route -- expected to carry 32,000 vehicles a day -- 
motorists no longer have to negotiate the often backed-up dogleg that used to 
carry California 118 through Saticoy. Instead, motorists can bypass the 
community on a new stretch of four-lane pavement that sweeps south and west of 
town. Or they can take the former route and cruise through the Old Town 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years of construction have taken a toll on some local businesses, forcing 
relocation or reducing customer flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some businesses that had to move, and others, like mine, had to 
put up with the constant bumper-to-bumper traffic," said Nico Esquivel, manager 
of the Cabrillo Meat Market on Violeta Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might think that our business would have been improved by having so much 
exposure, but there were far more commuters than customers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Masanobu Yeto said the project and subsequent traffic rerouting have caused 
business to decline by as much as a 25% over the last year at his shop, also on 
Violeta Street. 
</P>
<P>
 However, for Zack Samaan, manager of the Kwicki Mart on Los Angeles Avenue, 
the project will eventually be good for business and good for the town, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my customers will have an easier time getting to and from the store," 
Samaan said. "I think what's good for the town will be good for business." 
</P>
<P>
 People weren't the only ones affected by the project. During construction, 
nesting swallows were discovered underneath the 55-year-old bridge. Caltrans, 
working with U. S. Fish & Wildlife specialists, constructed special screens to 
shield the small, rust-colored birds from the work going on above. 
</P>
<P>
 While the merits of the project were debated Saturday, many said the project 
has gone a long way toward establishing a sense of community in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Gomez, chief of the California Highway Patrol's Southern Division, was born 
and reared in Saticoy. He said the project -- with its new traffic signals at 
the eastbound California 126 off-ramp and at Darling Road and Nardo Street -- 
will increase pedestrian safety and make life a bit easier for local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom and dad still live here, so I'm very pleased to see these changes," 
Gomez said. "It's kind of nice that we have signs on the highway pointing here. 
I'm very proud to call this my old hometown."

CREWS BRACE FOR ANOTHER DANGEROUS FIRE SEASON; PREVENTION: AREAS THAT DIDN'T 
BURN IN LAST YEAR'S BLAZES ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE THIS TIME AROUND. 
AUTHORITIES ARE PREPARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Brushy areas of Ventura County that escaped last year's massive firestorms 
have grown even taller and denser, providing fuel for another conflagration as 
the fire season enters its most dangerous period, fire authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, firefighters see evidence that this year's fire season -- which 
continues through November -- may be a busy one. 
</P>
<P>
 Since mid-May, county fire units have responded to 21 brush fires that burned 
a total of 70 acres. Elsewhere, more than 30 major wildfires have broken out in 
eight western states, consuming thousands of acres. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those places that didn't burn last year, the brush has just grown heavier 
and heavier," said acting Ventura County Fire Chief Robert Holaway. "I think 
it's fair to say that some areas, given the right conditions, are very 
explosive right now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Holaway and other county fire officials said they could not predict a 
repeat of last year's cataclysmic firestorms -- conflagrations that together 
burned an estimated 70,000 acres and destroyed more than 38 homes -- they said 
residents should be prepared for a long, hot, extended fire season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some areas in the county where the brush hasn't burned for 50 years," 
Holaway said. "In areas like that, you can see the stuff grow to 12 to 15 feet 
in height -- those are places that we keep an eye on during the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Holaway and county Assistant Fire Chief Bob Roper, who was one of the 
commanders in last year's response to the firestorms, said Wildwood Regional 
Park in Thousand Oaks is particularly vulnerable, given its hills and canyons 
and the fact that many homes lining the park have wood shake roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura foothills, Camarillo Heights and east county areas such as Box and 
Carlisle canyons are also at high risk for wildfires, they said.  
</P>
<P>
 Added to that list is a 200,000-acre chunk of land that runs east from Ojai to 
the Golden State Freeway and generally north of California 126, which is of 
high concern to the U. S. Forest Service, the agency responsible for patrolling 
and managing that remote area. 
</P>
<P>
 A key to whether a given area burns is the amount of moisture in the brush. 
Both county and Forest Service crews are frequently "cooking" samples of brush 
in laboratory ovens to determine how much moisture -- and how combustible -- a 
given area might be. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the fuel moisture level is going down," said Sandi Wells, a County 
Fire Department spokeswoman. "Currently, our samples are showing that the 
moisture level is close to being on par with last year's numbers during the 
firestorms." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ojai area, where the so-called Wheel fire burned 1,650 acres last year, 
Bob Sommer, a battalion chief with the U. S. Forest Service, said his agency is 
not taking any chances and is doubling normal staffing where needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "For instance, we are putting two people in our patrol vehicles -- the idea is 
to get more eyes out there looking for possible (fire) starts," Sommer said. 
"If we see a period of sustained east winds like we did last October, we could 
be in for some real trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The County Fire Department, along with the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department, is forming a specialized version of the Neighborhood Watch program 
to look for arsonists during the height of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, during the times when the winds come, the temperatures soar and 
the humidity drops is when we need people keeping their eyes open," Wells said. 
"We are going to teach them to look for vehicles or individuals that look out 
of place. If something does look weird, we want them to call it in. It's better 
to be safe than sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said the county is recognized across the state for having one of the 
more aggressive fire prevention programs. This year alone, more than 21,000 
brush- or weed-abatement notices have been sent to homeowners demanding that 
they clear at least 100-foot swaths of brush from around structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Chief Roper said county and California Department of Forestry crews 
will not only be cutting brush away from structures but also plan 12 prescribed 
burns of brushy areas during the next five years.  
</P>
<P>
 The schedule is determined by a detailed environmental review of each proposed 
burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe weather conditions must also be present or the burns are canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Roper said that county fire stations in the high-hazard areas will be 
reinforced during the height of the fire season with extra staff, engines and 
water-tenders. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roper said that the situation can become so volatile that even areas that 
burned during last year's fire can burn again, possibly bringing flames to 
unconsumed brush. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen situations where the small light grasses that have grown back in 
burned areas act as wicks to taller, unburned fuel nearby," Roper said. "There 
are some areas, given the right amount of heat and low humidity, where

SWITCH TO L.A. COUNTY ANIMAL CONTROL PAYS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks has slashed its animal control costs by 68% since the city 
spurned Ventura County's program two years ago and hired Los Angeles County to 
deal with barking dogs, forlorn kittens and hungry coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city saved more than $116,000 for the fiscal year that ended in June -- 
enough money to plant 230 potted trees along Thousand Oaks Boulevard or to fund 
the D.A.R.E. drug education program for nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, residents enjoyed better service, including swifter responses to 
emergency calls and a more aggressive dog-licensing campaign, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who used to have to wait weeks for Ventura County to resolve barking 
dog complaints have proved especially grateful for the faster service, 
commending the Los Angeles County officers for promptly picking up dead animals 
stranded by the roadside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really amazing," said Brenda Young, a management analyst who tallies 
complaints and compliments about animal control. "People are very happy that 
their calls are responded to so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic cost savings have also impressed Councilman Frank Schillo. 
</P>
<P>
 In his three terms on the council, Schillo logged countless complaints from 
residents who felt Ventura County animal control ignored Thousand Oaks and 
surrounding neighborhoods. Two years ago, he suggested switching to Los Angeles 
County's department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I dug into it, the more problems I saw (with Ventura County's 
program), mainly a lack of service," Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County officials defended their animal control program, which 
employs 47 workers on a $2.5-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a pretty efficient operation," said Luisa Haskell, the county 
administrative analyst who evaluated the animal control budget this summer. "I 
don't see any fat in the budget at all, to tell you the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' savings "has nothing to do with efficiency," agreed Kathy 
Jenks, who directs Ventura County's Animal Regulation Department. She said her 
department is forced to pass on costs for attorney, administrative, janitorial 
and other services, so the Ventura County bill will always end up higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like apples and oranges," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County program also costs less because its officers have spent 
hours canvassing Thousand Oaks streets to urge residents to license their dogs. 
Each dog license brings in money, and helps defray the costs of running an 
animal control program. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of cash-strapped cities, Ventura County cut its dog-license 
canvassing programming several years ago. The door-to-door campaign costs money 
up-front, and some city officials felt they weren't recouping their investment 
with license fees, Jenks said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the cold budget figures, some Thousand Oaks officials favor the Los 
Angeles County program for warm-fuzzy reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agoura Hills shelter finds homes for 74% of the dogs and 65% of the cats 
picked up in Thousand Oaks, director Bruce Richards said. In contrast, Ventura 
County animal control officers have to destroy nearly half the dogs that pass 
through the Camarillo shelter. Three-quarters of the cats are also put to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards attributes his shelter's high adoption rate to two factors: a cadre 
of dedicated volunteers and a unique program that allows animal lovers to 
introduce their current pets to shelter waifs. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Richards said, Thousand Oaks residents may find it more convenient to 
dash to the Agoura Hills shelter, rather than driving over the Conejo Grade to 
the Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this business 26 years, and I've never known a city that adopts 
more cats than Thousand Oaks," Richards said. "It's like when you move into 
Thousand Oaks, you walk past some kind of a beam and suddenly you love cats."

DAMS, LOSS OF HABITAT MAY WRITE FIN TO PACIFIC SALMON; CONSERVATION: THE SNAKE 
RIVER SOCKEYE IS NOW SO SPARSE THAT IT IS PROTECTED BY THE ENDANGERED SPECIES 
ACT. THREE OTHER VARIETIES ARE THREATENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Pike Street Market, camera-clutching tourists still marvel at the 
"salmon toss" where vendors hurl the glistening fish across aisles to have them 
wrapped for customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Piles of the fabled fish, stacked like cords of wood on ice, give no hint that 
the Pacific salmon is in a state of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got plenty of fish," said Harry Calvo, 46, who has been hawking salmon 
ever since he came back from Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bustle at the market belies the turmoil and urgency that surrounds the 
Northwest's most famous fish. If something isn't done, say environmentalists 
and fishermen, the Pacific salmon might disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska and Canadian salmon still are abundant. But along the Columbia River, 
where once 16 million adult salmon swam each year, it is another story. There 
were only 1.2 million adult Columbia River salmon found last year and most of 
them came from hatcheries. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 2,000 adult salmon made it up the Snake River to Idaho this spring 
and summer, compared to 10 times that number as recently as four years ago, say 
federal fisheries experts. The Snake River Sockeye is now so rare it is 
protected by the Endangered Species Act and three other salmon species are 
classified as threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Northwest without salmon is unthinkable, but now we are on the brink of 
the unthinkable," said Lorraine Bodi, who has followed the decline of Columbia 
River salmon stocks for 15 years as a government worker and now with the 
conservation group American Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Never has the need for revitalizing the salmon been as urgent. 
</P>
<P>
 From Puget Sound to Northern California, salmon fishermen have been confined 
to shore this summer after the government banned salmon fishing along the U.S. 
Pacific Coast to the Canadian border in an attempt to restore stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon still come into Seattle docks from Alaska and Canada, but the Canadians 
recently became so outraged about U.S. fishermen catching too many Canadian 
salmon that they imposed a $1,100 transit fee for fishing boats using Canadian 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Snake and Columbia rivers, a protracted war of words, conflicting 
scientific studies and finger-pointing have hampered efforts to develop a 
salmon-recovery plan. The key question: How to protect the fish from the string 
of hydroelectric dams that are blamed for killing young salmon by the millions 
as they make their way to the ocean each spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a region that has been stung by the emotionally charged conflict between 
loggers and environmentalists over ancient forests and the endangered spotted 
owl, the fight to preserve the salmon has especially difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saving the salmon has immense economic implications," said Sen. Patty Murray 
(D-Wash.). "We have to learn the spotted owl lesson and act together now to 
avoid legal gridlock later." 
</P>
<P>
 But the antagonists have had difficulty getting together. 
</P>
<P>
 They talk of the "Four H's" of salmon recovery: habitat, harvesting, 
hatcheries and hydropower. All share the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no simple solution. Improvements in survival must be made in all 
stages of the salmon's life," said Donald Bevan, the University of Washington 
professor who headed a government-sponsored team of scientists that studied the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists -- and almost everyone else, in fact -- agree that the answer 
rests in better protection for the spawning areas harmed by commercial 
development; in improved hatchery operations so the captive fish do not degrade 
the wild ones; in curbing how many fish are caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there are the dams that have given the Northwest the cheapest 
electricity in the country and have allowed the irrigation of parched 
high-desert land, turning it into profitable farms and orchards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must fix the dams to recover the fish (or) . . . all our other mitigation 
efforts will be in vain." said Bodi, the conservation worker. Environmentalists 
argue that there is no chance for salmon recovery unless reservoirs behind the 
dams are drawn down, allowing the water to flow more rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 But that would require major modifications. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
has maintained that to dramatically draw down four dams on the Snake could cost 
as much as $4 billion. Reducing reservoir levels also would interrupt hundreds 
of millions of dollars in commerce that moves on the waterways and would 
disrupt agricultural irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Columbia River Alliance, which represents industrial and agricultural 
interests that use the river, strongly opposes any drawdowns that interfere 
with river traffic because of the economic impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, federal and state agencies have directed interim measures to 
increase the water flow. The Corps of Engineers has continued its practice of 
transporting by barge millions of young salmon so they avoid some dams. 
</P>
<P>
 The barging has been widely controversial, with the Corps claiming it saves 
salmon, but environmentalists arguing that the fish become so disoriented that 
they lose the "mapping" ability that brings them back as adults to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits of diverting more water from the electricity-producing turbines 
and spilling it over dams to help the salmon also has been in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 After a recent series of dam spills were ordered by the National Marine 
Fisheries Service, scientists at the Bonneville Power Authority maintained that 
the additional water flow may actually harm the salmon. They attribute this to 
the creation of high amounts of nitrogen bubbles that give the fish something 
akin to the bends. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Bonneville, a federally operated provider of wholesale electricity, 
spent nearly $350 million for salmon recovery, compared to $150 million three 
years ago, said Randy Hardy, authority administrator. He suggests these costs 
are certain to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year a federal judge in Portland accused the federal National 
Marine Fisheries Service of not adequately protecting the salmon under the 
Endangered Species Act. Since then, both federal and regional regulatory groups 
have stepped up the pressure to develop salmon-recovery plans. 
</P>
<P>
 No one believes the task will be easy or quick. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no magic solution. There is no technological breakthrough that will 
painlessly solve this problem," Rolland Schmitten of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration told a recent congressional hearing in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodi countered that "our legacy to future generations hangs in the balance. We 
will either be known as the generation that saved the salmon or as the 
generation that let them go extinct."

 Wetlands Tours--Public walking tours of the Bolsa Chica wetlands will be held 
Saturday morning. The tours, sponsored by Amigos de Bolsa Chica, will depart 
every 20 minutes beginning at 9 a.m. The last tour will depart at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Docents will lead talks on various aspects of the wetland's natural and human 
history at stations along the path.Walks generally take about 1 1/2 hours, with 
participants walking from station to station at their own pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall return of shore birds is beginning, and this is a good time of year 
for spotting rarities. Most of the returning shorebirds will still be in their 
bright breeding plumages. The nesting terns are still in residence, noisily 
feeding their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who wish to take part are asked to meet at the ecological reserve 
parking lot on the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway about half a mile south 
of Warner Avenue, across from Bolsa Chica State Beach. The event is free. 
Information: (714) 897-7003. 
</P>
<P>
 At Upper Newport Bay, another free walking tour is planned. The tour, which 
departs at 9 a.m. Saturday, is free and lasts about 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who would like to participate are asked to go to Shellmaker Island off 
Backbay Drive in Newport Beach. The tour is offered by volunteer docents of the 
Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve. Information: (714) 640-6746. 
</P>
<P>
 Bay Bird Counts--The Sea & Sage chapter is seeking volunteers to help with its 
monthly bird counts at Upper Newport Bay. The next count will be Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The census is taken by six teams at low tide and lasts about two to 2 1/2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The count will begin at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>

BILLS CHALLENGE LIMITS ON AIR TANKER USE IN FIRES; FIREFIGHTING: THE MEASURES, 
INCLUDING ONE BY REP. GALLEGLY, WOULD ENABLE AIR NATIONAL GUARD PLANES TO BE 
IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO BATTLE BLAZES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nine months after federal red tape grounded two Air National Guard tankers 
during a rash of wildfires, two bills that would free them from such strictures 
are awaiting action in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills, authored by Reps. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and David Dreier 
(R-Covina), seek to free the Guard's giant C-130 Hercules military transport 
planes to respond immediately to fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the eight C-130s equipped for firefighting can be called out only 
after federal officials have exhausted a list of 40 private operators of air 
tankers -- a requirement of a 1932 act aimed at preventing the military from 
competing with private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of those eight aircraft are based at the Channel Islands 146th Tactical 
Airlift base near Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 Both bills would exempt firefighting efforts from the 1932 act and would also 
direct the U. S. Forest Service -- which coordinates the tankers while fighting 
major brush fires -- to consider establishing an early warning system. Such a 
system would allow the Guard to begin mobilizing against brush fires whenever 
hot desert winds -- known as Santa Anas -- blow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is critical for us to make these changes now, before we again find 
ourselves operating in crisis, hamstrung by flawed resources and bureaucratic 
inefficiency," Gallegly said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Dreier, who represents portions of the San Gabriel Valley near last 
year's Altadena blaze, said the Guard's tankers must be made to respond faster 
when firestorms get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to federal wildfire managers, the existing system works. They 
said the bills would redefine the role of the Guard in wildfires and could 
damage military readiness to transport troops and equipment -- tasks considered 
the Guard's main job. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just public relations firefighting," said Woody Williams, national 
fire mobilization officer at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, 
Ida. "The simple truth is that the Guard's tankers are not designed to be 
initial attack aircraft and they're not all that effective in high-wind 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the government's fleet of 40 contracted private air tankers have 
more modern and more efficient fire retardant distribution systems than the 
Guard's planes, and that those systems operate better in high winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Will, an air service manager for the U. S. Forest Service in Hemet, said 
the delay in getting the C-130s in the air last fall has been overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at the Guard as our ace in the hole," Will said. "The truth is that 
during typical fire seasons they will be used two or three times a year -- 
obviously more during situations like last year." 
</P>
<P>
 But the two tankers based at Point Mugu, along with two Air Force Reserve 
C-130s based in Colorado, flew more than 40 missions last week alone battling 
forest fires in Idaho -- dumping more than 110,000 gallons of chemical fire 
retardant, base officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Col. John Iffland, the Air National Guard's commanding officer at Point Mugu, 
said he would support changing his unit's mission to respond faster to 
wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are certainly supportive of the legislation," Iffland said. "In an 
emergency, you have to fill the breach as soon as you can with all of your 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
 During last year's fires, as the brush-fires crept down the side of a mountain 
not three miles from the Point Mugu base, the two C-130s sat with crews aboard, 
fully ready for launch. The only thing stopping them was the authorizing call 
from Boise and a broken retardant-loading system, which officials said was 
quickly repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting Forest Service authorization, the planes were used to battle the 
blazes that blackened more than 70,000 acres in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly and Dreier said they didn't care about the concerns of fire officials 
in Idaho who oppose their legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The folks in Boise say there's not a problem, but I'd like to see them 
explain that to the people whose homes were burned down last year," Gallegly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Gallegly's position was Ventura County Assistant Fire Chief Bob Roper, 
who said his firefighters could have used the help early on while fighting the 
Green Meadow fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Both bills are pending before the House Agriculture Committee, but no hearings 
have been scheduled. Spokesmen for both congressmen said they hope the bills -- 
probably in a combined form -- will be approved before the current Congress 
adjourns.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; MASONIC GROUP LABORS TO RESTORE HISTORIC GRAVEYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With rakes, hoes and a rumbling skip loader, about 150 members of Masonic 
groups from throughout Ventura County spent Saturday restoring a neglected 
cemetery and unearthing part of Oxnard's past. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the work began, knee-deep ice plant all but obscured century-old plots 
at the Hueneme Masonic Cemetery. Headstones were missing or knocked down. 
</P>
<P>
 But by afternoon, order began to re-emerge at the three-acre graveyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Three dumpster loads of ice plant were hauled off, revealing more than a dozen 
plots containing the grave sites of pioneer families: Saviers, Arnold, Arundell 
and Mahan. The headstones, some weighing hundreds of pounds, were uprighted 
with the help of a skip loader, then cemented in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was in a way like an archeological dig," cleanup organizer Steve Cooley 
said excitedly as he dusted off a headstone from 1899. "You're talking about 
real history here." 
</P>
<P>
 Using a plot map drawn up in 1900 as a guide, the volunteers plan to return in 
coming months to clear off more graves now marked with about 100 wooden stakes. 
Eventually, they want to catalogue all of the names. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hueneme Masonic Cemetery lies between Pleasant Valley and Etting roads in 
south Oxnard, hemmed in by orange groves and a housing subdivision. At the 
center of the cemetery -- where all of Saturday's work took place -- is a 
diamond-shaped open space surrounded by the plots of city founders and early 
settlers of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 One granite marker identifies the grave of Curdin N. Kenyon, who served as a 
sergeant in Company L of the 4th Michigan Cavalry during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the corporation set up to maintain the cemetery, the Hueneme 
Masonic Cemetery Assn., has paid state taxes on the property but has been 
unable to afford its upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's effort began as a community project for Job's Daughters, an 
organization of teen-age girls affiliated with the Masons, Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after seeing the cemetery's deteriorated condition, organizers realized 
the task was bigger than expected and recruited help from all of the county's 
Mason lodges and women's auxiliary groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of mushroomed," Cooley said. "We had no idea what we were getting 
into." JULIE FIELDS

FUZZY FUNGUS OUT ON FOREST SURVIVAL LIMB WITH SPOTTED OWL; ECOLOGY: TO 
CHAMPIONS OF ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT, THE FURRY SANDOZE IN THE NORTHWEST IS AN 
IMPORTANT STRAND IN THE WEB OF LIFE, DESERVING OF PROTECTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Forget spotted owls. To see where the debate over saving America's wildlife is 
heading, spend a day in the woods with ecologist David Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Drive with him deep into the Olympic National Forest, hike through a grove of 
ancient firs, totter the length of a mossy log, and peer, finally, around the 
base of a dead tree to behold . . . the fuzzy sandoze. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fungus. A very odd fungus, with a fruiting body that's furry like a 
bear and sometimes as big, weighing up to 300 pounds. A very rare fungus, known 
from only six sites around the Northwest. And a very intriguing fungus, at 
least to scientists like Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know its life history," Shaw said, kneeling by the half-grown 
specimen he found in 1992. "We don't know if it attacks live roots or strictly 
dead wood. We don't know much about this fungus." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes this fungus an ideal poster child in the campaign for 
ecosystem management, the latest theater in the war over imperiled wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The fuzzy sandoze, one of dozens of cryptic creatures protected under a new 
federal plan to manage Pacific Northwest forest lands, is not particularly 
cute. You can't eat it. You can't build anything with it. 
</P>
<P>
 But to champions of ecosystem management, the fuzzy sandoze is an important 
strand in the web of life, deserving of protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Where land management traditionally starts with a narrow goal -- cutting 
timber, say, or saving a particular wildlife species -- ecosystem management 
takes a broader view. The goal is a sustainable ecosystem, and any human 
activity is supposed to leave enough of the landscape intact to ensure the 
survival of all wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea isn't new. But putting it into practice can be devilishly 
complicated, and there has never been a large-scale attempt to make it work -- 
until now. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to end a three-year deadlock between wildlife protection and timber 
production, the Clinton Administration in April proposed a plan embracing 
ecosystem management across 24 million acres of federal forest land in 
Washington, Oregon and California. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge in Seattle must approve the plan for it to go into effect. He 
is to hear oral arguments Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 What began as an effort to save a single species, the northern spotted owl, 
has evolved into a plan offering sanctuary to an ark full of creatures: salmon, 
sea birds, slugs, snails and, yes, the fuzzy sandoze. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists view the Northwest experiment as a step toward more holistic 
wildlife conservation, an improvement over the species-by-species approach 
fostered by the Endangered Species Act, which is up for reauthorization by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who defend the use of natural resources see something more ominous 
-- a government using analysis to create paralysis, enlisting ever more obscure 
organisms to prevent humans from carving out their own ecological niche. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, then, the forest plan resembles the forest itself -- so big, so 
complex, that what you see depends on what you look for. 
</P>
<P>
 David Shaw is standing now, gazing up at 500-year-old firs and hemlocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "A logger looks at this and sees work," he said. "I see a rich biotic 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, his view didn't count for much in a region where getting big logs 
out of the woods was the paramount concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1991, U.S. District Judge William Dwyer in Seattle granted a request 
by environmentalists to temporarily ban logging across much of the Northwest's 
national forest lands. Dwyer said the government had violated its own laws by 
not assessing logging's effect on the spotted owl, listed in 1990 as threatened 
under the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, when federal officials presented their spotted-owl plan, Dwyer 
rejected it, saying it did not meet National Forest Management Act requirements 
that viable populations of all wildlife be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwyer lifted the ban in June, in response to the government's new forest 
proposal. But the judge said his action did not indicate how he would rule on 
the forest plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: These are busy times for scientists like Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 They roam the forest in force, counting owls and other creatures. They sit at 
computers, using satellite imagery and multilayered, digitized maps to chart 
ecological connections. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's scientific team studied how 10 logging scenarios would affect 
each of more than 1,100 species, from grizzly bears to lichens. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most comprehensive study of its kind ever done. But Shaw says it 
barely scratched the surface of the forest ecosystem, where the bulk of 
biodiversity is made up of tiny, poorly understood organisms. 
</P>
<P>
 A cubic yard of forest soil may harbor 200,000 mites and tens of thousands of 
beetles, centipedes, springtails and spiders. High in the canopy, one spruce 
needle can support a world of fungi, lichen, insects and bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw's curiosity extends to both ends of trees. He got his doctorate in forest 
pathology, specializing in root rots. Now he's leading a federally funded 
project to erect a 285-foot crane that will give researchers a bird's-eye view 
of the old-growth canopy. 
</P>
<P>
 He stumbled across the fuzzy sandoze while scouting sites for the crane. It 
was an exciting moment, he says, and not just because of the novelty of the 
fungus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fuzzy sandoze is important because it's part of the process, not just 
because it's unusual or rare," Shaw said. "There's work being carried out by 
ecosystems, and all the pieces are important." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Late on a Friday afternoon in Portland, Ore., when most people were making 
tracks out of the city, Tom Tuchmann was in his office, pursuing the sticky 
business of turning science into public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want more timber, more recreation, more biological diversity," 
Tuchmann said. "At some point, we have to recognize that we have a limited land 
base, and then start making decisions about how much of each we want." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuchmann, head of the Northwest office implementing the government's new 
forest plan, knows how unpopular those decisions can be. 
</P>
<P>
 He must tell unemployed loggers that the region's annual timber harvest will 
drop to one-fourth of its average during the 1980s. Then he must face 
lawsuit-prone conservationists and try to convince them it's enough to protect 
80% of the remaining old-growth, not 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 What Tuchmann sees in ecosystem management is a way to untie the knot of 
environmental laws and recent court rulings involving the old-growth forest. 
Protect habitat, he says, and you protect wildlife -- including species that 
may be listed as endangered in years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get ahead of the Endangered Species Act," he said. "We feel 
that over time, we will have enough habitat to protect old-growth-related 
species." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups say the government's plan points in the right direction 
but does not go far enough. They're already drawing up new legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's net effect can be put simply -- more federal land for wildlife and 
less for loggers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-six percent of the 24-million-acre planning area is already preserved 
as national park, wilderness or administratively withdrawn areas. The plan puts 
an additional 31% into old-growth reserves, and 11% into riparian reserves that 
will protect every river and stream with a forested buffer up to 600 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the 22% open to logging, the region's familiar checkerboard of 
forested and clear-cut squares will give way to a more careful landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Loggers will have to leave 15% of the trees in every watershed they cut. 
Dozens of rare plants and animals will get special protection wherever they're 
found -- 100 acres around spotted-owl nests, 1.5 acres around the roosts of 
certain bats. 
</P>
<P>
 The fuzzy sandoze will fare especially well. Each specimen will get a 600-acre 
reserve until its needs are better known. 
</P>
<P>
 Bat buffers? Fungus reserves? 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of talk that pushes Myron Ebell's buttons. He works for the 
American Land Rights Assn., which represents private landowners and users of 
public lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebell says the forest plan is part of a "criminal conspiracy" to cripple the 
Northwest timber industry in the name of wildlife protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're able to move ahead, we're going to see similar economic 
dislocations around the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecosystem management, by his definition, is a meaningless abstraction invoked 
by bureaucrats who want to exercise national land-use controls but lack the 
authority to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebell says the current concern over endangered species is overwrought. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nature's not fragile at all," he said. "It's an incredibly resilient thing. 
There are people who say any loss of genetic variety is a disaster, not 
admitting that any gaps are quickly filled by new species." 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists, noting threats such as global warning, say humans have 
made a risky habit of modifying the environment in ignorance. They say that to 
ensure we're not the gap filled by new species, more intelligent tinkering is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are mere mortals trying to play God," said Jim Pissot, Washington state 
representative of the National Audubon Society. "And we need a little more data 
to do that."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; CARJACKING SUSPECT ARRESTED AFTER CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard man suspected of carjacking led police on a high-speed pursuit 
Saturday from Pico Rivera in Los Angeles County to the La Colonia area of 
Oxnard, where he crashed about 15 feet from a house, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators identified the suspect as Jose 
Roman Hernandez, 32. He was arrested by Oxnard police but was being transported 
back to Los Angeles County for booking on suspicion of carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the pursuit, which reached speeds of more than 90 
m.p.h., investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 2 p.m. in the parking lot of a shopping center in 
Pico Rivera, investigators said. An off-duty police officer saw the car run a 
red light as it sped away, and he used a car phone to alert police. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators later learned that a carjacker armed with a screwdriver had 
taken the vehicle from a 32-year-old man at the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase proceeded through Los Angeles and then into Ventura County, where 
the driver exited the Ventura Freeway at Rose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect "was actually driving fairly good until the end," said California 
Highway Patrol Officer R.J. Erikson, who participated in the pursuit and 
arrest. "He was using his turn signals most of the time. There were only a few 
times on the freeway where I thought he was in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Chased by CHP and Oxnard police units, the suspect crashed into an iron fence 
in front of a house at 905 E. Cooper Road about 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard a very loud bang," said Lupe Mendoza, 21, who lives at the house. 
"We looked out and saw this guy had crashed through our gate. He was trying to 
get away but was pinned in the car." 
</P>
<P>

bedroom window. J.E. MITCHELL

 It's just a little friendly competition among bus drivers -- a chance to test 
their skills at maneuvering a 35-foot bus through an obstacle course in record 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty South Coast Area Transit bus drivers will participate in the eighth 
annual Bus Roadeo, which gets under way at 9 a.m. today in the parking lot of 
San Buenaventura State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers will be rated on their ability to maneuver a bus through a 
specially designed obstacle course during a timed race. They will also be 
required to take written tests and perform routine safety checks of their 
vehicles. 
</P>

NATIVE AMERICANS ATTACK HEALTH CARE GAP; MEDICINE: ON THE FRONTIER, ONE 
PHYSICIAN WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR TREATING 30,000 PEOPLE. TODAY, INDIAN HEALTH 
SERVICE WORKS TO IMPROVE CARE. SOME MODERN RESERVATION HOSPITALS INCLUDE 
TRADITIONAL HEALERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Army doctors, trying to stop the spread of smallpox and other contagious 
diseases around frontier forts in the early 19th Century, started vaccinating 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the first federal health service delivered to the tens of thousands 
of Native Americans. "But it was done to protect the soldiers, not the 
Indians," said Patricia A. DeAsis, a Cherokee from Oklahoma, who is 
communications director at Indian Health Service headquarters in Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 When frontier doctor Albert M. Wigglesworth arrived at the Navajo reservation 
in the high desert of northeastern Arizona in 1904, there was no hospital, no 
nurse and virtually no medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the only physician for some 30,000 Indians on a reservation of 16 
million acres -- almost double the area of Connecticut and Massachusetts 
combined," he wrote decades later in his memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lame from an untreated childhood fracture, the young doctor wasn't eligible 
for higher-paying military or U.S. Public Health Service posts. Only the Indian 
Service was open to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doc" Wigglesworth, housed on the reservation at old Ft. Defiance, would 
become the first white "medicine man" to responsibly serve the largest Native 
American tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety years later, the Indian Health Service is still fighting to improve the 
health of Native Americans and Alaska Natives, which continues to lag well 
behind that of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian death rates for seven major causes are greater than those of the 
population as a whole: alcoholism, 438% greater; tuberculosis, 400%; diabetes 
mellitus, 155%; accidents, 131%; homicide, 57%; pneumonia and influenza, 32%; 
and suicide, 27%. Heart diseases and accidents are the two leading killers. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal comprehensive health care program, available to the 1.3 million 
natives belonging to the 547 federally recognized tribes, is provided by 1,100 
doctors, 380 dentists, 2,600 nurses, 100 physician assistants and numerous 
allied health professionals. It operates 42 hospitals and 119 health centers 
and stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed cuts in the $1.8-billion Indian Health Service budget were on the 
agenda last April when 300 tribal chiefs met with President Clinton, the first 
and largest gathering of Indian leaders at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) introduced a bill that would elevate the 
Indian Health Service within the Department of Health and Human Services to a 
policy-making level equivalent to that of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the 
Interior Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Native Americans' struggle with health problems is rooted in some of the 
decades-old diseases and in conflicts between traditional Indian healers and 
modern Western medicine about how to treat them. As a result, DeAsis said, in 
many communities a dual, and often confusing, health-care system persists. 
</P>
<P>
 Navajo medicine men, or "hatathli," at first resented the intrusion of doctors 
like Wigglesworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Navajo children at that time were sent to schools off the reservation. "It was 
a terrible mistake," Wigglesworth wrote, "for they began returning them dying 
of tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was frantic. I had no place to keep them. There is no idea of sanitation in 
the hogans (earthen Navajo dwellings) of their families. I had to stand by and 
see the infection planted. Now we were reaping the harvest. There had been very 
little TB on the reservation earlier. Now it was very common." 
</P>
<P>
 Wigglesworth demonstrated the importance of sanitation. Even today, DeAsis 
said, "construction of sanitation facilities has done the most to save lives on 
the reservations." 
</P>
<P>
 Wigglesworth opened the Navajos' first federal hospital, a 60-bed frame 
building, and the first tuberculosis sanitarium, with 25 beds. He treated 
trachoma, a contagious eye infection that was prevalent among Navajos. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1909 the Public Health Service conducted a trachoma survey of Native 
Americans because of numerous reports of the unusually high incidence of 
blindness among them. It resulted in a U.S. handbook for trachoma control that 
has become a global reference. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1918 flu epidemic, which killed more than a half-million Americans 
and 20 million people worldwide, Wigglesworth and his family fell ill. "I had 
worked day and night with dying Indians and it was bitter cold," he wrote 
later. "I was anointed for death by one of the missionary priests." 
Wigglesworth survived and lived to be 92. 
</P>
<P>
 While modern medicine helped improve the health of Native Americans, it 
diminished the influence of the traditional healer. Within the last two 
decades, DeAsis said, the Indian Health Service has tried to bridge this 
medical gap to enhance healing without interfering with newer treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Indians, the circle of life -- symbolizing birth, growth into adulthood, 
old age, passing on and rebirth -- is sacred and understood across all tribes. 
It is an integral part of the Native American medicine wheel. Wellness is 
harmony and balance among mind, body, spirit and the natural environment. 
</P>
<P>
 In modern medicine, the focus is only on the physical, said J. T. Garrett, a 
Cherokee from North Carolina, who is a traditional healer and a director of 
health care administration at Indian Health Service headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "On my reservation and others, we have a place, a room, in our modern hospital 
for traditional healing," Garrett said. "Our patient bill of rights says that 
you can consult a traditional medicine person and bring in paraphernalia -- 
herbs, teas, crystals, feathers." Traditional healers are regarded as "visiting 
doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 Medicine men and elders of the Navajo Nation provided clues to a mysterious 
epidemic that plagued the Four Corners region of the Southwest last year. 
Rodents were suspected carriers. Pinyon trees had borne their sweet nut all 
year for only the third time this century, the Navajos said. Residents were 
warned to stay away from pinyon trees, frequented by rodents. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the disease was identified as hantavirus and traced to deer mice. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the decades, the Indian Health Service has developed a recognized 
community-oriented public health care model. "Health officials from the Third 
World come to look at what we have," DeAsis said.

REDEVELOPMENT PLAN SPENDING IS RECKLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Oxnard is in the midst of spending a million or two preparing for adoption 
of a Redevelopment Project covering most of the city. By the time the plan is 
drawn, they may not have enough council members who can vote on the proposal. 
Currently, only two councilmen can vote on the matter because of conflicts of 
interest. One of those two is not running for reelection. Gambling with one or 
two million of our tax dollars that they will have to support after Nov. 8 is 
reckless. 
</P>
<P>
 I urged the council to stop the massive spending now and halt activity on the 
plan study until at least after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us question the value of the planned indebtedness of a redevelopment 
project. Statewide, only 22.3% of the tax increment is actually spent on 
projects. The rest of the money goes into debt servicing, interest on the 
loans, administration, consultants, etc. If they were to ask the people of 
Oxnard to approve a bond measure for the contemplated indebtedness of the 
redevelopment project, they know they would be turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bill Carlson, the state lobbyist for redevelopment agencies, the 
city would only get a share of the tax increment, and after the end of the 
project in 45 years. Without a project, a city would get its share of all tax 
increment for property transfers and development. 
</P>
<P>
 During my eight years on the City Council I found that there was very little 
development in the redevelopment project area during poor economic times, no 
matter how much we spent on incentives to encourage developers, so there was no 
increment. 
</P>
<P>
 How Oxnard spends our tax money and how it funnels future tax money is the 
concern of all of us. It is not just a neighborhood issue and needs to be 
discussed at City Council meetings with the public. I urge the City Council to 
stop the spending now and discuss these funding issues.

PUBLIC MISINFORMED ON NEED FOR A DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Weldon Canyon dump initiative backers (mostly out-of-county investors) 
have misinformed the public, saying we need a new dump and that each part of 
the county can have a local dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain citizens like the idea of a neighborhood dump serving west Ventura 
County, but times have changed.The Supreme Court has ruled that trash disposal 
is like any business and that government cannot force private trash dumps to 
serve only a certain area. The privately owned neighborhood dump is a thing of 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't we need a new dump? Because of greatly increased recycling Ventura 
County's need for trash dumps has been greatly reduced. There are actually too 
many trash dumps in this part of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Where will western Ventura County's trash go? Very soon, more than half of 
this trash will be recycled and composted at the two large recycling centers 
being built in Ventura and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Where will the trash go that is not recycled? This decision will be made by 
cost and contracts just like any business. The companies that run trash dumps 
in Los Angeles County near Ventura County and two out-of-state dumps are 
fighting for unrecycled west county trash by lowering their dumping fees. This 
trash will go to dumps outside of Ventura County because the fees there are 
much cheaper than dumping at Simi or a Weldon dump. It is simple economics.

SCHOOL SYSTEM SHORTCHANGES PUPILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a parent becoming uneasy about the increasing problems in our schools, I 
was astounded when I attended my first Ventura County school board meeting. I 
saw John McGarry, board president, deftly spare the board the inconvenience of 
listening to public concern about the appearance of impropriety by Supt.Charles 
Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, I heard Weiss confidently inform a person that the superintendent 
of schools is accountable to no one concerning dismissal of personnel and that 
people bothered by the apparent political retribution against Dan Flynn simply 
have incorrect information. 
</P>
<P>
 John McGarry and Weiss share an attitude toward the public which I am 
confident will be displaced as more people become aware of the education mafia 
that has established itself in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Although McGarry and Weiss are doing their part to demonstrate problems at the 
county level, they are only elements of a larger problem in California schools. 
We need to transform an education establishment that feeds on the public and 
shortchanges our children.

WARNING ISSUED ON BOGUS $20 BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A rash of counterfeit $20 bills are circulating in Oxnard and Ventura, and 
police expect more of the forged cash to turn up in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police are warning all businesses and customers to check the cash they 
receive for telltale signs that give away the otherwise successful copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would probably accept it, I would probably accept it," said Detective Len 
Newcomb of the Oxnard Police Department's white-collar crime unit. "Unless you 
look at them really carefully, they're good copies." 
</P>
<P>
 An Oxnard fast-food restaurant first discovered the forgery Monday after 
running a scanner over two $20 bills turned in at the drive-through window, 
Newcomb said. The restaurant, which police declined to name, gave the bogus 
money to Oxnard police. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the week, the U.S. Secret Service came across a pile of the bad cash 
in Ventura, Newcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills, all of them in the 1985 series, bear "C3" on the front and the 
number "259" on the back. Some show the serial number "J24291768A," though this 
can be changed, police said. The bills also lack the fibers that can be seen on 
genuine currency. 
</P>
<P>
 This series of counterfeit bills first surfaced in Los Angeles in March and 
again in Reno and Texas in June, Newcomb said. The first sighting in Ventura 
County came Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police expect more bills to turn up in the county. "That's based on trends, we 
don't have any inside information," Newcomb said. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

YOUTH, 16, SEVERELY BEATEN BY CROWD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old Oxnard boy was beaten severely Saturday afternoon by a crowd of 
several dozen youths who attacked him and his girlfriend in a park after a 
brief exchange of words, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose name was not released, suffered a head injury and possible 
skull fractures.He was on a respirator and listed in serious condition late 
Saturday at St. John's Regional Medical Center, according to police and a 
nursing supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's 16-year-old girlfriend was bruised and cut, but not seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred about 3:50 p.m. at Via Marina Park in west Oxnard. 
Police learned of the attack when an anonymous caller reported that 30 people 
were fighting, Sgt. Cliff Troy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old girl told detectives that she was sitting with her boyfriend 
and another friend when a carload of youths drove by and yelled something to 
the 16-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief exchange, the suspects got out of their car and walked toward 
the couple, where more words were exchanged. The suspects were then joined by 
another crowd of male and female youths who together attacked the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived, they found the 16-year-old boy crumpled in a yard 
across the street from the park, unconscious and bleeding slightly. He was 
taken to the hospital by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they have few leads on the suspects, who fled the scene in two 
cars before officers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy said the assault was possibly related to a series of violent incidents in 
the past month involving Oxnard gangs. JULIE FIELDS

CULT LEADER'S RETURN TO L.A. FOR TRIAL DELAYED; COURTS: TONY ALAMO FACES 
CHARGES OF CHILD ABUSE. HE IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN MEMPHIS FOR MONTHS, 
APPEALING A TAX CONVICTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new lawyer hired by cult leader Tony Alamo following his conviction for 
federal tax violations in Memphis, Tenn., told a judge that it will be months 
before the evangelist returns to Los Angeles to face child abuse charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Appeals in the federal case will keep Alamo, 59, the flamboyant leader of the 
Saugus-based Holy Alamo Christian Church, in Memphis for at least six more 
months, and "probably longer," attorney Susan James told Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge William Pounders on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo's church started as a street ministry in the 1960s and earned millions 
of dollars in later years through communes and church-owned businesses. In the 
latest of several legal battles, Alamo was convicted June 8 of falsifying his 
1985 income tax returns and failing to file returns for the next three years. 
He is scheduled to be sentenced in the federal case Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo is charged in Los Angeles with ordering four men via telephone to strike 
Jeremiah Miller, then 11, 140 times with a large paddle in 1988 at the Saugus 
church. But pretrial proceedings were interrupted when federal officials 
arrested Alamo in April.  
</P>
<P>
 Alamo, whose real name is Bernie Lazar Hoffman, faces up to six years in 
prison and a $550,000 fine in the federal case. He remains in custody pending 
sentencing and the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, he is charged with felony child abuse and inflicting corporal 
injury on a child. If convicted on those charges, Alamo could receive up to 12 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John Asari said he would like to bring Alamo to Los Angeles 
following his sentencing in the federal case. But he said discussions with 
James started Friday to seek "an ending other than a trial" on the child abuse 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Asari said the prosecution's willingness to offer a plea bargain, or dismiss 
the case altogether, might depend on the sentence Alamo receives in the federal 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 A status conference on the abuse case is scheduled Sept. 26. Asari said the 
frequent delays might cause problems at trial, another reason he might be 
willing to negotiate an ending to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, it harms or hinders the prosecution," he said. "I think witnesses 
tend to forget things, or they become frustrated, and that's something we will 
certainly take into account while we're deciding what course of action to 
take." 
</P>
<P>
 James said Alamo has expressed no interest in a plea bargain, although she 
will continue to keep options open. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo fired Tulsa, Okla., attorney Jeffrey Dickstein following the 
evangelist's conviction on tax charges. James, a Montgomery, Ala., attorney, 
declined to speculate on the reason for the change in attorneys, except to tell 
Pounders, "Mr. Alamo has wanted a change of counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 Dickstein could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo and his wife, Susan, founded the Holy Alamo Christian Church in the 
1960s, taking in young dropouts and drug users off Hollywood streets and giving 
them food, shelter and anti-Catholic sermons. During the next two decades, the 
church prospered, especially with earnings from glitzy clothing such as 
rhinestone-studded jackets that sold for as much as $600 in fancy boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Alamo died of cancer in 1982 and her body was placed on display in the 
Alamos' Arkansas mansion for several weeks after she did not rise from the dead 
as rumored. Her body was stolen from a marble mausoleum in 1991 and has not 
been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Alamo has since married eight of his followers, including one woman who 
already had a husband, and at least two 15-year-old girls. 
</P>
<P>
 The church is still operating in Saugus and led, to the extent possible, by 
the imprisoned Alamo, said Don Sweat, a church volunteer at Friday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Alamo's religious convictions have not been dampened by the years of 
legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more persecution he endures, the more resolute he gets," he said.

STORY ON SHELTER NEEDS CLARIFICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was dismayed at the manner in which my comments were characterized in your 
recent front-page article ("Shelters for Disadvantaged Arouse Fierce 
Opposition," July 25). The article implied that I said that there was little 
cause for celebration regarding the opening of Orange County's first homeless 
shelter for the mentally ill, Beacon House. I said or implied nothing of the 
sort. Furthermore, I never said, as stated in the article, that restrictions 
placed on the project by the county led to only the provision of 12 beds. Allow 
me to clarify. 
</P>
<P>
 As I told the reporter, the problem lies in the fact that nowhere in Orange 
County does there exist a zoning designation for transitional or emergency 
housing. Thus, service providers must go through the conditional use permit 
process, which provides the opportunity for public comment and mandates 
governing officials to strongly consider the community's objections (no matter 
how uninformed) to such projects. This leads to delays in construction or 
rehabilitation of properties as well as, at times, restrictions on the number 
of beds and types of services that can be provided at the site. The Times' 
characterization of my comments represents a simplistic interpretation of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 On any given night in Orange County, 12,000-15,000 men, women and children are 
homeless. The resolve and determination on the part of service providers like 
Episcopal Service Alliance to subject themselves to this long, frustrating 
process is a testament to their commitment to ending this unnecessary tragedy, 
and their subsequent success, is cause for great celebration. The point I made, 
which was sadly overlooked, was that service providers shouldn't have to be 
subjected to a seven-year process to increase the stock of shelter beds in the 
county by 12 or 100 beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Any information that I provided regarding the specific experiences of service 
providers was intended only to point in the direction of those providers for 
the purpose of interviewing them. I had no intention of speaking for them and I 
should not have been quoted in their stead.

YOUNG MARINES TEACH RESPECT, LOYALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I have been a member of the Tustin Young Marines for over one year, and I am 
11 years old. The Young Marines ("The Corps Curriculum," July 10) have helped 
me learn a lot of good things.I have learned the proper ways to show adults 
that I respect them. I have gained a lot of confidence in myself. I am in 
better physical shape because I know how to take care of my body. I also know 
that I have to do good in school. 
</P>
<P>
 At the National Encampment, we did see how the U.S. Marine Corps does some 
things, but we never participated in the demonstrations. We did not carry guns 
or learn how to kill each other. We did participate in physical training to 
keep our bodies in good condition; we were encouraged to always show respect to 
all people and to keep ourselves drug-free. We also went to Sea World just to 
have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The Young Marines teach us as leaders to use our knowledge and judgment to 
make the best decisions. We are also taught to be honest, courageous, 
dependable, tactful, fair, unselfish and loyal. This is why the Young Marines 
are a good alternative to gangs.

SMOKING BAN BASED ON BAD SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times' quote from me on the smoking ban was seriously out of context in 
both the July 8 article ("Strong Statewide Ban on Smoking Sent to Wilson") and 
the July 9 editorial ("The Showdown Over Smoking"). 
</P>
<P>
 What you left out of both pieces was the pseudo-science behind the crusade 
against secondhand smoke, which, as I said on the floor of the Assembly, is why 
the AB 13 ban is "based on a lie." 
</P>
<P>
 If and when it's proven that limited exposure to secondhand smoke is a health 
risk, I'll be the first to call for an outright ban on smoking in public. In 
contrast to thousands of studies that together proved that smoking itself is 
definitely harmful to health, an EPA decision to declare secondhand smoke a 
harmful carcinogen is based on a few studies. 
</P>
<P>
 What's worse, the EPA took these 17 studies and used a highly questionable 
method, in which radically different data are "merged," and claimed the result 
was "equivalent" to repeatable, scientific results. The scientific community 
has been unanimous in its denunciation and declaration that this kind of 
analysis is of limited use at best. It never should be relied on as a basis for 
public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a nonsmoker, I'm as annoyed by secondhand smoke as the next guy. But if 
smokers can have their rights taken away through pseudo-science, so can other 
minorities. The AB 13 smoking ban is another serious assault on individual 
liberty and a giant power grab by "government as nanny."

INS TEST HAD 2 WRONG ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Of the six sample questions from the INS Citizenship Examination ("How Well 
Would You Do?" July 18), two have incorrect answers. There are now 27 
amendments to the United States Constitution, and while the House of 
Representatives has 435 seats, Congress, which includes the House and the 
Senate, has 535 (plus five non-voting delegates, one each from the District of 
Columbia and four American territories). 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the people teaching the citizenship classes are doing a better job than 
the people writing the INS examination.

ANAHEIM STADIUM IS SADLY OUT OF DATE; CITY, ANGELS SHOULD THINK ABOUT A 
REPLACEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fashions change in architecture as surely as in clothing. When Anaheim Stadium 
opened in 1966 as the home of the California Angels, it seemed a magnificent 
ballpark. All that new paint, that glistening concrete, that open space beyond 
the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the stadium is mocked as an example of the "concrete doughnut" style of 
stadium architecture. It is still clean, still well-run, but somehow dowdy, 
especially when compared with the new ballparks that opened in Baltimore, 
Cleveland and Arlington, Tex., in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 City-owned Anaheim Stadium lost a lot of its charm when the spaces beyond the 
outfield were filled in to create more seats for the Rams, the football team 
that moved to the stadium in 1980. Now the ballpark has 69,000 seats. With the 
Angels drawing about 20,000 per home game, the acres of empty seats become a 
depressing sight. Those at the game find it more difficult to be enthusiastic 
when their nearest neighbors are several aisles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Rams are considering moving, and Anaheim city officials have devoted 
time to the not-so-promising cause of seeing what it would take to get the team 
to stay. Their concern has worried Angels' executives, who feel slighted and 
can make a persuasive argument for improving the terms of their lease. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no discussions yet, and even the floating of ideas is at a 
preliminary stage. Of course, were the Angels a better team, the crowds would 
be bigger and the complaints fewer. But even then, both sides would be right to 
consider a major renovation of the current stadium. Perhaps better, should the 
Rams decide to stay, would be to let them use the current stadium and to build 
a new one for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 A new stadium would be an asset for the region, and is at least worth thinking 
about. There is room next to Anaheim Stadium for another ballpark, but the 
problem is how to pay a bill estimated at $100 million or more. Private funds 
might be required, with the Angels or other investors kicking in some money. In 
the case of a public-private partnership, there are ways for the city to find 
funds. One would be a sale of bonds, paid off by revenues generated by a new 
stadium. Surcharges on parking or tickets could be another money-raiser. A 
third source of funds could be rents from luxury boxes, those pricey private 
clubs where more business than baseball is discussed. Such fund-raising has 
proved successful at other major league ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential source of money would be increases in tax revenue from any 
new development on or around the stadium property, since the City Council this 
month declared the stadium and parking lot a redevelopment project. That 
designation, the result of the January earthquake's damage to the stadium 
scoreboard, could provide more tax money for stadium improvements or 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Also worth consideration is creation of a sports and entertainment center to 
link Anaheim Stadium, The Pond of Anaheim and a football stadium with 
Disneyland and the convention center, and perhaps adding a retail center 
similar to CityWalk in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have a long history in Orange County and have worked hard to become 
a part of the community -- certainly harder than the Rams have. Anaheim is 
right to explore ways to keep the team happy while being careful not to break 
the city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' lease with Anaheim expires in seven years, but given the long time 
needed to renovate or build stadiums, the team and the city should start 
talking soon about their plans and how to finance them.

GETTING TO THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM; STOPPING SPILLS BEFORE THEY TAINT OCEAN 
MAKES MORE SENSE THAN SIMPLY REACTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County at times seems remarkably slow to reckon fully with all the 
implications of ocean pollution. The water is a resource around which so many 
other things depend that make this a special place to live and visit. And yet, 
as we have noted in previous years, closed beaches and fouled water too often 
have been regarded as part of the cost of having runoff from the newly 
developed South County communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, it appears now that some local officials are getting fed up 
enough that they aren't going to take it anymore, to paraphrase the famous line 
from the movie, "Network." Three Laguna Beach City Council members have asked 
for public hearings before the Aliso Water Management Agency, the regional 
agency for waste and water districts that serves a number of nearby 
communities.  
</P>
<P>
 These officials rightly want to know why more can't be done to stem the 
pollution problems arising from urban runoff at the mouth of Aliso Creek, which 
is part of a drainage basin from inland cities.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a good question, and it was encouraging to see the general manager of the 
South Coast Water District, the agency with jurisdiction at the mouth of the 
creek, acknowledge that ocean quality in the area is poor and that better 
efforts are called for. There are a number of components, including recycling 
more water, finding new drainage alternatives, and increasing public awareness 
of the consequences of careless dumping into inland drainage systems that later 
end up in the ocean.  
</P>
<P>
 During the winter, rainfall almost routinely is followed by spills that close 
beaches and threaten wildlife. Although heroic efforts often have been made in 
the past in South County to fix broken pipes once the damage is done, it is 
necessary to be more anticipatory in order to cut down on spills before they 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the popular Aliso Beach was closed for what appeared to be an 
interminable amount of time. In June of this year, a one-mile stretch of the 
beach had to be closed after 16,000 gallons of partially treated sewage spilled 
into the creek and flowed into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, living with the prospect of spills as a way of life needs to be 
changed.  
</P>
<P>
 The concern of the local officials suggests a welcome willingness to take more 
direct action to prevent such problems. Cooperation between local 
representatives and the responsible agencies can be an effective start in 
heading off future problems, and changing the way people think about ocean 
pollution.

LISTENING TO SWEET SOUNDS OF HARMONY; PACIFIC AMPHITHEATRE STRIKES PEACE CHORD 
WITH NEIGHBORS BY LOWERING DECIBEL LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The music emanating from the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa this month may 
not have amounted to the sounds of silence, but it was a lower-decibel, more 
eardrum-friendly medley of country, rock and rap that left the neighbors 
largely in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The amphitheater, on the grounds of the Orange County Fair, began hosting 
concerts in 1983, and the following year nearby residents began filing lawsuits 
claiming the music violated a county ordinance limiting noise. After years of 
trying to compromise, the fair wound up buying the amphitheater last year and 
promising to turn the volume down. It was a needed gesture on the good-neighbor 
front, and it appeared to have survived its first test this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there was a concert earlier this year, the 17-day run of the annual 
fair provided the first consistent test of the new noise limits, providing a 
bill of musical fare each night. Fair officials wisely decided to put the lawn 
area of the theater off limits. That cut the capacity from 18,500 to 8,500, but 
it meant there was no need to boost the amps to make the music reach the lawn. 
To be sure the decibel level was not violated, a specially hired monitor kept 
tabs on the sound engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another smart move was halting the concerts by 9:30 p.m. Fair officials said 
some neighbors called to point out they could hear the music, even at lower 
levels, but were happy to have it end early. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair can use lessons learned this year to book events next year, perhaps 
even hiring a management company to promote a full season of music before and 
after the fair's 17 days. With 8,500 seats, the Pacific has 2,000 more seats 
than the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, another nice place to listen to a 
concert beneath the stars. As the Neville Brothers and Queen Latifah, Vicki 
Carr and Tim McGraw showed, there is no reason why good music and peaceful 
neighborhoods cannot coexist.

COST OF REPLACING COYOTE IS PROHIBITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The report (that) a coyote had attacked a dog in the Upper Newport Bay area 
came as I was about to walk on the trail that passes the YMCA on its way to 
Jamboree Road. In less than 30 minutes I saw more rabbits and squirrels than I 
have seen in many years. Nature's population control is provided by the coyote, 
I wondered why a coyote would bother a dog when plentiful and more natural food 
was readily available. 
</P>
<P>
 The coyotes are important to us. Think of the problem local governments would 
have if they were to take over the job that coyotes willingly do. (Arguing 
about territory with a dog is not one of the coyote's natural activities.) I am 
talking about their job of controlling the squirrel and rabbit population. The 
authorities would need to train people to destroy only the weak or witless of 
the squirrel or rabbit population. After all, we don't want to destroy all the 
squirrels and rabbits. Then a supervisor is needed to see that the people do 
their job correctly, and then a department head would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 What would it cost for people to do the job the coyotes are willing to do for 
us? If 10 people for each city are needed to do the job, (there is) the salary 
and fringe benefits, and also insurance for lawsuits. All told, $1 million a 
year might get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the job is done, then a new set of people would be needed to control the 
vegetation growth, formerly done by the rabbits and squirrels. Of course there 
is also the cost for buying and spreading fertilizer no longer provided by the 
squirrels and rabbits.  
</P>
<P>
 Where is this to end? A solution is needed. There have been no reports of 
coyotes attacking a dog when the dog is accompanied by a person with a "doodoo 
bag." This new weapon has yet to be evaluated by the coyotes. This may be one 
solution. Another may be to provide the dog with a fence for its protection.

IN-LINE SKATING ACCIDENTS ARE RARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am concerned about the title and tone of the July 17 editorial on Irvine's 
plan to build a youth facility for in-line skaters. The title "Roller Rink Idea 
Is In Line With Safety -- Innovative Irvine Allocates Fund for Youth Facility 
to Put Brakes on Street Skating" indicts in-line skating as being dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 My in-line skating experience has never required more than 1) average common 
sense, 2) knowledge of bicycling road rules and 3) wrist guards. A serious 
accident is very rare and is usually the consequence of insufficient experience 
or stupid bravado. (No one can protect stupid people from hurting themselves.) 
</P>
<P>
 Many in-line skaters (myself included) have logged thousands of miles over the 
years in heavily congested streets, highways and bike paths without incident 
for years. Some of us are in our 40s, and we are not reckless "thrill seekers." 
The draw is to harmless fun, excellent exercise, fresh air, companionship, sun 
and an alternative means of transportation during the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 In-line skating can include generations of family members in one group 
activity. In the course of five years of in-line skating experience and my 
former work as an accident investigator for nearly 10 years, my overall 
assessment of the in-line urban skating practices of California adolescents, 
children, and adults is very positive. I see more responsible behavior here 
than I do on the ski slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 The young woman who was observed "flying down an Irvine street" may have been 
in full control of her skates and had excellent command of her situation -- as 
much as the most experienced bicyclist on that same path. There is no problem 
here that requires government attention.

MARINES DESERVE DECENT HOUSING

 * So, the swells in San Clemente don't want the grubby Marines to live next to 
their ritzy houses ("It's a Marine Landing of Sorts -- and the Neighbors Don't

 We have lived on both coasts and witnessed before this attitude of "after I 
get mine everybody else can go hang." It must be some defect of human nature.

Americans, especially from those who are their neighbors.

CHARTER SCHOOL IDEA TO BE PUT TO TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I commend you for your editorial "A New Hope for Ailing Schools" (July 14). 
</P>
<P>
 Charter schools empower parents and teachers to provide the best learning 
environment for their students, unfettered by rules and regulations designed by 
people unfamiliar with the unique student population served locally.Charter 
schools are a challenge to parents and teachers and require a dedication and 
commitment to success that demands many hours of hard work and full cooperation 
among school site personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 During the education hearing at the Marian Bergeson Elementary School earlier 
this year, there was a presentation on the charter school concept and the most 
frequently asked question was "When will Orange County have a charter school?" 
</P>
<P>
 I am pleased to know the answer to that question. Santiago Middle School in 
Orange will have the first opportunity in Orange County to showcase this new 
form of school-based management -- a concept contained in a bill I authored 
successfully a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish the Santiago Middle School community, students, parents, faculty and 
staff the very best success in this challenge and look forward to following its 
search for excellence.

TEACHERS' REPUTATIONS, STUDENTS' FUTURES HURT IN GRADE-CHANGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I've read quotes in the media with dismay that the alleged grade changes at 
Brea Olinda High School are a "problem that started in the math department" and 
it is "a practice started by math teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Just to set the record straight, there is no problem with teachers assigning 
grades. That is what we are supposed to do, and that is how the system 
functions. The courts have affirmed this many times; the teacher is deemed the 
expert and the grade can only be invalidated under very special circumstances 
(incompetence, error, etc). Also, there is a written policy regarding pass-fail 
grades at Brea Olinda: The student is to contract with the teacher in the first 
six weeks if he or she is to be allowed this option. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if a teacher's assigned grade has been changed without his 
or her consent or knowledge, then that is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 I and my colleagues in the math department are proud of our efforts and our 
students' SAT, CLAS, AP and Golden State Scores and feel that we are one of the 
reasons our school was given Distinguished School Recognition (a state award) 
and a Blue Ribbon Award (a national award) recently. I can assure you that we 
did not "start" any improprieties such as changing each other's grades. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * I am absolutely appalled that as educators of our youth the employees of 
Brea Olinda High School would even think of changing transcripts for students 
to boost grade-point averages or help students go to college. Who are they 
helping? Certainly not the student. Does it help someone or foster 
responsibility to make it easy? 
</P>
<P>
 We talk about our youth of today not taking responsibilities: No one will if 
they don't have to. It's the fault of people such as these educators. If that 
were my child, he or she would go back to school and do it until it was right, 
however long it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduating students ill-prepared for college or life is a disservice to our 
society and to them personally.

<P>
 * I want to express my complete disgust about your coverage of the grade 
changes at Brea Olinda High School. I have taught English there for many years 
so am concerned about the reputation of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Even given my bias for the school, why are you continuing to give such 
prominent coverage to this issue? The article in the paper July 27 is 
headlined, "Brea Olinda Graduated Some Who Lack Credits." This information was 
contained in an article in June. No information was available for this article 
that was not available for the article yesterday. Old information was given 
again in a different order. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are discussing the graduation requirements, why is there no information 
that we require for graduation 40 more units than required by the state and 
more units than most county schools? There are local high schools for whom 
these students would have completed all their graduation requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 I am very proud of the academic record of Brea Olinda High School. I hope that 
you will decide that you do not have to continually repeat your coverage of our 
grade problem, especially when there is no new aspect of the case to cover. 
</P>

<P>
 * As a graduate of the old, unimproved Brea Olinda High School, ostensibly 
years in advance of what has thus far come to light in the still-developing 
grade-change story, I can say with emphasis that I am not in the least 
surprised. And I will continue to be overwhelmingly unsurprised as further 
investigation reveals more wide-ranging details. The uniformly shocked demeanor 
of the assorted staff represented in the several articles on the subject 
strains the limits of credulity to an amusing degree. 
</P>
<P>
 While this jellybean gangsterism surely goes on at more schools than not, I 
have to smirk when I read names I recognize from my own seemingly interminable 
tenure at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 No big-deal corrective measures are to be anticipated -- no mass firings, 
certainly no one taking responsibility or admitting complicity.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON TRANSPORTATION; TRANSIT CENTER IS A WIN-WIN 
PROJECT FOR THE PUBLIC AND DISNEY; IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT ORANGE COUNTY RECEIVE 
ITS FAIR SHARE OF FEDERAL FUEL TAXES FROM ITS 2 MILLION VEHICLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARAH L. CATZ, Sarah L. Catz is the public member on the board of directors 
of the Orange County Transportation Authority. She also serves on the Southern 
California Regional Rail Authority (Metrolink). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority has a reputation for being 
innovative and responsive. As the public member on the board of directors, I 
receive many compliments on our creativity. This creativity, however, is 
sometimes the cause of misunderstanding and criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 A case in point is how some members of the public and the media view OCTA's 
proposed intermodal transportation center, which is to be located near the 
planned Westcot expansion of Disneyland in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately this proposed project has been captured in newspaper headlines as the 
"Disney Garage." After a thorough analysis of this project, I can genuinely say 
that support of the proposed intermodal transportation center is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA's intermodal transportation center project is entirely about public 
transit. The center will provide a linkage between local buses, express buses, 
proposed urban rail, commuter rail, airport shuttles, local area shuttles, car 
pools and van pools at a single, centralized location at one of the most 
important activity centers in the Orange County region. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will also include a state-of-the-art traffic control and operations 
center, 1,000 parking spaces for park-and-ride and intermodal use and 11,000 
paid public parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Above and beyond this, the project creates a means for sustainable revenue to 
support public transit. An initial investment of $32 million by OCTA is 
expected to generate $7 million to $9 million annually, above the costs of 
running the parking operation. The entire revenue will be invested by OCTA in 
public transit that will serve all parts of Orange County -- not just Anaheim. 
Knowing that we will be receiving this revenue each year will be of vital 
importance in planning the purchases and operations of commuter buses to help 
keep Orange County moving. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is a public-private partnership among the Orange County 
Transportation Authority, the city of Anaheim, the state of California and the 
Walt Disney Co. The project meets the objectives spelled out in recent laws 
that promote intermodalism and public-private partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 For a public-private partnership to work, there has to be a benefit to both 
parties. Disney is not giving away this money-making opportunity for nothing. 
The intermodal transportation center would be built with an investment of 
public money, but Disney's share would be approximately $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons of Disneyland and of the proposed Westcot Center, if built, will 
undoubtedly use the intermodal transportation center, as will other visitors to 
the Disneyland and Convention Center area in Anaheim. But mere use of the 
intermodal transportation center by Disney visitors would not give Disney 
ownership. The facility will be publicly owned by the OCTA, and all the revenue 
would be sustained by the OCTA. 
</P>
<P>
 The key aspect to making the project work is federal financing. There would be 
a major involvement of $131 million of federal capital. These funds come from 
the federal gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to this project, Orange County had never received a dime from these 
transit funds. 
</P>
<P>
 It is about time that Orange County receive its fair share. There are 2 
million motor vehicles registered in Orange County, and Orange County is a 
major producer of federal gas and diesel tax. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time the intermodal transportation center project was created, Disney 
was seeking federal funds for transitway connectors near the proposed Westcot 
project. And OCTA was in the process of preparing a $318-million federal 
transit-way grant request. The application was for transitway connectors 
joining high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes on the Costa Mesa (55) and San Diego 
(I-405) freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The 55-405 project, proposed to be 75% federally funded, also included $131 
million for the purchase of several hundred commuter buses to use the Orange 
County HOV-transitway network and park-and-ride facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA's new proposal was to invest the $131 million for buses and park-and-ride 
facilities in the intermodal transportation center and parking facility, 
creating two projects for the price of one and developing ongoing revenues 
decades into the future to buy commuter buses and keep them operational. 
</P>
<P>
 These commuter buses will use a high-occupancy vehicle system of car-pool 
lanes and transitways that is second to none in the nation and already includes 
three direct HOV-lane connectors at the El Toro Y, the 55-5 freeways, and the 
5-22-57 freeways, funded by our half-cent sales tax, Measure M and state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is great concern that Disney drives a hard bargain and might gain 
inordinate benefit amounting to a giveaway of public funds, it is actually the 
OCTA that has made a good bargain. This project is truly a win-win not only for 
OCTA and Disney, but also for the people of Orange County.

'BOOKS' OF FUTURE WILL SPEED LEARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Kudos is due your paper for publishing responses (Letters, July 17) to my 
ideas on future libraries. I am sorry that my point seemed lost in the warm 
sentiments for books. The crucial issue: There are mediums developing at a 
rapid pace that improve one's ability to learn, be entertained and satisfied. 
An electronic travelogue that offered a full motion video of Paris might not be 
preferable to walking the streets of Paris, but it might be more accurately 
illustrative of Paris than a paper brochure (a mini-book?), even with photos 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 I have the utmost respect for books. They have given me some of my greatest 
moments of pleasure and learning; but things are changing. Some relevant facts: 
Comprehension levels greatly improve when students see videos or movies 
demonstrating principles or functions being learned. Think about it this way. 
If you were reading a history "book" about the Civil War and on the pages that 
describe the various battles (in words) you could touch a spot on the page and 
see the battle(s) taking place in full motion, full color, video, with sound, 
would your experience of the subject be enhanced? The professors of history 
writing in the journal History Microcomputer Review, which deals with 
interactive learning programs in the teaching of history in North American 
schools, think so. 
</P>
<P>
 The transition that printed books served took man from the era of limited 
information to the nearly universal access to information arriving at our 
doorstep now. As a society in a competitive world we need to learn how to learn 
much more a lot faster. Access to our new forms of "books" is of critical 
importance. Their characteristics will make people smarter, faster. Who will 
not want this for themselves or at least for their children?

 Somewhere out there is the future president of the United States. He's 12

 Curtailing the hours he can get to the library or possibly closing the branch 
he can get to is not the way to build his education. 
</P>
<P>
 We deserve better than this. And so does the rest of the world.

RIORDAN'S CHIEF PRESS AIDE RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's director of communications was forced to 
resign in the latest shake-up for the year-old Administration, which has 
struggled to stabilize its media operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's office released a statement late Friday saying that David Novak was 
leaving after less than seven months "to return to the private sector." But 
sources said that he had been asked to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Two high-ranking Riordan Administration officials said that Novak's skills as 
a speech writer are no longer needed as Riordan, a novice politician, is 
becoming more comfortable speaking in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Novak's resignation is the fourth major departure from Riordan's press office. 
Previous communications chief Annette Castro resigned and took a top staff job 
with Councilman Richard Alarcon.

 David Hasenauer is in a hurry. He has to get to Los Angeles International 
Airport to meet a flying horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Hasenauer is meeting five flying horses, all of them inbound to LAX 
from Auckland, New Zealand, aboard an Emery Worldwide Airlines DC-8 cargo 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Their owners have paid something in the neighborhood of $5,000 each to have 
them shipped to the United States by air, instead of saving money by putting 
them on a ship for a two-week transpacific voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Hasenauer's job to pick them up at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 So Hasenauer, president of an animal air-shipping company called Jet Pets 
Inc., hops in his pickup truck and heads for a dilapidated former Nike missile 
site in a remote corner of LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 The DC-8 lands and then taxis onto the apron, and with Hasenauer carefully 
eyeing the cargo, handlers start unloading -- first some pallets piled high 
with bulk cargo and then the horses, which are in large open-topped wooden 
shipping boxes, three in one box, two in the other. They're accompanied by a 
New Zealander groom, Bernie Hackett. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackett says the horses did just fine. Top shape. No problems. They didn't 
even get airsick, although he admits it's a little hard to tell if a horse is 
airsick, considering that horses can't throw up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We handle about 700 or 800 horses a year," Hasenauer said. "A lot of horses 
get sent to Japan or Australia for races or shows. They're flying all the time. 
Some of them have more flying miles behind them than most people do." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, thousands more horses pass through LAX on domestic flights every 
year. So do sheep, goats, fish, cattle, parrots, chickens -- well, just about 
everything that walks, crawls or flies. 
</P>
<P>
 They are all air cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the living, breathing part of the LAX air cargo world. 
Although most people think of LAX as a place that moves people, it also moves 
an astonishing array and volume of freight -- about 2.8 billion pounds of cargo 
every year -- everything from horses to textiles and soup to nuts, a little 
more than half of it packed in the bellies of commercial airliners along with 
your luggage, the rest in cargo aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 LAX is now the busiest air cargo center in the nation. Every day about 7 
million pounds of air cargo goes through LAX on 1,000 arriving and departing 
cargo and cargo-and-passenger flights. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sort of like a flying warehouse in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.S. Department of Commerce figures on international imports and 
exports -- which account for just under half of all LAX air cargo -- the 
largest imported commodity coming through LAX was apparel, with 47,000 tons 
arriving in 1992, the last year for which figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest export from LAX was 33,000 tons of vegetables, fruits and nuts. In 
that same year, 18,000 tons of computer equipment and parts worth about $2.4 
billion were exported through LAX, and 24,000 tons of computer equipment worth 
about $3.3 billion were imported. 
</P>
<P>
 There also were 7,000 tons of taps, valves, bearings and gaskets imported and 
exported, along with 6,000 tons of live animals and meat, 550 tons of feathers, 
artificial flowers and wigs; 16,000 tons of fish and crustaceans; 1,400 tons of 
musical instruments; 1,100 tons of arms and munitions; 1,700 tons of beverages, 
spirits and vinegar; 2,600 tons of jewelry and coins; 208 tons of animal and 
vegetable fats and oils. The list goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 There were even 57 tons of a category the Commerce Department describes, 
somewhat curiously, as "umbrellas, walking sticks and whips." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 43% of LAX air cargo exports go to Asian countries, with Europe and 
Australia/Oceania following at 35% and 11%, respectively. About 70% of LAX 
imports come from Asia and about 17% from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Also about 175,000 tons of mail, domestic and international, moves through LAX 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that's valuable and can fit in a plane, alive or dead, moving or not 
moving, comes through here," said Rick Wells, assistant chief of airport 
planning for the Los Angeles Department of Airports.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the air cargo is illicit. In May, U.S. Customs agents discovered a 
ton of Colombian cocaine hidden in a shipment of flexible rubber tubing inbound 
from Mexico aboard a chartered cargo plane. So far this year, customs agents 
have made four seizures of drug shipments hidden in air cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 All imported cargo passing through LAX is subject to U.S. Customs inspection. 
But with so much cargo moving through, officials can only inspect a portion of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a daunting task," spokesman Michael Fleming said. "We have limited 
resources on what we can examine. The vast majority of cargo is legitimate, and 
we don't want to impede legitimate cargo, which could cause economic impacts. 
So we work selectively." 
</P>
<P>
 Air cargo is an important if little known -- to the public at least -- aspect 
of airport operations, Wells said. It doesn't have the glamour of passenger 
operations, and thus it traditionally hasn't gotten as much attention from 
airport officials as the passenger side of the flying business. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as LAX air cargo tonnage has increased by about 50% in the last decade, 
LAX cargo facilities have expanded to meet the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gateway Freight Services Inc., a contract cargo handler for 22 airlines that 
operate in and out of LAX, recently expanded its facilities. Federal Express, 
Japan Airlines and Qantas also plan to expand cargo handling facilities at LAX. 
Currently about 1.6 million square feet of air cargo terminal space is 
available at LAX, about two-thirds of it used for international import-export. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 people in Los Angeles are directly employed in air cargo-related 
jobs with airline and freight companies. That represents about 10% of the total 
number of people who work at LAX. Airport officials estimate the "economic 
impact" of LAX air freight in the Los Angeles region at about $11 billion per 
year, or about $9,000 for every ton of air cargo that passes through. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 True, LAX's 1.4 million tons of cargo annually pales in comparison with the 75 
million tons of goods that move through the Port of Los Angeles by ship every 
year. But the value of LAX import-export goods -- about $34 billion -- is a 
little over half of the value of goods that move through the port. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, air cargo may be relatively small in quantity. But pound for 
pound it's some of the most valuable cargo in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, larger airlines with numerous LAX flights handle their own air 
cargo, but for smaller or foreign-based airlines with limited numbers of 
flights it's more cost-effective to contract out their cargo handling 
operations to companies such as Gateway Freight Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost anything that's for sale, anything people want, anywhere in the world, 
comes through here," said David Abe, chief operating officer of Gateway, which 
handles nearly 600 million pounds of air cargo annually, making it the largest 
contract air cargo handler at LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 Abe is standing in a 38,000-square-foot warehouse, one of five cargo handling 
centers Gateway operates at LAX. In the vast, high-ceiling building with row 
upon row of shelves, cargo waits to be put on a plane or picked up for 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 There are pallets of pearl onions and stacked boxes of rhubarb. There's a box 
of live koi fish being shipped from Monterey Park to Seattle. There are boxes 
of lamb and venison from New Zealand and Australia, large slabs of tanned 
leather, a film canister bound for Hollywood from Portugal, boxes of men's 
belts from Italy, sealed boxes of unknown goods from India bound for the Target 
Stores of America, "special handling" boxes marked flammable and corrosive.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every single day it's something different," said Mark Wood, Gateway terminal 
manager. "We've had cars, reptiles from Africa, birds. Once we had a bear that 
was going to the Los Angeles Zoo." 
</P>
<P>
 Human bodies -- dead human bodies -- also constitute part of LAX air cargo. 
Exact figures aren't available, but airport spokesmen and air shippers say that 
every year hundreds of human corpses pass through LAX, in coffins inside 
shipping boxes marked "human remains," bound for burial in other states and 
countries. They are handled like any other piece of air cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Sending goods by air freight isn't cheap, compared to sea or truck or rail 
shipping. Prices vary widely, depending on the weight and bulk of the shipment, 
but generally air freight costs three to 10 times more than shipping by sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Some items, such as sea urchins bound from California to the sushi restaurants 
of Japan, or prepared fugu fish from Japan bound for the Japanese restaurants 
of California, have to get from Point A to Point B fast or they'll spoil. At 
other times, market conditions, not perishability, make the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a store owner selling winter jackets and they're going like hot 
cakes and you need more of them, they have to get here fast," Wells said. 
"Sure, it costs more to send by air, but they won't do you any good if they get 
here two months from now." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you need a shipment by tomorrow, then cost isn't really that much of a 
consideration, is it?" said Wayne Gatewood, office manager at Rainbow World 
Transport in Inglewood, one of about 300 freight forwarding companies in the 
Los Angeles area.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, for some people cost really isn't a consideration. A few months 
ago, for example, Gatewood's company shipped a 48-foot horse trailer to Berlin 
by air freight at a cost of $17,000 -- at least three or four times what it 
would have cost to ship by sea. Gatewood figures that people who can afford to 
air ship horse trailers probably don't worry too much about money in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatewood's company also has shipped Harley-Davidson motorcycles to Italy, and 
Ferrari cars from Italy, along with 1,200 pounds of explosive detonators and 
some Italian space satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes people simply run out of time and have no choice but to ship by air. 
That's what happened with Gary Harper and his $30,000 Gatling machine gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper is a Ramona gas station owner who belongs to a military re-enactment 
group called the Gordon Highlanders, who wear the uniforms of Scottish soldiers 
of the 1880s. They were scheduled to participate in a ceremony in Scotland, and 
Harper wanted to take his 4,000-pound Model 1874, .45/70-caliber Gatling gun. 
The problem was that he only had a week, and cargo vessels couldn't get there 
that fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, it would have cost Harper about $3,000 each way to air freight the 
Gatling gun, but only $300 to $400 by sea. But Northwest Airlines took a liking 
to his group and "helped us out" on the freight charges, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a time problem," Harper said. "Besides, every time I've ever shipped 
something by sea there's been a problem. The shipment gets damaged, or it gets 
wet; it's always something. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, air cargo is the only way to go."

WOMAN TO FACE TRIAL IN RENT FRAUD SCHEME; COURTS: INVESTIGATORS ALLEGE MARY 
LOUISE JOHNSON OF PALMDALE TOLD WOULD-BE TENANTS AND BUYERS THAT SHE BOUGHT 
FORECLOSURE HOUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Palmdale woman accused of running a fraud scheme in which she collected rent 
from tenants at houses she did not own has been ordered to stand trial on three 
counts of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 After a preliminary hearing that focused on complex real estate documents, 
Antelope Municipal Judge Chesley N. McKay Jr. on Friday found that there was 
sufficient evidence to order a trial for Mary Louise Johnson, who has also used 
the name Mary Thedford. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have alleged that Johnson told prospective tenants and buyers 
that she was a buyer of foreclosure homes. She persuaded low-income residents 
and others who were unsophisticated in real estate matters to rent or buy these 
properties without getting permission from the lenders, who had taken 
possession of the houses, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Horowitz, a legally blind woman who testified at the hearing, said she 
rented a house from Johnson, then gave her a $6,000 down payment toward the 
purchase of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Johnson appeared to be "a church lady" who presented herself as the 
legitimate owner of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a cruel act to take money, especially from people who can least afford 
it," Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph D. Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Lawrence Miller, argued that his 
client was legally entitled to sell the house to Horowitz because she had 
purchased a quit-claim deed from the previous owner, who had lost the house 
through foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence of any intent to defraud," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sheriff's Detective Jan Carroll testified that the lending institutions 
that took possession of the foreclosed houses had not given Johnson the right 
to rent or sell the dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Carroll said she is looking into fraud allegations involving 
Johnson and at least six other victims, which may lead to additional charges. 
</P>
<P>
 She said deputies had seized "milk crates full of files on homes" after 
obtaining a warrant to search Johnson's home. She said these files will be 
reviewed as part of a continuing investigation into Johnson's real estate 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the court hearing, McKay ordered that Johnson remain in jail, in 
lieu of $500,000 bail, pending her Aug. 12 arraignment in Lancaster Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller argued that Johnson's bail was excessively high, particularly in a case 
in which the alleged losses totaled only about $10,000. But McKay refused to 
reduce the bail, saying Johnson, who has used several different names, posed a 
flight risk, and that questions still surround her financial assets.

UNITED WAY CUTS WERE UNEXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am writing in response to the July 10 letter to the editor from Jonathan 
Jacobs, chairman of the United Way North Angeles region. 
</P>
<P>
 United Way is having severe financial difficulties, and the volunteers 
connected with United Way are doing their best with a very difficult 
situation.However, as chief executive officer of two of the agencies (Vista Del 
Mar Child and Family Services and Julia Ann Singer Center) who took one of the 
more severe cuts from North Angeles Region, I must take exception to a couple 
of Mr. Jacobs' comments -- in particular, since Vista Del Mar and Julia Ann 
Singer had extremely positive site reviews by the United Way Allocations 
Committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Vista Del Mar and Julia Ann Singer received 95% cuts of their funding from the 
North Angeles Region. Our agencies had no warning of an impending cut of this 
size and nature, and therefore we were unable to plan or budget accordingly. 
The impact of this cut on a population which is severely in need will only 
exacerbate the problems currently encountered by disadvantaged youth and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 My board of directors and I sympathize with United Way's plight, but effective 
management requires discussion and planning to most ably meet the best 
interests of all involved.

DIRECT FEDERAL QUAKE AID TO THE TRULY NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The July 12 interview with attorney William Streitfeld about his problem in 
securing funding for his apartment house demonstrates one of the major problems 
faced by our government. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand we voice outrage at government waste, and on the other we 
demand more from government than we are entitled to. 
</P>
<P>
 As I understand this particular situation, Mr. Streitfeld has an investment in 
a piece of property on which he pays no federal taxes and which he uses as a 
source of tax write-offs and tax-free financing for his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he lives in an earthquake-prone community, he chose not to take 
responsibility for himself and did not purchase readily available earthquake 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Mr. Streitfeld, who apparently has other sources of raising money, wants 
the federal government to bail him out with a low-interest loan, and he has the 
nerve to complain about their attitude and delay. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately this is just one example of how "born again" believers in 
government's welfare are contributing to the demise of the American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration 
programs are rightfully designed for the needy, not the greedy, and our elected 
representatives need to remember this. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Streitfeld states that given the condition of the building, "no lender 
will lend you a dime on it." If that is true, then neither should the federal 
government.

MAKING PEOPLE THE PIGEONS; BATTLING OVERPOPULATION, GLENDALE WILL CLIP WINGS OF 
ANYONE FEEDING THE BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not exactly "Feed a Pigeon, Go to Jail," but it's coming close to that in 
Glendale, where city officials have decided to get tough with the source of the 
daunting downtown dung problem: people. Within three months, thanks to a more 
humane edict from the Glendale City Council, folks caught feeding the birds on 
public property, parks, streets, and sidewalks will be fined $50. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second offense, the fine rises to $100, and then to $250 on the third. 
</P>
<P>
 This all came about because Glendale's downtown pigeon population has risen 
exponentially, up to an estimated 10,000 winged bombers who have been dropping 
their unwanted poop all over statues, awnings and whatever else they can hit. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months back, a rather unseemly solution was entertained. The idea then 
was to bag the birds and unceremoniously hook the sack up to the tailpipe of 
your basic internal combustion engine vehicle. This concept so outraged people 
that they rose to the defense of pigeondom. 
</P>
<P>
 The fines are a better idea, but why stop there? In the war against graffiti, 
for example, it has become standard practice to make the weapons unavailable. 
Merchants keep spray paint cans behind the counters or out of reach of the 
would-be taggers. Surely the supermarkets and the corner grocery, and even pet 
stores, could follow a similar strategy.  
</P>
<P>
 Checkout counter employees could be encouraged to customers with a withering 
gaze and to inquire "And what exactly is the purpose of that bread you're 
buying?" 
</P>
<P>
 Unless it's Thanksgiving, anyone seen with a bag of bird feed or bread crumbs 
would be considered a suspect. Conscientious citizens would keep a wary eye on 
such hooligans, and report them smartly to the proper authorities. By the way, 
the acronym for the city officials who could keep track of such reports could 
be SPAPS ("Stool Pigeons Against Pigeon Stool"). Sounds like a winner to us.

FINDING BRIGHT SPOTS IN DIM ECONOMIC PICTURE; SUCCESS OF SOME VALLEY 
ENTREPRENEURS OFFERS HOPE FOR FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps it is not so much that there is more optimism in the San Fernando 
Valley and its environs these days, just less pessimism. Indeed, this past 
week's three-part Times Valley Edition series on "Changing Fortunes: The Valley 
Economy in Transition" shows that the hard times for the region's economy have 
merely softened a bit. There is no large-scale recovery in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent poll of Valley adults, for example, shows both real and perceived 
improvements, such as fewer households that have suffered through layoffs or 
firings. Still the numbers here, and in the economic data for the region and 
Los Angeles as a whole, are daunting. Yes, fewer folks feel that we are still 
in a recession, but 80% of the people felt that we were a year ago, and 66% 
still do. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankruptcy filings are down, but they are still far too numerous for anyone to 
find solace in the decline. Sales of single-family homes and condominiums here 
are half of what they were in 1988, and the average sales price of those units 
continues to drop. All over the region, the shells of partially built units 
stand as a symbol of the sour real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's important to focus on the positive, and there is much -- surprisingly 
-- to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 The brightest entrepreneurs, for example, can still take a simple idea and 
turn it into thriving business. There's Dan Sandel, an Israeli immigrant who 
kept hearing his friends in the nursing profession complain about the tedium of 
counting hypodermic needles. Among other things, he has created a 400-employee, 
$60-million-a-year Chatsworth business producing medical supplies . . . and 
automatic needle counters. There was also the story of a former aerospace 
engineer who began making lightweight electric wheelchairs in his garage, and 
who now owns a 24,000-square-foot factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Garcia's Burbank-based consulting firm has also found quite a foothold. 
He's helping businesses learn how to approach the Valley's fastest-growing 
population: Latinos. He's also advising Latino-owned firms on how to go 
mainstream, to the tune of $1 million in annual revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Such efforts are helpful, but the vast majority of us still face an evolving 
economy that will include a significant number of jobs, but at lower wages, 
with fewer benefits and fewer hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, we can find guidance in the likes of those like Wylen Won, a 
$70,000-a-year director of a Sherman Oaks medical laboratory. Won still keep 
samples of Amway products on his desk, in case he, too, has to join the ranks 
of the "downwardly mobile." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, of the Valley residents who changed jobs within the past five years, 
nearly one-fifth of those aged 30 to 64 are working part-time jobs because they 
cannot find full-time jobs. And in a future in which more than half of the top 
25 jobs will pay minimum wage, or slightly more, it behooves us all to try to 
become as valuable and as versatile as possible. Perhaps that's why one-third 
of the Valley residents in that poll said that they have taken some form of job 
training or additional schooling to boost their current careers, or vault to 
new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wylen Won says, "it's just not safe these days to put all your eggs in one 
basket." No kidding.

 * Earthquake repair to the Simi Valley Freeway in Granada Hills has gotten 
back-burner treatment by Caltrans.Six months after the quake, the undamaged on 
and off ramps at Hayvenhurst Avenue and Balboa Boulevard are not yet reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans says reopening the ramps would be dangerous to the freeway traffic. 
This is a ludicrous excuse. Why would freeway drivers in Granada Hills suddenly 
become dangerous on ramps while everywhere else acts sanely? 
</P>
<P>
 The closed ramps are a constant nuisance to thousands of residents and 
businesses. The public deserves better treatment from Caltrans.

WOULD COSTLY DEFENSE HAVE CHANGED OUTCOME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Not long ago in the San Fernando Valley a young black man was convicted of a 
brutal double murder. 
</P>
<P>
 His crime was cruel and coldblooded.For a little less than $500 he robbed and 
murdered a young man closing up a sandwich shop. The killer also murdered a 
bystander. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder what the outcome would have been for this quiet owlish killer and 
former college student had he been able to afford a defense lawyer of, say, the 
caliber of a Leslie Abramson or Robert Shapiro. He would probably still be 
awaiting trial while his attorneys prepared to dazzle a jury with mitigating 
factors set deep in his childhood or social circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess we'll never know. He had no big lawyers, and he is already on San 
Quentin's Death Row.

ACTIVIST GROUPS CAUSE 'WHITE FLIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * White flight has been defined as a reaction by narrow-minded bigots to 
remove their families from people of diverse ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 As a father of two children presently in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District and one more to enter in a few years, my experience has been greatly 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 A first day at kindergarten for my one son consisted of learning the days of 
the week in Spanish, even though I'm not sure he knew them in English. I have 
watched as Washington's and Lincoln's birthdays have passed with little 
fanfare, but not Cinco de Mayo or Mexican Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
 My children have been thrown into bilingual Spanish classes time and again to 
prepare them for a future in a changing city. Their school educates immigrant 
children in their native Spanish language even though they speak perfect 
English. I was told right across the principal's desk that their parents prefer 
that they be taught in their native tongue. As a grandson of immigrants who 
were forced to abandon their ethnic trappings, I find this unbelievable during 
these tight financial times. 
</P>
<P>
 Intercultural studies consist of no more than a competition among ethnic 
leaders to see who has the most gripes against the evil Europeans that settled 
in this land.  
</P>
<P>
 An attempt at magnet schools ran into a quota trap whereby some of the most 
affluent minorities have hopped aboard the special consideration bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles school district, not unlike our state and federal governments 
with their caucuses, has been carved up into special-interest groups, all 
fighting for the biggest piece of the pie. When you are not part of any of 
these activist groups, you go to private school or resort to white flight.

TRUCK REGULATIONS NEED TO BE STRICTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * A large truck losing its cargo overboard as it rounds an overhead freeway 
bridge is a sight none of us ever want to see. And yet that happened as a truck 
dropped its load of heavy steel tubes onto the I-5 Freeway just north of San 
Fernando. It was another of many truck disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what the trucking industry uses for design of truck cargo 
supports. I do know that standard aircraft design practice for many decades has 
required that all cargo supports be designed for a turning side load equal to 
one-half the weight of the cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 In support of this requirement, I'll never forget the sight which occurred 
some 30 years ago in Burbank. Our Lockheed "Skunk Works" chief, C.L. (Kelly) 
Johnson was racing his new Ford sedan around a previously cleared runway. Kelly 
was trying to see if he could find cause to reduce the required one-half "g" 
side load to something less for the design of the still-secret SR-71 Blackbird 
airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to confirming that the original requirement was a good one, Kelly 
ended up scaring the engineers half to death who accompanied him around the 
curves.  
</P>
<P>
 With this picture in mind, I seriously doubt that the tubing supports on the 
freeway truck were sufficient to withstand a side load of anything near one 
half its own weight. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA is not the least bit reticent about issuing airworthiness directives 
to control situations existing in the aircraft industry. It seems that it is 
time for the Transportation Department, in the interest of public safety, to 
exert some control over the design of these large trucks. Our lives are worth 
more than dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 One criteria could be that any such truck should be capable of rolling over at 
say 55 m.p.h. and still retain its contents, be they liquid or solid. We've had 
enough of these dangerous and disastrous spillages on our freeways.

MANAGED HEALTH CARE MERELY LINES POCKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The article by Dr. Ken Murray (June 19) extolling the virtues of managed 
care is a lot of self-serving garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Murray has only been in practice for 10 years, so perhaps he is unaware 
that without managed care, the American medical profession was able to bring to 
the populace the highest quality health care system in the history of 
mankind.And who were the ultimate judges of the quality of that system? The 
patients. Perhaps they can't define quality medical care, but believe me, they 
know it when they see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Managed care, in the form of for-profit health management organizations, is 
flourishing not because of the high quality of care, but because it is an 
immensely profitable business. Several HMOs recently admitted taking as much as 
50 cents of every premium dollar for their cut before any health care was 
provided to anyone. A large group like the one Dr. Murray belongs to may take 
another 15 to 20 cents in administration out of that premium dollar. Could it 
be that the problem they had in obtaining quality mammograms was that 50-cent 
dollars don't go too far? 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly a week goes by that we don't hear of one HMO's buying another for 
hundreds of millions of dollars in cash. Where did all that money come from? 
Somehow it didn't get spent on patient care. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dr. Murray would have us believe that the end result of this scheme is a 
higher quality health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody want to buy a bridge?

VISIONARY PLANS FOR THE RIVER IN OUR BACK YARD; A SHORTAGE OF OPEN SPACE HAS 
FOCUSED ATTENTION ON THE NEGLECTED LOS ANGELES RIVER. A COASTAL CONSERVANCY 
STUDY OFFERS AN AMBITIOUS PROPOSAL FOR AN URBAN OASIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS MacADAMS, Lewis MacAdams is a member of the board of Friends of the 
Los Angeles River. This is the first of two articles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until a few years ago, the few Angelenos who knew there was a Los Angeles 
River spoke of it in the past tense. The river had been massively channelized, 
hemmed in by railroads and freeways and industrial parks, buried beneath 3 
million barrels of concrete and treated as a storm drain and an open sewer by 
the dozen or more local, state and federal agencies ostensibly responsible for 
its well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles continued to grow. The largest, most densely populated county 
in the United States added almost 1.5 million people during the 1980s. By 1990, 
L.A. had less parkland per capita than any metropolitan area in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with an open-space crisis to go with all our other crises, Los Angeles 
rediscovered the river in its own back yard. Running from the San Fernando 
Valley to the Pacific Ocean at Long Beach (the Queen Mary is the toothpick in 
the river's mouth), there it was -- the Los Angeles. For the first time, 
Angelenos began to speak about the river's future. 
</P>
<P>
 The city convened a Los Angeles River Task Force. The county Department of 
Public Works began to develop a river master plan. At least half a dozen 
studies and reports were generated, including the first-ever biological 
inventory of the river, conducted by the L.A. County Museum of Natural History. 
Every study was useful. Each contributed to a growing body of knowledge about a 
river that had been ignored except as a flood threat for 80 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the state Legislature asked the state Coastal Conservancy to assess 
the river's potential for public access, recreation and wildlife enhancement. 
The result is the just-issued "Los Angeles River Park and Recreation Area 
Study."  
</P>
<P>
 The report profiles all 12 riverfront cities from Glendale and Burbank, south 
through the city of Los Angeles and southeast L.A. County to Compton and Long 
Beach; inventories parklands near the river, and prioritizes opportunities for 
local parkland acquisition. This is the first study that looks at the river as 
a whole. Anyone interested in restoration of the Los Angeles River should have 
a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 The study documents almost a century of neglect. There is still no legal 
access to the river or its tributaries. Would-be bird watchers, bicyclists and 
canoeists are still greeted with locked gates and L.A. County's rusting "No 
Trespassing: $500 Fine and 6 Months in Jail" signs. Only two bike paths run 
along any portion of the river -- none in the Valley -- and neither is 
landscaped or has rest stops. The report says that one, the Lario Trail, is "in 
a severe state of disrepair and is impassable in many locations." For 50 miles, 
there is no place along the river to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the report confirms how much we've already got to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost a quarter of the river's bed -- including a two-mile wilderness stretch 
in the Sepulveda Basin and six miles from Griffith Park to just north of 
downtown that parallels the Golden State Freeway -- is not lined with concrete. 
Along these stretches, fed by nearly 100 million gallons a day of treated 
runoff from the Tillman and L.A.-Glendale water reclamation plants, the Los 
Angeles harbors a rich biota that includes amphibians, reptiles, several 
species of fish and almost 200 species of birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The conclusion? The Los Angeles River has the potential to become one of the 
basin's greatest recreational resources, a 250-mile greenway through the heart 
of the region, a source of desperately needed parks and recreational facilities 
from the San Gabriel Mountains to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy's study recommends that parks and recreation -- including 
bike, pedestrian and equestrian paths, nature-study areas and extensive 
landscaping -- become a high-priority land use for the entire river corridor. 
Linear parks and trails should be incorporated into future commercial, 
residential and industrial riverfront development. New land uses should not 
obstruct public access to the river corridor. All these recommendations 
parallel riverfront development standards in Los Angeles' new General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Specific recommendations for the Valley include expansion of Burbank's Buena 
Vista Park, so far one of the few public accesses along the river; the creation 
of a Crystal Springs Park, where Glendale is considering establishing an 
environmental education center; the construction of a Sepulveda Basin nature 
trail between the river and Balboa Park, and development of a bikeway from the 
Valley to Long Beach via downtown's Union Station. Design of Phase 1 of the 
bikeway is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The weakness of the study is its political dimension. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy simply calls for better integration of flood control, ground 
water recharge, habitat and open space uses without saying how that is to be 
achieved. But no current agency seems willing or able to plan for this 
integration, much less carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy, while acknowledging that the fragmentation of authority makes 
"comprehensive planning for the entire watershed a difficult and complicated 
undertaking," can only recommend a vague "mechanism for coordination." It will 
take a new agency, long proposed by the Friends of the Los Angeles River -- a 
countywide Los Angeles River Conservancy -- to carry out the Coastal 
Conservancy's ambitious and visionary plans.

VALLEY MUST UNITE NOW TO DEMAND RAIL PROJECT; SIX YEARS AGO, A DIVISIVE BATTLE 
OVER ALIGNMENTS COST THE REGION MILLIONS OF TRANSIT DOLLARS. IT'S TIME TO JOIN 
TOGETHER AND DEMAND OUR FAIR SHARE OF MTA FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEL WILSON, Mel Wilson is on the board of the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Within the next two months, a decision will be made that will affect the 
quality of life for the San Fernando Valley for the next 50 to 75 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has been waiting for a 
year to receive the results of two independent studies that evaluate the 
important elements of building an east-west Valley rail system. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is due to review the findings and then adopt one of these alignments 
as the next new preferred local rail alignment to be built in Los Angeles 
County. The alternatives under study are an elevated train along the Ventura 
Freeway and a subway farther north. 
</P>
<P>
 Whichever route is chosen, the Valley will be in fierce competition with other 
areas for the money. It is critical that those who live and work in the Valley 
voice support for the next MTA rail project to be built here. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a compelling case. TAX EQUITY 
</P>
<P>
 The 1.4 million people living in the Valley make up one-third of the 
population in the City of Los Angeles and almost 16% of the county. With the 
passages of Proposition A and Proposition C, more than $5 billion in sales tax 
dollars have been collected. Close to $800 million in taxes have been paid by 
the Valley for public mass transit. Other regions have gotten major rail 
projects. What does the Valley have to show for its taxes? 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the election of Mayor Richard Riordan, due in part to Valley voters, 
the Valley is finally getting some attention. The Valley is counting on the 
mayor and his influence to deliver us a rail transit system here where it is 
wanted, needed and deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 We have been paying one extra half-cent sales tax since 1982 and another since 
1991. This money is to be used to improve transit services and operations, 
reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, efficiently operate and improve 
the condition of the streets and freeways utilized by public transit, and 
reduce foreign fuel dependence. FAIR SHARE 
</P>
<P>
 Other than Metrolink commuter trains and two Metro Rail stations, the 
construction and operation of the east-west rail alignment is the only rail 
project being considered for the Valley. Both the Westside and the Eastside of 
the Los Angeles basin have more than one project planned or under construction. 
We want and expect no less than our fair share. CONGESTION AND AIR QUALITY 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley east-west corridor is one of the most congested in the Los Angeles 
region. It serves as a major access route connecting population and employment 
centers in the San Fernando and Conejo valleys, Hollywood, Mid-Wilshire and 
Downtown Los Angeles. A well-planned rail system will also connect to the 
northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The mere fact that we live in a valley with narrow pass-through access creates 
additional transit and mobility problems. Our freeway rush hour now lasts 4 1/2 
hours, with traffic crawling at average speeds of 21 m.p.h. despite the recent 
widening of the Ventura Freeway. What's more, buses, which contribute to poor 
air quality, travel at an average speed of 17 m.p.h. A modern rail system will 
provide a viable alternative to future gridlock because low-emission trains 
move at overall speeds of 30 m.p.h. to 40 m.p.h., including station stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, the Valley was scheduled to be the site of the next rail 
project to be funded. We became embroiled in a divisive public debate about 
which rail alignment should be adopted. Meanwhile, transit board members 
representing Pasadena, East Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley built a 
community consensus that resulted in the Pasadena Blue Line being adopted and 
partially funded. Millions of dollars intended for the Valley went elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 As I attend community meetings, I consistently hear that the Valley wants and 
needs a modern rail system. Active support for an east-west rail system has 
been shown by most of the east-west corridor homeowner associations, business 
groups and elected officials. I feel there is a strong consensus for an 
east-west Valley rail system. 
</P>
<P>
 As I indicated, there is fierce competition for the scarce public transit 
dollars in Los Angeles County. Several rail projects are waiting to be built, 
but without funds. One should ask who are the losers and who has the most to 
gain from our millions of tax dollars? Where do they live and whom were they 
elected to represent? I compliment those officials who have been successful in 
gaining transit authority approval for their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's agree to come together now and work tirelessly for our fair share of 
transit tax dollar improvements. We owe it to our children, grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren to do our part to make the San Fernando Valley a better 
place to live and make a living. I hope citizens will call the MTA board and 
elected officials and tell them the San Fernando Valley wants rail now!

BUSINESS-FRIENDLY CITY IS THE PROBLEM, NOT THE SOLUTION; A COMMITTEE WANTS TO 
'REFORM' LOS ANGELES' LAND-USE DEVELOPMENT REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS. 
GREASING THE SKIDS FOR DEVELOPERS WILL ONLY MAKE OUR PREDICAMENT WORSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD A. SILVER and MYRNA L. SILVER, Gerald A. Silver and Myrna L. Silver 
live in Encino. Gerald Silver is president of Homeowners of Encino. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan and City Councilman Hal Bernson have a plan to "reform" 
the city's land-use development review and approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 They want to create a "business friendly" environment by greasing the skids of 
City Hall. A committee of 20 of the city's top developers, real estate 
attorneys, architects and land-use consultants has been named to achieve this. 
Homeowner leaders and community activists are noticeably absent from this 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is quietly holding meetings around the city and will issue a report 
shortly. The objective is to cut away what the group believes is useless red 
tape. For example, a Riordan news release said it took nine months and $10,000 
to get approval for a single-family dwelling. In another instance it took a 
retail building seven months and $35,000 in unspecified costs to jump through 
the hoops. 
</P>
<P>
 We think that greasing the skids of City Hall in the name of economic relief 
for developers is a bad idea. The supposed crisis is nonexistent, and 
developers simply want to dismantle the present deliberative assessment of 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of one-stop permit shopping claim that businesses and residents are 
leaving Los Angeles in droves because there are too many obstacles to 
constructing a building. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's fundamental premise is flawed. Let's look at the real reasons that 
business and residents find Los Angeles increasingly unattractive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported in a May 18 article: "For the first time since the 1970s, 
the city of Los Angeles did not lead the state's cities in population growth." 
The article cites the Department of Finance statistics and describes a falloff 
in migration. According to demographers, this reduction is the direct result of 
a long California recession. People will move for jobs, and not many new jobs 
have been created in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is in its present predicament not because it is too hard to get a 
building permit, but because it is too easy. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, city administrations have given the store away. They have allowed 
developers to build inappropriate projects, many too big or in the wrong 
places. They have encouraged new business and an influx of residents without 
providing an adequate infrastructure. The result is a greatly reduced quality 
of life, traffic congestion, noise, diminished city services and a dilapidated 
sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime, burglaries and thefts have raised the cost of doing business. The 
character of the Los Angeles population has changed. This has resulted in 
inferior schools and a work force that can barely read or write, much less read 
a micrometer or interpret a spreadsheet. It is this continuing decline in the 
quality of the Los Angeles work force that has changed the city from a safe, 
manufacturing-based hometown to a world-class problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the fault lies in a weak permitting and development review process. 
The Planning Commission regularly grants exceptions that are routinely approved 
by the City Council. They allow monstrosities, such as the Chalk Hall 
condominium project on Ventura Boulevard and canyons of four-story apartments 
towering over adjacent residents on Laurel Canyon. Businesses are allowed to 
open with inadequate parking, poor access and lack of ground transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tightened air quality regulations are pushing once-profitable businesses into 
the red. Overcrowding, crime and the flight of high-tech jobs are the real 
reasons that Los Angeles has become business-unfriendly. It is no longer a 
pleasant place to work or live. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most expensive and sought-after real estate lies in communities 
that have the world's most rigorous, time-consuming and complex permitting 
processes. In New Orleans, you can't change a stone or move one foot of wrought 
iron without getting city approval. Manhattan, Tokyo and Paris have rigorous, 
restrictive procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it may take many months to review and permit a project. This is not bad. 
It gives neighbors time to react to environmentally destructive projects. 
Community groups can conduct independent investigations and open neighborhood 
dialogues before concrete trucks show up on a site. This scrutiny results in 
better projects that serve both developers and community needs. 
</P>
<P>
 A developer of the property at Ventura Boulevard and Hayvenhurst Avenue spent 
more than a year and a great deal of money trying to obtain an environmental 
review and permits. He threw in the towel before he could build an office 
building that would probably have remained half-empty. A second developer took 
over the site with a more acceptable project and was able to move through the 
process in record time and with minimal cost. A single-story supermarket, 
bookstore and attractively designed retail center are under construction.

 Los Angeles residents should insist that quality, rather than quantity, of 
projects be stressed. Homeowner and community leaders must be well-represented 
on the Development Reform Committee panel. Working with developers, the group 
can create a truly business-friendly environment.

BREAKING THE SILENCE ON GUNS IN SCHOOLS; RESEDA HIGH'S WARN PROGRAM URGES 
STUDENTS TO REPORT WEAPONS -- IT'S WORTH IMITATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The problem of students who bring guns to school -- and what to do about them 
-- is again in the news. That's because of California Sen. Dianne Feinstein's 
plans to introduce a "zero tolerance" amendment to the $12-billion Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act. Essentially, it would require that any school 
district that receives federal funding must expel for a year any student who 
carries a gun to school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District already has a strict policy. LAUSD 
students who get caught with a firearm on campus are usually kicked out for the 
remainder of that semester, and for the one that follows. Gun incidences there 
are down. 
</P>
<P>
 Such policies, however, still do not address a critical problem: getting even 
more students to speak up and warn officials when they see that one of their 
peers is carrying a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda High School continues to set something of a national example here, one 
that other schools would do well to duplicate. Its efforts were spurred by the 
fact that at least six students at Reseda High said they noticed a teen-ager 
with a gun on the day that an armed youth later shot and killed student Michael 
Ensley. Not one of those students warned school officials about what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the school's WARN program (which stands for Weapons Are Removed 
Now), has been trying to break the unofficial code of silence that decrees that 
no student should rat on another, regardless of the seriousness of the 
transgression. It is the kind of local initiative that can save lives and rid 
schools of potentially violent youths before they are allowed to resort to 
intimidation and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 WARN has received national attention from media sources as diverse as the NBC 
Nightly News and the "Donahue" show. Among other things, WARN members perform 
skits that point out the tragedies that can occur and be prevented if students 
speak up about what they see. 
</P>
<P>
 The toughest expulsion policy in the nation will not matter a whit if the 
weapon-carrying student is discovered only after he or she has managed to shoot 
someone.

JIM MURRAY: THERE WILL BE LITTLE JOY LEFT IN MUDVILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I never saw a strike that was "won." Not in the short run. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm no advocate of big business. I grew up in a 
household where my grandfather worked 14 hours a day. If he got hurt on the job 
-- as he often did -- that was his tough luck. They not only didn't pay his 
medical expenses, they didn't even pay his salary while he was off the job. I'm 
guessing that was about $15 a week. Management took the position the injury was 
his own damn carelessness. No concern of theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Costly strikes elsewhere helped to change that sorry state of things. But so 
did indignant doctors and enterprising lawyers. If a Royal Typewriter strike 
garnered a $2-an-hour raise, the price of typewriters went up 50 bucks. So did 
the services of those who had to buy them. Newspapers went from 3 cents a copy 
to 10 cents. Reporters went clear up to $25 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings me to the baseball strike that is imminent. For the first time in 
history, the World Series is in danger of being wiped out. Not even world wars 
could wipe out World Series. But a union might do it. With a lot of help from 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think either unionist Don Fehr or ownership's Richard Ravitch wants to 
be known as "the creature that killed baseball." Ravitch maintains that he's 
trying to save it. Fehr's view is narrower. He's trying to save the union rank 
and file their multimillion-dollar lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 If it comes to pass, it will be the first strike in history where the strikers 
had more money than the bosses. In the whole history of labor warfare, this has 
never happened anywhere but baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues are clear: Ownership wants a salary cap, i.e, a fixed ceiling on 
the amount of money they will pay the help each year. The union scoffs at this. 
Understandably. Why play for table stakes when you have all the aces? 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball says nine or more of its teams are losing money. Then, someone goes 
out and pays $173 million for the Baltimore Orioles. The Baltimore Orioles! The 
team that used to be the St. Louis Browns -- a team that drew fewer fans in a 
decade than the New York Yankees drew in a big week. 
</P>
<P>
 Why plead poormouth when southern cities are so salivating for franchises that 
they build stadiums in the hopes they can lure a team and will pay almost 
anything to get one? 
</P>
<P>
 How can you plead poormouth when the game could charge Miami and Denver $95 
million merely for the license to do business? Batteries (ballplayers) not 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball insists it has to have a salary cap to institute revenue sharing. 
Now, revenue sharing is obviously a priority. The Yankees' local radio-TV 
contracts, the real lifeblood of a franchise, were for about $54 million. The 
Seattle Mariners' were for about $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh had to trade -- or simply lose -- Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla and 
Doug Drabek. That's half a pennant right there. The San Diego Padres had to 
scatter Fred McGriff, Gary Sheffield, Tony Fernandez, Bruce Hurst, Randy Myers 
and Benito Santiago. Couldn't afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, small-market teams are overmatched in the counting house. And, 
therefore, on the playing field. It has to be leveled. Not everyone can move to 
Tampa-St. Pete. If the Dodgers take in $80 million more in TV revenue than, 
say, San Diego, the game has a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 That's San Diego's problem, the players say. Well, not exactly. The essence of 
sport is competition, not exhibition. A Dream Team giving a recital only works 
every decade or so. If you can't compete at the bank, you can't compete on the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 How many of the advantages of today's players are ascribable to work 
stoppages? Well, the costliest one in baseball history, 1981, started out with 
management having a strike fund with Lloyd's of London that paid each club 
$100,000 per lost game. The policy didn't go into effect until the second week 
and topped out at 500 games. The strike lasted 712 games. The owners lost $72 
million -- offset by Lloyd's $44 million -- but the players lost $28 million. 
Home mortgages, alimonies, autos, club dues, maids, butlers, yard work, phone 
calls and the yacht go on whether baseball does or doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting a strike date is like dropping leaflets over an open city. It gives 
the enemy, i.e., the owners, time to break out the white flag. 
</P>
<P>
 What if they don't? What if the game takes this called third strike with its 
bat on its shoulder? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the economic ruin would be devastating. It has been estimated that it 
would cost Barry Bonds more than $25,000 a day. Or more than $1.3 million if 
the rest of the season is wiped out. It would cost baseball $140 million if the 
postseason were wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
 What if baseball itself is wiped out? What if fan disgust finally boils over? 
What if they gave a ball game and nobody showed up? 
</P>
<P>
 Not likely. They will show up, all right. The day after the '81 strike ended, 
60,000 fans showed up in Philadelphia to see Cincinnati's Pete Rose go for his 
3,631st all-time National League-leading hit. Baseball fans don't have to buy 
tickets, they have the remote control in their hands. They have the veto power. 
They simply won't exercise it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to argue with the gains posted. Fehr, as did Marvin Miller before 
him, likes to behave as if he is representing the girls in the Triangle 
Shirtwaist Fire, but the ante has gone steadily up for these hired hands who 
not only don't make shirts in a sweatshop but who are probably the most visible 
bunch of underachievers in the labor force. They fail at what they do two out 
of every three times. They sign $43-million contracts, with a $10-million 
signing bonus -- then they go out and sell their autographs. In many cases, 
they refuse to help promote the game that makes them all this money. 
</P>
<P>
 The gains they have made are hardly made on the picket line. Free agency came 
about mainly because owner Charlie Finley neglected to put part of pitcher 
Catfish Hunter's salary in an insurance fund and a three-man arbitration 
committee declared him a free agent. A permanent arbitrator -- which was to 
turn out to be the owners' Little Big Horn -- was put in place by the owners 
themselves, by a vote of 22-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaries, of course, escalated. But that was due not so much to labor activity 
as to the presence of a new and well-heeled player in the game, television. At 
one point, television was paying $14 million a year to each club. It was a 
major reason baseball's average salary went from $35,000 a year in 1975 to 
$326,000 by 1984 to more than $1 million today, with nearly 200 players making 
more than $2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But baseball teams play 162 games a year compared with 82 for basketball teams 
and 16 for football teams. A baseball game is hardly the event the others are 
-- as CBS was to discover to its sorrow. CBS paid $1.06 billion for the grand 
old game -- and lost its shirt. Today, baseball merely takes its cut of TV 
revenue with the networks. In short, it only gets what it earns, based on how 
it performs. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad the players can't do the same. When last seen, baseball was paying 
about $50 million to players who were no longer performing at all -- and at 
least one team, the Dodgers, were paying millions to a player (see Darryl 
Strawberry) who was performing for another team and beating their brains out. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a game anymore. It's an industry. It's barnacled with agents, 
accountants, superstations, licensing fees, strikes, lockouts, corked bats and 
card shows. It's run by and for millionaires. It's not "Casey at the Bat" 
anymore, it's Casey at the Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 When I think of Grandpa crawling around those belt lines at Pratt & Whitney 
for 54 years, I could cry. Strike Losses 
</P>
<P>
 Players who would lose the most in salary during each day of a strike, with 
1994 salary, daily loss and total loss if the strike lasts from Aug. 12 through 
the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaries listed do not include prorated shares of signing bonuses or other 
guaranteed income, or incentive bonuses earned or money lost because of lost 
opportunities for incentive bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily loss is calculated by dividing 1994 salary by 183, the number of days 
scheduled for the 1994 season. The method was established in a 1983 decision by 
arbitrator Raymond Goetz dealing with salaries during the 1981 strike.

FULLERTON'S NOE CAPTURES U.S. AMATEUR TITLE; GOLF: BELIEVED TO BE FIRST 
NON-U.S. CITIZEN TO WIN, SOUTH KOREA NATIVE CARRIES ON WOODS' TRADITION. 
</P>

<P>
 Terry Noe of Fullerton defeated fellow Californian Andy Barnes, 2-up, Saturday 
to win the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship at Echo Lake Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Noe, a South Korea native playing in his third tournament in the United 
States, is a student at Sunny Hills High and the 1992 South Korea junior 
champion. He is believed to be the first non-U.S. citizen to capture the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Noe's victory was the fourth in a row for Orange County residents. The 
previous three tournaments were won by Cypress' Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 In the championship match, Barnes took the lead on the first hole, holing a 
sand shot for birdie. Noe drew even with a par on the short par-4 second, then 
Barnes parred the third to regain the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Noe birdied the fifth and parred the eighth for a 1-up lead, then moved to 
2-up with a par on No. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Noe birdied the 16th to give him a 2-up lead with two holes to play. Barnes 
got one back at 17, but lost the 18th hole when he put his first two shots into 
the fairway rough while Noe placed his second shot, a 25-foot approach shot, 
two feet past the hole, prompting Barnes to concede the putt and the victory to 
Noe. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the possible putt on the 18th hole, Noe said, "I didn't care 
about that. I just wanted to make par on the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Noe, playing in the tournament for the first time, said, "When I got here this 
week I just wanted to make the stroke-play cut. The course was really tough for 
me in the practice round, but when I got to match play, I felt more 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Noe had a relatively easy time in the morning semifinal, eliminating Mauricio 
Muniz of Puerto Rico, 5 and 3. Barnes defeated Charles Howell of Augusta, Ga., 
1-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Noe's victory earned him a spot in the U.S. Amateur Championship next month.

THE BRICKYARD 400; A NEW TRADITION ROARS TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HERMAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Indianapolis Motor Speedway revels in its traditions. But the 
door-bangin', tire-smokin', bumper-to-bumper world of NASCAR racing hasn't been 
one of them -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brickyard 400 stock car race, a form of motorsports once considered heresy 
within Indy's hallowed concrete walls, makes its debut Saturday. Its own 
traditions will come later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a big history guy, or tradition, but (winning the first race) would 
really even to me mean a lot, because I know it will be in the history books," 
said NASCAR driver Mark Martin. "That would be really, really special to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin lived in North Liberty, Ind., for about two years. He was 150 miles 
north of the famed Indy oval; he might as well have been on the other side of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just out of high school, and I was pretty young and pretty dumb," the 
35-year-old driver said. "I had a lot to learn about racing and everything 
else. I never dreamed and never had an interest coming out here because I never 
expected I'd race here. I sure didn't think NASCAR would race here." 
</P>
<P>
 So how did the good ol' boys end up at a track known since the infancy of the 
sport as a magnet for the top drivers in the world? 
</P>
<P>
 It was due to the efforts of Tony George, the president of the Speedway and 
the grandson of the late Tony Hulman, who rescued the track and, many believe, 
the sport itself after a decline during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to my first stock car race in probably July of 1976, and when (John) 
Cooper was president here I went to Talladega and saw a race there," George 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched it develop and grow over the last 10 to 15 years and started to 
follow it more closely and realized it would be a good show to bring here if we 
ever had another event," he said. "Subsequently, I broached it with my family." 
</P>
<P>
 George's mother, Mari Hulman George, is the Speedway board chairman; his 
grandmother, Mary Fendrich Hulman, is chairman emeritus; his three sisters are 
members of the board. Tampering with a one-race-a-year tradition was serious 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't really comfortable with the idea at first," said George, who 
raised it a couple of years ago. "After several months, they started becoming 
more comfortable with it and we got the approval (from the board) to go ahead 
and try to start to negotiate another event." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine NASCAR drivers tested at Indianapolis in June 1992. But even then, the 
public heard only rumors of a second race at Indy. It wasn't until the 
following year, after new outside walls and safety fences were built and 
warm-up lanes in the corners were added, that George confirmed the historic 
marriage between NASCAR and Indy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, more than 30 NASCAR drivers took part in two days of tests on the 
2 1/2-mile oval, a narrower and flatter surface than the high-banked NASCAR 
tracks. What was once the exclusive domain of such names as Foyt, Unser, 
Andretti, Mears and Fittipaldi now belonged also to such drivers as Martin, 
Rusty Wallace, Ernie Irvan, Dale Earnhardt, Ricky Rudd, Darrell Waltrip, Bill 
Elliott and transplanted Hoosier Jeff Gordon, the NASCAR rookie of the year in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the king of stock car racing, Richard Petty, became a part of Indy 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Petty, who retired after the 1992 season, took four ceremonial laps during the 
test session last year and donated his No. 43 Pontiac to the Speedway Hall of 
Fame Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had got a chance to run here, but the time didn't come," he said. "I 
always felt Indianapolis was really responsible in one way or another for stock 
car racing, because they got a lot of people interested in racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was always THE race. From that standpoint, I would have always liked to 
come here and run stock cars . . . not the Indy cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Petty said the Brickyard 400 will be a "great event. It's going to be good for 
us, good for the Indy-car crowd, good for Indy, good for racing all over the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indy 500 draws crowds routinely estimated at more than 400,000, but nobody 
outside the official Speedway family knows for sure because officials never 
reveal the attendance. And that's one tradition that won't change for the 
Brickyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Speedway admits to more than 250,000 reserved seats, and 
every one will be filled for the Brickyard, which will make it the world's 
second-biggest race crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the money. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the Indy 500 paid the richest purse in auto racing history, $7.86 
million, and the Brickyard already is close to becoming the richest NASCAR 
race. The posted purse is $2.69 million, and accessory prizes could raise the 
total payoff above the NASCAR-record $2.76 million set in February for the 
Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
 George is more than pleased with his favorite step-child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of the fact we're going to have a second event here, and all 
indications are it's going to be very successful and well received," George 
said. "A second event was never totally discounted here, but it had to be 
something that was worthwhile and had enough merit to stand on its own." 
</P>
<P>
 The 160-lap Brickyard, which will be televised lived by ABC, will be the first 
non-Indy car race at the Speedway in more than 80 years. If last year's testing 
is any indication, it indeed will stand on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 85,000 to 100,000 people paid $5 apiece to watch more than 1,100 
laps during the two days of testing. While the NASCAR crowd couldn't match the 
blurring speeds of Indy cars -- the fastest laps were by Elliott at 167.467 
m.p.h.; Martin, 165.905; and Gordon, who grew up in nearby Pittsboro, Ind., at 
165.868 -- they pointed to another reason for the increasing popularity of 
stock car racing in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our cars are conducive to smoking the tires and rubbing the doors and running 
inches apart," Martin said. "They're built to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not built to run 230 m.p.h. around this place, and won't do it. And 
if they would, we couldn't get near each other," he said. "For competitiveness' 
sake, it doesn't matter if we're going 165 or 160, or 230, if they're all in 
there smoking and gouging and going for it. It's going to be really, really 
exciting. But it won't be 230 m.p.h., which is a whole different thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But who cares? Certainly not the drivers. About 75 to 80 entries are expected, 
considerably higher than the 50 to 60 that normally comprise the NASCAR Winston 
Cup entry list for a given race. A number of drivers from the Winston West 
series are expected to give it a shot, along with a handful of Indy-car 
regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 A.J. Foyt, a four-time Indy 500 winner who won seven NASCAR races in the 1960s 
and early '70s, is entered and already has tested at the Speedway in 
anticipation of the Brickyard. It would be Foyt's first race since he retired 
more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Indy driver Davy Jones also has entered; former Indy winner Danny Sullivan has 
practiced here in a stock car, and seven-time Indy veteran John Andretti joined 
the NASCAR circuit last fall. In May, Andretti became the first driver to 
compete at Indianapolis and in NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600 the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying will begin on Aug. 4. That procedure will be completely different 
from the Indy 500, which uses a four-lap average to determine the 
three-abreast, 33-car lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 In NASCAR, each driver gets one lap to qualify. They'll line up at the south 
end of the pits and go out one-by-one, taking the green flag without even a 
full warmup lap. As soon as each qualifier pulls off the track, the next will 
go out. The fastest 20 on the first day will be locked in position and cannot 
be bumped. The next-fastest 20 who qualify either that day or the next will 
also get in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 NASCAR also has the option of adding up to four more. Most likely, they would 
be the top two drivers in the season point standings who are not among the 40 
qualifiers; one driver from the Winston West series; and any past NASCAR 
champion who raced last year but was not among the fastest 40 qualifiers or 
this year's point leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Then at last, on race day, after they've been positioned two-abreast on the 
track, they'll hear Indy's most famous command: "Gentlemen, start your 
engines." 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, it's tradition.

JUMPING INTO RETIREMENT; MARTINA NAVRATILOVA WILL GO OUT AT THE END OF THE YEAR 
STILL NEAR THE TOP OF THE HILL, BUT IT HAS BEEN QUITE A CLIMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 We are at 35,000 feet above the Rocky Mountains and Martina Navratilova says 
what she really wants to do is jump out of an aircraft. This is not what you 
expect to hear, so you quickly look around to check where the cabin doors are. 
</P>
<P>
 Martina does not stir in her black, lace-up boots. She sits calmly in her 
seat, expertly peeling a mango. Her miniature fox terrier, known as K.D. 
(Killer Dog) and possibly the most disagreeable canine in tennis, rests at her 
side under a small cloud of a pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, the craft from which Martina says she wants to jump is a 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no plans for next year," she says, "except helicopter skiing." 
</P>
<P>
 This activity features a person in skis jumping out of a helicopter at the top 
of a mountain and skiing down very fast. It is regarded as fun by many, 
including a 37-year-old would-be helicopter skier named Navratilova, who is 
also the greatest women's tennis player of all time. Watch that first step. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems pretty clear that at this point in her life, Navratilova's focus has 
shifted to what will be her last step. 
</P>
<P>
 The end is in sight already for Navratilova, whose 22-year career in tennis 
will end when she hits her last ball in her last match in her last tournament 
in November at Madison Square Garden in the Virginia Slims Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, we have the Martina Farewell Tour, a yearlong event that so far 
has included unexpected success on the grass courts of Wimbledon and next week 
will feature her last tournament in Los Angeles, this one to be played out on 
the green-painted hard courts of the Manhattan Country Club in the Virginia 
Slims of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 For the woman who has won more tennis tournaments than anyone, who has 18 
Grand Slam singles titles, who has won nearly $20 million in prize money, who 
has won at least two tournaments a year for the last 19 years, who has been 
ranked in the top five for the last 20 years . . . well, let's simply say that 
after 22 years of tennis, helicopter skiing is looking pretty good right now. 
</P>
<P>
 And how will women's tennis fare in the post-Navratilova era? If a 37-year-old 
Navratilova can be ranked No. 4 and still make the final at Wimbledon, that 
indicates her departure might create a void as big as Centre Court. She's not 
going to change her mind, by the way, and stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the right time for me to leave," Navratilova says. "If it's not 
the right time for the game, then I say tough luck. I gave it about 10 more 
years than it had the right to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel like I would be contributing much anyway next year because my 
heart's not in it. I wouldn't be doing anybody any good." 
</P>
<P>
 So here's the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 She is playing six or seven more tournaments, but maybe not the U.S. Open, to 
which she isn't committed yet, but certainly the Virginia Slims Championships. 
That's it for tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, by December, Navratilova's house will finally be completed on her 
100-acre spread in Aspen, Colo. She can move out of the barn in which she is 
staying now and return sole custody of it to her three horses. 
</P>
<P>
 When she gets to her bedroom, she can pick up her jewelry pouch from the 
dresser and pull out the plug of grass she removed from Centre Court on her 
final visit, right after she lost to Conchita Martinez four weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in January, it's off to Canada and that skiing trip with the airborne ski 
lift. After that, who knows? At the very least, Navratilova has a lot to think 
about, if she ever feels comfortable doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The years all start running together," she says. "I can't remember what year 
. . . I remember the decade, I can't remember the year. That just means that 
I've been playing a long time. It's all a blink when you think about it, the 
last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends say, 'Oh, don't retire, don't retire,' and you know I'm not retiring, 
I'm just not going to play tennis. I'm going to have a blast." 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, the blast is going to have to wait. TELL US, MARTINA, IS IT NOISY 
IN BOISE? 
</P>
<P>
 The day before Navratilova and her New Jersey Stars teammates show up in 
Boise, Ida., to play a TeamTennis match, Rick and Jon Leach of the Idaho 
Sneakers go kayaking on the Payette River. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was cool," Jon Leach says. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but as experiences go, it can't compare with Rick Leach's when he asks 
for one of Navratilova's rackets after the match and she gives him one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going in the trophy case," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova has a contract to play one more year of World TeamTennis, a 
struggling, monthlong exhibition series featuring mostly minor players in 
mostly minor cities. The highest-ranking men's player is San Antonio's Christo 
van Rensburg, who is No. 147 on the ATP Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 In these bush leagues, Navratilova is unquestionably the star. She is 
introduced by the public-address announcer as "the greatest lady in tennis," 
and the nearly 3,000 in the stands seem to agree. Hundreds form lines at the 
exits after the match hoping for an autograph while Navratilova holds an 
impromptu news conference on court. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody asks about her greatest rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy question. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Evert is 39 and has two young sons. She also lives in Aspen, not too far 
from Navratilova, which probably isn't that surprising because their proximity 
to one another was the major story line of women's tennis for 16 years, 
1973-88. 
</P>
<P>
 They played 80 matches, 189 sets and 12 tiebreakers. Navratilova held a 43-37 
advantage and won 13 consecutive times in a span of nearly three years from 
1982 to '85. If anyone fully appreciates how dominant Navratilova was in that 
period, it is Evert. 
</P>
<P>
 "She won the match before I stepped on the court," Evert says. "I knew I 
couldn't win. Mentally, she had already won. And I was No. 2 in the world . . . 
imagine what she was doing to the other players. She was invincible." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova can't recall what invincibility felt like. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so long ago, I don't remember," she says. "But I knew I was going to 
win. That takes a lot of pressure off. I knew even if I didn't play my average, 
I would still win. I could do that even against the top players. I was playing 
so well, my average was that much better than anybody else. It's like you 
forget how to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova was 89-14 in 1981, 90-3 in 1982, 86-1 in 1983 and 78-2 in 1984, 
the year her 74-match winning streak finally ended with a loss to Helena Sukova 
that December in the semifinals of the Australian Open. She won 15 tournaments 
in 1982, 16 in 1983 and 13 in 1984 on her way to a record 167 titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Evert was not surprised by Navratilova's Wimbledon farewell, not after Steffi 
Graf was defeated in the first round. And even though Navratilova's quest for a 
10th Wimbledon singles title fell short, Evert is not convinced it was all that 
bad a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was the signal, 'Martina, it's time to stop,' " says Evert, who 
retired in 1989. "If she had won, in her mind, she might have made the wrong 
decision about not playing. Let's face it, you always want to go out on top, 
but (John) McEnroe, myself, Jimmy (Connors), Billie Jean (King), we all didn't 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "So losing at Wimbledon was a blessing in disguise for Martina. I think she's 
more comfortable now with her retirement. Billie Jean was playing on and losing 
to people she shouldn't have and she didn't care. But Martina, she's going out 
on top, and that's important to a player." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova and Evert have grown closer over the years, but there was a time 
when they probably would have preferred to jam a racket down the other's 
throat. They didn't have much to do with one another, except on court. It was 
the women's tennis answer to Bjorn Borg-McEnroe as tennis shot to greater 
popularity, fueled by the spectacle of rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
 "People love rivalries," Navratilova says. "You've got to have rivalries, and 
we certainly had it going. Most of the times, one of us was No. 1 and the other 
was No. 2. It's hard to have a rivalry between No. 1 and No. 10 or No. 3 and 
No. 8 or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova says the reason she didn't get along with Evert was because she 
was being coached that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Lieberman, who had been a noted college basketball player at Old 
Dominion, began working with Navratilova to toughen her mental approach and to 
strengthen her body. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a couple of years when I was beating Chris and Nancy was sort of 
saying, 'You've got to hate your opponents,' " Navratilova says. "So I got a 
little bit carried away with the killer instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 Evert says the first match that Lieberman saw Navratilova play was in Amelia 
Island, Fla., in 1981, the final of the Women's International Tennis Assn. 
championships. Evert won, 6-0, 6-0. At that point in the series, Evert had won 
27 of the first 40 matches against Navratilova. After that match, Navratilova 
won 30 of the next 40. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the turning point," Evert says. "I did her a favor beating her, 6-0, 
6-0. Nancy was asking her how humiliating it was and that was the beginning of 
the new Martina, the whole physical edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman, now Lieberman-Cline, lives in Dallas with her husband and newborn 
son. She has a successful career as a television commentator for basketball 
games and runs a sports marketing company. She also has a softer definition of 
the killer instinct she instilled in Navratilova, with whom she was affiliated 
in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just made her more competitive," Lieberman-Cline says. "For a time, she 
needed to go totally opposite to what she was because she was so passive. 
Mentally, she was competitive, but she had a lot of feeling for the people she 
was playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The example was Chris -- so mentally strong and dominating. Martina went out 
there to play tennis, and Chris went out there for war. In 1981, Martina needed 
to be pushed." 
</P>
<P>
 How a person is perceived is not in the control of that person. Navratilova is 
well aware of this truth, but she believes she is being perceived quite 
differently than in years past. She also believes how she is viewed relative to 
Evert is not as it once was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the perception of the All-American woman has changed over the years," 
Navratilova says. "Chris was the epitome of it in the 1960s and '70s, but in 
the '80s it started changing. Sure, she's still the same great person, but it's 
more accepted to be outspoken, to be a feminist, to have a muscular body, and 
your goal in life is not to be a housewife anymore -- it's to do something with 
your life -- and I fit that mold a lot more than Chris does. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had I been born 20 years later, I would have been accepted much more than I 
have. I've stayed the same, but they have accepted me because attitudes have 
changed." THE FANS LINE UP IN SAN ANTONIO ROWS 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a phalanx of five security guards to get Navratilova into the 
changing room at McFarlin Tennis Center in San Antonio after another World 
TeamTennis match. Navratilova looks weary from all the attention at the scene, 
which is a far cry from the team's afternoon practice when only a few braved 
the broiling sun for a glimpse of her.  
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova is discussing "Forrest Gump," a film she saw the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't let smart people off the hook," she says. "If so-called stupid 
people can perform heroic acts, what does that mean smart people can do?" 
</P>
<P>
 The dream of many tennis fans in San Antonio is to get Navratilova's 
autograph. Some lucky ones get their visors or shirts or programs or pictures 
signed, but many don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Williams also feels fortunate, but for a different reason. Williams is a 
reporter for the Texas Triangle, a biweekly gay and lesbian publication in 
Austin. Navratilova has agreed to give him an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 27 and I have been aware of the Martina phenomenon since I was 8," 
Williams says. "She's been a role model my whole life, even before I knew what 
gay was or that I was gay. A lot of people see her as a major leader in the 
movement after her retirement. . . . How could she not be?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone familiar with interviewing Navratilova knows well that she is one of 
the most quotable athletes around. It seems she has an opinion on almost 
everything and is perfectly capable of expressing it. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been something of a recent event that Navratilova has been so 
outspoken about gay issues, dating to the 1992 Colorado anti-gay constitutional 
amendment. Navratilova also caused a stir after Magic Johnson announced that he 
had HIV when she said if a woman had made the same admission, she would have 
been branded as a slut. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova is an extremely popular figure among gays, partly because she is 
so visible. 
</P>
<P>
 She is going to be even more outspoken in her retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be an active activist," she says. "The environment, gay rights, which is 
equal rights. I want the right to adopt a baby, fight for my country, teach in 
school and not be fired because I'm gay, want the right to be married. Gay 
rights are huge because we don't have any." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova's relationships with Rita Mae Brown and Judy Nelson ended badly -- 
Nelson sued Navratilova and reached a multimillion-dollar out-of-court 
settlement. Navratilova's new companion is Danda Jaroljmek, who was among 
Navratilova's many friends staying with her at a rented house in Wimbledon to 
see the last walk on Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Martina Farewell Tour moves on toward its inevitable conclusion, the 
chances to see Navratilova play grow fewer and the anticipated reception for 
her becomes larger. So far, it has been somewhere between amused novelty and 
unbridled hysteria. As usual, Navratilova manages to provoke a reaction, and 
this time, it has been mostly good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it surprising, the level of support I've been getting, particularly 
because I'm gay," she says. "That's kept a lot of people from accepting me for 
a long time, but most of them have gotten over it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still get introduced here and there and I hear jeers and boos from two or 
three people. Chris never had to hear that. I used to have a lot more of it, 
obviously. I still hear it and it hurts. To think that something like that 
would define somebody's perception of you as a human being is pretty scary." 
THE LONG GOODBY 
</P>
<P>
 It's going to take about 11 months for Navratilova to leave, which amounts to 
one month for every two years she has played on the professional tour. 
Navratilova has lasted long enough to win 167 tournaments and that averages out 
to more than seven a year for her 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A left-hander and one of the last serve-and-volley specialists in the women's 
game, Navratilova was born on Oct. 18, 1956 in Prague, in the former 
Czechoslovakia, and grew up in Revnice. She defected to the United States in 
1975 and became a naturalized citizen in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 She won her first Grand Slam singles title in 1978 at Wimbledon when she 
defeated Evert. Her last one was four years ago, also at Wimbledon, when she 
defeated Zina Garrison-Jackson in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova's 1990 Wimbledon title, the ninth she earned on the court inside 
the ivy-covered brick walls on Church Road, might be directly attributed to the 
influence of her mentor, King, and her coach, Craig Kardon. King and Kardon 
rescued Navratilova from so-called burnout in 1989 and turned her around. 
</P>
<P>
 Kardon says he never believed he would have coached Navratilova for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six months, I would have believed that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there are only six months left coaching Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult for me because I don't know how tough to be on her since she's 
going to be stopping," Kardon says. "It's been a real roller coaster. That 
makes what happened at Wimbledon so unbelievable. She was losing so many bad 
matches on clay, I didn't know if she was even going to make it to Wimbledon 
after losing in the first round of the French Open." 
</P>
<P>
 Through a spokesperson, King says she will not talk about Navratilova. King 
says she would be interviewed only about TeamTennis. 
</P>
<P>
 As Navratilova's doubles partner for most of the 1980s, Pam Shriver knew 
Navratilova as a player and a person as well as anyone. Shriver doesn't expect 
to see anyone like Navratilova again. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an original, she's unique, she's a legend -- who do you replace her 
with?" Shriver says. "Compared to anyone else, Martina kind of stands out even 
more glaringly." 
</P>
<P>
 Together they won 109 consecutive doubles matches and eight consecutive Grand 
Slam titles. How such a successful union could be formed from such a liberal as 
Navratilova and a staunch Republican as Shriver, who played tennis with George 
Bush when he was in office, well, it seems hard to imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova offers an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pam played the right side and I played the left side," Navratilova says. "But 
it seemed that (one of us) always played the middle. The Republicans and 
Democrats could learn from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the tour ends, we can reflect on what we have learned from Navratilova. 
Part of it is great tennis -- overpowering, dominating, flamboyant tennis. 
Another part is the opportunity to view a work in progress of a person, a study 
in freedom of expression and lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 So the tour goes on and Navratilova promises to try to keep her mind on her 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been swept up in the emotion yet, except maybe in the beginning, 
but it's going to be hard not to get caught up in it at the end," she says. 
"For now, I still have to play. I have to detach myself. I can get caught up in 
it when it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 And it will be over all too soon. When it is, someone will start writing 
Navratilova's legacy for her. Actually, she has her own walk-away line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I served and volleyed my way through life," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Warm up the helicopter and prepare those skis. Life Phase II is not that far 
off. The first phase has gone better than anyone could have dreamed.

RAIDERS GO LONG WAY TO FACE AN OLD RIVAL; PRO FOOTBALL: EXHIBITION SEASON 
BEGINS AGAINST BRONCOS IN BARCELONA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last season ended for the Raiders on a frigid winter day in Buffalo, N.Y., a 
chill wind blowing in off Lake Erie, their hopes of a Super Bowl berth blown 
away in the second round of the playoffs in a 29-23 loss to the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 This season begins thousands of miles away with an exhibition game against the 
Denver Broncos on a hot, humid summer day in Barcelona, a warm breeze blowing 
in from the Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is, how far have the Raiders really come? 
</P>
<P>
 Not in miles, but in talent. 
</P>
<P>
 They were tantalizingly close to advancing further last season but lacked an 
effective running game and overall depth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have made a lot of changes in the off-season, so many that they 
look good enough on paper to be tabbed the favorites in the AFC West by many. 
</P>
<P>
 But the favorites in July are not always the winners in January. The real test 
begins today when the Raiders and Broncos kick off at 7 p.m. local time (10 
a.m. PDT) at Montjuic Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first of five preseason games for each team. So in the interest of 
saving some wear and tear on the older bodies and getting a good look at some 
of the younger ones, this game will not be anything near the two ferocious 
battles these clubs staged last January at the end of the regular season and 
the start of the playoffs, no matter how much they say they hate each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, three questions, all crucial to the eventual fate of the '94 Raiders, 
must be answered before the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Has their running game improved? 
</P>
<P>
 Do they have an effective middle linebacker? 
</P>
<P>
 Can their new defensive line work smoothly and effectively as a unit? 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Raiders will be without Greg Robinson, last year's leading 
rusher, until at least midseason because of the lingering effects of knee 
surgery, they appear to have more than enough legs to carry them. 
</P>
<P>
 Two holdovers from last season, Ty Montgomery (tailback) and Napoleon McCallum 
(fullback), will join quarterback Jeff Hostetler tonight in the starting 
backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Pushing Montgomery and McCallum will be two off-season acquisitions -- running 
back Harvey Williams from the Kansas City Chiefs and fullback Tom Rathman from 
the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also expected to play are rookie running back Calvin Jones from Nebraska and 
fullback Derrick Gainer, obtained in an off-season trade with the Dallas 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 That's depth. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's middle linebacker, Joe Kelly, was cut, largely because of 
salary-cap considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 In his place are second-year man Greg Biekert, who didn't get any quality time 
at the position last season, and Rob Fredrickson, the team's No. 1 draft 
choice, who is not only trying to jump from college to the pros, but from an 
outside linebacker spot into the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Most teams that lost half their starting defensive line would be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The retirement of Howie Long and the release of Greg Townsend have opened up 
starting spots for Anthony Smith, who had a team-leading 12 1/2 sacks last 
season and 36 over the last three years, and Scott Davis, who unexpectedly 
ended a two-year retirement this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Add the returning inside men -- Chester McGlockton and Nolan Harrison -- and 
the Raiders look as strong as ever if this foursome meshes as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Other new faces to look for are Kevin Gogan, the new right guard obtained as a 
free agent from the Dallas Cowboys; Albert Lewis, the veteran defensive back 
obtained as a free agent from Kansas City, and veterans Jerry Ball (defensive 
line) and Jamie Williams (tight end). 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders and Denver met three times last season with the Raiders winning 
all three, including a first-round playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 That and the off-season battle for free-agent receiver Tim Brown, who wound up 
staying in silver and black, has left a lot of hostility between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect to see much of that bad blood tonight. This time of the year, 
teams are more concerned with their own players than those of the opposing 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 "The regular season is the test," Raider Coach Art Shell said. "This is just a 
quiz." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it would make the Raiders happy if they could start with all the right 
answers.

MIKE DOWNEY: THEN THE BIG BEAR SAID TO ALL THE BABY BEARS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Chapter 1: "It was the time of year when baseball season came around. There 
was a team of boys who were the best in town. There was 'Big Hands Willie' and 
'String Bean Joe,' a short guy named 'Stretch' and a tall guy named 'Mo.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So begins the charmingly illustrated children's story, "Home Run Pete," part 
of a four-book series for kids 5 to 9, also now available on audio cassette 
with narration by the author. 
</P>
<P>
 The books, which also include "The Little Quarterback," "Jill and the Hill" 
and "Jonathan McBoo," are the creations of Shaun Gayle, a 32-year-old graduate 
of Ohio State with a degree in education who also has opened a preschool for 
children 2 to 5 in Highland Park, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 The author plays football for the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 You are familiar with the basketball player who does not wish to be a role 
model for your children. You are familiar with the baseball players who tell 
kids not to use drugs and then use them themselves. You are familiar with the 
tennis players who throw tantrums and with the football players charged with 
familial abuse (and worse). By now you must be in the mood to hear about 
somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Say hello, then, to Shaun LaNard Gayle, a defensive back who was one of the 
captains of the Super Bowl XX championship squad and is currently in camp 
preparing for his 11th season as a Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know why everybody forgets I was one of our captains?" Gayle asks, 
cheerfully, on the phone from training camp in Wisconsin. "Because our other 
captains were all famous: Walter Payton, Jim McMahon, Mike Singletary, Dan 
Hampton and Gary Fencik. And me." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun is single and has no children. One night, he was sitting at home in 
front of his computer, trying to take his mind off the next day's game. 
</P>
<P>
 On a whim, he began tapping out a football fable, "The Little Quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle took the story to practice and gave it to Singletary, a popular 
linebacker and dedicated family man. Singletary took it home to his kids, who 
enjoyed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, one of the reasons I got my degree in education was to make a 
commitment to children, to try to make a better environment for them," Gayle 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not certain why doing these books occurred to me. I do feel a sense of 
urgency to try to improve our society for kids to some degree. It's nice that 
they appreciate what athletes do, but just because someone can jump high or run 
fast isn't reason enough. Adults have to spend time with kids, give them some 
kind of example." 
</P>
<P>
 Home Run Pete, for a very good example. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, Pete, the player who plays "bigger than life -- like he was 10 
feet tall," comes to bat in a big game like Mighty Casey and strikes out. But 
his teammates persuade Pete that trying, not succeeding, is what counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories, in rhyming couplets, are accompanied by wonderful illustrations 
by Patrick Owsley, an artist from Southern California who works as a letterer 
for Malibu Comics Entertainment. The collaborators met for the first time 
recently at the huge American Booksellers Convention in the L.A. Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle would fax his stories to Owsley, who brought them to life. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons these books have taken off is because they offer reading 
material for boys," Gayle says. "It was brought to my attention that a lot of 
the children's stories seemed to be aimed toward young girls, who apparently 
tend to show more interest in reading as a rule. I'm not sure if this means 
that boys tend to go outside and play rather than read, but there really hadn't 
been much of a market out there for books directed toward young boys." 
</P>
<P>
 The books sell for $4.99 each, with a cassette package going for $7.99. Gayle 
says each story teaches kids about persistence, self-esteem, the healthy use of 
their talents and "making right choices." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears' safety, who played in the 1992 Pro Bowl, has launched a preschool 
called "Fit By Five" in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park where the aim is to 
help toddlers learn through physical fitness and games. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle also composed a public letter to parents: 
</P>
<P>
 "The influence of time is tremendous," he writes. "What is heard and seen 
every day will have some type of effect on our kids . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "What was inexcusable 10 years ago, today is commonplace -- making the 
potential of tomorrow less than it should be . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We have to talk and listen to our kids, find out if they know what racism is, 
explain the importance of sacrifice and compassion, teach them the meaning of 
perseverance and faith, give them the moral foundation that seems to be 
disappearing in our society. We have to provide for them what we may not have 
had ourselves, realizing that anything we leave to chance is a chance we cannot 
afford to keep taking."

PASSED BALL DOES THE JOB FOR DODGERS; BASEBALL: TWO RUNS SCORE ON HOUSTON'S 
MISPLAY, GIVING THE BULLPEN A NICE CUSHION IN 6-1 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda gambled on his much-maligned bullpen Saturday night at 
Dodger Stadium. It paid off and the Dodgers spent another night in first place. 
</P>
<P>
 With the bases loaded and two out in the sixth inning and the Dodgers holding 
a 2-1 lead over the Houston Astros, Lasorda sent in a pinch-hitter for Kevin 
Gross. 
</P>
<P>
 The hitter, Dave Hansen, didn't even deliver a hit, but he was standing at the 
plate when catcher Tony Eusebio was the victim of a passed ball that let in two 
runs and led to the Dodgers' 6-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 With the comfortable lead, rookie Ismael Valdes pitched two innings and Todd 
Worrell finished up in the ninth, sending an old-timers' night crowd of 50,880 
home happy and keeping the Dodgers in first place in the National League West 
for the 70th consecutive day. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Henry Rodriguez's ground-rule double had given the Dodgers the 2-1 lead 
earlier in the sixth, loser Darryl Kile had pitched brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
 When he went to a 2-and-2 count on Hansen, he threw a low fastball. Kile has 
10 wild pitches, but this ball back to the backstop was ruled a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez scored easily, followed by a hustling Raul Mondesi. The rookie is in 
a batting slump, but he was alert and scored without a play from second. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers scored twice more in the seventh on a sacrifice fly by Eric Karros 
and a run-scoring single by Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 That put Lasorda in a position where he didn't have to worry if his relievers 
could hold a one-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross had thrown only 70 pitches, but he backed Lasorda's move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't ready to come out," Gross said, "but it turned out fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler said the two victories in a row over Houston had given the 
Dodgers a lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're winning as a team again," he said. "With only two weeks maybe left, the 
pressure is on the Giants to make up the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Valdes, unless he's used too much, might give the Dodgers the stopper they are 
looking for. In four innings in two nights against the Astros, he gave up only 
one run and two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda showed he still doesn't have complete confidence in his stopper. 
Worrell came in to pitch the ninth with a five-run lead, but there were two 
pitchers warming up. 
</P>
<P>
 It was obvious from the start that both starting pitchers, both of whom had 
struggled recently, were back in form. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross (8-7) came into the game winless in the month. In his three previous 
starts, Gross had two losses and a no-decision, giving up 24 hits and 12 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 But mixing his speeds and location, he seemed to baffle the Astros, the last 
team he beat, on June 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross didn't give up a hit until a two-out single by Ken Caminiti in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower end of the Astros' order put Gross in his first jam in the fifth 
inning. Eusebio, the No. 7 hitter, singled to center and Orlando Miller, 
getting a chance to play shortstop after Andujar Cedeno's two errors Friday 
night, singled to left. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kile was unable to sacrifice, the Dodgers turning his bunt into a force at 
third. Gross then disposed of Craig Biggio and Steve Finley to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The versatility of Jeff Bagwell enabled the Astros to tie the score on only 
one hit in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened with a single to left. Then, getting a huge jump on Gross, he easily 
stole second, his 15th steal. Bagwell went to third on Caminiti's grounder and, 
even with the Dodger infield in, he scored without a play on Luis Gonzalez's 
grounder to second.

NEWSWIRE: FORMER AUBURN COACH EAGLES, 45, DIES ON COURT

 Tommy Joe Eagles, basketball coach at the University of New Orleans, collapsed 
while playing basketball Saturday in Salt Lake City and died a short time 
later. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagles was visiting Phoenix Sun assistant Scotty Robertson and several former 
players, who were participating in the Rocky Mountain Revue at the Delta 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Robertson, Eagles and one of his former players, Sun rookie 
forward Aaron Swinson, remained on the floor after practice at Salt Lake 
Community College to work on Swinson's shooting. After throwing a pass to 
Swinson, Eagles collapsed and didn't regain consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics were unable to revive him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a non-drinker, non-smoker and jogger," Robertson said. "He was 
supposedly in excellent shape. We're all just devastated." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagles accepted the New Orleans job in May after resigning from Auburn. A 
Louisiana native who played and later coached at Louisiana Tech, he resigned 
under pressure in March after Auburn posted an 11-17 season. His record at the 
Southeastern Conference school was 64-78 in five seasons. Tennis

EIGHT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THE ANGELS; BASEBALL: THEY END LOSING STREAK BY 
ROUTING THE RANGERS, 14-4, AS DAVIS HITS TWO HOME RUNS AND DRIVES IN SEVEN 
RUNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Angels acknowledge that it's too late to do anything about this season, 
and they are not about to insult anyone's intelligence by claiming they are 
still in a pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
 But in halting an eight-game losing streak with a 14-4 rout Saturday night 
over the Texas Rangers, with designated hitter Chili Davis driving in a 
career-high seven runs in hitting two homers, including a grand slam, the 
Angels unloaded a season's worth of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in the lineup reached base at least twice in the 18-hit attack. Davis 
hit a home run from each side of the plate for the eighth time in his career 
and center fielder Chad Curtis drove in four runs with his career-high 11th 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to win a game eventually," said Davis, whose third-inning grand slam 
triggered the assault. "Man, we had reached the bottom of the barrel. That 
perfect game against us was big-time embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, we needed this one." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a night the Angels (43-62) not only proved to themselves they can win 
again, before a record 46,679 at the Ballpark in Arlington, but most important, 
they have management believing in them. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in two years, the Angels might be leaving town tonight with 
an All-Star closer on their pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how much that would mean to our club," Angel shortstop Gary 
DiSarcina said. "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out we need one. 
</P>
<P>
 "A closer separates the championship clubs from the rest of the group. If you 
don't have one, you can forget it. I think we proved that this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Said starter Chuck Finley: "Obviously, it's too late for this year. But if we 
get someone who can intimidate people, like we had with Harv (Bryan Harvey), 
things will be different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, it would be a huge lift for this pitching staff." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (43-62) will learn today whether General Manager Bill Bavasi can 
acquire All-Star closer Rick Aguilera of the Minnesota Twins. They also have 
expressed interest in closers John Wetteland of Montreal, Randy Myers of the 
Chicago Cubs and Jeff Montgomery of Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 But their most serious negotiations have been with the Twins, confirmed 
Saturday by Twin General Manager Andy MacPhail. The trouble, however, is that 
the Angels still must persuade the Twins to budge from their hefty demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins, according to team sources, were seeking first baseman J.T. Snow; 
starter Brian Anderson (7-5), who won Saturday, or Andrew Lorraine; triple-A 
reliever Troy Percival; and minor league prospect Ryan Hancock or Jeff Schmidt. 
The Twins have also inquired about the availability of starter Phil Leftwich, 
but he has yet to surface in any trade proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 But as much as Bavasi covets Aguilera -- a three-time All-Star who has saved 
at least 30 games for four consecutive years -- he can't create more voids to 
solve one problem. Bavasi figures he can afford to give up a left-handed 
starter, particularly if the Angels sign free-agent Jim Abbott this winter, but 
a four-for-one deal is too steep.

MORNING BRIEFING: ROOKIE REBELS IN PLACE OF A REBEL YELL

<P>
 Defensive tackle Tim Bowens is working out with the Miami Dolphins again after 
leaving for a day on a sour note -- or maybe because he didn't want to hit a 
sour note. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-round draft choice from Mississippi bolted an afternoon session 
because of pranks by his new teammates. Bowens refused to sing his school fight 
song during a lunchtime hazing session. In playful retaliation, a few veteran 
teammates hid the 6-foot-4, 330-pound rookie's shoulder pads in the weight 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowens didn't find it humorous and decided to leave the training facility and 
drive to his Miami Beach apartment. He returned the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was the only person to manage in at least 2,500 baseball 
games and play in at least 2,500 games? 
</P>
<P>
 Can't wait: Only 1,412 days until the next World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 From one who knows: John Elway, who knows what it is to face high expectations 
as a rookie NFL quarterback, has some advice for Heath Shuler, the quarterback 
drafted by the Washington Redskins from Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing Shuler can't do is try to live up to the expectations," Elway told 
Ron Borges of the Boston Globe. "It will be hard enough just to get him where 
he feels comfortable with the offense. It's a huge transition, and some people 
will always expect him to do a little bit more than he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to swallow: From columnist Steve Rosenbloom of the Chicago Sun-Times: 
"Which startling revelation was first to shatter your trust in sports: Don King 
getting indicted for fraud or Hulk Hogan taking steroids?" 
</P>
<P>
 Spit and tell: Hall of Fame pitcher Gaylord Perry has come out with a home 
video, "Baseball's Dirtiest Tricks," which is available by calling 1 (800) 
SPITBAL. 
</P>
<P>
 Matter of time: Charlie Hough, 46, was asked what was bothering his leg, and 
the Florida Marlin knuckleballer said: "It's old." 
</P>
<P>
 Different perspective: Seattle Mariner spokesman Dave Aust notes, "For what 
it's worth, the ceiling panels that fell at the Kingdome were as old as (rookie 
shortstop) Alex Rodriguez." 
</P>
<P>
 Both are 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting around: Mark McKoy, the Olympic 110-meter hurdles champion, was born 
in Guyana, won his gold medal as a resident of Canada and is now competing for 
Austria, where he recently gained citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Booth partners: When Jimmy Johnson missed a recent Fox TV network media party, 
he was chided by fellow NFL broadcaster Terry Bradshaw for not showing up. The 
former Dallas Cowboy coach countered: "Terry talks before he thinks, but I 
don't think it would make any difference if he thought first." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Fred Clarke, an outfielder/playing manager from 1897 to 1915, 
mostly with the Pittsburgh Pirates.

SPAWNING TALENT; OLD CAPE COD, A SUMMER COLLEGE LEAGUE WHERE PLAYERS LOVE TO 
PLAY, PARENTS LOVE TO VISIT, BASEBALL SCOUTS LOVE TO SCOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is another idyllic afternoon on old Cape Cod as Eileen Barr, 15 months, 
arrives at Red Wilson Field in a stroller pushed by her mother, Marianne, and 
sister, Katie, 4. 
</P>
<P>
 John Barr, scouting director of the New York Mets, is combining business with 
pleasure on this trip to the Cape Cod League, the most prestigious of the 
summer college leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 As Eileen sleeps peacefully in the shade of a pine tree behind home plate at 
the Yarmouth-Dennis High School diamond, Barr sets up lawn chairs and takes out 
a notebook and stopwatch as he prepares to watch the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox 
play the Chatham Athletics. He is surrounded by a dozen or more scouts from 
other organizations, all a long way from the big-city tempo and troubled times 
of the strike-threatened major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a throwback to another time and place, or as Barr said: "Players love 
playing here, parents love visiting here and scouts love scouting here." 
</P>
<P>
 On this spit of land that has become a summer vacation retreat for the rich, 
famous and otherwise, from eclectic Provincetown on the Eastern tip to the 
popular restaurants and shops of Hyannis (home of the Kennedys) and continuing 
on to the dramatic seascapes of Woods Hole in the West, the Cape has also been 
a professional baseball breeding ground for more than 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recent major league All-Star game alone, there were nine players who 
had spent a summer or more in the Cape Cod League as amateurs -- Frank Thomas, 
Will Clark, Jeff Bagwell, Chuck Knoblauch, Albert Belle, Mickey Tettleton, 
Craig Biggio, Darrin Fletcher and Jeff Conine. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 90 players currently in the majors who received their 
first extensive experience with a wood bat in Cape Cod. More than 50 players 
selected in the June draft, including three first-round choices, played in the 
Cape last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The major leagues provide the 12-team league with $85,000 to cover bats, 
balls, umpires and scorers. Noted David Mulholland, general manager of the 
Orleans Cardinals: "For $85,000 a year, it's a highly productive minor league 
sustem." 
</P>
<P>
 Restricted to college-eligible players -- 23 to a team, by invitation only -- 
this year's rosters include players from 106 four-year and two-year schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barr: "You may find a better individual player or two on the national 
team or in another collegiate (summer) league, but overall the Cape always has 
the best talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Orrin Freeman, a national crosschecker with the Florida Marlins: "The 
Cape provides us with a chance to see the best college hitters going against 
the best college pitchers, and the best college pitchers going against the best 
college hitters. Very few players who do well with the wood bat here fail to do 
well with it in the pros." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cape's use of wood has forced several other summer leagues to go from 
aluminum to wood to stay competitive. The wood bat, of course, tends to be 
heavier than aluminum -- the mandatory college bat -- and slower through the 
strike zone. It is also less forgiving than aluminum. There are fewer handle 
hits, fewer rocket shots. The sweet spot on a wood bat is much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Cape players have been blessed with a new bat source. Tom Bednark, 
a fourth-generation woodworker who lives in nearby Centerville, has gone into 
the bat-making business under the name of Barnstable Bat Co. His high-quality 
models, produced in his garage workshop, have been a major hit in the Cape 
league, but he does not intend to threaten Louisville Slugger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to sell a hundred a week, enough to make a comfortable living," he 
said. "Louisville throws away more than I make." 
</P>
<P>
 Bednark also has a long attachment to the league here. His grandfather came 
home one day and told Bednark's grandmother that they were moving into the 
garage so that the entire Hyannis team could spend the summer in their 
nine-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
 Host families now house one or two players each. The respective clubs find 20- 
to 28-hour-a-week jobs for their players, and the players pay their host 
families $45 a week. Some families include meals for that, some don't. This is 
the fifth year that Margie and Brian Homer of Yarmouth have acted as hosts to 
Red Sox players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they would provide good role models for our own children," Margie 
Homer said, "and they have. I haven't met one that I haven't liked. I mean, we 
did it for our kids in the beginning, and now we do it for ourselves. We just 
need to be wealthy, so I could go visit them after they move on. Almost all of 
them stay in touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the Homers' former tenants are playing professionally. Two have 
invited them to their weddings this year. Not every experience -- for player or 
host family -- is positive, but every time the Homers, for example, think about 
not doing it anymore, they quickly decide otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only decision we've made after this year is no more pitchers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Homers are currently housing their third pitcher of the summer. The first 
two -- Jason Dawsey of Clemson and replacement Travis Burgus of San Diego 
University -- were both sent home with elbow problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe that the league's coaches sacrifice development for winning, but 
most of the coaches come from small colleges and need the summer income. 
Winning generally translates to rehiring, since each franchise that qualifies 
for the playoffs -- two per division -- figures to make $1,000 to $1,500 a game 
from playoff admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Said John Castleberry, a Marlin scout who previously coached Orleans for nine 
years: "There's a certain amount of development that takes place simply by a 
player going up against the best every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The regular season runs from June 10 through Aug. 5. Teams generally play five 
games a week. The longest drive is 46 miles, from Chatham in the East to 
Wareham in the West. Attendance varies from a few hundred to a few thousand, 
with teams charging only a $1 donation for admission. A crowd of about 4,500 
attended Saturday's All-Star game at Orleans, where the grass along the 
first-base and right-field lines at Eldredge Park is terraced, making for a 
colorful scene of picnicking fans on blankets and lawn chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O'Connor, general counsel to the major league owners' Player Relations 
Committee and owner of a vacation home within walking distance of the Orleans 
park, scanned the All-Star scene and said: "This is what baseball is supposed 
to look like." 
</P>
<P>
 USC shortstop Gabe Alvarez, in his second summer with Chatham and expected to 
be a high draft choice next June, said he tries not to worry about how many 
scouts are watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "The competition is so good that I look on it as an opportunity to improve all 
my tools," he said. "The main thing is, I'm here to enjoy myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The league has several sponsors, but every club is responsible for paying part 
or all of each player's travel costs from and to his home city. The gate does 
not cover budgets, so there are raffles, auctions, card shows, camps and 
clinics. Orleans takes in $30,000 by merchandising T-shirts, caps, etc. in 22 
home dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarmouth-Dennis beefed up attendance recently by advertising that pitcher 
Jason Haynie of South Carolina, who does some juggling, magic and fire eating 
-- stunts he learned with the Circus of the Kids in St. Petersburg, Fla., and 
which he has honed at various school shows and charity events -- would be 
performing after the game. Haynie wowed a crowd of several hundred, including 
teammates, particularly with his fire eating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can blow smoke on or off the mound," he said with a wink, adding that he 
considers himself a performer on or off the mound. "It's just a different kind 
of rush, a different kind of thrill." 
</P>
<P>
 Curly Clement knows the feeling. He's 75, in his 33rd year with the league, 
and still works a game or two a week behind the plate or on the bases as the 
league's evaluator of umpires. "I'm God in this league," he said with a smile. 
He's also the Candy Man, keeping a pocketful of sweets with which to ease a 
manager or player's sour reaction to a call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know when I'm going to hang it up," Clement said after three hours 
behind the plate on a humid afternoon. "I still enjoy it. My wife said she's 
going to wheel me out there if necessary, and she doesn't even like baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 On old Cape Cod, it's hard not liking it.

HANGING ON BY HIS FINGERTIPS; WITH CHARLIE HOUGH'S CAREER SEEMINGLY OVER, THE 
DODGERS' TOM CANDIOTTI IS THE LAST OF THE KNUCKLEBALLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the flamethrowers and the precision artists, there exists a pitcher of 
another kind, the oft-overlooked knuckleballer, whose success can sometimes be 
spoiled by something as trivial as a broken fingernail. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Candiotti is the only knuckleball pitcher remaining in the major leagues, 
a legacy that extends to the few who came before him, but who will come after 
him? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a dinosaur," Candiotti says. 
</P>
<P>
 Trips to Florida will not be the same for Candiotti, who would seek out 
Charlie Hough before games with the Marlins, two pitchers bonded by the 
knuckleball. On Wednesday, days after Hough announced glibly that he was 
rotting, he went on the disabled list because of a degenerated hip, and doctors 
are discussing hip replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, I wore out," said Hough, 46. "Basically, there is no way I can 
pitch again." 
</P>
<P>
 In the history of the game, there have been only 20 pitchers who have used the 
knuckleball for four years or more, a consoling statistic for catchers, most of 
whom would rather inhale sawdust than catch the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather catch (Candiotti) than hit him," Mike Piazza said. "It is funny, 
though, watching the hitters. They will guess and miss by a foot, and they cuss 
and yell and stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Catching him) is just work, you can never relax back there, it's just 
physically and mentally draining on every pitch."  
</P>
<P>
 It is a difficult pitch to master, and one even more difficult to explain. 
Candiotti says he receives mail from all over the country from scientists and 
others who try to explain how a ball thrown with no rotation moves the way it 
does. Hough says he has never understood it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been throwing it for 25 years, and I don't know how the hell it does 
that," Hough says. "But what it means with only Tom left, is that it is really 
hard to throw.  
</P>
<P>
 "There will be another guy who comes along, though, somebody -- Timmy 
Wakefield (of the Pittsburgh Pirates) if he gets it together. I don't think we 
will be (extinct). Some kid will come along and not be able to make it and 
someone will say, try this. Usually we are pitchers who are not quite good 
enough and resort to that as our way of competing." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of a knuckleball depends a lot on weather conditions -- humidity 
helps the movement, thin air can flatten it. And its success depends on 
overcoming the embarrassment that sometimes can be associated with the wildness 
of the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not a lot of people to teach it or that understand it," said 
Candiotti, who has pitched more than 200 innings for all eight full seasons of 
his career, the longest current streak in baseball. "Tommy (Lasorda) does 
because there have been three knuckleball pitchers in this organization, 
Charlie, Hoyt Wilhelm and myself. But some catchers don't want any part of it. 
You get passed balls and walks and guys steal bases." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most humorous questions asked Candiotti came in a postgame 
interview session recently, when a reporter asked what pitch he had working 
during a game. "Knuckleball, knuckleball and knuckleball," Kevin Gross wryly 
interjected.  
</P>
<P>
 There are derivative pitches of Candiotti's knuckleball -- slow knuckleball 
and hard knuckleball -- but it is not his only pitch.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has a good curveball, a fastball and a cutter," said Carlos Hernandez, who 
catches Candiotti most of the time, which gives Piazza a rest. "He throws 
around 70%-30% knuckleballs to other pitches. But I love to catch him. You 
don't know where his pitches are going, but sometimes I can see when he lets it 
go whether it will be a good knuckleball or a bad knuckleball." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the specialty of the skill, though, the irony is that a knuckleball 
pitcher, no matter how good, is not considered to be an ace. Aces, most say, 
throw smoke, not a ball that looks like a slow pitch in a softball game. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you watch a knuckleball pitcher and he loses, he tends to look bad," 
Hough said, "but when a guy with a great arm loses, you say, 'What a great arm, 
he lost, tough luck.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Candiotti, if not the ace, has been a savior for the Dodgers this season, 
particularly on their recent 13-game trip, when he pitched four times in four 
cities. During that stretch, he gave up eight runs in 27 2/3 innings, for a 
2.60 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have the courage to throw a knuckleball you have to have a lot of 
confidence in yourself," said Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president. 
"Rearing back and throwing the ball 90-plus, Tom can't do that. But what Tom 
and Charlie Hough have in great similarity is that when the count is 3 and 2 
they are not afraid to throw the knuckleball. It's like staring at a 20-foot 
downhill putt and believing you are going to put it in." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the final game of another bad Dodger trip this season when Candiotti 
demonstrated his competitive character. The team, which had suffered through 
three losses on the trip blown by the bullpen, needed a solid outing from 
Candiotti so the relievers could regroup. Candiotti, making his first start 
since the bullpen had blown a 9-4 lead for him in the seventh inning in an 
eventual 11-10 loss to the Marlins, pitched a five-hitter, beating the Chicago 
Cubs, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "That game against the Marlins put the team in a downward spiral and it was 
difficult mentally," said Candiotti, who is 7-6 this season with a 3.73 ERA. 
"But I think it's a credit to anybody not to carry a grudge, and for us to be 
able to bounce back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accept the role of being a supportive pitcher or an ace or whatever anybody 
wants to call me. But somebody sure thought I was pretty good to open the 
(1991) playoffs up in Toronto." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stuck on the 24th floor of a hotel recently and waiting for 20 minutes for an 
elevator was a group of Dodger players trying to get to the ballpark. Waiting 
outside the hotel was the team bus, which doesn't wait for anybody.  
</P>
<P>
 The players thought about taking the stairs, but then would hear the elevator, 
which never stopped. Finally Candiotti searched around and found the service 
elevator. Wearing suits -- it was getaway day -- and carrying luggage, they 
piled in among the garbage cans, a situation in which Candiotti felt quite 
comfortable. "Those years in Toronto paid off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the second half of the 1991 season, Candiotti lived in the SkyDome 
Hotel above center field and used to go to work with the maids and the garbage 
men on the service elevator. He had been traded to the contending Blue Jays by 
the Cleveland Indians, for whom he had pitched seemingly unnoticed for 5 1/2 
seasons. But the Dodgers had their eye on him, noticing that Candiotti's 2.65 
ERA at the end of 1991 was among the best in the American League. They went 
after Candiotti, a free agent, signing him to a four-year, $15.5-million 
contract at the age of 34. The Blue Jays offered only three years. 
</P>
<P>
 By signing with the Dodgers, though, Candiotti missed out on two championship 
rings. "It was OK, though," said Candiotti, who lives in Los Angeles with his 
wife, Donna. "I was rooting for those guys. Before I signed with the Dodgers, 
in 1991, the Dodgers finished one game out from winning the division. There was 
no way of knowing what would happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Victories have not come easily for Dodger starters the last couple of seasons, 
but Candiotti has seemingly suffered most. Last season he had the lowest run 
support in the majors -- 2.53 runs per game -- and in 1992, he had the 
second-lowest run support in the league. But he finished both seasons with an 
ERA of 3.12 or less, last season finishing in the top 10 for the fourth time in 
eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough the last couple of years, not getting a lot of runs to work 
with, but it made me a lot better pitcher last season," Candiotti said. "It 
made me tougher mentally. I would say, two runs, that's all I've got.  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember in Cleveland, I pitched 10 innings in a game and lost in the 10th 
by one run, 1-0 or 2-1. So when I was traded to Toronto, I thought that it 
would be great with their offense and all. But it started happening and I 
remember Manager Cito (Gaston) saying, 'Oh no, Candi, not again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti learned the knuckleball from his father, Caesar, in front of their 
house in Concord, Calif. After Candiotti graduated from St. Mary's College in 
1979, there was little interest from major league baseball, so he signed with 
an independent team in Victoria, British Columbia. He bounced around in the 
Kansas City and Milwaukee organizations, before Cleveland signed him to a 
triple-A contract in 1985. But Candiotti had thrown out his arm, and had 
reconstructive surgery after the 1982 season. After that, he started using the 
knuckleball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a staff saver for us," Dodger pitching coach Ron Perranoski said. 
"He has filled in on two days' rest, three days' rest and he has been sharper 
and sharper the last five or six starts." 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti says he wants to keep pitching as long as he can. "Phil Niekro was 
48 or 49 and Wilhelm was 49 and Charlie is 46," said Candiotti, who is 36. "In 
the history of baseball, I am only the 20th pitcher that's used the pitch for 
four years or more." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hough: "I didn't know there were that many."

SALARY CAP PUTS KELLY WITH RAMS; FOOTBALL: SWITCH FROM SILVER AND BLACK TO BLUE 
AND GOLD WAS PROMPTED BY THE ECONOMIC MOVES THE TEAMS HAD TO MAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Dallas wide receiver Michael Irvin has called it "ridiculous." Minnesota 
quarterback Warren Moon says it "stinks." Former quarterback Phil Simms has 
several adjectives for it, most of them unprintable. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the NFL's new $34.6-million salary cap, and it's the reason Ram 
linebacker Joe Kelly will spend his Sunday afternoons this fall in Anaheim 
Stadium instead of the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 An eight-year starter with Cincinnati and the New York Jets, Kelly was cut in 
April by the Raiders, who no longer needed him as their starting middle 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason -- Caponomics. 
</P>
<P>
 A signing bonus and incentive bonuses drove Kelly's $600,000 annual salary to 
nearly $900,000, and the Raiders thought it was too much to spend on their 
starting middle linebacker, who finished second on the team in tackles with 
103. 
</P>
<P>
 "The salary cap was the death of Joe Kelly with the Raiders," said Steve 
Feldman, Kelly's Newport Beach-based agent. "Here's a guy who got cut for all 
the wrong reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Three months have passed since the Raiders cut Kelly, whom they signed as an 
unrestricted free agent before the 1993 season. Does he harbor any resentment? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never resentful about it," he said. "My wife was really upset and all 
my teammates were upset. But I've been in the league nine years and nothing 
really surprises me." 
</P>
<P>
 The salary cap has meant major pay cuts for veteran players such as Kelly, who 
signed a one-year, $500,000 deal with the Rams in May.  
</P>
<P>
 "The game as I see it now won't field the best players," Kelly said. "With the 
cap, there won't be a team in the league with the 11-best guys on defense or 
offense because of the financial structure." 
</P>
<P>
 But who's to blame? Perhaps the players themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly didn't vote on the proposal. Now he wishes he had. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the vote) was a group thing," he said. "A lot of us with the Raiders 
didn't agree with it (the cap) because we knew with that system you were going 
to have a defensive end, a running back, quarterback, wide receiver who were 
paid well, but not everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the proven veterans, like myself, would get caught up in the cap. Why 
keep a veteran who's making $800,000 at a position when you have a rookie who's 
making $108,000?" 
</P>
<P>
 Teams once cut down rosters almost entirely in August, but with the cap, they 
must make many decisions before going to camp. Kelly was one such decision for 
the Raiders. Money had become as much a factor as age, injuries and skill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably had my best pro season last year," Kelly said. "Nobody really 
expected anything out of me when I came to the Raiders. All I told (owner) Al 
Davis and (Coach) Art Shell was all that I wanted was a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders cut Kelly shortly before April's draft, leaving the 29-year-old to 
test the free-agent market for the second time in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wasn't expecting it (the cut)," he said. "If you ask anybody on that 
Raider team, I would be one of the last names that would have been mentioned as 
someone they would have to look at as far as salary." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram linebackers coach Dick Selcer, who coached Kelly as a rookie in 
Cincinnati, was more than a little surprised to see the linebacker in the 
free-agent market after last season. Kelly talked to several teams, but chose 
the Rams over the Washington Redksins because of his relationship with Selcer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's versatility gives the Rams some much-needed depth at linebacker. His 
strength and hitting ability made him a run-stopper with the Raiders. And 
although Kelly can back up Shane Conlan at middle linebacker, Selcer thinks 
Kelly's speed puts him in contention for the starting outside linebacker jobs 
with Henry Rolling and Roman Phifer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe is versatile in the sense that he can play regular in our nickel-back 
situations or he can cover," Selcer said. "You can play him in goal-line 
situations and on special teams. He'll be involved in all facets of the game, 
the kind of guy you won't have to take out of a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is just the way Kelly likes it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come to this camp facing the same thing as last year," he said. "I don't 
have to prove that I can play because I know I can. But I have to show the Rams 
that I wasn't cut because of my abilities. I can come in here and contribute."

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; ROOKIE KLEIN PUTS ON SHOW FOR 
ATLANTA

 Rookie quarterback Perry Klein scrambled five yards for a touchdown with 37 
seconds left Saturday, lifting the Atlanta Falcons past the San Diego Chargers, 
21-17, in the annual Hall of Fame exhibition game at Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, a fourth-round draft choice from C.W. Post, dropped back on third and 
goal, then sprinted to the right corner of the end zone.He had earlier 
completed a pass to rookie Bert Emanuel -- a converted quarterback -- for a 
41-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein's touchdown run, set up by a late interception, capped what had been a 
frustrating fourth quarter for the Falcons and gave them their first lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a couple of things like a rookie, but overall I was happy," said June 
Jones, Atlanta's coach. "When we worked Perry out, that was the thing we first 
noticed about him and liked about him, his accuracy on the deep ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, who played at Carson, Palisades and Santa Monica highs, moved Atlanta 
into scoring range two other times in the quarter. But he barely overthrew a 
diving Joe Rogers in the end zone with about 10 minutes left and another pass 
was intercepted by Chris Johnson at the Chargers' nine with 4:38 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Stoyanovich kicked a 21-yard field goal with 2:57 to play after the New 
York Giants fumbled a punt and the Miami Dolphins rallied in the second half 
for a 20-19 victory in the exhibition opener for both teams at East Rutherford, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The game featured the NFL's first two-point conversion. It came on a pass from 
Dolphin backup quarterback Doug Pederson to tight end Rob Coons and followed a 
one-yard, fourth-down touchdown run by Irving Spikes.

CRUSTY GRANT PROVES EMOTIONAL AT CANTON; HALL OF FAME: IN HIS INDUCTION SPEECH, 
THE FORMER VIKING COACH WEEPS AS HE RECALLS HIS PARENTS' ROLE IN HIS SUCCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cold, calculating, stone-faced image Bud Grant cultivated during 18 years 
as coach of the Minnesota Vikings dissolved Saturday as he choked back tears 
during his enshrinement into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Inducted along with Grant during a frequently emotional ceremony that lasted 
more than two hours were Dallas running back Tony Dorsett, San Francisco 
cornerback Jimmy Johnson, Cleveland running back Leroy Kelly, St. Louis and 
Dallas tight end Jackie Smith and Dallas defensive tackle Randy White. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the acceptance speeches were more poignant than Grant's. Many in the 
audience had to wipe away tears as he credited his father with inspiring him to 
make it in professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was born, my name was Harry," Grant said. "I was a Junior. Well, you 
can't have two Harrys in the same house, so my mom nicknamed me Buddy Boy and 
dad called me Kid. Buddy Boy got shortened. Maybe if I was a boxer, I would 
have been Kid Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't imagine what an honor this is. If Mom was here -- she's 93 and 
couldn't make it -- I'd look at the pride in her face. If Dad was here, he'd 
stand up and say, 'The kid made it. He finally made it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In 18 years with the Vikings from 1967 to 1985, Grant went 158-96-5, leading 
his team to the Super Bowl four times -- all losses. But he noted that he left 
the game on his own, never getting fired from his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to succeed -- survive is maybe a better word -- you've got to 
handle losing," he said. "You die every time you lose, but you've got to get 
over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's induction came 18 years after he was first eligible, perhaps because 
his accomplishments with the Browns always seemed overshadowed by those of his 
predecessor, Hall of Famer Jim Brown. The seniors committee acted to put Kelly 
in the Hall this year. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown abruptly retired in 1966 to pursue an acting career, Kelly stepped 
in, and Cleveland's offense scarcely missed a beat. He led the NFL in rushing 
in 1967 and '68 and scored 90 touchdowns in his 10-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 White and Dorsett were teammates during some of the best seasons of Tom 
Landry's Cowboys in the 1970s and '80s. Although both were highly publicized 
athletes in college, neither was a sure thing in the professional ranks -- 
Dorsett because of his size, White because the Cowboys initially played him out 
of position at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Landry presented Dorsett for induction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody said I'd be too small to play pro football at 188 pounds," said 
Dorsett, who as a youngster once loaded his pockets with rocks in an 
unsuccessful attempt to boost his weight above the minimum required to play 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never dreamed I'd play 12 seasons. The man in the hat, Coach Landry, 
brought me along. He taught me discipline. He taught me to set goals. These are 
things you take with you in life."

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; THIS GIVES TALKING HEADS NEW MEANING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Today, the Raiders will be on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 And we're not only talking about radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the rest of the NFL, the Raiders will begin experimenting with an 
electronic receiver in the quarterback's helmet, enabling a coach on the 
sidelines with a microphone to send in plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The play will be called, as always, by offensive coordinator Tom Walsh in the 
press box and radioed to the sidelines. From there, receiver coach Fred 
Biletnikoff will call in the play to Jeff Hostetler on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The system was tested in practice Saturday and Hostetler said that, while the 
volume was fine, it seemed strange to be hearing a voice in his helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 He also had another complaint: "There's no talkback." 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Coach Art Shell, with a big smile, "We don't want him to talk back." 
</P>
<P>
 The system is supposed to be turned off in the final 15 seconds of the 
40-second allotment between plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they shut it off fast," Hostetler said, "so I don't have to listen to 
it on the way up to the line." 
</P>
<P>
 The chances of opponents tuning in is said to be remote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure hope the game doesn't come to that," Shell said. "That would be total 
espionage." 
</P>
<P>

 The Raiders and Denver Broncos will have met five times by the time 1994 ends. 
That includes the regular-season finale last January, a playoff game the next 
week, today's American Bowl and the upcoming regular season. STEVE SPRINGER

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MCMURTRY RETURNS, BUT STOKES DOESN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wide receiver Greg McMurtry returned to training camp, but defensive end Fred 
Stokes didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after walking out because he thought the Rams were releasing him, 
McMurtry rejoined the team for Saturday's afternoon workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also learned that Stokes, who strained a ligament in his left knee 
Friday, will be out for three weeks but will not need surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry, one of 11 receivers battling to make the team, turned in his 
playbook Friday and flew home to Michigan. He thought his chances of making the 
team were slim.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Rams retained the contract rights of the free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said McMurtry looked good in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made a couple of good catches," Knox said, "so maybe going and coming back 
helped him." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes said he will wear a brace and expects to begin rehabilitation on an 
exercise bike and in the swimming pool as early as Monday. He is confident he 
will be ready for the Rams' Sept. 4 season-opener against the Arizona 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just thankful that it (three weeks) isn't any longer and it won't require 
surgery," he said. "I've never had any problems with my knees before." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes, who had 9 1/2 sacks last season, injured his knee during one-on-one 
drills against rookie offensive lineman Ronald Edwards. Stokes said he thought 
he tore a ligament when he first went down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it on film and it looked a lot worse than it was," Stokes said. "I was 
trying to make an inside move, and I tripped over (Edwards') foot and my foot 
planted with my weight on it and I fell on the side of my knee." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Players missing practice besides Stokes were defensive tackle Marc Boutte 
(right knee), cornerback Steve Israel (right thigh), linebacker Joe Kelly 
(right hamstring), defensive end Kevin Patrick (left shoulder) and wide 
receiver Jermaine Ross (right hamstring). MIKE REILLEY

MAJOR? U.S. OPEN MORE LIKE A MAJOR PAIN TO NAVRATILOVA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How much does Martina Navratilova like the U.S. Open? 
</P>
<P>
 Not much. In fact, the four-time U.S. Open champion is considering skipping it 
in her last year of playing tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she's not into it, the worst thing she could do is play," said Pam 
Shriver, her former doubles partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova's list of complaints about the U.S. Open is long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most unenjoyable tournament in the world," Navratilova said. "It's 
great when you win it, everything else is a pain in the butt. There is nothing 
good about it. The facility itself, to think that they built it specifically 
for tennis is frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova said the players' facilities are poor, the speeds of the courts 
differ, the ticket policies are confusing and always changing, the smoke from 
the concession stands bothers players, there are problems with most of the 
courts, including lighting, and that's not all. 
</P>
<P>
 "They even run out of balls during the match," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will miss the spectators, the helpers in the locker room, I will miss the 
atmosphere, but I won't miss anything else." THOMAS BONK

FULLERTON'S NOE ADDS U.S. TITLE TO SOUTH KOREAN AMATEUR CROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry Noe of Fullerton, a resident of the United States for less than two 
years, defeated fellow Californian Andy Barnes, 2-up, on Saturday to win the 
U.S. Junior Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Noe was the 1992 South Korean national junior champion, but he had played in 
only two tournaments previously in this country.Noe's victory earned him a spot 
in the U.S. Amateur Championship next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, of Stockton, took the lead on the first hole, holing a sand shot for 
birdie. Noe drew even with a par on the short par-four second, then Barnes 
parred the third to regain the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Noe birdied the fifth and parred the eighth for a 1-up lead, then moved to 
2-up with a par on 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes won the 15th, but Noe's birdie on 16 gave him a 2-up lead with two 
holes to play. Barnes got one back at 17, but lost the 18th hole when he put 
his first two shots into the fairway rough. 
</P>
<P>
 Noe, playing in the tournament for the first time, eliminated Mauricio Muniz 
of Puerto Rico, 5 and 3, in the morning semifinal. Barnes defeated Charles 
Howell of Augusta, Ga., 1-up.

CORKED BATS; GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF 'BATGATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAL BOCK, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a double-edged mystery about the strange saga of Cleveland's Albert 
Belle and the corked bat. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there is the matter of identifying the undersized second story man who 
went through a tiny crawlspace filled with air conditioning ducts and 
insulation at Comiskey Park to get into the umpires' dressing room and 
temporarily lift the evidence. Cleveland, remember, is the same franchise once 
owned by the man who sent 3-foot-7 Eddie Gaedel to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there is the question of exactly what Belle thought he was going to 
accomplish if he indeed was corking his bat. The Indians slugger, who doesn't 
say much in the best of times and even less at moments like this, is not 
telling. It is interesting to note, however, that Belle had 26 home runs before 
his bat was confiscated and seven in nine games without it. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks at Louisville Slugger have done extensive testing on the effects of 
plugging the middle of bats with stuff other than wood. "What it does," said 
Chuck Schupp, manager of professional baseball promotions for the company, "is 
reduce weight which produces quicker bat speed. But it also reduces mass so the 
bat doesn't drive the ball as far." 
</P>
<P>
 This Albert, remember, is Belle. The Albert who did all that work with energy 
and mass was Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
 And if it's a lighter bat Belle wanted, he needed only change from his 
standard model B343, a 35-inch, 33-ounce Louisville Slugger, to something 
lighter. The up side to that solution is that it would be legal and avoid 
six-day suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate," Schupp said. "First, it's something he doesn't need and 
second, now people wonder how long he'd been doing it and it casts a shadow on 
his accomplishments." 
</P>
<P>
 Professor Robert Adair, who teaches physics at Yale University and has done 
his own tinkering with bats, said there are other legal options that would not 
have gotten Belle in hot water with American League president Bobby Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could choke up three-quarters of an inch," Adair said. "He could saw 
three-eighths of an inch off the end. He could use a lighter wood." 
</P>
<P>
 The point, Adair said, is corking the bat doesn't change things much. "A 
corked bat will increase bat speed but won't hit the ball as far," he said. 
"You also reduce the length of the sweet spot. How far you hit a ball depends 
on mass. If you want a really light bat, try swinging one made of Styrofoam. 
The ball would brush it away because it's not heavy enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a given speed, a light bat won't hit a ball as far as a heavy one." 
</P>
<P>
 So why fool around with the wood? Adair thinks he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say you're being paid $1 million to hit .260," he said. "It's June and you're 
hitting .225. Your timing is all messed up, but you love your bat. So you drill 
a six-inch hole, fill it with cork, plug it, smear it with tobacco juice so the 
umpire won't notice and suddenly, your 32-ounce bat is 30 ounces. Your swing is 
quick and your timing is back. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be better off leaving it hollow, although that might not sound right." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Di Tullio, an instructor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, thinks 
he has a better idea. If you want a quicker bat, he reasoned, make the bat more 
aerodynamic. And to do that, you merely borrow the dimples that make golf balls 
fly great distances. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Tullio pressed various patterns of dimples into the ends of bats and tested 
them in MIT's wind tunnel. When he got it just right, he patented the bat and 
took it out to Fenway Park to let some of the Boston Red Sox try it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the guys liked it," he said, "but more of them couldn't tell the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 No surprise there. In this season of offense, the Red Sox are near the bottom 
in American League team batting. What would they know about hitting? 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot that players believe about the science of hitting has nothing to do 
with the law of physics," Schupp said. "Their point of reference is the guy 
sitting at the next locker." 
</P>
<P>
 If the guy sitting next to Belle is 3-foot-7, we may have solved the mystery.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; JACKIE AUTRY PROOF THAT OWNERS STILL DON'T GET IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That was a nasty, bitter and misleading statement released by Angel owner 
Jackie Autry in response to the players' union's Aug. 12 strike date. Autry 
said she was disappointed by the action at a time when the players are making 
more money than ever and added: 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . To deprive the fans of postseason play merely because they would be 
hurting the owners the most is shortsighted on their part. What they fail to 
recognize is they will be removing money from their own current money stream 
for 1995 and beyond which cannot be made up financially by a strike no matter 
what the length. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is also distressful that such hatred continues from union leadership. We 
do not want to end free agency. Nor do we want to break up the union. Quite the 
contrary. We believe positive, forward-thinking and strong union leadership 
would be an asset to the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatred from union leadership? What hatred? The union, as any labor union 
would, is simply acting to protect its rights at a time when the owners might 
unilaterally implement a system that would restrict salaries, eliminate 
arbitration and, indeed, significantly damage free agency, all rights the union 
has won in negotiation with the owners and which have been upheld by the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Positive, forward-thinking and strong union leadership? When have Marvin 
Miller and Don Fehr exhibited anything but that? They have argued in vain with 
a series of owners, commissioners and management negotiators that a true 
partnership must involve the players in the making of decisions, but their 
forward-thinking concepts regarding TV, marketing, the draft and revenue 
generating in general have been blatantly ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 It has always been the goal of most owners to break the union, and that 
remains their goal. It took the owners -- squabbling among themselves in a big- 
and small-market battle that betrays their own insistence that the overall 
industry is on the verge of financial doom -- 18 months to formulate and 
present their salary-cap proposal, painting the players into a no-win corner. 
</P>
<P>
 If the industry's economic problems are so forbidding, why won't the clubs 
simply increase their revenue sharing without linking it to a salary cap that 
forces the players to pay back the big-market clubs for their generosity to the 
small-market clubs? 
</P>
<P>
 If the owners are so united on this, why won't their chief negotiator, Richard 
Ravitch, let any of them join him during negotiating sessions, and why did he 
shove through a rule requiring 75% approval of any settlement in the event of a 
work stoppage? 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake. The players are definitely being paid more than they ever 
have, but it's the owners who are paying them. No one held a gun to the their 
head in the process. No player forced the owners into their collusion, an act 
that destroyed union trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake. If the fans are deprived of the postseason -- interesting 
that Autry seems to state it as if it were already a fact -- it will be the 
owners who have shut down the asylum. ROCKIES ROAD 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible that a second-year expansion team is about to embarrass the 
National League West worse than the sub-.500 Dodgers and San Francisco Giants 
already have? The Colorado Rockies are in the thick of the race. The Angels led 
the American League on July 5, 1962, the latest a second-year expansion team 
has held first place. Mal Florence's headline in The Times the day before read: 
"Heaven Can Wait! Angels First on Fourth." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies' quest was dealt a severe blow Thursday as first baseman Andres 
Galarraga suffered a broken hand when hit by a Dave Burba pitch. "The Cat" will 
miss the remainder of the season, no matter how far it goes. He was on the 
disabled list twice last year when the Rockies set an NL expansion record with 
67 victories -- averaging 5.1 runs a game when he played, 3.6 when he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big shoes to fill," General Manager Bob Gebhard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest yet in a season when the Rockies have stayed in contention despite 
the loss of their No. 1 pitcher of last year, Armando Reynoso; their No. 1 
reliever, Darren Holmes, and their No. 1 free-agent acquisition, outfielder 
Ellis Burks. All have gone down with injuries, but the Rockies have received 
unexpected seasons from the recycled Marvin Freeman (10-2), Mike Kingery 
(.340-plus) and Bruce Ruffin (16 saves). 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies will try to replace Galarraga by committee. In the meantime, 
acknowledging that the Rockies would be 14 or 15 games behind the Atlanta 
Braves if it weren't for realignment, Gebhard said he was "still thrilled and 
pleased to be in the hunt," adding: "We're a couple years ahead of where we 
expected to be. No one could have anticipated we'd be fighting for a division 
title, but we haven't really focused on that. We're still trying to take it a 
game at a time and not lose sight of our long-range developmental plan. We 
don't want to make a move that would be foolish in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Gebhard said he is looking beyond Aug. 12. So is moderate 
owner Jerry McMorris, who does not expect the season to resume if the players 
go out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know some players think that after a two- to four-day strike, it will all 
be over and we'll be back to work," McMorris said. "If that's true, that we 
could fix this thing so easily, it's a real shame we've come to this stage. My 
sense is it will take some time. We as an organization would not plan on 
playing again this year (if a strike begins on Aug. 12). 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, the resolve among this ownership group is pretty hard and pretty 
deep. I don't think the industry has ever been in this dire shape. By the same 
token, it's never had the players making this kind of money. There's a feeling 
among many of these clubs that something has to be done. Fortunately, we're not 
in those economic straits, but there's only a handful of clubs like us." 
STATIONARY TARGET 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to take shots at Dodger Executive Vice President Fred Claire for 
his reluctance to give up a promising outfielder -- Billy Ashley and/or Todd 
Hollandsworth, for example -- in exchange for a proven closer such as Randy 
Myers (whom he once shunned as a free agent in favor of signing Todd Worrell) 
or John Franco (once a Dodger minor leaguer). Yet, there is logic to his 
position: Why trade the future on the slim chance that the season will last 
beyond Aug. 12? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's at odds with everything we're trying to do," said Claire, whose plan 
is to build from within. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, how often does a club get the chance to win a race, of any 
length? And can the Dodgers hold on without stability from a bullpen that has 
blown 19 saves while the manager insists that roles aren't important? 
</P>
<P>
 Even Claire's own relievers are questioning his status quo stance. "Medieval 
torture," Jim Gott said in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the final day for trading without waivers, and Claire said the 
uncertainty of the schedule has definitely encumbered the market. Maybe he 
shouldn't have let it get to this point, but who would have thought that 
Worrell and/or Gott wouldn't have regained some consistency? 
</P>
<P>
 How much weight does Claire place on being first on the 12th? 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't any day in August or September that you don't want to be in first 
place," he said. "But I don't think there's anything we could be doing to 
prepare for it that we haven't done already." REMEMBERING 1981 
</P>
<P>
 John McNamara, now an instructor in the Angels' organization, still finds it 
hard to digest. He was managing the Cincinnati Reds in 1981 when the 50-day 
strike split the season in half. The Reds had the best overall record in 
baseball, but finished second in each half, to the Dodgers and the Houston 
Astros, and didn't make the playoffs. The Dodgers beat the Astros in the 
mini-playoff, beat the Montreal Expos in the league playoff and beat the New 
York Yankees in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "That still hurts," McNamara said of the way the champions were determined and 
the season split. "It didn't sit well then and it doesn't sit well now. I'll 
feel it was unfair to the day I die. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Commissioner) Bowie Kuhn just wanted the big-market teams in there, and it 
was very, very tough to take -- just as tough as the '86 World Series (when he 
managed the Boston Red Sox and ultimately lost to the New York Mets after Bill 
Buckner's error). 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that separates the hurt is time. That was like a death in the 
family. I still live and grieve. What else can you do." 
</P>
<P>
 On opening day of the 1982 season, General Manager Dick Wagner unfurled a flag 
over Riverfront Stadium that read: "1981 Cincinnati Reds, Best Record in 
Baseball." A photo was taken with the team holding the flag, but McNamara can't 
be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't find me in that picture," he said. "I hid behind somebody. I did 
not want to be part of that."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; NAMES AND NUMBERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 * THE DIAGNOSIS: How relieved was Philadelphia Phillie first baseman John Kruk 
to learn that those abdominal lumps stemmed from a muscle strain and didn't 
represent a cancer recurrence? It went beyond the obvious, the pot-bellied Kruk 
said, adding: "At least, now I know I have a muscle in my stomach. A lot of 
people didn't think I did." 
</P>
<P>
 * REHAB: Fed up with Rob Dibble's incessant bugging that he is ready to pitch 
after spring shoulder surgery, the disbelieving Cincinnati Reds have sent their 
one-time closer to Indianapolis on a 30-day rehabilitation assignment. The Reds 
let Dibble throw batting practice before leaving, and he almost beheaded Jerome 
Walton and Deion Sanders before Manager Davey Johnson called the 25-pitch 
workout over after 15 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, Dibble can't even spell location," Johnson said. "That's it. He 
isn't going to maim my hitters. If he wants to pitch under game situations, he 
can go to the minors, where those kids are used to dodging bullets. In fact, 
I'll escort him to the border to make sure he crosses it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dibble: "I can't spell location? L-o-c-a-t-i-o-n. My wife told me how. I 
can count to three too." 
</P>
<P>
 * ADD REDS: Although first in the National League Central after finishing 
fifth in the West last year, attendance is down 52,000, which owner Marge 
Schott blames on the Riverfront Stadium smoking ban, while others cite the 
attraction of new Jacobs Field in Cleveland, only 250 miles away. Schott is 
fighting the ban in City Council; says the poor crowds are an embarrassment to 
her players and will serve as grand marshal of a tobacco festival parade in 
Ripley, Ohio, next month. "I'm doing it for the economy," she said, lighting 
up. "Lots of people in that industry are losing their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 * CHOP TALK: The Atlanta Braves began the weekend with a 60-41 record, 2 1/2 
games behind the Montreal Expos in the NL East. Last season at this stage, en 
route to 104 victories, they were 59-42, seven games behind the San Francisco 
Giants. Nevertheless, the impression is that the Braves have regressed, with 
inconsistent pitching from their vaunted rotation aside from Greg Maddux, 
chronically spotty relief again and a station-to-station offense devoid of the 
speed of Sanders and Otis Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Expo General Manager Kevin Malone said: "The Braves have more power, but 
bullpen and speed are our big advantages. We steal bases. Our outfielders get 
to more balls in the gap." 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal reliever Mel Rojas added: "They're like an American League team now. 
They sit back and wait for the home run." 
</P>
<P>
 * BRONX BOMBERS? The New York Yankees are patiently putting away the American 
League East. They began a weekend series against the Cleveland Indians leading 
the league in runs, but it's more the result of discipline than power. They 
also were leading the league in walks and on-base percentage while a modest 
fifth in home runs. Hitting coach Rick Down said: "My philosophy is you're only 
as good as the pitch you swing at."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; YANKEES ROLL PAST INDIANS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Paul O'Neill, it was simply a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't give up," he said after ending a 22-at-bat slump with an RBI double 
that helped the New York Yankees defeat the Cleveland Indians, 6-5, Saturday at 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to continue to go out there and play hard and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 What happened Saturday was simple. With O'Neill's help, the Yankees won their 
10th in a row over the Indians since Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score 4-4 in the sixth, Mike Gallego and Pat Kelly singled with one 
out against Larry Casian (1-5). Wade Boggs singled with two out against Derek 
Lilliquist for the go-ahead run and O'Neill's double made the score 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this game you go through ups and downs," said O'Neill, who has a .355 
average. "Maybe I can go on an upswing now. When the team's winning, it makes 
it easier to go through a personal thing. We've played real well the last two 
weeks, so it's been good for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Ausanio (2-0) gave up one hit in 1 2/3 innings -- Carlos Baerga's 15th 
home run of the season in the eighth. Steve Howe got two outs for his 14th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Belle hit his 35th homer and ninth in 12 games for the Indians, who 
have lost all eight games against the Yankees this season. Belle will begin 
serving a six-day suspension Monday for using a corked bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 4, Seattle 2 -- Jack McDowell pitched a five-hitter and Frank Thomas 
hit his 36th homer as the White Sox moved a game ahead of Cleveland in the AL 
Central with their victory at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell (9-8) struck out seven and walked one in his fourth complete game. He 
won for the sixth time in seven decisions, and is 9-1 against the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the sixth in a row for the road-weary Mariners, who have spent 10 
consecutive days away from home because of roof problems in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 5, Minnesota 4 -- Brent Mayne singled home pinch-runner Vince 
Coleman with one out in the 11th inning to lead the Royals at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hamelin led off the 11th with a single and advanced to second on Felix 
Jose's single against Mark Guthrie (4-2). After Coleman ran for Hamelin and 
Erik Schullstrom replaced Guthrie, Terry Shumpert advanced the runners with a 
sacrifice and Mayne followed with the game-winning single. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 14, Oakland 2 -- Chad Kreuter tied a major league record with three 
sacrifice flies, and Milt Cuyler went three for four with a home run to lead 
the Tigers at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kreuter became the ninth player to hit three sacrifice flies in a game, and 
the first since Toronto's George Bell did it in 1990 against Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuyler, who had been on the disabled list since May 26, is nine for 16 with 
eight runs scored in five games since returning. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Brosius had a single and a home run for the Athletics, whose five-game 
winning streak ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 5, Boston 1 -- Cal Eldred gave up four hits in six innings to 
outduel Roger Clemens as the Brewers won for the seventh time in their last 
nine road games. 
</P>
<P>
 John Jaha led off the fourth at Boston with his 11th home run and Jody Reed, 
who played for Boston in 1988-92, hit a three-run shot in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 7, Toronto 5 -- Leo Gomez hit a home run in a three-run seventh 
inning that carried the Orioles at Baltimore. Harold Baines also homered for 
the Orioles, who ended a four-game losing streak. Dwight Smith and Mark 
McLemore each had three singles in Baltimore's 15-hit attack.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; GAETTI, LEFFERTS WON'T BE STRIKING OUT

<P>
 While major league players will not be paid in the event of a strike, the 
Angels still are required to pay two of their former players. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels were informed Friday that they must continue to pay the salaries of 
former Angel third baseman Gary Gaetti and former pitcher Craig Lefferts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaetti, who was released in June, 1993, and signed by the Kansas City Royals, 
still is being paid $2.89 million this season by the Angels and will be paid if 
there is an Aug. 12 strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts, who was released July 9 and did not re-sign with anyone, will be 
paid his $400,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the beauty of the whole thing," Gaetti said, laughing. "Oh well, they 
didn't do anything to help me when I was out there. I found out that some of 
the people who were booing me were getting their tickets from Angel employees. 
That's not right. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to make me quit, and I almost did (in 1992). 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just terrible out there." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ranger starter Kenny Rogers, never to be mistaken again with the 
country-western singer, received a surprise telegram when he came to the 
ballpark: 
</P>
<P>
 "For about the last year and a half, I kept hearing about a baseball player 
with my name. After last night, you'll be hearing about a singer with your 
name. Congratulations. I wish I could have been there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kenny Rogers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Rogers' biggest decision over the weekend was deciding whether to 
appear on David Letterman or "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
 His decision? 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman. 
</P>

 First baseman J.T. Snow was moved to the No. 3 spot in the lineup for the 
first time this season in a promotion that is expected to last at least until 
Tim Salmon returns this week from the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of surprised," said Snow, who is batting .274 with three homers 
and 10 runs batted in since July 5. "I'm used to coming in each day and seeing 
that 6 or 7 next to my name. I think I'll get some good pitches to hit with 
Chili (Davis) behind me. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann: "He's been hitting the ball well, and 
besides, we've got to do something to get us started." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting pitcher Chuck Finley, chiding Rod Carew upon seeing him the day after 
the perfect game: 
</P>
<P>
 "How can a hitting coach even show his face today."

</P>
<P>
 Just what is the unique aspect of the Angels and Dodgers being home at the 
same time this week? 
</P>
<P>
 Fans will have the opportunity to see the three worst teams in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Mariners and the Angels have the two worst records in the American 
League, and the only team with a worst record is the Padres, who are playing 
the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former Ranger pitching coach Tom House on Rogers' perfect game: "The book on 
him everywhere was dumb and durable. I'm just repeating, not creating. He 
always had the pitches to be a starter, but didn't seem to keep his focus for 
more than one or two innings. He was hyper, like Mitch (Williams), and 
relieving seemed to suit him." BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Kauffman Stadium, home of the Kansas City Royals, will have a much different 
look next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Like nearby Arrowhead Stadium, home of the NFL's Chiefs, Kauffman Stadium will 
replace its artificial turf with natural grass for next season, along with 
moving fences in and lowering them from 12 feet to nine feet.

 "By putting in grass, we needed to add some offense to the park, and the only

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; PORTUGAL, STRAWBERRY POWER THE GIANTS PAST ROCKIES, 
6-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If this really is a pennant race, the San Francisco Giants are putting on as 
much pressure as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Portugal pitched effectively for eight innings and hit a two-run double, 
and Darryl Strawberry hit a home run Saturday, leading the Giants to a 6-4 
victory over the Colorado Rockies at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I'm getting too much credit," Strawberry said. "I just want to fit in. 
I want it to be 'us' as a team. It's nice for me to be playing and getting 
comfortable with baseball again." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the Giants' 16th in 20 games. San Francisco, which was 9 1/2 
games behind the Dodgers on July 7, stayed one game behind after the Dodgers 
victory over Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal (10-7), who has hit safely in 13 of 20 starts, capped a three-run 
rally in the fourth inning with a double. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big hit," he said. "It gave us a little cushion when we needed it. A 
lot of it has to do with luck. I just happened to get the good part of the bat 
on the ball and kept it between the lines. I basically just tried to put the 
ball in play." 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal gave up nine hits and four runs, three earned, in eight innings. Rod 
Beck pitched the ninth for his 25th save in as many tries, his 67th in his last 
69 opportunities. Last year, Beck set a league record with 24 consecutive 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, who joined the Giants on July 7, made a fourth-inning error in 
right field but had a double and his third home run, a solo shot in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants took a 2-0 lead in the second against Kevin Ritz (4-5). Matt 
Williams singled and went to third on Strawberry's double. After Todd Benzinger 
walked to load the bases, Williams scored on Royce Clayton's groundout. 
Strawberry then scored on Ritz's wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 5, Atlanta 2 -- Lenny Dykstra hit a two-run triple to highlight a 
four-run rally in the ninth inning at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies battered reliever Greg McMichael (5-3) for four consecutive hits 
in the ninth to send the Braves to their eighth loss in 13 games. McMichael, 
who started the ninth protecting a 2-1 lead, has blown nine saves in 29 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Heathcliff Slocumb (5-1) pitched one scoreless inning of relief and Doug Jones 
earned his 27th save by getting the final three outs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Batiste beat out an infield single in the ninth, and Mike Lieberthal 
doubled. Pinch-hitter Mickey Morandini blooped a single to right, scoring 
Batiste with the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 7, Florida 3 -- Sean Berry drove in the go-ahead run in the seventh 
and hit a three-run triple in the ninth at Miami. The first-place Expos have 
won 10 of 11 to open a 3 1/2-game lead over the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 Rondell White and Marquis Grissom hit home runs for the Expos, who sent the 
Marlins to their fifth consecutive loss. Tim Scott (5-2) was the winner and 
Mark Gardner (3-4) the loser. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 3, New York 2 -- Pinch-hitter Lloyd McClendon singled over a 
five-man infield with the bases loaded and none out in the 10th inning after 
Carlos Garcia doubled and Roger Mason (2-5) walked Jay Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Miceli (2-0) pitched one scoreless inning for the victory at Pittsburgh. 
Bret Saberhagen was one out away from stretching his winning streak to six but 
gave up an RBI single to Steve Pegues that tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 7, San Diego 6 -- Jeff Branson hit a two-run home run and Bret 
Boone went three for four with two RBIs as the Reds won at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Schourek (6-2) pitched 6 2/3 innings, giving up one run on nine hits, 
with six strikeouts and one walk. Jeff Brantley pitched the final 2 1/3 innings 
for his 12th save, giving up one hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Branson hit his home run to right field in the second against Andy Ashby 
(4-11), who has lost five starts in a row and is 0-6 lifetime against 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 10, Chicago 7 -- Gregg Jefferies hit a two-run home run as Bob 
Tewksbury and the Cardinals ended slumps in the game at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferies had three hits, including his 11th homer, as the Cardinals stopped a 
six-game losing streak. St. Louis had lost 19 of its previous 28 home games. 
Tewksbury (11-10) gave up six runs and 11 hits in 5 1/3 innings to stop his 
three-game skid. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Banks (8-10) gave up seven runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings. Banks 
is 0-4 in his last five starts with an 11.31 ERA.

 The trading deadline for deals without obtaining waivers is at midnight

 Claire again emphasized that the Dodgers will not trade any of their young 
prospects for a quick fix in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that in the people we have here and the guys we're developing in the 
system, we have a strong bullpen for the future," Claire said.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular of the former Dodgers at the old-timers' game Saturday 
night was Sweet Lou Johnson, the meteoric star of the mid-'60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Few remember that Johnson was a member of the 1961 expansion Angels. "I made 
such an impression that halfway through the first game in their history, they 
traded me to Toronto for Leon Wagner," Johnson said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the old Dodgers, for the most part, were heavier and looked 
older. Willie Davis was an exception. The slender center fielder hasn't gained 
an ounce in two decades. He looked ready to take off on one of his graceful 
runs for a triple. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Davis, the last Dodger to win a batting championship -- in 1962-63 -- is 
a bit heavier, but he can still swing a potent bat. During batting practice he 
hit one into the left-field bullpen and during the game he lashed a ball into 
the gap in left-center to drive in the first run. 
</P>
<P>
 Clem Labine, who came West from Brooklyn in 1958, remembered how tough it was 
to pitch in the Coliseum with its close screen in left. "We had a poor first 
season," he recalled, "but we won it all the next year and the fans loved us."

THERE'S MORE THAN JUST BRICK AT THE 'BRICKYARD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HERMAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why is it called the "Brickyard 400?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, considering the Indianapolis Motor Speedway once was paved with more 
than 3 million bricks, the name is a perfect fit for what soon will be the 
richest stock car race in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 NASCAR's debut at the Speedway Aug. 6 will be the first non-Indy car race in 
more than 80 years on the 2 1/2-mile track, built early this century as a 
testing ground for the new automobile industry. 
</P>
<P>
 It originally was covered with crushed stone and tar, then paved with the 
bone-jarring bricks and resurfaced three times after that with asphalt. The 
nickname "Brickyard" endured, however, even though all that's left of the 
original brick is a 36-inch strip that crosses the main straightaway at the 
start-finish line, producing a nostalgic "thump-thump" every time a car passes 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl G. Fisher, a barnstorming racer from Greensburg, Ind., and an automotive 
pioneer who later turned a Florida swamp into Miami Beach, was the father of 
the most famous race track in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher was one of the first daredevils who drove those newfangled contraptions 
on the half-mile, dirt-covered county fair circuit. He made $20,000 in 1901 by 
racing a one-cylinder Winton against horses and by carrying passengers in his 
car at $10 a ride. But he made his fortune with partner James A. Allison, 
founding the Prest-O-Lite company in Indianapolis to compress carbide gas for 
auto lighting systems. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Henry Ford replaced his standard equipment oil lamps with electric 
lights, Fisher and Allison were millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher proposed construction of a race track in 1908. He joined Allison, 
Arthur C. Newby, the manufacturer of the National automobile, and Fred H. 
Wheeler, a carburetor maker, in forming the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corp. 
the next year, hoping to use the facility not only to test and race cars but 
also to lure other automakers to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 European cars were dominating American entries in international competition at 
the time, and Fisher believed U.S. factories could catch up by developing their 
products at the Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 He picked a spot along the old Ben Hur interurban line to Crawfordsville, 
northwest of Indianapolis at the time but now within the city limits, and the 
track opened in June 1909. 
</P>
<P>
 There were a series of automobile, motorcycle and even balloon races at the 
Speedway that year and the next; Fisher himself was the pilot of one balloon in 
the first event at the track. 
</P>
<P>
 The first automobile race at the Speedway was on Aug. 19, 1909, a 5-mile dash 
won by local industrialist Louis Schwitzer, whose name now is memorialized on 
an annual Indianapolis 500 award for automotive innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The first feature race was a 250-miler won by Bob Burman that same day. 
</P>
<P>
 The first deaths at the Speedway also occurred in that race, when driver 
William Borque and riding mechanic Harry Holcomb were killed in a crash on the 
main straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis Strang, the 1908 American Automobile Association national champion, won 
the featured 100-miler the next day. Lee Lynch was the winner of the featured 
event the final day of the three-day meet in a scheduled 300-mile race that was 
called off after 225 miles when Charles Merz's car lost a tire and plunged into 
the crowd, killing mechanic Claude Kellum and spectators Homer Joliff and James 
West. Two others were seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Fisher and his partners decided that the stone and tar surface was 
too dangerous and had the track paved with 3.2 million bricks. Thomas R. 
Marshall, then Indiana governor and later U.S. vice president, laid the last 
brick: 52 pounds of gold-plated silver. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly nicknamed "Brickyard" opened Dec. 17, 1909 in near-zero weather for 
a two-day series of short trials. Strang won the first 5-mile dash; John Aitken 
won a 20-mile free-for-all; and Strang won the second-day feature. There were 
no accidents either day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Speedway was back in business. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1910, there were a series races in May, July and September. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Harroun, the AAA national champion from Indianapolis, won a 200-miler in 
May and announced at the end of the season that he was retiring. Later, Fisher 
and his partners decided one large event would serve as a proper showcase for 
the track, and Harroun was talked back behind the wheel of his 
Indianapolis-built Marmon Wasp for the first Indianapolis 500 on May 30, 1911. 
</P>
<P>
 His was the only one of the 40 cars that did not carry a riding mechanic with 
the driver, so Harroun installed a mirror to enable him to see traffic behind 
him. According to legend, it was the first use of a rear-view mirror in an 
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Harroun won the inaugural Indy 500 at 74.602 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bricks, like the stone and tar before them, were not the ideal surface 
for racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very bumpy ride," recalled Duke Nalon, who got his start as a riding 
mechanic in the '30s and twice won the pole position as driver. "It wore you 
out mentally, especially if the style of the driver was to set the car sideways 
through the turns. We used relief drivers because of the track conditions and 
the heat coming off the engine. The track is like a boulevard now." 
</P>
<P>
 Nalon, 81 and living in Indianapolis, is one of the few people who can make 
that comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing third in 1948, he started on the pole in 1949 in one of the 
most famous Indy cars ever built, the Novi, but was severely burned in a fiery 
crash. He was out of racing until late 1950, then came back and won the pole in 
1951.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1930s were the deadliest decade at the Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 22 drivers, mechanics and spectators killed from 1930-39, about a 
third of the 65 deaths since the track opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the reason was the cars," said Speedway historian Bob Laycock. "They 
called it the 'junk formula.' People literally entered souped up stock cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher shut down the track during World War I and turned it over to the 
government for use as an aviation repair depot and landing field. The 500 
returned after the war, but within a few years Fisher was considering tearing 
down the track because "it has accomplished its purpose" to establish the 
superiority of American cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker, a World War I flying ace who drove at Indy from 
1912-16, bought the track and ran the race through 1941. Then the Speedway was 
dormant until the end of World War II, when Terre Haute businessman and 
sportsman Tony Hulman bought the weed-infested, crumbling facility from 
Rickenbacker and rescued the 500. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-century later, Hulman's grandson, Tony George, is president of the 
Speedway -- and the father of the Brickyard 400.

 What drivers have to say about Saturday's Brickyard 400, the first NASCAR race 
at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I lived about 15 or 20 miles from here out in Hendricks County. I went to 
Tri-West High School and graduated from there. To make history here in NASCAR 
is more than a dream come true. This is one of the greatest things I've ever 
done in my life. To see all these fans when you come driving down that front 
straightaway is just the greatest thrill ever. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JEFF GORDON, 1993 NASCAR rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We're not any threat to the Indy 500 at all. We're going to come and put on 
our show, and there's definitely room for us to come and do our deal and for 
them to do theirs. The Indy 500 will be alive and well forever, I'm sure of 
that. We're just going to get a chance to come up and showcase what we do, 
which is quite a bit different than what they do. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARK MARTIN 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact . . . it's not even the same track. When you go very 
slowly and have time to look around, it looks the same, but when you're out 
there running, you're so busy driving and getting into the next corner, it 
looks very different. The car is so different, you drive it so different, it's 
definitely the car that makes you feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JOHN ANDRETTI 
</P>
<P>
 seven-time Indy 500 veteran now competing in NASCAR 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a rug rat I used to run around here. I always remember riding 
around here on a motor scooter and hanging out at the Speedway Motel and 
throwing baseballs in the parking lot and stuff like that. I really enjoyed 
coming here. I thought one day I might be able to race here, but I never 
thought it would be in a stock car. 
</P>
<P>
 -- P.J. JONES, 
</P>
<P>
 son of 1963 Indy 500 winner Parnelli Jones 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody's going to take their side, whether they like Indy-car racing or 
stock car racing better. That's normal. That's human nature. All I can say is I 
love to come to the Indy 500 and watch the race. And I love watching the Coke 
600. I really like being involved in it more than I do watching it. But I guess 
I'm a fan of both types of racing. I think it would really be neat if all the 
fans can get together and say, 'Boy, this is great that we have two big races 
instead of one big race.' 
</P>
<P>
 -- RUSTY WALLACE 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pretty neat thing. I don't know about tradition and whatever. . . . I 
wouldn't want to change anything when it comes to the Indianapolis 500 and the 
month of May, but we can have the month of August and run the Brickyard 400 and 
have a great time as NASCAR. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DALE EARNHARDT 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a phenomenal happening. What's happening here . . . has a huge impact. 
Not just on NASCAR, not just on Indy, but in the world of motorsports.

IN THE LONG RUN, HAWKINS RULES; SURFING: WILD 'N' CRAZY MOVES HELP CURRENT U.S. 
LONGBOARD CHAMPION, WHO GREW UP IN HUNTINGTON BEACH, MAKE SEMIFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Longboarding, the slow, easy way to surf. Catch a wave, scamper up a few steps 
and relax. Enjoy the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing for the non-active lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell that to Joey Hawkins and he'll spend the day telling you why that's not 
true. Or better yet, he'll get in the water and prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 A former world champion and the current U.S. champion longboarder, Hawkins 
performed 360s, aerials and more traditional moves Saturday to win the first 
quarterfinal heat of the Op Pro longboarding competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins, 24, grew up in Huntington Beach. His father, a longboarder whom he 
calls "a full-on soul man," placed him on a surfboard at age 2. By the time 
Hawkins was 5, he was catching waves and riding alongside his father. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike his father, Joey favored the short boards and stayed with them 
through high school. His style called for crazy, risk-taking moves and vertical 
attacks on the lip. And in competition, it worked. In 1987, Hawkins was the 
Huntington Beach surf champion and ranked fifth in the nation among high school 
surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 He envisioned a future of professional surfing until a back injury slowed him. 
There was no painful spill or wreck to blame for the herniated disk, just a 
life of surfing and skateboarding and taking his back for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got back into surfing, I started with a longboard. It was supposed to 
keep me from doing any wild, snapping turns," Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, it might have. But now, Hawkins combines skateboard moves 
with his innovations and traditional longboard skills to tear apart the waves.  
</P>
<P>
 In the semifinals, Hawkins will face San Diegan Joel Tudor, the leader on the 
longboarding tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give my best effort every time," Hawkins said, adding that he's ready for 
the next level of competition. "Winning all the early heats doesn't mean much. 
Somebody could finish second all along and then be the big dog in the semis or 
in the finals." 
</P>
<P>
 In women's surfing, Rochelle Ballard advanced to the semifinals after catching 
only four waves in the quarterfinals. Competitors are allowed 10 waves, but 
only the top four count. Surfers usually catch eight or nine to give themselves 
room for one or two bad rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballard, 23, didn't bother. After scoring a 6.17 on her first wave, she looked 
to the stands for her husband, coach and manager, Bill Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stands up there and directs me in the heats," she said. "He waves me over 
to where I should be in the water." 
</P>
<P>
 Frieda Zamba posted the biggest wave score among women with a 6.5. A five-time 
Op winner, Zamba easily won her heat to advance to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 In men's surfing, Jeff Deffenbaugh of Huntington Beach and Richie Collins of 
Newport Beach may have been the biggest winners of the competition so far. In 
addition to winning their heats in Round 3 of the main event and advancing to 
the quarterfinals, Deffenbaugh and Collins advanced to the U.S. Open of 
Surfing, which begins Tuesday. Today's schedule: 
</P>
<P>
 7-8:20 a.m. -- Men's quarterfinals; 8:20-9 a.m. -- Longboard semifinals; 
9-9:40 a.m. -- Women's semifinals; 9:40-10:20 a.m. -- Op Junior semifinals;

WESTLAKE-ROYAL ALIVE TO PLAY ANOTHER DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westlake-Royal American Legion team is confident, if nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-run deficit in the eighth inning? No problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal overcame that Saturday night, defeating Camarillo, 11-10, in 
the Area 6 playoffs at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never worried," Westlake-Royal Coach Mike McClure said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next test will be today, when Westlake-Royal (28-6-1) will need to beat 
Arcadia twice to win the double-elimination tournament. The first game starts 
at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very confident we are going to play 18 innings tomorrow," McClure said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Schuster put Westlake-Royal into the championship round by sliding 
around a tag with the go-ahead run with two out in the top of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuster was running at third when Brent Egan hit a chopper in front of the 
plate. Schuster stopped midway down the line, but when he looked back to third, 
teammate Kevin Mellinger, running from second, was almost there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just decided I had to go home and make some kind of acrobatic slide," 
Schuster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Richard Soliz threw to first baseman Fernando Barajas, whose throw 
home appeared to be in time, but Schuster slid around the tag. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was especially pleasant for Westlake-Royal because it was against 
its District 16 rival. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play these guys four times a year," Schuster said, "so when we see them in 
a game like this, it's pretty intense." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo (27-8) was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Soliz (5-2) started for Camarillo, reversing a previous decision. Soliz, one 
of Camarillo's top starters, did not want to pitch in the playoffs so he could 
save his arm for today's Area Code Games tryouts. His teammate, Dan Martinez, 
also said he wouldn't pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jody Breeden, one of the coaches who helps select players for the Area 
Code Games, told Martinez and Soliz that he would watch them pitch Saturday in 
the playoffs and that would serve as their tryout. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez started and lost, 11-3, to Arcadia earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Soliz went the distance, throwing 160 pitches. He gave up 11 runs and 17 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, walking away with his elbow in a bucket of ice, Soliz said he 
didn't want to talk to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal fell behind in a disastrous first inning. Westlake-Royal made 
four errors in the inning, contributing to five runs, only one earned. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was our worst inning ever," McClure said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal needed three pitchers to get out of the inning. Starter Matt 
Pitstick, who had thrown only five innings all season, lasted only one-third of 
an inning. Joe Primack faced two batters before yielding to Jay Kenny, who 
pitched 5 1/3 innings earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal did not use right-hander Maki Kramer, one of the aces during 
the regular season. Although Kramer suffered a minor knife wound last week 
while apprehending a shoplifter at his job at Kmart, he had medical clearance 
to pitch Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our choice to go without him," McClure said. "We weren't saving him. 
We were concerned about him being in shape. He hasn't pitched in two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 McClure said Kramer will start today. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal tied the game, 5-5, with three runs in the bottom of the 
second, but Camarillo pulled away with two runs in the fourth and three more in 
the sixth, taking a 10-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal scored three runs in the eighth and two in the ninth, to take 
the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Morris (2-1), who pitched three scoreless innings of relief, picked up 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia 11, Camarillo 3 -- Martinez decided to pitch, but his defense let him 
down. He lasted 6 1/3 innings, giving up 11 runs -- six earned -- and 14 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez pitched well for most of the game, but his team came undone on one 
critical botched play in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 With Arcadia leading, 3-2, and Brett Hynes at second with one out, Jason Cly 
hit a routine fly ball to right field. Camarillo's Jason Adamson dropped the 
ball, then overthrew the cutoff man, allowing Hynes to score. Camarillo third 
baseman Eric Flores, backing up the play, picked up the ball and threw it into 
right field, trying to get Cly at second base. Cly wound up circling the bases 
on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia scored four runs in the inning, taking a 7-2 lead. Arcadia had five 
consecutive hits off a tiring Martinez in the seventh, scoring four more runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas had two doubles in four at-bats for Camarillo. Rick Collier and Rodell 
Desamparo each added two singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal 9, Valley North 8 -- Morris drove in Joel Mellinger with a 
two-out single in the 10th inning, eliminating District 20 champion Valley 
North (20-10). 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North's Tony Montiel, who was the losing pitcher, was responsible for 
the game going to extra innings in the first place. He singled home Rod 
Daryabigi with the tying run with one out in the top of the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Montiel's fifth hit of the game and his ninth in the past two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellinger, who was three for four, doubled with two out in the bottom of the 
10th and scored on Morris' single up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitstick had two hits and drove in four runs for Westlake-Royal. Catcher Ben 
Lemos hit a two-run home run. It was only Westlake-Royal's third home run of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Kenoi started for Valley North and gave up eight runs in 5 2/3 innings. 
He had been injured and did not pitch at all this spring at Chatsworth High, 
and he pitched just two short stints this summer for Valley North. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Kenny (7-0), who picked up the victory for Westlake-Royal, gave up one run 
in 5 1/3 innings of relief.

WHITAKER DOMINATED IN GOODWILL FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lance Whitaker of Northridge, the country's top-ranked amateur super 
heavyweight who began boxing about two years ago, lost to Alexi Lezin of 
Russia, 17-0, Saturday in the gold-medal bout of the Goodwill Games in St. 
Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The inexperienced Whitaker (29-4), 6-foot-8, 235 pounds, was no match for 
Lezin, losing to the three-time Russian national champion for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
 Lezin, a left-hander, continually befuddled Whitaker, beating him to the punch 
at almost every opportunity and preventing the American from using his height 
and weight advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "He beat me, he beat me good," Whitaker said. "He was faster than me and I was 
about two seconds late with every punch I threw."

VENTURA RACEWAY; IT WAS A NIGHT FOR CAUTION AS WILLIAMS WINS FEATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARIN ESPER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second consecutive evening, yellow was the dominant color at Ventura 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the color of the caution flag, which was displayed four times before 
one lap of the 30-lap Sprint Car Racing Assn. feature race was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Add that figure to the seven caution periods in the California Dwarf Car 
Racing Assn. main event, and it made for a long night. 
</P>
<P>
 Current SCRA points leader Rip Williams of Yorba Linda picked up his fifth 
victory, passing last year's California Racing Assn. sprint car champion Mike 
Kirby of Lomita coming out of Turn 4 on the final lap, less than 80 yards from 
the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby, who originally was third in the starting lineup, ended up starting from 
the pole after an accident eliminated pole-sitter Jerry Meyer of Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Shuman of Tempe, who has four victories this year, finished third, and 
fast qualifier Ron DiDonato of Riverside was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 After posting a fourth place finish in his seven-lap heat race, DiDonato 
earned his spot in the feature with a wire-to-wire victory in the first 10-lap 
semi-main. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams ran away from the field in the second semi-main, while Cucamonga's 
Gary Howard and Temple City's Bob Meli battled for second place. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard passed Meli on the inside of the fourth turn on the final lap for 
second, while Meli slid into the wall and flipped across the finish line for 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a tense moment when Meli's car caught fire as the safety crew 
righted it, but the blaze was quickly extinguished while Meli extracted himself 
from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-lap Dwarf Car feature was reduced to 15 laps, due to a 20-minute time 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Stansberry of Tehachapi picked up the victory when he passed 58-year-old 
San Pedro resident Ed Johns on the 14th lap after a restart following a final 
caution flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns, who is currently running second in the dwarf points race, started on 
the pole and led the first 13 laps.

SAUGUS SPEEDWAY; POLE-TO-POLE VICTORY IS A FIRST FOR MONROE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sean Monroe picked a fine time to register his first Sportsman victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles resident, who failed to win a Sportsman feature in nine starts 
this season, earned valuable points and $1,200 as he pulled away to win the 
fourth leg of the Sportsman Championship Series on Saturday night at Saugus 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe started on the pole for the 75-lap event and was never seriously 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Daniels of San Bernardino finished a distant second, followed by Simi 
Valley's Craig Rayburn and Gary Sigman of Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Pat Mintey Jr. of Quartz Hill finished ninth in his first 
appearance since July 2, when he vowed never to return to the 
one-third-of-a-mile oval following a racing incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus points leader Sean Woodside of Saugus was 11th after spinning twice 
while running in the top five. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 30-lap Grand American Modified main event, Canyon Country's Rick Crow 
held off a strong challenge from three-time defending champion and current 
point leader Dave Phipps of Simi Valley to win his first-ever Grand Am feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Crow started on the outside of the second row following a restart, but moved 
into the lead on the third lap when leader Larry Krieger suffered a flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Phipps finished a half a car length behind Crow, but increased his lead to 30 
points over Reseda's Dave Blankenship, who was third. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Nazaroff entered the night in second place, 11 points behind Phipps, but 
the Covina resident garnered just two points in the main event and dropped to 
third, two behind Blankenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Grizzaffi of Granada Hills moved past pole-sitter John Cappi with just 
five laps left and pulled away to win the 25-lap Street Stock oval main event. 
</P>
<P>
 Cappi wound up second followed by points leader John Schultz of Valencia, who 
started 18th in an inverted start. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz also won the four-lap oval trophy dash and increased his lead to 34 
points heading into the figure-eight main event, which was not completed by 
press time.

PRICE WAVES WHITE FLAG PROPHETICALLY IN 125-115 ALL-STAR DEFEAT; BASKETBALL: 
LOADED BLUE TEAM COASTS, BUT HARTMAN AND LOPEZ HAVE THEIR MOMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ricky Price is a pretty smart guy -- after all, the 6-foot-6 forward from 
Serra High is headed to Duke this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 So he knew what he was saying when, playing for the White all-star team, he 
walked over to the Blue all-stars' bench in the third quarter and asked, "You 
gonna break this team up?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue all-stars answered with laughter and a 125-115 victory over the 
Whites in the Southern California Summer Showcase basketball game Saturday 
night at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues were stacked with talent, featuring the UCLA-bound trio of J.R. 
Henderson of Bakersfield East, Kris Johnson of Crenshaw and Toby Bailey of 
Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whites, meanwhile, had Jason Hartman of Thousand Oaks and Alex Lopez of 
Campbell Hall, both headed to Washington. Another area player scheduled to 
appear, Damon Ollie of North Hollywood, was a no-show. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a fan's delight, so much so that when Hartman softly laid the 
ball in on a breakaway late in the game, some spectators booed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went up my legs just didn't have enough," said Hartman, who had five 
points and two rebounds. "But this was great. I was just happy to be out on the 
court with these guys. I wasn't expecting to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez had the daunting task of guarding Henderson, the highly recruited 
6-foot-8 forward who was named the game's most valuable player after a 
26-point, six-rebound performance. Johnson added 24 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I played good defense on J.R.," said Lopez, who had eight points and 
six rebounds. "Offensively I scored, and I made some good passes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues held the Whites at arm's distance the entire second half, not 
letting the difference drop to below eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Two free throws from Sam Tarks got the Whites to within 111-103 with 2:46 
left, but no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the kinds of players I'll be playing against," Hartman said. "I've 
got to start improving my perimeter game and defense (for next season)." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams traded leads until near the end of the first quarter, when the Blues 
went on a 9-2 run. Chris Clayton's layup made it 28-16 with 1:45 left in the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whites narrowed the deficit to 32-27 on Miles Simon's layup, but the Blues 
increased the lead to 62-44 before the Whites trimmed it to 64-54 at halftime.

MIKE PENNER: PLAYERS DESERVE BETTER THAN BACKWARD-THINKING OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In two weeks, when the 1994 baseball season ends, we will have more than 
enough idle time to debate such matters as "Is baseball better with or without 
a World Series?" and "How come realignment promised more playoff games and then 
left us with none?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, let's get one item out of the way right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: "Were the major league players of yesteryear better than those of today?" 
</P>
<P>
 A: "You're kidding, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 As we now know, the premise behind the argument the old timers seem to hold so 
dear is absolutely preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
 The major league players of yesteryear were only asked to hit, catch, run and 
throw. That's it. 
</P>
<P>
 The major league players of today are asked to do all that, plus save the 
national pastime from the 28 corked bats who currently run the sport and have 
charted a course that should land The Grand Old Game firmly behind hockey, 
soccer and rhythmic gymnastics on the fan popularity scale by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Think Ted Williams could have hit .400 with three owners clutching his right 
leg and bawling, "Please, we're blithering idiots completely unable to restrain 
ourselves from shoving $1,000 bills down your pants pockets! You're killing the 
game! You're destroying competitive balance! It's up to you to sew those 
pockets closed!"? 
</P>
<P>
 In the world according to the Lords and Madams of Baseball, major league 
baseball is on the brink of financial ruination (so they tell us), that 19 of 
28 franchises will lose money this season (so they tell us), that the 
big-market teams are running the small-market teams into extinction (so they 
tell us) and that the game requires radical surgery called a salary cap or else 
it's going to expire in its sick bed (so they tell us). 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, baseball's owners did invoke a salary cap once before, in the 
mid-1980s. It was called collusion. It very nearly gutted the game then and 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, professional basketball and football have adopted over-the-table 
-- and legal -- salary caps, to the detriment of both games. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA salary cap allows great teams to wither on the vine because one 
exceedingly wealthy aging ex-star refuses to retire or renegotiate (see the 
Lakers and James Worthy) while preventing other great teams from forming. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, NBA championships are won by paying one superstar huge amounts of money 
and surrounding him with journeymen cost-cutters because that's all that fits 
under the cap (see Houston Rockets). 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL's salary cap kicked in this year, creating mass chaos among 
panic-stricken general managers, an off-season game of musical starting 
quarterbacks and premature retirement for some of the league's best-known -- 
and best-paid -- players. Is it good for the game that the New York Giants were 
forced to release Phil Simms before he completed injury rehab simply because he 
was too expensive for the cap? That the only way for fans to stay current on 
their favorite team is to tap the home PC into the sports wire and conduct 
round-the-clock searches for player transactions? 
</P>
<P>
 With baseball's owners threatening to unilaterally impose similar restraints 
this off-season, is it any surprise the players' union decided last week to bar 
the door as well as it could with an Aug. 12 strike date? 
</P>
<P>
 Think about what the owners are doing, since they obviously are impaired in 
this area. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid widespread reports baseball was losing its grip with the public -- death 
by boredom is how the obituary writers were preparing to word it -- baseball 
rallies in the bottom of the ninth with one of its most noteworthy seasons 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Three players -- Matt Williams, Ken Griffey Jr. and Frank Thomas -- are giving 
spirited chase to Roger Maris' single-season home run record. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Gwynn has a real chance to become baseball's first .400 hitter in 52 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 With cries over a juiced ball ringing in his ears, Atlanta pitcher Greg Maddux 
is bidding to win his third consecutive Cy Young Award with an earned-run 
average less than 2.00. 
</P>
<P>
 And, thanks to the one fling with lucidity the owners have had in recent 
years, realignment has produced, at the end of July, 12 teams within three 
games of first place in their respective divisions and five suspenseful pennant 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball is staging one of the great comebacks of all time -- and the owners 
are prepared to shut off the lights Aug. 12 if it means shoving the salary cap 
down the players' throats. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, baseball is flying in the face of all the owners' arguments in 
favor of a cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Less-than-huge-market teams from Montreal, Cincinnati, Cleveland and Texas are 
contenders in four of the six divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto, with the largest payroll in baseball, is 15 1/2 games out in the 
American League East. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal, with one of the smallest payrolls, continues to hold off Ted 
Turner's conspicuous consumers from Atlanta in the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
 Where is the evidence to support the desperate plea for a wage ceiling? And 
why are we to believe a cap on salaries is a sure-fire solution? 
</P>
<P>
 Already, a couple teams have tinkered with self-imposed salary caps. You know 
them as the Angels and the Padres, and they are the two most depressing things 
about this baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's a sample of the future, if that's the owners' idea of what's "good 
for the game," let the strike begin today. And might it be a long one.

PENSKE'S CARS CAN'T KEEP UP IN QUALIFYING; AUTO RACING: AFTER DOMINATING SEVEN 
OF NINE INDY RACES, THREE-MAN TEAM STARTS TODAY'S MARLBORO 500 IN BACK ROWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The three-car Penske juggernaut, which has dominated seven of nine Indy car 
races this season, might hit a snag here today at, of all places, Roger 
Penske's own track, Michigan International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 On the two-mile banked oval where Al Unser Jr., Emerson Fittipaldi and Paul 
Tracy tested and developed the Mercedes-Benz version of the Ilmor Indy car 
engine that prevailed at the Indianapolis 500, cars powered by Ford-Cosworth V8 
engines swept the front row for today's Marlboro 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's Nigel Mansell, defending series and race champion, took the pole 
Saturday with a qualifying lap of 233.738 m.p.h. It was enough to justify 
Michigan's reputation as the "world's fastest racetrack" but shy of Mario 
Andretti's closed-course world record of 234.275 set here last year -- and also 
shy of an unofficial lap of 235.639 Mansell ran earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford drivers Raul Boesel, 232.672, and Michael Andretti, 232.543, will start 
alongside Mansell. Andretti, with victories in Australia and Toronto, is the 
only non-Penske driver to win this season. 
</P>
<P>
 To further compound Penske's problem, two more Ford-powered drivers -- Robby 
Gordon and Mario Andretti -- and Ilmor-powered Stefan Johansson filled the 
second row. Fittipaldi, at 228.710, was the fastest of the Penskes, good for 
only seventh position in the 28-car field. 
</P>
<P>
 It was quite a turnabout from previous races in which Penske drivers twice 
finished 1-2-3, have led 935 out of a possible 1,114 laps and have had at least 
one driver among the top three in every race. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, who is battling Michael Andretti for best-in-class honors among 
non-Penske drivers, said of the previous races: "Sometimes the speed difference 
has made it seem like they were in Indy cars and we were in Super Vees." 
</P>
<P>
 Penske, whose cars have won 10 of the last 26 Indy 500s, raised a few eyebrows 
in the racing world when he signed Unser last fall and announced he would run a 
three-driver team. Although three-driver teams have been commonplace for the 
Indy 500, they have proved to be too difficult to maintain over a full season. 
</P>
<P>
 Many two-car teams have been torn apart by jealousies and bickering among 
drivers and crew members. Every driver who fails to win fears he has not been 
given the same treatment as the driver who does. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, Penske has avoided such controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it might be a problem when Al joined the team, but right from the 
start, Roger (Penske) and (team manager) Charlie Sprague made it definite that 
we would all get the same treatment," Tracy said. "When one of us finds a new 
part that seems to work better, the three of us wait until all three cars can 
have it before it is used in a race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has really helped in testing. One driver can only do so much, but with 
three drivers we got in three times the amount of testing. I think that was the 
real reason we did so well right off the start, we had tested so much to 
maximize the car before the season started." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Denton, Unser's electronics engineer, said it is not unusual to see 
Unser, Fittipaldi and Tracy sitting around studying a network of telemetry that 
monitors and records forward and lateral G-forces, oil pressure, temperatures, 
fuel mix, throttle response, braking, suspension travel, engine r.p.m.s and 
other data. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers are most interested in steering wheel angles and throttle positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The data allows them to see how far they drove into a turn, when they 
upshifted or downshifted, and whether they were running flat out," Denton said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a long way from the days when Penske had a light put on top of his cars 
and rigged a sensor on the accelerator. The principle was simple: When the 
light was on, the driver had it flat. Whenever he lifted, the light went out. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Penske cars have won only two of 13 Michigan 500s. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, despite earlier successes, does not figure to change although Michigan 
races often take on more the character of a rodeo than a motor car race. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wild race track," Mansell said. "All the way around the circuit, it 
is difficult and awfully demanding. At this track, you are always attacking, 
overtaking, but there are places out there where you can't see anything for the 
bumping and bouncing. My philosophy has been to not try and look too closely, 
it might be too frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ford advantage comes from a different power range that delivers more 
horsepower than the Ilmors or the Hondas driven by Bobby Rahal and Mike Groff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michigan is the only track where you go flat out all the way around," Unser 
said. "The Ilmor is more efficient on a track where you either lift or brake or 
slow down in the turns, which gives us an advantage on the street and road 
courses and even at Indy where you lift slightly."

TEAMTENNIS; CONNORS, UNDEFEATED DUKES PRODUCE PERFORMANCES TO REMEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A near sellout crowd of 2,487 at the John Wayne Tennis Club came to see the 
legendary Jimmy Connors for possibly the last time in a World TeamTennis match. 
</P>
<P>
 They were treated to a performance that brought back memories of center court 
at the U.S. Open, but they also got to witness history when the Dukes became 
the first WTT franchise to finish the season undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dukes crushed Phoenix, 27-17, Saturday night and won their 14th 
consecutive match. The Dukes (14-0) will play again Friday night at Sacramento 
in the WTT semifinals against the winner of a wild-card match between Idaho and 
either Charlotte, Phoenix or Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the match, Dukes Coach Angel Lopez said the perfect record was on the 
team's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking to make a little bit of history (Saturday)," Lopez said. "We're 
looking forward to everyone playing their best." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Jones had been playing the best tennis of any man in the league, but he 
was cooled off by Connors, losing 6-3. After destroying Connors, 6-1, Friday 
night in Phoenix, Jones appeared tight in front of the big crowd. And Connors, 
who has played in front of much bigger crowds than Saturday's, was relaxed and 
playful. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was coming off an 6-2 loss in men's doubles with Danie Visser to 
Trevor Kronemann and Jones, Connors took the first three games against Jones. 
Connors got most of his first serves in play, allowing him to dictate most of 
the points. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones held his next three service games, but he could never break Connors' 
serve. Late in the set, Connors and some of the louder and happier Duke fans 
began to exchange a few nasty barbs. To one obnoxious fan, Connors quipped, "If 
that's all your looking at, you're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind it as long as they're willing to give it out and take it," he 
said. "A lot of them can't take it though." 
</P>
<P>
 Connors said the difference Saturday in his matchup with Jones was the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot slower here and it gave me time to set up," Connors said. "He 
served aces Friday night and played really well." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jones: "I set up a lot of my points, but I just couldn't come through. We 
played indoors in Phoenix and lights were a little better there. It's better 
for a serve and volley guy like me." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jones captured the men's singles championship over Connors by winning 
80 games and losing 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Zina Garrison Jackson and Larisa Neiland gave the Dukes a 6-3 lead with a 
victory over Leila Meskhi and Mary Lou Daniels. Garrison Jackson then avenged 
her Friday loss to Meskhi with a 6-1 victory. Kronemann and Neiland clinched 
the perfect season with a 6-5 (5-2) victory over Visser and Meskhi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to go 16-0," Neiland said. "No sweat."

L.A. FAIR PRESIDENT HINDS DIES AT 53 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ralph M. Hinds, president and chief executive officer of the Los Angeles 
County Fair Assn., died Saturday after suffering a heart attack while watching 
his grandson compete as a driver in a junior drag-racing competition at 
Fairplex Park in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinds, 53, was pronounced dead at 2:30 p.m. after he was rushed to the Pomona 
Valley Hospital Medical Center.He had a history of heart trouble dating to 
1987, but employees said that he had been following a strict diet and was 
adhering to an exercise program. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinds, who lived in Claremont, joined the fair association at Pomona in 1978 
as general manager and was named president and chief executive officer in 1983. 
He ran the Los Angeles County Fair, the largest of its kind in North America, 
and oversaw a $74-million improvement program that began at Fairplex in 1981.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the many projects at the fair was the annual horse racing meet in 
September. The meet, which races thoroughbreds, quarter horses and other 
breeds, runs for 19 consecutive days and last year the daily averages of 17,263 
in attendance and $3.7 million in betting ranked Fairplex among the top 10 
tracks in the country. BILL CHRISTINE

DEL MAR; THE TRIP SOUTH PAYS DIVIDENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Gilchrist doesn't make many appearances at Del Mar, but the Northern 
California trainer might have considerable impact this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilchrist saddled Work The Crowd for her victory Saturday in the $82,300 San 
Clemente Handicap, and he has scratched another fast filly, Soviet Problem, 
from today's Bing Crosby Handicap to save her for a $100,000 match race against 
Cool Air here on Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 A consistent 3-year-old who has had 10 victories, three seconds and one third 
in 15 starts, Work The Crowd held off favored Pharma to win the San Clemente by 
a head. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron, returning to action after suffering a sprained ankle in a gate 
accident, added a second stakes victory Saturday, riding Kingdom Found to a 
two-length victory over Tossofthecoin in the $125,000 San Diego Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ankle doesn't hurt when I ride," McCarron said. "It only hurts when I 
walk. So as long as I can stand the discomfort of getting from the jocks' room 
to the paddock, I'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Work the Crowd, running a mile on grass in 1:36, paid $7. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like every time this filly runs, she's got something to prove," 
Gilchrist said. "But I would think people would be getting the message by now. 
She's the genuine thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Work The Crowd, running before 21,878 on the meet's fourth day, earned $41,250 
for owners John Harris and Norma Foster Maddy, pushing her total over the 
$400,000 mark. She carried high weight of 120 pounds and is expected to run 
next in the Del Mar Oaks, which will be the same day as the Soviet Problem-Cool 
Air match race. 
</P>
<P>
 The match race will be at five furlongs on grass, with each horse carrying 116 
pounds and the winner, according to Gilchrist, earning $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather have to beat just one horse at that distance than trying to beat a 
bunch of horses going six furlongs (today)," Gilchrist said. "But if anybody's 
watching this race, they'd better not blink, because it won't take long to get 
it over with." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's victory was Kingdom Found's first in a stake. In last start, 
trainer Gary Jones' 4-year-old colt ran last, beaten by 16 lengths, at 9-5 in 
the Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was just a bad go," Jones said. "It looked good on paper, but the horse 
just didn't like the track." 
</P>
<P>
 Owner-breeder Ray Dilbeck's horse was favored Saturday, paying $3.60 while 
carrying high weight of 116 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingdom Found, who ran 1 1/16 miles in 1:41 1/5, is eligible for the 
$1-million Pacific Classic here on Aug. 13, but probably won't run in the 1 
1/4-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that he wants to go that far," Jones said. "It won't be fair to 
him. The distance isn't that good." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Alex The Great came from behind under Pat Valenzuela to win Saturday's 
$250,000 Sword Dancer Handicap at Saratoga. Alex The Great is trained by Rodney 
Rash, who remained at Del Mar to saddle Dancing Mirage for her third-place 
finish in the San Clemente Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Memo is the 8-5 morning-line favorite for today's Bing Crosby Handicap. The 
7-year-old gelding from Chile has two victories and a second in three starts 
this year. Valenzuela will be back from Saratoga to ride Gundaghia, also a 
7-year- old gelding. . . . Trainer Bob Baffert, who didn't like Thirty Slews' 
weight assignment or the No. 1 position position, has scratched Gundaghia's 
stablemate. Thirty Slews, who won the Crosby in 1992 and lost by a head last 
year to The Wicked North, is winless since the 1992 Breeders' Cup Sprint. . . . 
Alex Solis, sore from a spill on Thursday, is expected to return to action 
today. . . . Garrett Gomez, who starts a five-day suspension today, rode 
winners Saturday that paid $19.40 and $54.40.

LEARY ADMITS MAKING A TITANIC ERROR; BASKETBALL: CAL STATE FULLERTON WANTED TO 
BUILD AN OFFENSE AROUND HIM, BUT MISTAKES PUT AN END TO THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Unforgiving brick walls just a few feet beyond the court. Wooden backboards. 
Rickety, worn-out bleachers. An electric fan by a corner doorway, straining to 
pump air from outside into a tiny, sweat-box of a gym. 
</P>
<P>
 It's OK by YMCA standards, but when you've sank three pointers in Pauley 
Pavilion and the Thomas & Mack Center, when you've dished off on the break in 
the Pan American Center and the Thunderdome, it's a bit of a letdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, even rinky-dink Titan Gym looks like The Pond of Anaheim next to this 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is awful," Don Leary said in the steamy Anaheim YMCA last week, another 
in a seemingly endless string of recreation-league games behind him. "This is 
something I don't want to do forever." 
</P>
<P>
 It's places like this and games like this -- an ugly, 94-46 blowout against a 
rag-tag collection of over-the-hill hackers -- that motivate Leary to return to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 And make him wonder why he ever left. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary seemed to have everything going for him in the spring of 1993. He 
quickly established himself as one of the Big West Conference's best outside 
shooters in 1992-93, setting Cal State Fullerton records for three-pointers 
(89) and three-point percentage (.443). 
</P>
<P>
 He had one memorable game, making a school-record eight three-pointers and 
scoring 25 points in a 90-82 loss at UCLA, and was the Titans' leading scorer 
in five other games. 
</P>
<P>
 Four seniors from the 1992-93 team would be moving on, and Titan Coach Brad 
Holland was already busy devising ways to build the 1993-94 offense around 
Leary, who averaged 13.4 points as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 But summer came and Leary disappeared, and Holland, to this day, isn't sure 
why. In fact, Holland hasn't talked to Leary since he left and had no idea what 
happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland tried calling Leary's father in Long Beach last summer. No luck. He 
tried calling Leary's mother in Banning. No luck. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew Leary, a former Banning High School and Mt. San Jacinto College 
standout, would have to attend summer school and take extra courses in the fall 
of '93 to remain eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holland never had the chance to help his shooting guard map out a course. 
It was as if Leary had simply vanished, kapoof ! 
</P>
<P>
 "We never heard from the guy," said Holland, whose inexperienced team slipped 
to 8-19 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out, Leary was alive and not so well and living in Indio. He has spent 
the past year unemployed, living with a sister in the desert, playing rec 
league basketball five nights a week and regretting the events that led to him 
dropping out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss college basketball a lot," Leary, 22, said. "Knowing I could have been 
pretty good, that the coach would have based the offense around me my senior 
year, hurt. I let a lot of people down, including myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary accepts full blame for his downfall. He did well enough in his first 
semester at Fullerton to maintain athletic eligibility, but soon after the 
second semester began, Leary said he became a regular on the nightclub scene 
and a no-show in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland believes it's no coincidence that Leary stopped going to class around 
the time his stepbrother, Dante Moore, moved in with Leary and former teammate 
Todd Satalowich. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't a student at Fullerton, he was just living with them," Holland said 
of Moore. "He wasn't working or doing anything. That's when things went 
downhill." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary claims Moore wasn't a bad influence, but he does admit he often went out 
with Moore, and that strange things began happening around the house after he 
moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things came up missing, like a gold chain, that my other roommate complained 
about," Leary said. "He (Satalowich) told the coaches, and he also told them 
what I was doing outside of school, and I didn't appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the semester, Leary's relationship with the Titan coaching staff 
had deteriorated, and when grades were issued, it was obvious Leary was in deep 
academic trouble. But instead of confronting his problems, Leary ran from them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't feel like dealing with school any more," Leary said. "I didn't 
want to talk to the coaches because we were on bad terms. I felt I'd just leave 
and save everyone the trouble, which was wrong. I should have handled it a lot 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary said his problems stemmed from immaturity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was probably trying to hang out too much, do too much partying," he said. 
"It was my first real college experience, my first time away from home, and I 
didn't handle it correctly." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Leary wants to relive that experience -- the college part, not the 
partying. He has applied for financial aid at Cal State San Bernardino and if 
accepted, he hopes to enroll in the Division II school and play basketball this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll need to hit the weight room -- at 6 feet 2 and 175 pounds, Leary has 
dropped about seven pounds since his Fullerton season and appears to be lacking 
in upper body strength. But the smooth release, the high arc and the soft touch 
of his jump shot have not dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary walked into the Anaheim YMCA right at game time Wednesday night and hit 
his first three-pointer from the left corner without even taking a warm-up 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been playing in a bunch of rec leagues in Palm Springs, San Bernardino 
and Anaheim and I'm in great shape," Leary said. "I feel I still have it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's encouraging for the San Bernardino coaching staff, which was surprised 
to hear Leary was considering the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not really in need of guards, but Don's the type of guy any Division II 
school would love to have," said San Bernardino assistant Tim Murphy, who 
coached at UC Irvine when Leary was at Fullerton. "He was an unbelievable 
shooter. He'd be amazing to have." 
</P>
<P>
 To the Titan staff, he was the one who got away. For that, Leary is sorry, and 
he says he will eventually call Holland to explain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel nervous about it, but I do want to talk to him," Leary said. "I regret 
what happened with the coaches there, and for that I apologize, but right now 
I'm just hoping to go back to school and get my life back together."

 Two Southland boxers were defeated in their gold-medal bouts at the Goodwill 
Games on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Super-heavyweight Lance Whitaker of Northridge lost by 17-0 to Russian Alexi 
Lezin, and flyweight Carlos Navarro of Los Angeles was defeated by Cuba's

POSTCARD: ST. PETERSBURG; COACH COULD TEACH SOVIETS SOME NEW MANEUVERS NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a monument here dedicated to Alfred Nobel, and perhaps there will be 
one some day dedicated to Ted Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobel, the Swedish industrialist whose family owned pre-Revolution factories 
here, invented dynamite and created the Nobel prizes. Turner has been equally 
elusive of moral judgment, colorizing our favorite movies but creating the 
Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner maintains that he did the latter in 1986 to promote cooperation between 
the United States and the Soviet Union, and although there is suspicion that 
providing original sports programming for cable television operators also had 
something to do with it, there is at least one person who gives him the benefit 
of the doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 That is Steve Nunno, coach of the Dynamo Gymnastics team in Oklahoma. The team 
is representing the United States in the Goodwill Games women's competition 
that began Saturday night. Among his charges is all-around world champion 
Shannon Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunno was a young coach with no money, no reputation and no gymnasts to speak 
of when he learned in 1986 that, in conjunction with the first Goodwill Games 
in Moscow, the Soviets were opening the doors of their famous gymnastics 
schools to U.S. coaches and gymnasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they didn't exactly open everything to us," said Nunno, who took out a 
loan to pay for his trip. "I came over with a video camera and got thrown out 
of three gyms. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I came over as a sponge and learned a tremendous amount, a lot of things 
that I still use today. They didn't tell us everything, but they let us 
observe. That was more important to me because I wanted to see what they were 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had always heard that the Soviets were good because they beat their kids, 
whipped them. But they were having fun in training. I had heard how coarse they 
were. They couldn't have been more gentle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked about the differences in Soviet and American coaches. They said 
American coaches say 100 things and let the kids try one, while Soviet coaches 
say one thing and let the kids try 100. That's exactly right. We talk too much 
and don't let our kids have enough fun." 
</P>
<P>
 One morning, Nunno went to a gym to watch a training session involving Soviet 
gymnasts and their young American visitors. There was one tiny 8-year-old from 
the United States who was so frustrated because she could not duplicate the 
Soviets' movements that she was in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunno inquired about her and discovered that she also was from Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I can work with her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her name: Shannon Miller. RANDY HARVEY

WORKING FOR SCALE IS NEVER SAFE IN WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS; GOODWILL GAMES: DEATH OF 
CHRISTY HENRICH HITS HOME FOR FORMER OLYMPIAN KATHY JOHNSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much has changed in women's gymnastics since Kathy Johnson retired 10 years 
ago. The age and size of the competitors have gone down, and the degree of 
difficulty of the tricks they are expected to perform has gone up.  
</P>
<P>
 But, as a television commentator who visits the dressing rooms that once 
seemed like home to her, she has learned that one thing has remained the same. 
Too many girls are worried about their weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping that the trend toward younger gymnasts would eliminate some of 
these problems, that they would get in the sport and get out before their 
bodies changed," she said Friday at the Sport and Concert Complex, where she 
was watching women's teams practice for the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think it's made a difference. When I walk into the dressing room, 
I see these young, strong girls pinching the flesh on their thighs and hear 
them asking, 'Do I look fat?' I say, 'Is that a joke?' But it's not." 
</P>
<P>
 Obsession with diet and weight can be deadly serious, as was reaffirmed 
Tuesday when Christy Henrich, 22, died in a Kansas City, Mo., hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Henrich, a member of the U.S. team in the 1989 World Championships, suffered 
for several years from eating disorders -- anorexia nervosa and bulimia -- 
before her vital organs succumbed. At the time of her death, she weighed less 
than 60 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Henrich's death is a visible burden for many of the sport's officials, coaches 
and athletes who are here, but perhaps no one needed to discuss it more than 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's therapy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 34, of Burbank, spent eight years locked in potentially mortal combat 
with her own body, exercising it to extremes while starving herself in order to 
maintain her weight at less than 100 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
 One result was her dramatically delayed menstruation -- amenorrhea -- as she 
did not have her first period until she was 25. She also went through phases of 
anorexia and bulimia that accelerated after she retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overeating, undereating, bingeing, purging," she said. "Once you get on that 
roller coaster, good luck trying to get off." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Johnson did not begin competing until she was 12, relatively late for 
a female gymnast, she was small for her age and did not feel out of place among 
the younger novices.  
</P>
<P>
 But as she grew, it seemed as if her competitors shrank. At no time was that 
more apparent to her than when she was sent to a camp for juniors at 18. Even 
though she was still under five feet tall, she felt like an amazon among those 
tiny bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing in her first World Championships the next year, she made the 
connection between low weight and high-level performance when the miniatures 
from Romania and the Soviet Union dominated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became obsessed with weight," she said. "I took some time off, took a 
couple of pounds off, and, when I returned to the gym, my coach said, 'Hey, you 
look great.' I liked hearing that. I thought, 'Well, I can look even better.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to have a 12-year-old body. It's easier to throw around 50 pounds 
instead of 90. That's reality." 
</P>
<P>
 In attempting to improve acrobatically, however, she discovered another 
reality. If she did not supply her body with fuel by eating properly, she lost 
power and strength necessary to propel herself. 
</P>
<P>
 She fell and almost broke her neck. Then she broke her elbow, an injury that 
doctors said would end her career. 
</P>
<P>
 She came back. So did her bad habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have learned my lesson, but I was obsessive-compulsive," she said. 
"You have to be. You don't get to this level if you're not going to the gym 
every day, doing the same routines, striving for perfection.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I started out, everything was about talent. I used to look at my friends 
and ask, 'Why can't they do these things I can?' Everything came so easy for 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, when I got older and put on weight, I, all of a sudden, couldn't do 
some of things I did before. I panicked. I thought, 'I'm too heavy. If I were 
lighter, I would be a better gymnast.' Every time I gained a pound or two, I 
felt like a blob. I felt like I couldn't fly. I wanted to fly." 
</P>
<P>
 She soared in the 1984 Summer Olympics. Johnson -- 24 years old, 5-0 1/2 and 
98 pounds -- won a silver medal in the team competition and a bronze on the 
balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the end of her gymnastics career, not the end of her struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the year after the Olympics, I gained about 10 pounds," she said. "When I 
would go to a function for Olympic athletes, I would hear people say, " She was 
a gymnast?' I realize now that they weren't saying that at all, that that's 
what I imagined they were saying. I just didn't feel very good about myself." 
</P>
<P>
 She got back on the roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have ended up killing myself," she said. "But one day about three 
years after the Olympics, I realized that I had to have help. I called my 
brother, who was studying to be a doctor, and told him what I was going 
through.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know if it was so far gone that I couldn't fix it, but I told him I 
was going to try. I wanted to do it myself. All I asked was that he keep in 
touch with me to ask how I was doing. If I had told him that I couldn't beat 
it, he was going to make sure that I went for professional help." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Johnson is still a petite 104 pounds. But she said she has as much 
strength as she did at her peak as a world-class gymnast. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said that she realizes there are no easy answers for the problem in 
her sport, just as there are no easy answers for the problem in society. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the one thing we can't do is deny that the problem exists," she said. "I 
wouldn't say it's common in our sport, but there are things I see that I don't 
like. Our athletes are predisposed to it because of the pressure that they are 
under." 
</P>
<P>
 Her advice for parents, coaches and officials is to treat young gymnasts with 
respect, win or lose, so that they can retain their self-esteem, educate them 
about nutritional methods of keeping off pounds and look for early warning 
signs of a preoccupation with weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should ignore the fact that weight is an important element 
in gymnastics," she said. "You cannot be overweight and succeed. But no one 
should deal with it like I did.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had never gone through that. My career would have been a lot easier, 
and I would have been a better gymnast. If I could keep kids today from going 
through some of the things I went through, God, I'd love that."

SPLASH LOSING STREAK OVER; TEAM ALONE IN FIRST PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raffaele Ruotolo's streak is alive. So is Dale Ervine's. And so is the San 
Diego Sockers'. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Splash's streak is broken, and that's good news. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash broke a five-game losing streak Saturday night in a physical, 
heated, 8-7 sudden-death victory over San Diego, and took sole possession of 
first place in the Continental Indoor Soccer League's Western Division. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the third consecutive loss for the Sockers (11-6), who fell into second 
place, one game behind the Splash (12-5). 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first victory by the Splash over the Sockers, who have won 10 of the 
last 12 indoor soccer championships, and provided a critical psychological 
boost for the team, which expects to play San Diego in the CISL semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was nothing but streaks. The Splash scored the game's first five 
goals, the Sockers the next seven and then the Splash avoided the biggest 
collapse in franchise history when Armando Valdivia scored 2 minutes 46 seconds 
into overtime; Paul Ratcliffe's shot was blocked by San Diego's Antonio Cortes, 
the league's leading goalkeeper, and Valdivia found the ball in front of him 
and nudged it in for a short-handed goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another remarkable comeback, this time in front of a franchise-record 
6,027 at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash trailed, 7-5, when Ruotolo, who won three titles with the Sockers, 
scored at 12:56 on a power-play goal with a sixth attacker. Rod Castro, who won 
two titles with the Sockers, got the assist. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro then scored the tying goal with 36 seconds left, playing a pass off the 
glass from Shane Hickson.  
</P>
<P>
 Both goals came with an extra attacker on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickson was playing because Denis Hamlett couldn't. Hamlett was paying the 
one-game penalty for accruing 20 penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night's victory was similar to the 10-9 triumph over Arizona last 
week, when the Splash came back from a three-goal fourth-quarter deficit, tied 
the score with 30 seconds left, and won it with 0:00.1 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruotolo had an assist on the second goal of the game; it gave him 25 on the 
year, matching his career high over five years, and gave him 18 consecutive 
games with an assist, a CISL, Major Soccer League and North American Soccer 
League record. 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine, who scored the first two goals, now has scored in eight consecutive 
games. He has 24 on the season.

ROLLER HOCKEY INTERNATIONAL; BULLFROGS LOSE, 11-10, TO OAKLAND IN SHOOTOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a stellar outing the previous night against Las Vegas, the Bullfrogs 
dropped back into mediocrity Saturday night, losing to the Oakland Skates for 
the first time in franchise history, 11-10, in a shootout at the Oakland 
Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs started quickly, jumping to a 3-1 first-quarter lead on goals by 
Shayne Arsenault, Bobby McKillop and Joe Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 The Skates rallied behind five consecutive goals to take a 6-3 lead, which 
they never relinquished. The Bullfrogs tied it, 9-9, with 17 seconds remaining, 
when they pulled their goalie for an extra skater and Rick Judson scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullfrogs goalie Chris Gordon was instrumental in forcing the game into a 
shootout as he came up with a number of key saves in the last five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Skates gained the victory on goals by David Moore and Karry Biette in the 
shootout.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; WOMAN WARRIOR; SHE'S KNOWN AS A RELENTLESS AND 
UNCOMPROMISING ACTIVIST FOR LIBERAL CAUSES -- AND AS A WORKAHOLIC. BUT MARGERY 
TABANKIN IS ABOUT TO CHANGE JOBS AND TAKE A VACATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She was sprayed with tear gas during a college Vietnam War protest, has met 
with Fidel Castro and Yasser Arafat, and headed a 200-member political action 
committee of heavy hitters in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's a tad odd to find teddy bears among the Ralph Lauren linens in Margery 
Tabankin's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people get to know me really well, they know I'm incredibly vulnerable 
and a complete marshmallow on the inside," Tabankin says, trailing off into a 
from-the-gut laugh. "To the outside world, I think I present a forceful, sort 
of assertive presence." 
</P>
<P>
 The teddy bears must be the yin to her yang. An uncompromising, driven career 
activist for liberal political causes and human rights issues, Tabankin is a 
political force in Washington, Los Angeles and points in between. The college 
anti-war campaigns were a preamble to a career that has zigzagged from 
government jobs to foundation work. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, she moved west and became executive director of the Streisand 
Foundation (as in Barbra), parceling out $7 million over several years to 
groups supporting the environment and human rights, among other causes. 
</P>
<P>
 She was soon juggling an additional job as executive director of the Hollywood 
Women's Political Committee (HWPC), a 10-year-old group made up of studio 
executives, producers, writers, actresses and directors that supports liberal 
candidates, human and civil rights issues, environmental causes and 
campaign-finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tabankin says she feels fortunate to have had a string of 
high-profile jobs, the downside has been far worse than mere burnout. About 
seven years ago, she came down with chronic fatigue syndrome, known generically 
as the "yuppie flu." Only in the last year has she begun to pull out of it, 
thanks to mega-vitamin drips from holistically minded doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Her illness was also the catalyst for a major reality check in which she 
realized that working oneself into a stupor isn't the best way to live. And 
that, yes, you can love watching bad TV with your teddy bears and still be 
passionate about your work. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabankin's recovery has come just in time for another job switch. She'll soon 
become executive director of the Oscar Schindler Foundation, Steven Spielberg's 
new philanthropic venture. All of the director's profits from "Schindler's 
List" will be funneled into the organization when it starts up this fall. 
Tabankin expects it to "emerge as a major source of philanthropy about Jewish 
life and Jewish values." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Uber -director Spielberg beckoning, it was a difficult decision, she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offer presented itself out of the clear blue sky, and I think this is a 
great thing for the world that is being done," she says. "But I was in this 
tough bind because I was doing work that I loved." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Mike Farrell, a longtime friend and fellow activist, sums up the move 
this way: "She's been on a personal journey for the years I've known her, and 
the moves she's made have always been for the good -- not just for her, but for 
the good of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tabankin first felt her political calling as a young child. In her 46 years, 
friends say, she has maintained -- without so much as a hairline fracture -- 
the idealistic creeds that all people deserve equal rights and that one person 
can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I was born with it," she says, sitting in a cushy floral brocade 
chair in her West Los Angeles HWPC office. "I don't ever remember a time in my 
conscious memory where it didn't absorb me. Even as a little kid, I remembered 
how clearly the black kids in my class in Newark (N.J.) were treated 
differently from the white kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, a salesman, and her mother, a teacher and school administrator, 
weren't "particularly political at all," Tabankin says. 
</P>
<P>
 But their daughter recalls watching TV and being drawn to the plight of the 
farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like I had this epiphany because I'd met Cesar Chavez. It was like, 
'Oh my God, here are these farm workers and look how they're treated and we've 
got to boycott these things.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tabankin says her passion for wanting to help the oppressed never made her an 
outsider among her peers -- just different. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never thought about those things. They thought about 'Who's going to ask 
me out?' and 'Are my parents going to buy me a car?' But they were nice kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, she had more to deal with than friends who didn't understand her. She 
had a brother who was hit by a truck and killed, at age 8, before she was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big deal in the psychology and the drama of my family," she 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout her youth, no one would acknowledge or discuss the brother, 
although a huge oil portrait of him hung in the living room. "He was the 
essence of the house, but he was never mentioned. It was the weirdest thing in 
the world," Tabankin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was about 9 or 10, my cousins took me up into the attic. And they told 
me that the person in the picture had been my brother and what his name was and 
how he died." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she never lacked for material things or felt overprotected, Tabankin 
says the fallout from her brother's death was "growing up with parents who 
weren't very functional in a way that made an impression on me." 
</P>
<P>
 She forged a strong tie with her Aunt Hattie, her "surrogate mother" and 
disciplinarian, who lived with the family until Tabankin went to college. 
</P>
<P>
 One other incident put an indelible mark on a 15-year-old Tabankin: hearing 
state Sen. Tom Hayden speak when he was based in Newark as a community 
organizer and agitator. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is such a stark moment for me . . . because it was the embodiment of 
somebody doing something for a living that I could put myself into and say, 
'Oh, you can do this!' . . . I didn't have to be a nurse, or a doctor or a 
teacher. I could be that. And that's what I wanted to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabankin's mother hoped her daughter would go to Vassar or Radcliffe (then 
return home, get married, have kids and do volunteer work), but Tabankin had 
something less ivy-covered in mind. Her older cousin Larry, with whom she was 
very close, had gone to the University of Wisconsin. Plus, the campus was fast 
becoming a magnet for students fond of activism and not fond of the war. She 
was going to Madison or she wasn't going to college at all . 
</P>
<P>
 Guess who won that skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
 A political science major, Tabankin became student body vice president and 
says she spent "most of my four years in the streets, fighting against the war 
in Vietnam." It was exhilarating, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The exhilaration was that you were participating and doing something about 
something. There is an exhilaration that comes with acting in concert with your 
beliefs. There is a sort of cleanness to truth." 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing school, Tabankin studied the art of community organizing at 
Saul Alinsky's Industrial Areas Foundation in Chicago before returning home to 
care for her mother, who was dying of breast cancer. Her father died of 
Alzheimer's disease 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her Washington career started when she became the first female president of 
the National Student Assn. She then became director of the Youth Project, which 
raised grant money to help young peoples' community projects. 
</P>
<P>
 She was appointed head of VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) during the 
Carter Administration, which she calls "baptism by fire. . . . I went from 
being a hippie with wire-rimmed glasses and cowboy boots to gray suits and 
pearls. I was 29 years old. It was the critical management experience of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was back into foundation work, this time to head up the Washington, 
D.C.-based Arca Foundation, which concentrates on economic and political policy 
issues in Central America. During her time there, Tabankin consulted part time 
for the Streisand Foundation, whose causes include civil liberties, AIDS 
issues, and women's and children's causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabankin married Tom Asher, a fellow activist who is now a Massachusetts 
attorney, in 1974. After a "brutal" divorce in 1980, they eventually became 
good friends again. She remains close with her stepdaughter, Lauren, now 28, 
who remembers that Tabankin's bedtime stories re-created scenes of being 
tear-gassed in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she told it, it wasn't that it was funny," recalls Asher, a staffer in 
the women's bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor. "It was about a part of her 
I didn't know. She would tell me, 'This is what happened and we thought what 
they were doing was bad, so we decided to demonstrate.' It was part of her 
narrative, and I think I liked it because she survived. But I don't think I 
ever understood what she experienced until I was older." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabankin could have also recounted her stories of a wartime journey to North 
Vietnam when she was 22, at the invitation of that country's government. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she doesn't regret the decision, Tabankin acknowledges that she and 
others have felt lasting consequences from the controversy surrounding the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Vietnamese "were fighting a liberation struggle -- that didn't mean 
they had a right to torture prisoners," she says. "I, as a human rights 
activist, can't accept that. It's not just OK if it's from the left and not 
from the right." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabankin reconciled her feelings by working for Vietnam vets' causes: "That's 
my way of sort of dealing with my anti-war world. I've helped raise a lot of 
money over the years for Vietnam veterans." 
</P>
<P>
 During her tenure at VISTA, some conservative members of Congress called for 
an investigation of Tabankin and other liberal Carter Administration members. 
After an "incredibly horrible experience" that lasted for more than a year, 
Tabankin believes she "came away completely clean." Still, she wonders if she 
would ever be considered for a job in certain government branches. "I think 
they'd be nervous about me. I don't think they need to be because I think I 
learned a very good lesson from that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnam experience may have left scars, but it didn't make her 
controversy-shy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989 she went to the West Bank and met with Yasser Arafat, chairman of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, in a trip supported by the Arca Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one was a huge dilemma for me as a Jew. . . . I became a Jewish woman 
who (believed) that the survival of Israel meant hearing out a peaceful 
solution to the situation as opposed to taking a rigid view of don't negotiate, 
don't be flexible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After years in Washington, burnout turned to meltdown. With her chronic 
fatigue syndrome symptoms looming, she decided to quit Arca and come west. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to this very apartment and I never left," she says of her condo on the 
beach in Santa Monica. "For the first two years I was living with rented 
furniture, thinking clearly I was just here visiting. After my second year I 
sent all the rented stuff back and bought furniture." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, she succumbed to the California lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be reported," she says, laughing, "that I have become completely 
California. I get acupuncture once a week, I have a chiropractor and I get 
massages. I'm still political but I've definitely been California-ized." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabankin came to the HWPC at the recommendation of some Streisand Foundation 
board members and found the Hollywood community, unfettered by the rigidity of 
Washington, amazingly refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the HWPC she found women who shared her personal and political views, 
including support of abortion rights, gay rights and campaign-finance reform, 
an issue that consumes her. The membership is a who's who of talent and 
powerbrokers: producer Paula Weinstein; actresses Cybill Shepherd, Jane Fonda 
and Geena Davis; songwriter Marilyn Bergman, and studio exec Lisa Henson, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could be sitting behind their gates, but they choose to do this," 
Tabankin says. "And it's not a networking group. Nobody would dare pitch 
something to somebody. It would be so uncool. . . . There is no way that would 
work if there were men in the group." 
</P>
<P>
 What Tabankin brings to the group is a "sophisticated sense of how the 
political and entertainment communities can work together," says her friend 
Danny Goldberg, president of Atlantic Records. "She's uniquely effective in 
terms of maximizing the relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman, a co-founder of the group, knew of Tabankin's political reputation 
long before she played matchmaker to her, Streisand and the HWPC. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was kind of legendary," she recalls, "during the '60s and the Carter 
Administration. When I heard she was thinking of making this move (to Los 
Angeles), light bulbs went off in my head." 
</P>
<P>
 If Tabankin's working style is tough, Bergman says, "it's a kind of tough that 
comes from somebody who is so principled that they can't be compromised. And 
she's not intimidated or impressed by celebrities." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabankin remembers her initial meeting with Streisand this way: "When I walked 
away from it, I thought, she's really thin and little, and she knows all this 
stuff about the environment. How is that possible? I didn't know any Hollywood 
people, really, so that was my first impression." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tabankin acknowledges that one of the challenges in her HWPC position has 
been defending the why-should-we-take-stars-seriously-as-activists issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have to give up their American passports just because they work in 
this industry," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a warm Friday afternoon, Tabankin sits in a recliner with an intravenous 
drip in her arm. It's her standing weekly appointment for her mega-vitamin 
cocktail (20,000-plus milligrams of Vitamin C and other vitamin boosters), the 
only treatment that has helped yank her out of the debilitating, flu-like 
symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Once downplayed as possibly psychosomatic, the ailment is now recognized as a 
legitimate medical problem. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 
the National Institutes of Health are looking for causes and cures. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabankin likens the illness to " 'The Invasion of the Body Snatchers,' when 
you feel like the pods have moved in and taken over your life, or that you're 
fighting your way through these clouds." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the clouds have lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually went out to dinner the other night with friends, stayed out really 
late, came home, went to bed and came to work the next day. I thought I was 
never going to climb out of this. And it's like I've been given this incredible 
blessing right now." 
</P>
<P>
 But having the illness also guaranteed that Tabankin could no longer be the 
poster child for workaholism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very big growing experience for me," she says. "What's important to 
you becomes very clear. You have X amount of energy, so what are your real 
priorities?" 
</P>
<P>
 She's found that slowing down has its rewards: indulging in spy novels, going 
to movies alone, staying home watching stupid TV shows and ignoring the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "My escape and enjoyment," she says, "is to be taken away on a great adventure 
in a novel or spy story and I think people are really shocked by that. I say, 
'What do you think, that I just read the Economist? . . . I'm not this 
academic-policy egghead who's consumed with notions of democracy from the 
minute I wake up." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabankin wasn't always so guilt-free about allowing herself quality private 
time. Years of therapy, begun during her marriage, helped with the 
transformation, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to run around, I think, to avoid being alone," she says. "Part of what 
I did politically was to fill up all the time and all the space so I wouldn't 
have to be alone. But the older I got, and the more secure I got, the better I 
felt about myself. I really ended up loving being alone or with good friends. 
And that was, like, so fun." 
</P>
<P>
 She won't rule out getting married again, although she's not in a serious 
relationship. "I do have wonderful men that I share a lot of time with until I 
meet the right person," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tabankin is eager to enter a more thoughtful phase in her life, which should 
fit in perfectly with her Schindler Foundation work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing creative philanthropy you really need to have a strategy and you need 
to be able to step back and use that part of your brain that says, 'What is 
this going to lead to? Where is it going to go?' " 
</P>
<P>
 And where is Tabankin going to go? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not into politics, although friends have urged her for years to run 
for office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd much rather help pick the people who get elected," she explains. "But 
I've thought about it. Right after I left government, I almost ran for 
Congress. . . . (But) I think you have so little personal privacy, and I 
really, really value my private time." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, Tabankin is hoarding a cache of books -- the new Sue Grafton 
mystery and the best-selling thriller "The Day After Tomorrow" -- to take on 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 After she returns, she'll jump into another project, a grass-roots 
organization in South-Central L.A. called Common Ground that urges kids to stay 
in school. Tabankin works as a volunteer to raise money and awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand people who operate in a bubble," she says, "as if there's 
nothing going on in the world around them. . . . That is so not in my fiber of 
being. . . . Do one thing. Tutor one kid and all of a sudden you'll realize the 
connections everything has." Margery Tabankin 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 46 
</P>
<P>
 Native: No. Born in Newark, N.J., lives in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Politics, human and civil rights issues, campaign-finance reform, 
mystery novels, staying home and ignoring the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 On working for the Streisand Foundation: "It's been an extraordinary 
experience for me, in that it has enabled me to keep my fingers in the policy 
world of issues that I really care about. . . . It's a skill to give money away 
well. People don't understand the value and the role that creative philanthropy 
can play in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 On delegating authority: "I love doing that. The more you find good people and 
trust them, the more you can accomplish. In no way do I feel threatened by 
anybody else. With more competent people around me, I only look better and can 
do more." 
</P>
<P>
 On negotiating: "I am a terrible negotiator if I'm asked to negotiate 
something I don't believe in. I am incredibly transparent. If something turns 
me on or off you can see it in my eyes immediately, and it's one characteristic 
that I've benefited from and suffered from my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 On life in Southern California: "My friends in Washington, D.C., think I've 
gone over the deep end and I might as well be nesting in the Pacific Ocean 
right now. They think I went Hollywood and I'm doing acupuncture and getting 
massages and taking drives to the country, and here I was this intense 
political activist who was always on the Hill screaming about a bill, and 
what's happened to me? But I think I'm much more balanced than I ever have been 
in my life."

WHEN HOLLYWOOD JUST WON'T DO; PARTIES: ASK YOUR FRIENDS TO CELEBRATE YOUR 
BIRTHDAY IN MONTE CARLO? SURE, WHY NOT? THAT'S WHAT PRODUCER LARRY THOMPSON 
DID.

 The invitation is engraved on nine-ply paper, the approximate thickness of 
cardboard and presumably three plies thicker than the paper used by the Queen 
of England. 
</P>
<P>
 At top and center is the host's personal gold seal: an arrangement of coiled 
film, a phonograph record, the scales of justice, and Michelangelo's hands of 
God and man from the painting in the Sistine Chapel -- along with the words 
"For love of God, family, law and the arts."  
</P>

 LARRY THOMPSON  
</P>
<P>
 Fiftieth Summer of my  
</P>
<P>
 "La Dolce Vita"  
</P>
<P>
 I am traveling Around The World  
</P>
<P>
 and you, my Friend, are most graciously invited  
</P>
<P>
 to join my Celebrative Sojourn in  
</P>
<P>
 Monte Carlo  
</P>
<P>
 Principality of Monaco.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No, this is no ordinary wingding, even by Hollywood's over-budget standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before leaving for the Celebrative Sojourn, Thompson grabbed a Chinese 
chicken salad and a bottle of non-carbonated mineral water from the 
walk-through line at Maple Drive Cafe. (When he has to do lunch, he would more 
likely do it next door in the tonier Maple Drive restaurant.) 
</P>
<P>
 Of the party, he said, "We have about 40 RSVPs." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson is president of the Larry Thompson Organization, an independent 
motion picture and television production and personal management company. He 
has produced more than 120 hours of TV programming and four movies. Currently 
in the works is a film of Kahlil Gibran's "The Prophet." 
</P>
<P>
 At almost 50, Thompson's hairline is receding, but his hair is just long 
enough to be tied into the tiniest of ponytails. He looks robust and fit. For 
kicks, he rides his bright red Honda motor scooter. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Thompson got pretty banged up when he crashed on 
Mulholland Drive. "I came around a corner too fast, hit a shoulder and went 
flying and skidding with the bike falling on top of me." 
</P>
<P>
 If he needs confirmation for celebrating his life in such a grand manner in 
Monaco, he's found it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he arrived in Monte Carlo, Thompson and his girlfriend, Carla Herd, a 
chiropractor and former actress, traveled to Tokyo, China, Hong Kong, New 
Delhi, Cairo and Rome. In Rome, Thompson's sister, brother-in-law and mother 
were to meet up with them so they could fly together to Sardinia. 
</P>
<P>
 There they planned to board a 120-foot yacht, costing $60,000 per week, and 
sail to Monte Carlo, where the real partying was to begin this weekend. It was 
to start Saturday night with a cocktail party aboard the yacht. Today, lunch 
will be served on-board as the boat cruises to St. Jean-Cap-Ferratt; everyone 
is requested to wear white. Tonight, Thompson hosts a black-tie dinner at Hotel 
de Paris in a garden and terrace overlooking the Bay of Monaco and the palace. 
Monday, the yacht will cruise the bay as guests indulge in their favorite water 
sports. Lunch will be served at La Vigie at the Monte Carlo Beach Hotel. The 
party ends at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire enchilada is rumored to cost $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, understand, is not paying for his guests to wing into Monte Carlo or 
putting them up in hotels once they get there. That's their responsibility, he 
says. The guest list is considerably smaller than the list of names -- 
including big Hollywood stars -- who got invitations. 
</P>
<P>
 The only star expected is William Shatner, Thompson's best friend and client. 
Maybe money is an issue, we suggest. Few people, even rich people, would 
indulge in the expense of flying to Monte Carlo for three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would," said Thompson at lunch in Los Angeles. "I flew to Florence, Italy, 
for two days for David Bowie and Iman's wedding." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said he never thought of celebrating his birthday with a simple, 
local blowout. "It never entered my mind. I didn't want to work. When you have 
a party in Hollywood, you send limos to the celebrities to make sure they show 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year I went to Bob Shapiro's 50th at Bob Evans' house. They brought in 
artificial snow and covered Evans' whole back yard. I've been to so many damn 
parties. That's why I wanted to do this far away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living in Hollywood for 26 years, managing stars and producing movies, you 
can become myopic. You shouldn't judge a man by the height he attains, but also 
by the width and depth. So my life and my travels and my party are part of the 
healthy and spiritual growth that you need in a town that doesn't always 
otherwise provide it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Hollywood, a lot of people throw parties -- and I'm as guilty as they are 
-- who have layered agendas. Whereas this trip and party is strictly for family 
and friends in the real world. I wanted to take a moment in my life and career 
to take this extended trip. Of all the planet I've traveled, I wanted to share 
these places with my family."

WESTSIDE WATCH: FOR SHEENS, COMMUNITY SERVICE IS A FAMILY AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week actor Charlie Sheen was seen at Bread and Roses, a restaurant that 
serves free meals to the homeless. Although the young actor brought along an 
entourage of friends to serve orange juice and coffee, he kept a low profile. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheen and his father, Martin Sheen, appear frequently at the Bread and Roses 
to cook and serve meals and to converse with the homeless clients, according to 
the restaurant's staff. Apparently, Sheen the Younger is more reticent than 
Sheen the Elder about discussing his community service work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martin Sheen would have been shaking the reporter's hand right now," said one 
staffer as the younger Sheen hid in the kitchen, waiting for the reporter to 
leave the restaurant.

 OLIVE BRANCH POLITICS: Republican congressional candidate Richard Sybert is 
still having a tough time with Bob Hammer -- even after beating the runner-up 
by nearly a 3-1 margin in June's GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer said earlier this month that he would not back Sybert's bid to unseat 
U.S. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) because of the way the former 
senior aide to Gov. Pete Wilson roughed him up during the GOP primary. The 
campaign included attacks that questioned Hammer's credentials as a businessman 
and accusations that he was an indifferent citizen for failing to vote in 
several elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sybert refused to take no for an answer, and in a letter this week he 
mounted a fresh offensive to win Hammer over. In a personal missive, Sybert 
said it was his intention to appoint Hammer to the Ventura County Republican 
Central Committee. Under party rules, Sybert is an ex-officio member of the 
committee and, beyond that, may name an alternate to serve in his place. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Sybert politely warned Hammer that his refusal to endorse him -- and 
his willingness to talk about same to the media -- was only helping Beilenson. 
"You have to know that Mr. Beilenson will use your comments to help himself, 
and I can't believe you really want that after everything you said during the 
primary," Sybert wrote. "Let's meet over breakfast or lunch," the nominee 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hammer was unmoved. Thanks for the Central Committee offer, Hammer replied 
later in the week in a letter of his own. But, he added, his plans don't 
include getting deeply involved in party affairs, at least for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to earn a living again," Hammer told The Times, repeating his 
unwillingness to back Sybert.

 PEDAL PUSHERS: Cops' calf muscles will be challenged in West Hollywood Tuesday 
at the National Night Out, a yearly event observed nationwide that highlights 
the fight against neighborhood crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies are scheduled to race up the steep Horn Avenue hill in a 
quest for glory -- and, it turns out, a free dinner at Spago. Second prize is 
lunch at Mirabelle restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The bike race, organized by Sibyl Zaden, a resident who is active in the 
Neighborhood Watch program and the U.S. Cycling Federation, was created to 
publicize the Sheriff's Department's local bike patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be a good way of introducing the bicycle patrol to the 
neighborhood," Zaden said. "And we wanted to make this year's National Night 
Out special."

BUSINESS LURE; PROGRAM AT SOUTH-CENTRAL RESTAURANT DISHES UP JOB SKILLS TO 
TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE SEO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the outside, the Rainbow Inn Fish Market looks like nothing more than a 
homey South-Central take-out joint that serves up everything from half-pound 
burgers to banana pudding to fried catfish platters. 
</P>
<P>
 But something special is taking place inside the modest Main Street eatery -- 
and it isn't on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten youths have completed or are in the midst of a four-month training program 
to acquire fundamental job and business skills. The program, funded by a 
$20,000 California Community Foundation grant, was established last fall by the 
Abundance of Christ Church in South-Central and the Kehillath Israel Synagogue 
in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We opened the restaurant because we wanted to give something back to the 
community," said Pastor Robbie Horton of Abundance of Christ Church, which is 
across the street from the restaurant. "We only employ people from the 
community and give them opportunities they might otherwise not have." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, four young women in their teens and early 20s stood 
around the tiny eatery, slicing vegetables, weighing fish and waiting on 
customers eager to sample the restaurant's red beans and rice and other 
Southern fare. The smell of grilled hamburgers and fried fish filled the 
kitchen as the young women wearing white T-shirts and jeans went about their 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eeeeew," 15-year-old Brisa Becerra said as she tried unsuccessfully to chop 
off the head of a catfish. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no. This is how you do it," manager Anita Harrison said as she grabbed a 
knife and sliced off the fish's head with one swoop. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're learning how to prepare food, but they're also learning how to 
operate office equipment and do bookkeeping," said Harrison, who is responsible 
for training the youths and running the business. "We're trying to teach them 
how to run a business so that they can get Other jobs or maybe open their own 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 The job-training program grew out of a partnership between the church and 
synagogue called Two Cultures/One Heart. The church's gospel choir first 
visited the synagogue in early 1992, as part of a Martin Luther King Jr. 
birthday celebration. After the riots, synagogue leaders contacted the church 
and offered their assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took care of 2,000 families by delivering them food, clothes and 
furniture," Horton said. "After that, we decided to create a long-range plan. 
We informed them that the church was going to open a restaurant, and they have 
been a tremendous support to us since then." 
</P>
<P>
 A synagogue member, who works in the personnel department at Target, helped a 
program graduate get a job at one of the company's stores. Other members have 
offered employment counseling and have donated supplies and materials. Church 
and synagogue members also have sponsored joint religious services, 
recreational activities and other programs for South-Central residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten to be a very comfortable relationship," said Sandi Merwitzer, a 
member of the synagogue who stops by the restaurant every week. "We try to 
provide them with whatever they need." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Merwitzer showed up at the fish market with a stack of coupons she 
had printed for the restaurant and a pile of practice Scholastic Aptitude 
Tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought this would help some of the kids prepare for college," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four participants who have already completed the program, two went to 
college or training schools, one is enrolled in a different job-training 
program and one works at Target. 
</P>
<P>
 Becerra, a Jordan High School student who has worked at the restaurant for the 
past two months, learned of the program by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked the pastor if he could open the church's gate so I could play 
basketball, and he asked me if I could work," she said. "I asked my dad, and he 
said it would be OK. So far, it's been going pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants receive $4.25 an hour and work 15 hours a week. The progRam is 
funded by California Community Foundation's Community Bridges program, a 
$1-million effort to support inter-ethnic collaborations. Sixteen 
community-based organizations were awarded grants late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the job-training program at the Rainbow Inn Fish Market has gone 
smoothly, its future remains in doubt because the grant money will expire this 
fall. The restaurant also is struggling financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business has been slow," Horton said, "but we're going to try really hard to 
keep the program going." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harrison: "The majority of the kids have never worked before and don't 
have skills that could get them jobs. I didn't know how much of a need there 
was for a program like this until we got started. The kids find out that they 
can be somebody."

JOY RIDERS THREATEN DELICATE EL SEGUNDO NATURE PRESERVE; ECOLOGY: VANDALS MAY 
DESTROY THE HABITAT OF THE ENDANGERED BLUE BUTTERFLY THAT LIVES IN THE DUNES 
NEAR LAX, ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If the largest remaining site of coastal dunes in Southern California is hard 
to find, it isn't because it's remote. 
</P>
<P>
 In the shadow of Los Angeles International Airport, the El Segundo Dunes Blue 
Butterfly Nature Preserve is home to 11 threatened varieties of flora and 
fauna, including its endangered namesake. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the eight years since it was established, the 200-acre preserve has 
also become the target of a troubling breed of vandal: late-night joy riders on 
all-terrain vehicles who have repeatedly savaged the delicate landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest incident 10 days ago caused environmentalists to express fear for 
the future of the fragile ecosystem and prompted Los Angeles City Councilwoman 
Ruth Galanter to criticize the security provided by the Department of Airports, 
which owns the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say a vandal or vandals used heavy bolt cutters to enter a 
little-used gate, then plowed through several of the highest dunes, seriously 
damaging plants and seedlings considered vital to the rare butterfly's 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The preserve, on a narrow coastal strip at the end of the airport's runways, 
is home to most of the estimated 5,000 El Segundo blue butterflies known to 
exist. Much of the area was cleared of houses when LAX was built in the early 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The butterfly's survival depends almost entirely on the delicate coastal 
buckwheat, which butterfly pupa depend on for nectar. Officials said the 
fragile plant was among the most heavily damaged by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really tragic," said Irena Mendez, project scientist at the preserve. 
"When you kill one of these plants, you effectively kill the butterflies." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third time in eight months that trespassers on all-terrain 
vehicles, commonly called ATVs, have entered the state-funded preserve, and the 
fifth such incident in five years, said Adriano Mattoni, its chief restoration 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 In the worst incident last November, vandals caused an estimated $25,000 
damage to equipment, seedlings and habitat, scattering thousands of seeds that 
Mattoni had hoped to use for the next planting season. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter, who played a key role in designating the dunes as a protected area 
and securing restoration funds, expressed outrage over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only have these idiots severely damaged an environmentally sensitive 
area, but they have destroyed the work of hundreds of concerned people," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilwoman was especially critical of the Department of Airports, saying 
the incident "reflects very poorly" on its efforts to provide security. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration has several important pieces of 
navigational equipment at the preserve, including a transmitter that enables 
aircraft to lock in on the airport from as far as 300 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter said that, besides the environmental damage, the incidents raise 
questions about the Department of Airport's ability to protect the navigational 
equipment, which she said "poses a threat to millions of passengers flying in 
and out of LAX." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Department of Airports said that airport police have 
stepped up patrols of the preserve and intend to assess what additional 
measures may be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Cora Fossett said that the department's general manager, John 
Driscoll, and Galanter intend to meet Monday to discuss the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are as distraught as anyone when these things occur," Fossett said, adding 
that the department is "eager and willing to formulate any new security 
strategies that may be needed."

BRIEFLY: RESEARCH: SUBJECTS FOR GLAUCOMA STUDY SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Researchers are seeking people at risk of developing glaucoma to take part in 
a nationwide study on whether the disease can be prevented or delayed through 
the early use of prescription eyedrops. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Jules Stein Eye Institute and Charles R. Drew University are urging 
people between the ages of 40 and 80 who believe they may develop glaucoma to 
contact Rebecca Ann Rudenko at (213) 563-5903 about free screenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the study, sponsored by the National Eye Institute of the National 
Institutes of Health, randomly selected participants will receive eye 
medications at no charge and will not be billed for research costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Their insurance carriers, however, will be billed for standard medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Those at greater risk of glaucoma, or ocular hypertension, include people who 
have diabetes or high blood pressure, those who are nearsighted, those with a 
family history of glaucoma and those of African ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers say the study will involve prescription eyedrops that have long 
been used safely to treat glaucoma, not experimental drugs.

BRIEFLY: EDUCATION: PRINCIPAL TO SIT ON EXPERT PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local high school principal has been named to the recently formed Carnegie 
Task Force on Learning in the Primary Grades, a nationwide panel of experts 
studying ways to improve elementary school education. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Martinez, principal at Farragut Elementary School in Culver City and 
founder of language immersion programs at the school, has joined Los Angeles 
Unified Superintendent Sid Thompson on the 18-member task force, but Martinez 
is the only principal on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very honored to be named to the Task Force on Learning. I feel a great 
responsibility to other principals around the U.S. for us to create good 
educational policy," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antony Ward, executive director of the task force, said Martinez's pioneering 
efforts in language immersion programs made him an ideal candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force, which includes educators, journalists, business leaders and 
attorneys from around the nation, will study the education of children ages 3 
through 10 and report its findings and recommendations in two years.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTSIDE VILLAGE; STOP-BY POLICE STATION TO OPEN MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A police way station opens this week in the Palms and Westside Village area. 
Patrol officers can stop there to take care of minor business, giving them 
higher visibility and more presence on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Ruth Galanter will dedicate the "police stop-by" station, which 
features a bathroom, telephone, refrigerator and desk, on Monday at 9 a.m. The 
station, at 3310 Motor Ave., will be open for residents when a police officer 
happens to be there, but there are no scheduled hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from the Los Angeles Police Department's Pacific Division had told 
residents they could patrol the area better if they didn't have to return to 
their home station at Culver Boulevard and Centinela Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon afterward, funds were collected from the Westside Village Homeowners 
Assn., individual residents and local businesses. Resident John Alonzo 
installed a telephone line in his name, promising to pay the bill for six 
months. The owner of the storefront that houses the station reduced the monthly 
rent from $750 to $500. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone number for the stop-by station is (310) 281-8401. KATHLEEN

COVER STORY; IN THE NAME OF PUPPY LOVE; ANIMALS: LOCAL RESIDENTS WILLINGLY 
SPEND HUNDREDS, EVEN THOUSANDS, OF DOLLARS ON VETERINARY SPECIALISTS AND 
HIGH-TECH TREATMENTS FOR THEIR PETS, FROM TEETH-CLEANING TO DELICATE SURGERIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Rumi, ailing from pancreatitis, rests on her back as a doctor uses ultrasound 
to scan her inflamed pancreas and liver. Max, suffering from inexplicable 
fainting spells, sits in an examining bay with a 24-hour electrocardiogram 
halter strapped to his chest and back. 
</P>
<P>
 And Spice, racked by fits of reverse sneezing, has a fiber-endoscope snaked 
down her throat to her gastrointestinal tract. 
</P>
<P>
 In this age of high-tech medicine, there is nothing unusual about this array 
of imposing, state-of-the art diagnostic equipment -- except that these 
patients are pets. The three animals at this West Los Angeles veterinary 
center, all dogs, protest only with an intermittent bark or yowl as specialists 
give them care akin to what their owners expect from high-priced doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned about this dog," said specialist David G. Feldman, viewing 
Rumi's pancreas on the ultrasound monitor. "She went into a coma and almost 
died, got better and then had a relapse. . . . Now we just keep her on an IV 
and medication and see if she can heal herself." 
</P>
<P>
 As medical treatment for humans has advanced in recent decades, so has 
veterinary medicine. The trend has been fueled by pet owners able and willing 
to part with hundreds, even thousands, of dollars to prolong the lives of their 
beloved animals. Such pet owners -- and the advanced veterinary practices that 
serve them -- are found in particularly high concentrations in upscale 
communities such as those on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safe to say that Southern California and New York City are the leading 
areas for the cutting edge of veterinary medicine," said Stephen J. Ettinger, a 
specialist widely known among veterinarians as the father of veterinary 
cardiology. 
</P>
<P>
 Small wonder, then, that the Westside has veterinary specialists in surgery, 
dentistry, dermatology, cardiology, internal medicine -- even oncology. Unlike 
general veterinarians, specialists receive about eight years of veterinary 
education and must pass both the standard veterinary exams and board 
certification tests before they are formal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Southland veterinarians unable to treat or diagnose complex diseases or 
congenital problems will refer patients to these specialists, many of whom also 
perform general veterinary services to keep their practices busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the Westside is home to the California Animal Hospital, a center 
that houses about $1 million dollars worth of medical equipment. The hospital, 
which treated Rumi, Max and Spice, has been likened to UC Davis' world-renowned 
veterinary school. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. hospital and UC Davis own the state's only two veterinary "colorflow" 
Doppler ultrasound machines, a high-tech tool that shows internal organs and 
blood flow, yielding information that can be critical, for instance, in the 
diagnosis of heart problems. For about a third of what the human procedures 
cost, the veterinarians install pacemakers, repair faulty heart valves and do 
kidney dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one has exact figures, Richard Holden, executive director of the 
Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn., says the Westside has more 
veterinary specialists than any other region in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area really allows us to practice the kind of medicine we were trained 
to do," said Robert B. Olds, a veterinary surgeon since 1975 who began 
practicing when there were only three such specialists on the Westside. "The 
population is well-educated, their pets are part of the family. They really put 
a lot of demand on us. People can afford it too. In a rural area, you would not 
see that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Driving the demand are pet owners such as George Sarandos of Valencia, a 
middle school principal who spent about $2,700 to cure Spice, one of his three 
dogs, of her sneezing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People criticize and talk about the starving in Rwanda and the homeless in 
Santa Monica that I could give money to," Sarandos said. "But I say (pets) are 
a gift from God, and he has given me enough money to care for them, and I can 
choose to do what I want with that money. She's my baby. I'd mortgage my house 
to get that dog well. When I adopt a dog, it's like a marriage, for better or 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Suffice it to say that Sarandos and love-struck pet owners like him keep 
specialists in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Kafka, a caramel-colored stray dog, might well have gotten the "Old Yeller" 
treatment (a walk behind the barn and a bullet) if he'd been in a rural 
community. But Kafka, who has been temporarily adopted by one of Olds' 
employees until she can find it a home, is the recipient of a $1,000 surgery to 
reconstruct a broken pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
 In the operating room, an out-cold Kafka, dwarfed by mammoth surgical lights 
overhead, is stretched out on the table and hooked up to a respirator, 
electrocardiogram and an IV of anesthesia. Olds slices through the hip muscle, 
cauterizing blood vessels as he goes. 
</P>
<P>
 With a tiny mallet and a tool resembling a chisel, he taps vigorously at the 
original fracture in the right ilium,a section of pelvic bone, to re-break it 
in the same place. He then fits the area with a stainless steel plate, the same 
type used on humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Holes are drilled for inch-long screws that will hold the angled plate in 
place, allowing the dog to walk without a limp and abating constipation caused 
by the collapsed hip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do one of these surgeries once every two years," said Olds. Plate surgeries 
were pioneered on people in the 1960s and applied to dogs in the 1970s, he 
said. "These dogs are in pain and their bodily functions are compromised. It is 
very satisfying to watch the animal be able to walk." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Animal Medical Center in West Los Angeles, Mona P. Rosenburg, one of 
only three veterinary oncologists in Southern California, sees her terminally 
ill cancer patients on the floor of an examining room. She scratches their 
bellies, coos words of encouragement and offers milk bones or cat snacks at the 
end of a session. This day, she gives Pooter, a 10-year-old Welsh Corgie mix in 
remission from lymphoma, a dose of chemotherapy through an IV. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I try to do is improve the quality and quantity of life for my 
patients," said Rosenburg, who estimates the cost of cancer treatment for a pet 
at about $3,000 a year. "The patients I see are members of the family. But if 
the treatment becomes worse than the disease, I stop, because I don't believe 
in continuing." 
</P>
<P>
 Cradling Pooter while Rosenburg administers the drug, Bill Swanson, the dog's 
owner, explains: "I guess it's empty nest syndrome. . . . We have three kids 
who are grown and gone. I thought I had myself talked into putting her to 
sleep, but I couldn't do it. How do you make that decision? My wife would be in 
a mental ward if anything happened to this dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Rollins, a professor of physiology and psychology at Colorado State 
University at Ft. Collins who studies the relationships between people and 
animals, said the Swansons' devotion is not unusual -- despite what could 
easily become a five-figure veterinary bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Animals are assuming increasing importance in people's lives because of 
urbanization and are often the only contact with nature," Rollins said. "And 
with the disintegration of tight and extended families, people relate to 
animals as family members. It's not uncommon for people . . . to spend in the 
six figures when treating their animals for cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly not all specialty procedures are life or death matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider British-born Anthony D. Shipp, a Beverly Hills' dog and cat dentist 
who is one of only 29 such specialists in the world. His services range from 
routine teeth-cleaning ($165 to $195), which has become increasingly popular 
among pet owners whose animals are living longer, to more high-tech procedures 
such as crowns ($585) and, in extremely rare instances, orthodontics (upward of 
$500). 
</P>
<P>
 With a metal prop holding open the mouth of Laney, a 13-year-old shepherd mix, 
Shipp hunches over, cutting away flaps of the dog's gums to remove the lower 
right molar, deteriorated from a cavity. After breaking the tooth and drilling, 
Shipp, who invented a double-ended toothbrush that has a small end for cats and 
a large end for dogs, extracts the tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did perfect," says Shipp to Leslie Lazner, the dog's owner, who stands at 
the operating table. Laney's worn, stuffed bear is nearby on a shelf. "Cavities 
cause all sorts of problems: infections, loss of teeth. And the infection can 
spread through the rest of the body or into the jawbone. I tell my clients, 
'You don't have to brush all of your pet's teeth, just the ones you want to 
keep.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Few places underscore the high-tech strides being made in veterinary care more 
than the California Animal Hospital, home to 20 veterinarians grouped into 
independent practices. Each practice shares the hospital's sophisticated 
radiology department. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the veterinarians are board-certified specialists. In the hospital's 
surgery department, specialist Scott Anderson deftly cuts a window into the 
vertebrae of a 6-year-old West Highland white terrier with a slipped disc, then 
removes disc material that resembles cottage cheese from where it had 
compressed the spinal chord. The dog recovers from the delicate surgery, which 
costs about $1,200, in an incubator sort of cubicle that controls temperature 
and oxygen levels. 
</P>
<P>
 On an operating table to Anderson's right, surgeon Phillip J. Gill amputates a 
cat's cancerous ear. Skin cancers around the eyelids, nose and remaining ear 
are vaporized through laser surgery, leaving the spots ashen but cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
 As prone to skin cancer as a fair-skinned person, the albino cat had his left 
eye surgically removed last year after skin cancer weakened the eye-socket 
muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rumi, Max and Spice, after undergoing tests at the animal hospital, 
receive their diagnoses and prescribed treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 For the wire-haired terrier Max, plagued by bouts of fainting, the problem is 
epilepsy and is treatable with the same medication prescribed for the disease 
in humans. 
</P>
<P>
 For the beagle, Spice, a dog with an extraordinarily good disposition -- 
demonstrated by vigorous tail wagging during an endoscopic exam -- drugs will 
alleviate the reverse sneezing, caused by a muscle problem in the pharynx. 
</P>
<P>
 But the news for Rumi, the 4-year-old chocolate Labrador whose medical bill 
was already more than $5,000, was not good. Exploratory surgery confirmed that 
she suffers from severe pancreatitis, which has caused so much stress in other 
organs that the dog is diabetic and has hepatitis. Unable to eat or drink, 
she'd have to be fed intravenously for an indefinite amount of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the dog's owners decided that keeping Rumi alive would be selfish 
because the quality of her life would deteriorate and she probably would not 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
 She was put to sleep last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take some comfort that we did everything that we could," said Rumi's 
owner, Michael Auerbach. "You always know that with an animal, you'll outlive 
them, but you don't expect it when they're so young. It's very sad. We miss 
her. We'll always remember her and be happy that she was a part of our lives."

 You think you have problems? Leo Evans has 1,050 -- all of his own creation. 
</P>
<P>
 They're called brain calisthenics, and Evans, 81, has written more than 40 
volumes -- all in longhand -- of puzzles, anagrams, word games, riddles and 
quirky ideas that wake his mind up at all hours of the day and night. 
</P>
<P>
 It started 35 years ago as a project to challenge his teen-age son and now it 
is a second career as he tours senior residence facilities challenging people 
whose biggest event of the day is lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shakespeare said, 'I trick into learning with a laugh,' and that's what I 
do," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans was originally trained as a lawyer, practiced for six years in Detroit 
but quit after deciding that he could not put up with what he terms "the 
immorality of it all." 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like a parasite. It was during the Depression. People didn't have 
money and I was suing them, bringing more misery and grief into their lives, 
and I didn't like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he moved to California and became a successful furniture salesman, 
eventually owning five stores called Leon's Interiors. Evans was living in 
Compton with a wife and two children when he became disenchanted with the 
public school system and decided to spend one afternoon a week with his son and 
five of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I emphasized imagination and creativity -- right brain activity. The boys had 
no training in logic and problem solving so I taught them that and how to 
learn, how to speak in public," he said. "We worked on developing self-esteem 
and how to be unreasonable, meaning there's more than one answer to any 
problem. Two of those boys were juvenile delinquents, but they all grew up to 
become professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 For a year, Evans schooled himself in the work of Edward De Bono and Alex 
Osborne -- noted, respectively, for their work in problem solving and applied 
imagination. He learned about the harm of being right, the value of 
self-control rather than just control and the benefits of failure, and he kept 
adding material to an already bulging loose-leaf notebook. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something in me said collect it and someday it will be useful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long after his son grew up, Evans continued to add more pages and more 
loose-leaf notebooks to his collection. Four years ago, when a relative was 
confined to a nursing home and diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, Evans 
decided to visit. He remembers wondering if she could think and solve problems. 
When he entered the home, he saw blank faces. There was little or no 
conversation going on and what there was concerned complaints about food and 
health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember thinking I wanted to rescue them. I saw myself as a knight in 
armor changing their lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Evans has a new career. He is paid to stimulate minds and enrich lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see results immediately. They laugh. They solve puzzles faster. They're not 
afraid to make mistakes. That's the big one -- getting out of the habit of 
thinking there's only one answer and not being afraid of appearing silly if you 
make a mistake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, Evans starts every new group with an inane question: "What's the 
difference between a chicken?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, the first response is, 'Between a chicken and what?' When I say I 
want something else, the people with negative attitudes say that's ridiculous, 
then some say you're crazy -- why am I here? I respond that the question is 
ridiculous, so what kind of an answer does it deserve? Go with it. Come up with 
something funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans admits he gets a lot of kicks from his visits and loves to watch old 
videos of some of the early sessions. He makes a standard speech in all of 
them: "You all have a genius inside of you (that) you don't even think is there 
and I'll prove it to you. For some of you it's your first childhood. If you 
expect miracles, they will happen. Miracles do not happen to pessimistic people 
because they are always looking for what is wrong with the world, they're never 
alert to the coincidences which go into creating a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans wants to eventually consolidate his 40 hand-written volumes into a book 
of brain exercises. But for now he's playing tennis -- he learned to play with 
his left hand after arthritis hampered his right one -- and generally enjoying 
his Marina del Rey bachelor life. He hikes, hangs out with young people, goes 
to church and will most likely take his third trip down the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 He continues to look for the fun in everything and the play on words. No 
discussion with him is possible without some brain exercise. To wit: 
</P>
<P>
 1. A man left a restaurant, didn't pay and instead gave the cashier a note 
with 102004180 on it. What does his message mean? 
</P>
<P>
 2. What famous childhood song is this? M CE M CE M CE 
</P>
<P>
 3. A train, one mile long, going 60 miles per hour, is just entering a tunnel 
which is one mile long. How long will it take for the train to pass completely 
through the tunnel? 
</P>
<P>
 4. If yesterday was three days before Saturday, what will tomorrow be? 
</P>
<P>
 Answers: 
</P>
<P>
 1. I ought to owe nothing for I ate nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Three Blind Mice 
</P>
<P>
 3. Two minutes. The train is going one mile a minute. In one minute it is 
completely in the tunnel and in another minute it is out of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Friday. Three days before Saturday is Wednesday. That was yesterday, so 
today is Thursday. Tomorrow is Friday.

ANOTHER DRINK OF THE BLUES: THE RACE CARD IN THE SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stanley Crouch, Stanley Crouch, author of Notes of a Hanging Judge (Oxford), 
was a 1993 recipient of the MacArthur Foundation genius fellowship. He is 
currently finishing a biography of Charlie Parker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the O.J Simpson case, we are allowed another chance to recognize how 
fallacious is the idea that black Americans are some perpetually excluded group 
forced to watch the parade of society from behind a barbed-wire fence. If 
anything, the Simpson story is further proof of the fact that black Americans 
are at the center of our national tale -- functioning both as flesh and blood 
movers and metaphors in the continuing democratic debate that redefines our 
policies and our attitudes toward our political, professional and intimate 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of Afro-American culture and the civil-rights movement has touched 
us everywhere, from the dance floor to the senatorial debate. In professional 
athletics, Curt Flood was the martyr who led the way to the idea of free 
agentry, destroying his baseball career in the process. Army Sgt. Perry J. 
Watkins was the first homosexual I became aware of who was openly willing to 
take on the military. Now, because of the Simpson case, ravages of domestic 
violence have risen into high media view, just as deep questions of sexual 
harassment came with the charges Anita F. Hill laid on Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is impossible to discuss issues of freedom and fair play with any 
seriousness and not recognize the ways in which black Americans have indelibly 
influenced our attitudes and policies. It is also impossible to pretend that 
victimization has not become a growth industry. We make most-favored-victim 
laws; we hire separatist boneheads onto our university faculties; we tailor our 
history to self-flagellating theories; experience the national Peeping Tom 
craze for geeks on talk TV, and slip through our problems on the snake oil of 
recovery experts. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why the Simpson case is so loaded. It is fused to a complexity that 
will play itself out in everything from eloquence to lunacy, high-mindedness to 
opportunism, as the trial progresses. The charges against him, and what we 
think we now know about his world, put us smack dab in the middle of our 
schizophrenic suspicion of privilege and our "wish for kings," as Lewis H. 
Lapham calls it. Simpson's American dream wealth was made possible by the 
gold-rush aspect of our society that we most often see in the worlds of popular 
entertainment and drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he had an objective talent that separated him from the stars of pop 
music and movies, Simpson moved from the back of the bus to the wheel by 
playing a boy's game -- which meant that he excelled in the excessively 
celebrated adolescent world of sports. His generosity as an athlete was 
displayed when he brought the offensive line who blocked for him to his 
locker-room interviews, clarifying the importance of the team to his 
achievements. He was the strong, nearly silent type, low-keyed and marvelous at 
his game. 
</P>
<P>
 With the blood-encrusted gore of the murders and the inevitable snooping into 
the darker sides of his intimate life, Simpson joined the long line of figures 
whose private lives have a dissonant relationship to their public images. 
Though race wasn't discussed at first, there was always a media code. The 
murdered ex-wife was endlessly referred to as "the beautiful, blonde Nicole," 
while he was never described as "the handsome, brown, woolly-headed O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 Some dismiss her description as typical of mass-media sexism of the sort 
reserved for blondes and redheads. They are partly correct, because the blonde 
has had an unnaturally high position in our erotic iconography since the 
peroxide explosion of the '30s. But it is also true that Nicole's color was 
underlined in code because she was half of an interracial couple living in a 
world whisper-close to those deep-dipped in the decadence and melodrama of 
upper-class soap operas. Finally, there must be, in the wake of so many black 
brutes in the popular work of writers like Alice Walker and Toni Morrison, the 
question of whether this is what any woman should be prepared for from one of 
them , rich or poor, famous or nameless. 
</P>
<P>
 In a court of law, none of these things should matter. It would be pretty to 
think so, but once it is possible to play the race trump in a city that has the 
recent history of Los Angeles, one shouldn't be surprised to hear the card 
loudly smack the media table. Still, the ways in which race, class, sex and 
ideas about racial allegiance can influence potential jurors, law enforcement 
and the legal process itself are much more complicated than their surfaces 
would suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of affirmative action, whites seem more bothered when executive 
positions are held by mediocre or incompetent black people than by their white 
parallels; the sustained, murderous barbarism of black street crime transforms 
the tolerance of the most exasperated into a simmering racism, and the flippant 
hedonism of the worst upper-class black party animals instigates envy and 
resentment, even in certain police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why the dirt on Det. Mark Fuhrman won't be taken lightly. His 
confessed hostility toward "Mexicans and niggers" in 1983, his supposed 
membership in a group opposed to female police officers, the whispered 
allegations of sexual harassment and his imperious bending of the Fourth 
Amendment by scaling the wall of Simpson's estate, rerun all the vilest 
stereotypes about the Los Angeles Police Department. This makes the possibility 
of his planting the bloody glove plausible among those most wary of white men 
with badges and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Such elements give unfortunate weight to the racial admonishments put on Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti by defense lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and the Los Angeles 
civil-rights Establishment. A grand irony is that if Garcetti submits to the 
pressure and pushes for an integrated jury, black women could easily be wild 
cards as not, given the resentment a large number feel toward successful black 
men who marry white women, thereby reducing the limited pool available to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The television interview with Nicole Brown Simpson's therapist in which she 
said the murdered woman told her that she enjoyed sparking her ex-husband's 
jealousy could make some men think she was cruelly toying with the green-eyed 
monster in her hot black man and paid the consequences. It is possible, with 
Cochran now on the defense team, that intimations of what Clarence Thomas 
called "a high-tech lynching" will maintain the constant and incantational 
undertone of a mantra. That will make it the prosecution's slippery job to 
prove otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 So we end up in a big, fat, peculiarly American mess, the kind that allows us 
to understand why one writer said she would chose a good case of murder if her 
desire was to ascertain the broadest identity of a culture. In this case of 
blonde on black, omnipresent media magnification, wife-beating, sudden wealth, 
work-out partners, golf courses, the disco life, Bentleys rolling into 
MacDonald's, rumors of drug-spiced promiscuity and the ugly punctuation marks 
of two bloody victims in a high-rent district, we are forced to examine almost 
everything that crosses the t's of our American lives. What we will finally 
learn, however, is the smell and the taste of another long drink of the blues.*

MASS TRANSIT / IN THE CITY OF CARS; ULTIMATE CAR CULTURE WAS BUILT ON PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Starr, Kevin Starr, a contributing editor to Opinion, teaches in the 
School of Urban and Regional Planning at USC. The newest volume in his history 
of California, The Dream Endures: California Through the Great Depression, will 
published by Oxford University Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every now and then -- like now -- Los Angeles is reminded that there is no 
such thing as a functioning city without mass transit. With near-pornographic 
glee, the Adam Smith boys have been of late trashing the very idea of publicly 
supported mass transit as not only unnecessary, but an economic catastrophe. 
The automobile and para-transit, claim these hyper-free marketeers, left to 
their own devices, can out-perform public transit, no contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell that to the half-million and more commuters left stranded Monday morning 
by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority walk-out. In their panic about 
getting to work, commuters left high and dry by public transit did not have the 
luxury of the Adam Smith crowd's comparative statistics. Instead, standing in 
bewilderment on corners where no buses came, they confronted the Gordian knot 
of Los Angeles transit history -- from which there is no escape. 
</P>
<P>
 They were discovering, among other things, that the vaunted automobile culture 
of greater Los Angeles is dependent on public transit. Put another half-million 
people on the road -- as the MTA strike did -- and the already overloaded 
freeway system edges toward gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Less directly (but the lesson will sink in over time), stranded commuters were 
discovering that public transit, having made Los Angeles possible in the past, 
is irrevocably part of the Los Angeles present and future. Public transit 
cannot be banished. It is, among other things, public space, hence shared 
identity, as well as a primary agent of social justice. Public transit is a 
civic covenant as irrevocable as our park and library systems, our police and 
fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The big delusion of Los Angeles history is that public transit was banished in 
the 1930s and 1940s -- with the scrapping of streetcars and interurban 
electrics. Like most delusions, this one contains a grain of historical truth. 
Certainly, by the late 1930s, the citizens of Los Angeles were enjoying 
drive-in restaurants (serviced by a new example of the American Girl -- the 
car-hop); automobile-friendly motels and bungalow courts, and even a few 
drive-in churches and banks. Shops and department stores, churches and 
synagogues, high schools and junior colleges sustained large rear surface 
parking lots; and the model pioneered by the Richfield Building in the 1920s, 
the underground garage in an office building, was becoming increasingly common 
in new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 For geographical reasons -- the barrier formed by the San Gabriel and Santa 
Monica Mountains on the east and the Pacific Ocean on the west -- the City of 
Los Angeles was forced to accommodate the entire north-south traffic of 
Southern California, including the distribution of automobiles to the 43 cities 
and towns then in Los Angeles County. Not surprisingly, the City of Angels 
pioneered the one-way street, the traffic island and the rigid restriction of 
left turns into on-coming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more: the sound of traffic became the music of the city, like a Max 
Steiner score in a Hollywood film. In late 1937, a group of musicologists 
measured the wave frequency of traffic noises in various pitches throughout the 
city and discovered that the total pitch of Los Angeles was F natural, the 
fourth interval of the diatonic scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet back behind this identity -- indeed inherent in it -- was the historical 
creation of Los Angeles by the Big Red Cars of the Pacific Electric Co. and the 
yellow cars of the Los Angeles system. Perfected in the late 1880s by Frank J. 
Sprague, an assistant of Thomas Edison, the electric streetcar, followed by the 
interurban electric, made the suburb possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was this more true than in Los Angeles. By 1910, the Pacific Electric 
linked more than 50 communities in four counties -- Los Angeles, portation 
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino -- into one suburban whole. The system 
pushed as far south as Newport, as far east as Redlands, San Bernardino and 
Riverside, and as far north as San Fernando. There were 1,164 miles of track, 
the largest such electrical transit system in the world. Six hundred trains a 
day passed through the Los Angeles Terminal alone, the largest building west of 
the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 A past like this is never shaken. The very idea of Los Angeles was invented by 
public transit. The automobile subsumed this identity, and, as we are now 
experiencing with the MTA strike, remained dependent upon its success. 
</P>
<P>
 Historian Scott Bottles has disproved the myth, once and for all, that a 
conspiracy by General Motors and other automobile and tire interests destroyed 
the Red Car system. It is more correct to say the system lost out to the 
automobile. What the detective says in the film "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" -- 
namely, that Los Angeles has the best streetcar system in the world and will 
never abandon it -- has an unintended irony. Haunted by the memory of the Big 
Red Cars, which brought it into being, Los Angeles County is spending billions 
and billions of dollars on subway, light rail and bus systems -- as if to 
re-possess the urban vitality of that mass-transit era. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Red Cars, it must be remembered, were privately owned and operated. 
Which is the point. The key issue in the current MTA strike is the contracting 
of maintenance service to the private sector. This is inevitable. Sadly, the 
mechanics union, instead of seeking to maintain its status in the process -- 
demanding union benefits for mechanics employed by private sub-contractors -- 
decided to bring the entire MTA system to a halt, with disastrous results for 
both commuters and the cause of true unionism in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 A glorious opportunity, rich in historical resonance, is being lost. What if 
the MTA, while remaining a public agency, reconnected with the private sector, 
as it is seeking to do in the issue of maintenance? What if the MTA, secure in 
the knowledge that it is an inevitable component of the city's destiny, were to 
allow privately sponsored para-transit to supplement its services? What if the 
Adam Smith gang stopped trashing publicly supported mass transit and, rather, 
praised it for what it truly is: one of the region's founding components. 
Privately owned, it must be remembered, the Big Red Cars were publicly 
subsidized with easements, rights of way, tax incentives and a cooperative city 
that cleared the way for its downtown terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 In transit terms, let us recover our history. Let us affirm a mix of mass 
transit, publicly owned and privately subcontracted; para-transit, privately 
owned and publicly regulated, to include expanded shuttle routes, jitney 
service and the encouragement of Los Angeles' surprisingly first-rate taxicab 
system. And, of course, the automobile -- still the region's continuing 
obsession and icon, with all its gifts of privacy and choice, despite the fact 
that it can never fully serve the population's transit needs.*

MASS TRANSIT / IN THE CITY OF CARS; BUT IS IT A MATTER OF RICH (RAIL) VS. POOR 
(BUS)? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Fulton, William Fulton is editor and publisher of California 
Planning & Development Report. His book about the politics of urban planning in 
Los Angeles will be published by Solano Press Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, it has come down to this: Should we subsidize the poor who cannot 
afford to drive, or the rich who drive too much? 
</P>
<P>
 The recent ruckus over the Metropolitan Transportation Au thority's budget, 
and, indirectly, the mechanics' strike revolve around this question of rich 
(rail) vs. poor (bus). Indeed, this is often the issue in transportation. But 
it's magnified by the politics of the MTA, which are structured to yield a 
petty debate about bus vs. rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the MTA budget to argue transportation policy is like trying to solve 
the health-care crisis by tinkering with Medicare: Making Medicare efficient 
won't contribute all that much toward fixing the whole system. The problem with 
the MTA is not so much that the transit system is too bloated. It is that the 
MTA isn't a useful forum for framing transportation policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Though huge, the MTA actually controls a fairly small portion of 
transportation spending in Los Angeles. The rest is controlled by regional 
agencies, in Sacramento, in Washington and, of course, in millions of private 
decisions by individuals who buy cars, ride public transit and decide when and 
where to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But the MTA is the most obvious pressure point. It's the agency that controls 
most of the transportation money generated through local tax revenue. The MTA 
also serves as a place where interest groups can hassle mayors, council members 
and county supervisors directly, because they serve on its board. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the poverty advocates and transit unions fight against rail 
construction is an odd sight. After all, you don't see unionized schoolteachers 
lobbying against the construction of new schools. But that's because the 
political decision-making process concerning schools, though troubled in other 
ways, distinguishes between money used for operations and money used for new 
construction. New schools are constructed with developer fees and state and 
local bond funds, both requiring voter approval. When a new school gets built, 
nobody claims that third-graders and teachers elsewhere will suffer as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the MTA operates in a way that creates the perception that bus 
riders and rail construction are in competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA is the product of a forced merger of two agencies: the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District, which ran the bus system and was building 
the Red Line subway, and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, 
which doled out transportation funds and was building the light-rail system 
called for in Proposition A. The two agencies never liked each other and, since 
their union, have been struggling to fit together harmoniously. The turf wars 
can be almost comical. Try listening to an RTD loyalist defend the 
billion-dollar-a-mile Red Line as a sound investment while ridiculing the much 
cheaper Blue Line as a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the marriage, the MTA carries out two basically conflicting 
tasks. First, it operates the largest bus system in the country, making the 
agency a big target for political attack by poverty advocates -- because most 
riders are poor or working-class -- and union activists. Second, it is in 
charge of constructing one of the largest public-works projects in the history 
of the country, which inevitably attracts big-dollar lobbyists seeking 
construction contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA's board actually doesn't have as much leeway in deciding how to spend 
money as the poverty advocates claim. There is some discretion in doling out 
Proposition A and C funds, but the drafters of the ballot measures, especially 
Proposition A, were primarily concerned with paying for construction of a 
light-rail system. Nonetheless, because all the money is in the same budget, 
Mayor Richard Riordan, county Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich and the other 
MTA board members get hammered from all sides by people wanting to spend the 
money a certain way. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, this structure encourages political activists to fire away at the 
MTA without needing to pay attention to the overall transportation planning and 
funding process. 
</P>
<P>
 Billions of dollars of state and federal transportation funds flow into Los 
Angeles every year, and it is spent according to priorities mostly determined 
by the Southern California Assn. of Governments and state and federal 
bureaucracies -- forums reporters don't usually cover and politicians usually 
ignore. These spending decisions reflect a bias toward rail -- and highway -- 
construction over bus-operating funds that has nothing to do with the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Other decisions that drive public policy on transportation in Los Angeles are 
not even made by transportation agencies. Tighter tailpipe-smog regulations, 
which arguably hit the poor hardest because they increase the cost of old 
clunkers, are imposed by the California Air Resources Board. The regional 
car-pooling requirement, an expensive attempt to get the middle class out of 
their cars, is controlled by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 All these agencies, however, are not as politically appetizing as a 
high-profile transit authority controlled by the mayor and county supervisors. 
So poverty and labor activists slam the Pasadena light-rail line, arguing the 
MTA should instead spend its money on better bus service and better driver 
salaries. But you don't hear them criticizing the proposed extension of the 710 
Freeway through South Pasadena -- even though that project is of dubious social 
value and is similar in cost and path to the Pasadena line. That's because 
there's no political advantage to it. The MTA doesn't decide whether money is 
allocated to the 710 -- or any other state highway. Those decisions are made by 
the California Transportation Commission in Sacramento, 400 miles from Los 
Angeles TV cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials are right when they make the seemingly Pollyanna-ish 
assertion that transportation should not be a choice between bus and rail. Vast 
resources are devoted to transportation -- tax monies from local, state and 
federal sources; private business funds required to comply with air-quality 
regulations; and billions in household budgets, mostly to buy and maintain 
cars. Transportation priorities should be made in a political forum that 
recognizes and can accommodate all these resources, not just a few. 
</P>
<P>
 We will always have to subsidize rich and poor, because an effective 
transportation system will always have such broad and often conflicting goals 
as clean air, a manageable traffic flow and socioeconomic equity. But now there 
is no place in Los Angeles where our politicians can hash all these issues out 
in a broad context. Short of that, the MTA budget will remain a political hot 
button, and transportation politics in Los Angeles will remain the politics of 
rich vs. poor.*

TRYING A CASE IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When O.J. Simpson's scientific experts decided not to participate in the 
prosecution's DNA testing, they held a press conference to announce this. When 
they nonetheless showed up at the laboratory the next day to observe the 
division of the blood samples, they explained that to the press, too. Such 
behavior is what we have come to expect from the publicity-minded Simpson 
defense team. But when the prosecution or defense creates this kind of hoopla 
outside a criminal-case courtroom, does it really affect the verdict? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's put it this way: It's like the Jewish joke about the man who's on his 
death bed when his mother comes to visit and says, "What you need is a bowl of 
chicken soup." So the man croaks to her, "Chicken soup? How could that possibly 
help?" "Well," she says, a little miffed, "it couldn't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 In any single case, no one really knows whether outside publicity will sway 
the population and the jury. But Simpson's is a capital case. The stakes are as 
high as they can be. The defendant has enough money so he can spend in 
proportion to the size of the danger. And in his situation there's a chance the 
publicity will do him some good. 
</P>
<P>
 The noise surrounding this trial is hardly unprecedented in our criminal 
history. For example, it by no means exceeds the public excitement that 
attended the 1859 murder trial of Rep. Dan Sickles, who emerged from his 
Washington townhouse one afternoon and shot his wife's lover dead. The 
newspapers were beside themselves with anticipation. They spread rumors that 
his wife was pregnant with her lover's baby and that this was the reason for 
the murder. They speculated, alternatively, that Sickles had decided to act 
because he was about to be humiliated by public revelation of the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 So these things are perennial. But there is no field of endeavor that does not 
offer room for improvement. Human beings have congregated in the marketplace 
since time immemorial, but only 20th-Century America gave birth to the shopping 
mall. Eye-popping criminal cases have always produced lurid public curiosity 
and attempts to manipulate it, but not until the O.J. Simpson trial did defense 
attorneys offer the world an 800 number to phone in support for the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been advances on the prosecution side as well. For instance, 
beginning in the 1960s, adventurous prosecutors began trying to focus public 
attention on criminal cases that did not feature violence or organized crime. 
Instead, these cases involved what had once seemed like relatively arcane 
white-collar crimes, in fields such as tax law. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend greatly accelerated in the 1980s, when Manhattan's U.S. attorney -- 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, now mayor of New York -- set the style. In sight of 
invited TV cameras, he had an alleged Wall Street inside trader arrested and 
taken away in handcuffs. The Giuliani office worked with the press, giving 
journalists a close look at the inner workings of big cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the effect of the increased publicity on particular cases was not clear. 
The prosecution had a large advantage, since people are far readier to envision 
a guilty businessman than an innocent one. The publicity certainly added to the 
pressure on defendants to plead guilty. But in the courtroom, there were big 
losses as well as big wins. 
</P>
<P>
 In criminal cases where one side does not have such a huge edge over the 
other, it is even harder to predict if a publicity campaign will affect the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief reason for uncertainty is that once a criminal trial has begun, it 
takes on a life of its own. Evidence can look very different in a courtroom 
from the way it appears on the nightly news, as the first Rodney G. King trial 
showed. Many of a trial's crucial decisions are in the hands of a judge, who 
will apply specialized standards in making them. This judge, when he or she 
sees lawyers trying to generate publicity to sway the case, is more likely to 
be annoyed than impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial has its own pace: Facts that at first seem explosive can lose much of 
their power after they have been mauled by challenges and contradictory 
accounts. Jurors also develop strong opinions about particular defendants, law 
enforcement officials and other witnesses on the basis of qualities not 
apparent on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, because the relationship between the publicity and the verdict is so 
tenuous, it is tempting to conclude in these media-logged cases that 
prosecution and defense are generating press attention to advertise themselves 
rather than out of any rational eye to what effect they are having on the 
bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there are some cases where outside factors have a huge potential to affect 
the outcome. These factors can not be manufactured by an enterprising attorney; 
they have to pre-exist in the population from which a jury will be drawn. Race, 
gender, attitudes toward particular sorts of crimes -- these are the types of 
sentiment that can overwhelm legal argument. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case has idiosyncratic features that could serve this purpose. He 
is a sports hero. He has given pleasure to millions. He has been a man with 
whom people want to identify and therefore a man they want to think they know. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a few potential jurors who judge themselves open and fair-minded 
probably share the unacknowledged feeling that Simpson's life record should be 
taken into account. Some doubtless have the sense that because of this record, 
Simpson somehow deserves an acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 These are, of course, not attitudes that can be revealed outright. Those who 
hold them may not acknowledge it even to themselves. But a juror who harbors 
such feelings will be looking, in the courtroom, for events and facts that he 
or she can point to as a source of reasonable doubt about a defendant's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simpson's case we can already see from the publicity what lifelines his 
lawyers may try to throw to these would-be doubters: The DNA tests were 
performed improperly. The bloody glove was planted evidence. The policeman was 
a racist and a liar. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the predispositions in Simpson's favor that already exist, the 
publicity generated by his lawyers might conceivably reinforce it, and make 
jurors more receptive to the doubts that the defense team will sow in court. 
Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a fairly thin chain on which to hang the large amount of effort that 
the defense is putting into its activity outside the courtroom. But it has been 
said that the verdict in any murder trial ultimately comes down to whether the 
jury thinks the victim deserved to die. It might also be said that this verdict 
will depend on whether the jurors think the accused deserves to live. If many 
potential jurors already think the answer to this latter question is "yes," the 
defense is right to try to give them arguments to support their emotions.*

THE NATION; WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HEARINGS? NOTHING! -- JUST ASK THE DEMOCRATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nothing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the Clinton Administration's line in last week's Whitewater hearings. 
And for once, the Democrats had their act together. They communicated the party 
line forcefully, effectively and, Lord knows, repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing happened as a result of these contacts" between the White House and 
the Treasury Department, White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler assured the House 
Banking Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Stephen L. Neal (D-N.C.) made the same point when he asked a panel of 10 
-- count 'em, 10 -- top White House aides, "Did anyone attempt to influence any 
criminal investigations by the RTC (Resolution Trust Corporation)?" 
</P>
<P>
 Chorus of 10: "No." 
</P>
<P>
 Get it? Nothing happened. Rep. Jim Bacchus (D-Fla.) summed it up this way: "No 
crime, no cover up, no news."  
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats' strategy was simple: Emphasize people's behavior, not their 
situation. The fact is, many Administration officials were in compromised 
situations. The 20-or-so meetings between White House and Treasury Department 
officials between September, 1993, and February, 1994, created enormous 
conflicts of interest. The RTC, an arm of the Treasury Department, had 
initiated criminal "referrals." (Whitewater Glossary: a referral is a request 
for a criminal investigation.) In those referrals, President Bill Clinton and 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were named as possible beneficiaries of 
criminal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 So Clinton appointees were caught in a conflict of interests. They had to 
serve the interests of the President. And they had to serve the interests of 
justice in a possible criminal investigation. Look at Roger C. Altman, the 
beleaguered deputy Treasury secretary and longtime Clinton friend. He was the 
acting head of the RTC, which is supposed to operate without political 
interference. In his diary, however, he described White House discussions about 
resolving the Whitewater issue as "lancing the boil." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Altman decided he had to "recuse" himself. (Whitewater Glossary: 
to recuse means to withdraw because of a conflict of interest.) Bernard W. 
Nussbaum, Cutler's predecessor as White House counsel, had to resign because 
he, too, faced a conflict of interest. Other White House and Treasury officials 
-- possibly including the President and First Lady -- were caught in the same 
conflict.  
</P>
<P>
 But we knew about all that before the hearings. The Republicans couldn't prove 
these conflicts of interest resulted in any illegal or unethical behavior. 
Could they prove anyone obstructed justice? No. Could they prove anyone 
interfered with any investigations? No. So there you are: Nothing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans tried. They made an issue of the "heads up" passed on from 
Treasury officials to White House aides to Clinton. (Whitewater Glossary: a 
heads up is a warning to watch out.) According to the ranking minority member 
of the Banking Committee, Rep. James A. Leach (R-Iowa), "for the President or 
the White House to be informed of confidential criminal actions, especially if 
they touch the White House," means the President put himself above the law.  
</P>
<P>
 Leach called it "insider notification." Rep. Michael R. Huffington (R-Calif.) 
called it "the Washington equivalent of insider trading." Rep. Bill McCollum 
(R-Fla.) called it "insider information." Get it?  
</P>
<P>
 No, no, no, the Democrats said. They were simply putting the President in a 
position to respond truthfully, accurately and promptly to press inquiries. 
That's an official and legitimate function of the White House staff.  
</P>
<P>
 OK, so maybe some White House aides were a bit overzealous. Cutler thought so. 
"I found there were too many people having too many discussions about too many 
sensitive matters," he said. They behaved as if they were hiding something 
about Whitewater. But what? That's the point: In all likelihood, they didn't 
know. After all, it happened a long time ago, in Arkansas, long before they 
signed up with Clinton. Not knowing what was there made them all the more 
frantic. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, the President was saved for the same reason his aides 
were saved: Nothing happened. The Republicans couldn't demonstrate that the 
President interfered with the Whitewater investigation. Well, actually, one 
aide wrote in his diary that he was told the President became "furious" when he 
heard that Altman had recused himself. No, no, no, other aides said. The 
President was not furious because his friend was no longer in a position to 
protect him. He was furious because Altman told the New York Times before he 
told the President. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats got through last week by exercising the first principle of 
damage control: Let the worst information out first. Before the hearings began, 
they leaked all the bad news. Most of it was about Altman. It was reported that 
Altman was told about the criminal investigations long before he said he was. 
It was reported that Altman instructed a Treasury official to brief the White 
House -- though he claimed to know nothing about the briefings. Last week, 
Clinton issued a statement saying Altman still had his complete confidence. 
That means Altman's on his way out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats had to make sure the hearings were an anti-climax. People could 
learn nothing worse at the hearings than what they already knew. The Democrats 
on the committee kept reminding people of how little they were learning. "I 
find this hearing to be boring, uninteresting and uninformative," Rep. Maxine 
Waters (D-Calif.) declared. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) labeled it 
"Waste-water." Bacchus put it best: "No news." Exactly the way the Democrats 
wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans are infuriated. They claim the reason they can't prove anything 
happened is that the Democratic majority exercised tyrannical control of the 
process. They severely limited the subject matter the committee could ask 
about.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats set the ground rules to prevent us from asking the big 
questions," Rep. Toby Roth (R-Wis.) complained. "If these ground rules applied 
to O.J. Simpson's trial, you couldn't ask him about the knife, you couldn't ask 
him about the glove, you couldn't ask him about the blood. All you could ask 
is, 'So, O.J., how was your flight to Chicago?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats have an answer to these complaints: "Tough noogies. Those are 
the rules." The deal was that the Democrats agreed to hold hearings, but only 
on topics Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. had finished investigating. 
So far, this is the death of White House aide Vincent W. Foster Jr. and the 
unauthorized contacts between the White House and the Treasury Department. 
Nothing that happened in Arkansas. Nothing about the Whitewater Development 
Corp.  
</P>
<P>
 Why did Congress make that deal? Iran-Contra. Congressional committees 
investigating Iran-Contra gave witnesses like Oliver L. North immunity from 
prosecution based on their testimony. As a result, North's conviction on 
perjury charges was set aside by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans were the first ones to call for the appointment of an independent 
counsel to probe Whitewater. Fiske is a Republican. But that doesn't stop the 
Republicans from complaining. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of 
Kansas called Fiske "a congressional traffic cop -- he has commanded Congress 
when to go and when to stop."  
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater hearings, Dole said, are "like going to a movie theater, paying 
$6 a ticket and getting to see only one 60-second preview." Sooner or later, 
Fiske will complete his investigation of what happened in Arkansas. Then, the 
audience will get to see the main feature. 
</P>
<P>
 What will the Democrats do then? They'll argue that, if something happened in 
Arkansas long before Clinton became President, it doesn't make any difference. 
It's irrelevant. Nothing happened.*

THE WORLD; COLD WAR REDUX: U.S. TRAVEL BAN AGAINST CUBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Wayne S. Smith, Wayne S. Smith is a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins 
University and a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy. He was 
chief of the U.S. interests section in Havana from 1979 to 1982. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is there about Cuba that evokes such contradictory and often bizarre 
behavior from U.S. Administrations? Whatever it is, the Clin ton Administration 
has warded off its spell no better than its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration says, for example, that it wishes to reach out to the Cuban 
people, wishes to open the door to more contact with them. Yet, it continues to 
refuse to allow U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba to do just that, and it bases 
that refusal on a ridiculously obsolete statute: the Trading With the Enemy Act 
of 1917, a provision that can only be invoked in time of war or national 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 We aren't at war, so where's the national emergency? Well, believe it or not, 
it's the emergency declared at the time of the Korean War, back in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Reagan Administration imposed currency controls in 1982 -- controls 
that effectively prevented the travel of most Americans to Cuba -- it argued 
that the Cold War was a continuing emergency, of which the Korean War had been 
but the opening gun. Thus, under a grandfather clause, it insisted the controls 
were legal. The Supreme Court acquiesced to that argument in 1984, ruling by a 
narrow margin that because of the continuing struggle with the Soviet Union, 
national security needs had to override the rights of citizens to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a strained argument even in 1984. But this is 1994. The Soviet Union 
has disintegrated. The Cold War is over. The national-security justification 
for travel controls has evaporated. Yet, the Clinton Administration has kept 
them on the books. The rights of U.S. citizens continue to be infringed and 
contacts with the Cuban people severely circumscribed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration maintains that controls are needed because the Cuban 
government isn't democratic and violates human rights. Yes, but that doesn't 
override the right of U.S. citizens to travel.  
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court didn't uphold the controls in 1984 on any such grounds. 
Further, wouldn't the assertions made of Cuba also be true of China, Saudi 
Arabia, Kuwait and a whole series of countries that we have friendly relations 
with? They aren't democratic either, yet Americans travel freely there. Why not 
Cuba? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most compelling argument is that those in the front line of the 
struggle for a more open system and greater respect for human rights in Cuba, 
its religious leaders and its most prominent human-rights activists, oppose the 
controls. The Cuban Council of Catholic Bishops, the Ecumenical Council and 
activists such as Elizardo Sanchez, Francisco Chaviano, Yndamiro Restano and 
Osvaldo Paya, all call for open travel to Cuba. As they put it, the more U.S. 
citizens in the streets of Cuban cities, the better for the cause of a more 
open society. The Administration should listen. They are, after all, our 
natural allies. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the kinds of controls one expects of authoritarian governments but 
that ought to have no place in the U.S. system -- certainly not today. More and 
more citizens will challenge them. The Administration can count on it. 
</P>
<P>
 One such group, led by the Freedom to Travel Campaign, has done just that. The 
Administration tried to avoid the issue and prevent them from traveling to Cuba 
by freezing their bank account. Supporters chipped in funds so that they could 
go anyway. Now the group is back and the Administration is in quandary as to 
how to handle them. It has three options:  
</P>
<P>
 First, it can play the heavy, press charges and take them to court. Except the 
Administration knows it would lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, it can pretend the visits never took place and take no action -- thus 
evading the issue, but in the process making itself look foolish and virtually 
acknowledging that the controls have no validity. And no teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, third, it can behave as a democratic government should, acknowledge that 
there is no longer any need for such measures and remove them. It can show 
vision and lead, or it can be forced ignominiously to discard something it 
shouldn't have embraced in the first place. Which is it to be?*

THE NATION; CLINTON'S SEARCH FOR A FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James A. Baker III, James A. Baker III was the 61st secretary of state and 
also served as Treasury secretary. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighteen months and two G-7 Summits into his Administration, President Bill 
Clinton has yet to implement a strategy of trade, investment and exchange-rate 
policies that ef fectively promote U.S. interests in the international economic 
arena. Instead, the Administration's international economic policies seem 
confused, even schizophrenic. Its uncertain signals seem to reflect a mixed 
mind about the value of free trade and investment. 
</P>
<P>
 True, two of the Administration's most noteworthy successes -- passing the 
North American Free Trade Agreement and concluding the Uruguay Round of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- reflect firm free trade principles. 
Both initiatives, however, were begun and brought to near-fruition by 
Republican Administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Administration's own policies -- especially those leading to 
near-crises with Japan on trade and China over most-favored-nation status -- 
suggest a less-than-steadfast belief in economic liberalism and a dangerous 
tendency to look at everything through the prism of domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the Administration's first major free-trade initiative of its own 
devising -- the "Open Markets 2000" proposal offered at the recent Naples 
Summit -- has not enhanced its credibility. The initiative would have committed 
G-7 leaders to build on the achievements of the Uruguay Round by further 
expanding trade and investment. But the manner in which the Administration put 
forward the initiative -- at the last minute and with poor coordination -- 
undermined its seriousness and ensured its rejection by the other G-7 
governments.  
</P>
<P>
 International financial markets also have trouble taking the Administration's 
rhetoric seriously. The current dollar crisis, for example, was triggered, at 
least in part, by Administration signals that it was prepared to drive down the 
dollar to "punish" Tokyo for its recalcitrance in trade talks. Attempting 
damage control, Clinton declared in Naples, "No one has tried to talk down the 
market." The markets, unfortunately, knew better. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take more than mere declarations to restore the Administration's 
international economic credibility. Rather, it will require a practical, 
multipart strategy aimed at reasserting international economic leadership: 
</P>
<P>
 Pass GATT. The Administration cannot blithely assume congressional passage of 
the GATT agreement by the Jan. 1, 1995 deadline set in Naples. Powerful 
environmental and labor lobbies oppose it. Identifying budget cuts to offset 
the estimated $12-billion loss in tariff revenues over the next five years 
makes GATT ratification a potentially contentious legislative issue. Senate 
Finance Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) has publicly chided the 
Administration for dragging its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the Administration's ambitious legislative agenda, including health-care 
and welfare reform, it will require discipline -- not this Administration's 
forte -- to ensure passage on time. Once GATT passes, however, the 
Administration can and should reintroduce its Open Markets 2000 proposal, 
perhaps at this fall's Washington meeting of G-7 ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stop publicly bashing Japan. The Administration's hard-line stance toward 
trade with Japan did much to cause the current collapse of the dollar. 
Dismissing the crisis as a "problem with the yen," as some in the 
Administration have, will do little to ease it. Given the magnitude of the 
U.S.-Japanese economic relationship, there is no such thing as a "dollar 
problem" -- or a "yen problem." But there is a "dollar and yen" problem that 
can only be resolved by negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressuring Japan to open its markets and stimulate consumption must remain top 
U.S. goals. Our negotiating positions must be tough -- but are only effective 
if pushed privately. Instead of grabbing headlines by publicly pillorying 
Japan, the Administration should pursue a longer-term strategy of negotiation 
and sustained support for powerful reform forces within Japan itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Expand trade and investment regionally. The Administration should build on 
NAFTA and the Bush Administration's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative to 
move toward a truly hemispheric free-trade zone. Argentina and Chile are both 
suitable candidates for free-trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. regional trade initiatives should not be limited to our own 
hemisphere. Free-trade agreements with Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic 
would not only bolster the cause of reform in three of the former Soviet bloc's 
"success stories" but open up a growing market of 60-million consumers to U.S. 
goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the President should also use the forum for Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation, a Bush initiative, to intensify our relationship with dynamic 
Pacific Rim countries. The development of an investment code for APEC members 
should be a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep an eye on the European Union. European economic union, despite 
dislocations caused by German reunification, is by no means dead. Some form of 
monetary union containing, at a minimum, Germany and several other EU members 
is likely to emerge in the next few years. It is important for the United 
States to begin talks aimed at ensuring that monetary union enhances rather 
than erodes the potential for U.S.-European economic coordination. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the mid-1980s, when I was Treasury secretary, the European system of 
closely aligned exchange rates complicated policy coordination between the 
United States and major European economies, especially Germany. Full monetary 
union, particularly one requiring unanimity among member governments for 
exchange or interest rate adjustments, could make coordination more 
problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 Focus less on the dollar, more on fundamentals. Intervention by central banks 
in currency markets can be useful in promoting exchange rate stability -- but 
only in conjunction with closer coordination of economic fundamentals, such as 
fiscal and monetary policy, by the major economies. This was the lesson of 
1985-88, when the G-7 achieved levels of cooperation not attained before or 
since. But macroeconomic coordination does not just happen -- it requires firm 
and patient U.S. leadership to achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the centerpiece of Clinton's international economic policy is NAFTA. 
Ironically, the President carried the day because of the support of 132 House 
Republicans. Only 102 of 278 Democrats backed him in the cause of 
liberalization. Like the Administration itself, the Democratic Party seems to 
be of two minds when it comes to free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The President may have to turn to Republicans again if he is to pursue an 
ambitious but achievable international economic agenda. This will require him 
to come down firmly, one way or the other, on free trade and open investment. 
But coming down firmly is not something that comes easily to the Clinton 
Administration. Like its policies on Haiti or Bosnia, the Administration's 
approach to international economics has too often been a public-relations 
exercise in trying to have it both ways.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; HUGH HEFNER; IN THE SHADOW OF AIDS, EXAMINING 
WHAT'S LEFT OF THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt is a producer for Fox News and a contributor 
to National Public Radio's All Things Considered and Morning Edition. He 
interviewed Hugh Hefner at the Playboy mansion, in the Holmby Hills 
neighborhood of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The yellow warning sign on the drive reads, "CHILDREN AT PLAY." The sauna -- 
once a site for strictly adult games -- is now used to store toys. The only 
bunnies in evidence at the Playboy mansion are the furry four-legged kind, part 
of Hugh Hefner's personal zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 At 68, Hugh Marston Hefner is five years into his marriage to former Playmate 
Kimberly Conrad. He has two children with her, and has turned the day-to-day 
operations of Playboy Enterprises over to Christie Hefner, his daughter from 
his first marriage. These days he's writing his autobiography, looking back at 
a life that, by any measure, has been quite an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner was 27 when he published the first issue of Playboy, in 1953. It was an 
instant hit. Hefner's genius was in removing the furtive, plain-brown-wrapper 
feel of the pin-up publications of the day. He designed his magazine to be kept 
on the coffee table, not hidden under the bed. In the pages of Playboy, he 
associated sex with money, sophistication and style. And Hefner made himself 
into the embodiment of that Playboy ideal -- a regular guy who digs cool jazz, 
has a really neat bachelor pad and lots of sex with lots of gorgeous women. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1960s and '70s, his magazine spawned an empire -- a broad-based 
merchandising operation, Playboy clubs and casinos and the Playboy cable TV 
channel. Hefner was at the helm, often with the help of Dexedrine, and always 
with a Pepsi. He took the company public and then moved from Chicago to Los 
Angeles in 1975, purchasing an estate built in the 1920s by Arthur Letts Jr., 
whose father founded the Broadway department stores. Hefner transformed the 
Letts home into his Playboy Mansion -- complete with redwood forest, aviary, 
hot-tub grotto and game house. Parties were frequent and wild. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the dawn of the 1980s, the foundations of the Playboy empire were 
shaken. To many young people the magazine was either offensive or a curious 
anachronism. Circulation plummeted and, in short order, the company lost 
gambling licenses in London and Atlantic City. AIDS put the brakes on the 
sexual revolution. Dorothy Stratten, 1980 Playmate of the Year was murdered by 
her husband amid allegations that Hefner was somehow linked to the tragedy. 
Then in 1985, Hefner had a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 He made a quick and seemingly full recovery. But Hefner says he was forever 
changed by the experience. The announcement of his marriage made front-page 
news in 1989, and the once highly visible Hefner now jealously guards his new 
family's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner wore his trademark silk pajamas for this interview. His Pepsi is now 
diet -- and caffeine-free. Across an oversized backgammon table he talked of 
sex, gender and repression. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You've always been right in the middle of the battle of the sexes. 
How would you characterize the relationship of men and women right now?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think it's a very mixed message today. I think our society is 
fragmented. Messages regarding human sexuality have always been mixed in 
America. We are a schizophrenic nation. We were founded initially by Puritans, 
who escaped repression only to establish their own. Then the founding fathers 
gave us the Constitution to separate church and state. But the one thing that 
got left out of all those laws was human sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between the sexes is in many ways suffering from even more 
confused messages than ever before. You have the religious right and some 
left-wing feminists both taking very conservative postures on sexuality and the 
images of sex. There is within the women's movement an antagonism towards 
sexuality and towards the opposite sex that obviously makes no sense and 
certainly wasn't what (Betty) Friedan had in mind when she wrote "The Feminine 
Mystique" and started it all in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 We're fascinated by our sexuality and frightened by it. And during the Reagan 
and Bush era you got an entire decade of anti-sex government. Sex is not the 
enemy. It is the beginning of civilization, family and tribe. Sex can be 
twisted and exploited, but in its most essential form, it's the best part of 
who we are. And it frightens us. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did your efforts to open up the dialogue about sex, gender and 
sexuality either add to the confusion or provide some clarity?  
</P>
<P>
 A: This may be self-serving, but I sometimes feel that Playboy is one of the 
very few moral compasses when it comes to sex in America. Very early on, 
Playboy was saying the McMartin (child molestation) case was just another Salem 
witch hunt. We got sexual hysteria in many forms in the 1980s. It included a 
wave of McMartin-style allegations that had nothing to do with any real child 
abuse, and it was fed by AIDS. I said early on that if AIDS did not exist there 
is a portion of this country that would have had to invent it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How has the reality of AIDS transformed the philosophy behind Playboy?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think there was a window of opportunity that lasted for two decades -- 
from the invention of the pill in the early 1960s until the arrival of AIDS at 
the start of the 1980s. It was almost like the Garden of Eden. It was 
guilt-free sex with relatively few negative possibilities. Now the game has 
changed. But remember, disease has always been a consideration, and informed 
sexuality is always what Playboy has been about. 
</P>
<P>
 Playboy began editorializing about AIDS before any other national magazine, 
and brought some rational thought to the subject when the (television) networks 
and the rest of the mass media were really involved in a form of hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a cover story in Life magazine in early 1985 -- the shock headline 
was, "AIDS -- Now We Are All At Risk." Well that's a lie. We are not all at 
risk. The risks are very clearly defined and related to specific behavior. 
There were people who said, "When you have sex with somebody, you have sex with 
anyone they ever had sex with." Again, simply not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you always been somewhat preoccupied with matters of sex?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I can remember in my adolescence feeling that many of the things that were 
hurtful and hypocritical in society were things related to sex. They included 
the kind of censorship laws that existed in the movies and books when I was 
young. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember reading a story in Life magazine in 1939. I was an eighth-grader, 
13 years old. It was a story of a young couple, in their teens. She had become 
pregnant. That just wasn't supposed to happen to nice, middle-class kids. They 
didn't know what to do, and she suggested they kill themselves. He killed her, 
but then couldn't bring himself to commit suicide, and was on trial. Both 
families blamed themselves for the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 That story, even though I was a kid, had a tremendous impact on me, and I 
obviously read into it something about my inability to communicate with my own 
parents about those kinds of things. So I had a concern about repressed 
sexuality long before I came up with something called Playboy. I realized early 
on that, in a free society, if you are not free in your own bedroom, then you 
are not free at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You supported Bill Clinton during the presidential race. How's he doing?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Mixed. The good news is that he's coming from the right place. We had a 
federal government that was in favor of censorship, wanted to make abortions 
illegal, and was against sex education and birth control -- both in the United 
States and abroad. We had an attorney general, Edwin Meese, who had no concept 
of law or the Bill of Rights. Clearly in these areas, Clinton represents a 
great improvement. And he's really trying to do something about the deficit, 
and reforming welfare, about health reform. It's just his execution that seems 
to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've made the comment that there are countries all over the globe where 
the situation in terms of sexuality and gender is much like it was here in the 
U.S. during the 1950s. Is Playboy's growth going to come from the global 
market?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, because with the end of communism and the opening of Third World 
markets, the potential for Playboy is huge. It has been said that the two most 
famous trademarks in the world are Coca-Cola and the Playboy bunny rabbit. 
There is certainly no one else in our area that represents the American dream 
in this particular kind of way. That rabbit means economic freedom, personal 
freedom and political freedom. That potential is unlimited. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your stroke in 1985 -- what is it like to realize that you are no longer 
working like you used to?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It was pretty dramatic. It happened about two in the morning. I was reading 
from a newspaper to a girlfriend and, all of a sudden, I couldn't read the 
headline. I lost the ability to find the words for simple objects. The doctors 
showed me a tie, a belt -- I knew what they were but I couldn't find their 
names. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was lucky. I had a good doctor, and the recovery was quite rapid. My 
feeling at the time was that I had just been missed by a train or a bus. I'd 
been knocked off the road, but I was going to recover. And so it generated a 
tremendous feeling of optimism, and a sense of relief. I was born again -- in 
the best sense of the word. 
</P>
<P>
 After my stroke I put down much of the luggage of my life. I didn't have to 
prove anything anymore -- in business, in my personal life or whatever. And 
now, as I work on my autobiography, I enjoy looking back, seeing the 
connections, the causes and effects of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Plenty of people have predicted your demise -- both personally and that of 
the magazine. And yet you've survived. How did you do it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I've always had a tremendously optimistic attitude about life, and the 
setbacks are never really setbacks for me, because I see it as a part of the 
adventure. And if you don't hold onto your dreams, you're a very foolish 
fellow, because dreams are what life is about. 
</P>
<P>
 But from the beginning there was a need for some in this society to believe 
that Playboy and the things I stood for were fundamentally flawed, and that I 
would somehow have to pay for my sins. But I understand that -- it comes from 
the Puritan part of who we are. I, myself, am a direct, 11th-generation 
descendant of William Bradford, one of the first, staunchest Puritans who came 
over on the Mayflower. I understand that. My life has been devoted to trying to 
bring a little more understanding to human sexuality -- not just in society, 
but also inside myself. The struggle has been internal as well as external. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons that I have such tremendous satisfaction at this point in 
my life is because I know I've made a difference. I've made a difference in a 
way that really matters to me. I see a lot of terrible things going on in the 
world, but there are some good things going on too, and I feel I've been a part 
of that. I really do feel I have been on the side of the angels.*

OLVERA STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am writing in response to a column by George Ramos, "Reclaiming the Simple 
Delights of Olvera Street" (July 18). It is truly a shame that as much as Ramos 
comes and speaks with many of the merchants, including myself, he has failed to 
write about what is really happening here.Yes, there are two associations, but 
to read any of Ramos' articles, one gets the impression that there is only one 
group representing the merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 One desire all the merchants have is to have a better Olvera Street. Ramos is 
definitely out of touch with the real issues that pertain to Olvera Street. The 
merchants are working with city government to improve Olvera Street and the 
surrounding area. The merchants are not squabbling with each other; why did 
Ramos bring out events that happened years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos chooses to print and create the negative and never the positive, but I 
guess that is the result when one mixes taquitos and aspirin.

WHY LOS ANGELES MISSES THE CHRISTOPHER COMMISSION; THE PUBLIC NEEDS A PERIODIC, 
OUTSIDE AUDIT OF THE LAPD REFORM EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not for the first time, the City Council has moved to accept yet another 
valuable reform recommendation of the Christopher Commission. The council voted 
to place civilians on police disciplinary boards. Just a few years ago, such an 
innovation would not even have been formally proposed at the council, much less 
approved. The Los Angeles Police Department then was, in effect, a closed 
society -- an institution responsible to virtually no one, with a peculiar 
system that insulated the police chief in a way that only underscored the lack 
of accountability to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 But what would have been an unbelievable change just a few years ago last week 
passed through the portals of city government if not as routine business, then 
as something a bit less daunting than a wholesale rewrite of the Declaration of 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, credit for that goes, first of all, to the legacy of the Christopher 
Commission, whose chairman, Warren Christopher, is now of course serving the 
nation as secretary of state. But, with the commission no longer in existence, 
the torch has been passed to others. And what is notable is the intensity of 
feeling that the light of the Christopher reform movement must not be 
extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly that is the feeling of Willie Williams, the former Philadelphia 
police chief who was brought in to run the department and carry forth the 
reforms. Certainly that's the spirit of key City Council members, such as 
Marvin Braude; and of the public-spirited members of the city's Police 
Commission, the titular overlord of the LAPD, and indeed of the dedicated 
career officers in the department who see many of the Christopher 
recommendations as reforms that they themselves had long thought desirable. And 
certainly the commitment to reform remains with the (relatively) new mayor, 
Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all the conviction, and indeed for all the initial accomplishment, 
there remains reason for concern. Too many measures have been stalled, whether 
for reasons of lack of money or will, or surfeit of human inertia and 
entrenched bureaucratic opposition. This is to be expected, of course: The 
internal reform of a complex and vitally important public institution like the 
LAPD is not easy and indeed should not be easy. The changes can directly affect 
public safety; not everything about the department, to say the least, needs to 
be reformed. The good must be preserved while the bad is pushed out. 
</P>
<P>
 People of good will differ as to what still needs to be done. But no one 
quarrels with the proposition that a great deal is left to do. The problem is 
in determining what exactly remains on the agenda. The LAPD makes its report 
and says it has done X, Y and Z; the Police Commission makes its determination, 
the City Council's Public Safety Committee makes its report. Each of these 
efforts is helpful, but none is definitive. And all of them, taken, together, 
are confusing. Each player in the process has its own particular perspective. 
The public really doesn't know what to think, or where it stands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christopher Commission, while it was in existence as the disinterested 
panel above the fray, was able to issue authoritative judgments with which few 
people could quarrel. Indeed, six months after its initial report in July, 
1991, it issued an invaluable interim report. But that was the commission's 
last official act; after that, it simply went away. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time for it to come back. Los Angeles needs a reconstituted Christopher 
Commission -- not the full 10-member panel, of course, but some representative 
subgroup consisting of those members who are still able to serve. Los Angeles 
needs that reconstituted panel in order to provide the city with a continuing 
monitor of the LAPD reform effort. It needs to provide what the Kolts 
Commission provided for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department -- a 
mechanism of biannual reports to the public on how reform is proceeding. This 
has been most valuable and has contributed to the sense that sheriff's reforms 
are further along than the LAPD's. 
</P>
<P>
 We need the Christopher Commission again. A small group of its original board 
ought to reconstitute itself. A thorough and impartial audit of the reform 
movement -- what has been done, and what more needs to be done -- should be its 
first order of business. Then, every six months, it should report to Los 
Angeles on the progress of the monumentally important reforms it recommended. 
That will be an invaluable public service.

THE PRESIDENT AND THE 'RELIGIOUS RIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The standings of presidents in the polls cannot be thought reliably to make or 
break their political futures. Still, there was plenty of room for concern at 
the White House and among Democrats in last week's Times' poll that found 
President Clinton's job-approval rating standing at an anemic 45%. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton seems to have thrived in the past on adversity, and it would be 
premature to draw too many conclusions beyond the immediate prognosis that his 
party will have its work cut out in this year's congressional elections. 
Nevertheless, the public seems unhappy with the leadership it is getting from 
Washington, and it finds a disturbing lack of direction in shoring up the 
nation's social fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether anybody other than Clinton could do a better job of filling that 
demanding role as President is a very open question. The Republicans, who stand 
to benefit from unhappiness with the President, have their own troubles with 
the religious right. But Christian conservatives have what others seem unable 
to supply at the moment, namely a clear and understandable agenda -- even if it 
is narrowly based and at times openly antagonistic. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger public is troubled and restive -- not agreeing with the religious 
right's agenda, of course, but at least concurring in one respect: There is a 
feeling that the "moral climate" needs bolstering. This is a sensitive time for 
this country, a time when those from any quarter with a strong point of view 
would appear to have an opening.

GREASING THE SKIDS FOR GATT; CONGRESS NEEDS TO TAKE FAST ACTION ON THE HUGE 
WORLD TRADE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been an exhausting seven years for the world's trade negotiators, but now 
they are very close to the grand prize: implementation a vast trade pact that 
would stimulate imports and exports all over the globe and lower prices to 
consumers by reducing national tariffs. What a deal, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, while it's a great deal, it's not a done deal. There is still 
some opposition in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Last April in Marrakesh, Morocco, the United States and more than 100 other 
nations signed a new version of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Now 
comes what should be the easier part: implementation by each signatory. In the 
United States that means congressional approval, and that approval does not 
appear to be a slam dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the Clinton Administration, supported by such GOP stalwarts as 
former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, is feverishly working on GATT 
legislation to present to Congress. The process involves developing a 
legislative package that implements the changes in American laws required to 
bring this country into compliance with the new world trade rules. Forging 
legislation palatable to most of Congress is important because under the 
fast-track GATT authority given the President, the House and Senate can vote 
only up or down on the legislation, not to amend it (i.e., nibble it to death). 
So this is the historic moment to get this deal done. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee -- the very 
same panels tackling the awesome task of health-care reform -- are plowing 
through White House proposals that will implement the 22,000-page trade pact. 
Under the new agreement, GATT would be replaced as the international body that 
enforces trade rules by a new Geneva-based operation, the World Trade 
Organization. The WTO would have greater authority than GATT. A key element of 
the new agreement for this country is a requirement to scale back tariffs on 
imports. That could result in an initial shortfall in U.S. revenues of about 
$12 billion in the first five years. The Administration is working on proposals 
to take the string out of that short-term decline, which will eventually be 
made up by a very welcome rise in U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, implementing GATT is complex. But one hopes that the debate will 
not prove as rancorous as that which preceded approval of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada -- or that the vote will prove as 
close. Some members want to wait, arguing that the legislation is so technical 
that it needs to be reviewed line by line. But behind that is the desire to 
unravel the deal completely. Congress should pass GATT legislation before the 
end of this session. It will be disgraceful if it doesn't.

SPOUSAL KILLINGS

 * Re Alan Dershowitz's column, "Wives Also Kill Husbands -- Quite Often," 
Commentary, July 21: 
</P>
<P>
 This is yet another blatant attempt to manipulate public opinion and reject 
the facts in the O.J. Simpson case. Dershowitz complains in his article that 
the government and the media have manipulated the figures to show that wives 
are the primary victims in spousal murders.Dershowitz then does some fancy 
manipulation of his own to support his conclusion. He neglects to take into 
account that many women who kill their husbands do so only after years of 
physical battering. 
</P>
<P>
 What does this article have to do with the facts of the O.J. Simpson case? 
Nicole Brown was not Simpson's wife. Indeed it was Nicole Simpson and her 
friend Ronald Goldman who were brutally murdered, not O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts will show if Simpson is innocent or guilty. Bring on the facts; 
let's go where the facts lead. An innocent person has nothing to hide.

 * I read with great interest the column by Dershowitz. Of course it would have 
been relevant if he had included in his statistics the percentage of women who 
kill their husbands in self-defense or after years of physical abuse, and the 
percentage of men who kill their wives for "like" reasons. This data could 
explain why some women get more lenient sentences, but, of course, it would not 
serve Dershowitz's media goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing I learned in college (in Boston) was that data can be easily 
manipulated. I see they're still teaching that.

SAVE OUR STATE INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Jonathan Freedman's Column Left, "Save Our State? It's More Like Spite Our 
State" (July 19), won't fool California voters. The question the Save Our State 
initiative poses is crystal-clear: Should illegal aliens receive the same 
package of taxpayer-funded government benefits as legal immigrants and U.S. 
citizens? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is no. We can no longer afford to offer free housing, cash, 
education, Medicaid (except emergency medical services) and scores of other 
programs to anyone who manages to cross our border illegally. And, contrary to 
Freedman's assertions, denying these benefits to illegal aliens doesn't equate 
to "ethnic cleansing," is not unconstitutional and certainly doesn't "demonize" 
immigrants, illegal or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials estimate that providing a whole host of government benefits to 
illegal aliens costs California taxpayers almost $3 billion per year. This at a 
time when our own citizens are faced with higher taxes and reduced benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet there are those who insist we must provide such benefits, even though 
illegal aliens are often served to the detriment of legal immigrants and our 
own citizens. The Democratic majority in Congress recently prevented me from 
offering an amendment to exclude illegal aliens from the Women, Infants and 
Children nutrition program, allowing the payment of WIC funds to illegal-alien 
mothers to continue. Never mind that the program provides benefits to only 70% 
of eligible mothers, and that for every illegal alien served, a citizen or 
legal immigrant mother is left out. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that taxpayer-funded government programs should benefit our own 
citizens and legal immigrants is not hateful or nativist. The American dream is 
available to almost a million legal immigrants a year. Spending California, and 
America, into debt to provide benefits to illegal aliens denies everyone the 
opportunity America offers. And that hurts immigrants and citizens alike.

literacy coordinator and a resident of California since 1952, I not only agree 
with what Freedman had to say but would like to affirm my tremendous respect 
for our "Mex-American" neighbors and for the laws of our land. 
</P>
<P>
 We may not all be able to write columns like Freedman, but all who feel as he 
does should speak up at each opportunity and let our views be known. Then, 
maybe, the 62% who favor SOS would be reversed and our state would be spared 
from committing a grave injustice.

 * Re "Mahony to Fight Ballot Measure on Immigrants," July 24: 
</P>
<P>
 I would be the last to deny Cardinal Roger Mahony his right to feel as he does 
about illegal aliens in California. My only concern is that he makes his public 
denouncement of Proposition 187 with his own funds and not under the aegis of 
an organization that is exempt from paying taxes, property and others. This 
country has seen fit to separate church and state and given privileges to the 
former. His violation of this separation is an infringement on all taxpayers 
who believe that laws apply equally to all.

<P>
 * Cardinal Mahony is entitled to his personal opinion on Proposition 187, but 
he is not entitled to foist his religious viewpoints on the rest of us. If he 
wants to give illegal aliens public benefits, then let the Catholic Church put 
up the money to pay for them.

CLEAN AIR PLAN FOR L.A. BASIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * EPA Administrator Felicia Marcus (Commentary, July 18) asked that we get 
involved and send comments to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of Herculean efforts by most of the parties involved our air is still 
the worst in the nation. Why? It seems obvious that the root cause is 
population growth, and although that may be the most difficult problem to 
overcome, anything else we do is a Band-Aid approach. It may be politically 
difficult but if we don't address this issue everything else we do is effete. 
</P>
<P>
 Since we can't directly control population, our cities must stabilize their 
growth. It will take a state law to insist that a percentage of a community not 
be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many towns believe that if they build on every square foot of land their 
community will be enriched; the opposite has been true. Ironically, communities 
that have remained small have become havens for the very few affluent who can 
afford to live there. (Many of whom became affluent by building homes and strip 
malls in other towns!) 
</P>
<P>
 Building codes were created for the safety of the community after Mrs. 
O'Leary's cow kicked over that lamp. Now the safety of the community has taken 
on new meaning and the "fire" we face is considerably more threatening than the 
one that razed Chicago over 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 We need a building code that says what percentage of the land can be built on 
and what the density can be in every community. More freeways are not the 
answer, they are the problem.

 * In the article about EPA's plan to clean up the air in the Los Angeles Basin 
("Anti-Smog Proposal Would Hobble Transit and Shipping, Industries Say," July 
19), you quote transportation officials saying Los Angeles and Long Beach 
harbors would lose business to ports that do not face smog fees, such as San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Any loss to San Diego would be minuscule. The heavy hit would come from the 
Pacific Northwest; the folks in Puget Sound would grab the land bridge faster 
than you can say adios. 
</P>
<P>
 I have lived and worked in the major ports of the Pacific Coast and in all of 
those ports there is an acute awareness of the economic importance of their 
port -- except Los Angeles. I can guarantee that you will become aware of that 
importance after the EPA has done its job.

By ANDREW YOUNG, Andrew Young is the former mayor of Atlanta and U.S. 
ambassador to the United Nations. This is excerpted from his talk to the Unity 
Conference of minority journalists in Atlanta on Thursday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, I was elected to 
Congress, where I served on the House Banking Committee and the International 
Trade and Finance subcommittees. I was there not knowing what was going on or 
what I was doing. But nobody else there understood what was going on or knew 
what they were doing either. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember distinctly, Paul Volcker, Arthur Burns and George Shultz coming to 
the Banking Committee and saying that it was time to end the Bretton Woods 
agreements. Now we're celebrating 50 years of Bretton Woods -- agreements that 
were broken up 20 years ago. Before then, we had 3% to 6% economic growth in 
Europe, America and all over the world. We had stable currencies. We had free 
trade. We had low interest rates. The world progressed. Everybody moved 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 However, after the 1972 election, President Richard M. Nixon was determined to 
break up those agreements, thereby abandoning the leadership role of the United 
States of America in the free world economy. Burns, Shultz and Volcker were not 
convinced what they were doing on behalf of the Administration was right for 
the country, but that was what the White House wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Watergate broke. And while we got upset over it, the thing that was 
really screwing the country and screwing the world was what was happening on 
the Banking Committee. And nobody paid attention. Within months, OPEC was 
formed, the world price of oil went from about $3.50 a barrel up to $50 a 
barrel. And we've been on an economic roller coaster ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The banks began to recycle debt. In the 1980s, developed nations contributed 
$927 billion to poor nations. For that debt, poor nations paid back $1.34 
trillion. Instead of aid flowing from rich to poor, aid was flowing from poor 
to rich. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one of the reasons why you have Yugoslavia pulling apart, why they 
can't keep a government in Nigeria, why Colombia is dealing in drugs, why we're 
having all this rain and flooding, is the consequences of a debt burden having 
created a boomerang. That boomerang is affecting everything we do. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund insist on certain 
rescheduling, certain conditionality, which cuts down the size of government 
and creates unemployment. People have to earn a living, so they go out in the 
woods and grow cocaine instead of coffee and sugar. They export the cocaine 
back here and we've got a crime problem. They cut down the trees for export to 
meet their balance-of-payments needs. They destroy the rain forest. We have 
global warming. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless we have a sense of economic order, we're not going to have peace or 
prosperity anywhere on this planet. We're courting environmental disasters 
every day that we allow the present conditions to continue.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm basically a supporter of the World Bank and the International Monetary 
Fund because the development strategy which they are advocating is exactly what 
developed the southeastern part of the United States. It's exactly what 
developed Europe and Japan, with one exception: the interest rate.  
</P>
<P>
 When the United States loaned money during the Marshall Plan, England got it 
at 2%. Mexico had to pay 18-20% for their interest. That's why they have crisis 
in Mexico and why it's hard for the government to be stable. The Caribbean has 
been raped by high interest rates. Africa right now is a basket case because 
it's almost impossible to have any political order because there's no economic 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 George Bush used the term New World Order, but he didn't have a clue as to how 
to define it. I think it's our challenge to define it.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE MIDEAST; THE ROAD TO PEACE WIDENS; WITH JORDAN COMING ON 
BOARD, ONLY SYRIA IS LEFT TO BE PERSUADED. ISRAEL HAS NEVER BEEN IN A BETTER 
POSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBA EBAN, Abba Eban is a former foreign minister of Israel and a former 
ambassador to the United States and United Nations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On July 26, the success of the Mideast peace process ceased to be a doubtful 
prospect and became a near certainty. With the Egyptian treaty firmly 
established, the Palestinian self-governing authority slowly overcoming its 
initial disorder and the state of war with Jordan canceled by King Hussein's 
regal proclamation, Israel is living in a brighter glow than it has ever known 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria is more likely to be drawn into the emerging regional order than to 
remain outside its magnetic field. Precedent and tradition encourage this hope. 
Syria has usually joined an Arab initiative at the latest feasible stage. In 
the early months of 1949, three countries, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, signed 
armistice agreements with Israel, which defined the regional and territorial 
structure for some decades. Syria adhered six months later. Henry Kissinger 
mediated a disengagement agreement with Egypt and Israel in January, 1974. 
Syria signed a similar agreement later, on May 31 of that year. The lateness 
was calculated: Syria has to have its demonstration of reluctance; it is a part 
of its national temperament. 
</P>
<P>
 Damascus now has nowhere else to look if it wishes to avoid isolation. 
President Boris Yeltsin's congratulatory message to President Bill Clinton 
after the joint U.S. congressional session should remind President Hafez Assad 
that he no longer has an assured arms supply or the protection of a Russian 
safety net in the unlikely event of an assault on Israel. There are some 
indications that he is not far from following the politics of reconciliation 
practiced by Egypt, Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization. His frank 
condemnation of the terrorist assaults in Buenos Aires and London sound like 
routine gestures, but they are unique in the Syrian practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The next phases of the peace process will recall the intrinsic difficulties of 
negotiating in a multilateral context. All Arab states are faced with an 
identity problem. Are they sovereign states reaching their decisions in terms 
of their separate geographies, social orientations and diverse power 
structures? Or are they a family bound to habits of solidarity and harmonious 
movement? 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that they are both of these things at different times. In 
general, the federal tendencies in Arab nationalism are weakening and 
individual decision-making is on the rise. Anwar Sadat's plunge into peace with 
Israel, Saddam Hussein's revolt against the West, Moammar Kadafi's anarchic 
behavior and Jordan's defiant defense of Jordanian interests all give a picture 
of "each one for itself." Yet there is a strong preference in the Arab world 
for common action if this does not interfere with national interest. Jordan 
will probably give time for Syria to join the peace momentum, but not so much 
time as to miss the opportunities offered by last week's Washington 
declaration. Syria has missed too many opportunities in the past and it has 
gained nothing by yielding to intimidation by more radical Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
 Another incentive for Syria to join the peace process is that the PLO cannot 
convincingly inhibit Damascus from negotiating with Israel, as in the past. 
What is respectable in Arab terms is still defined by the Palestine issue. King 
Hussein could not have moved to his present attitude toward Israel before the 
Oslo agreement and the establishment of the Palestinian self-governing 
authority. Syria could not now accept criticism from Yasser Arafat, who has 
himself signed commitments well ahead of Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein's example is also helpful. It would have been grotesque for him to 
seek more contacts with the previous Israeli government which insisted on 
keeping all the residents of the West Bank and Gaza under permanent Israeli 
subjection. Hussein may not be Arafat's greatest admirer, but he is the last 
ruler who could afford to appear as a betrayer of the Palestine people. Nor is 
this his ideology. It is the readiness of the current Israeli government for 
innovation and compromise that has done more than anything else to make a peace 
process possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli leaders, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon 
Peres, have awarded Hussein a preferential position regarding the Muslim holy 
places. This is sustained by traditional rights, but the king will need a 
Muslim as well as an Israeli mandate for the exercise of that right. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1967, the government of Israel, in a communication to the United 
Nations, declared that "Israel does not claim exclusive rights or unilateral 
responsibility in the Holy Places of Islam." This was drafted by Ministers 
Menachem Begin, Zerach Warhaftig and me. Our unanimous Israeli refusal to 
envisage a secular division of our capital is reinforced, not weakened, by our 
readiness to accept the management of the holy places by those who hold them 
sacred. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few formative years, Israel will have to give more weight to 
diplomacy as one of the ultimate guarantors of its peace. One day, a national 
entity may exist, sufficiently powerful, wealthy and secure to live without any 
reliance on external forces. It will then be able to dispense with diplomacy. 
As yet, no such community has existed on earth, though some have aspired to 
that condition and others have been deluded into thinking that they have 
achieved it. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the lachrymose talk about Israel as the victim of world history, the 
truth is that no small state has ever been more in need of outside support -- 
or more successful in obtaining it. Anyone who doubted this would have a hard 
time to name another state that could ever hope to celebrate a day like that 
which Israel and Jordan lived together in the House of Congress in Washington 
on July 26, 1994.

COLUMN RIGHT / PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS: FIRST LADY'S SECRETS ARE IN THE DOCK; A 
TRIAL DATE IS SET ON A SUIT TO DISCLOSE WHO DECIDED WHAT AT CLOSED HEALTH-CARE 
MEETINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS, Paul Craig Roberts is a fellow at the Cato Institute and 
at the Institute for Political Economy, Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Monday, U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton and her top health-care aide, Ira Magaziner, to stand trial 
Sept. 12 on civil charges of covering up the involvement of special interests 
in drafting the Clinton health care plan.  
</P>
<P>
 The specific legal issues before the bench are whether the First Lady's 
health-reform task force violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act by holding 
meetings in secret, and whether Magaziner perjured himself when he testified 
under oath in March, 1993, that only federal employees were involved in the 
secret meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues before the public are more important. They involve the First Lady's 
candor, or lack thereof, and the White House's cynical manipulation of the 
public's health concerns in order to benefit special interests allied with the 
Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Advisory Committee Act requires task forces not wholly composed of 
federal employees to meet in public. When pressed by the Assn. of American 
Physicians and Surgeons to comply with the law and open the meetings, Clinton 
and her aides claimed that only federal employees were involved in the work of 
the task force.  
</P>
<P>
 This claim disintegrated when Kent Masterson Brown, attorney for the 
physicians' group, presented Judge Lamberth with 37 pounds of evidence that 357 
members of the task force were not federal employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure of the evidence, Clinton's Justice Department lawyers abandoned 
the federal-employees-only defense. The new defense of the secret meetings is 
that the health-care task force did not influence, and was not intended to 
influence, the content of President Clinton's health-care reform plan. If the 
task force was not established by the President or utilized by him to obtain 
advice or recommendations, it is not covered by the Federal Advisory Committee 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
 What are we to make of the President's publicly expressed appreciation to the 
task force for its contribution to his health-care plan if the work of the task 
force was not utilized by the President? Even more puzzling is Magaziner's 
staffing memo of Jan. 26, 1993, a copy of which is in the judge's hands. The 
memo clearly states that the goal of the task force "is to prepare 
comprehensive health-care reform legislation in the next 100 days." 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady, Magaziner and their Justice Department lawyers are driven to 
implausible argument by a desperate need to keep the public from finding out 
about the special-interest groups that prepared the Clinton health-care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plaintiffs win the lawsuit, the secret proceedings of the task force 
will be made public. The opened files will expose the President and First Lady 
to charges of public deception that will make Richard Nixon's transgression 
look mild in comparison. Hidden behind the President's promise of "universal 
coverage" paid for by employers and the federal government, special interests 
were working feverishly devising a scheme that would drive doctors out of 
private practice, terminate "fee for service" insurance coverage, curtail the 
supply of medical specialists and herd the public into impersonal, bureaucratic 
health-care organizations that would save money by rationing medical services. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the lawsuits and investigations that threaten the Clinton presidency, 
there are no greater dangers than the secret files of the health-care task 
force, which will reveal a cynical President defrauding the public in behalf of 
special interests.

<P>
 The weeks since O. J. Simpson's arrest for murder have witnessed an explosion 
of debate about domestic violence. With a conference committee of Congress 
considering the Violence Against Women Act as part of the crime package, the 
subject commands unprecedented attention. Sadly, much of the debate has been 
sullied by the willingness of the political right to engage in wild 
misrepresentations. Some of the people engaged in this process also bring their 
credibility as teachers and scholars to the exchange. To find academics 
presenting skewed information to the public casts doubt on the whole enterprise 
of scholarship, a doubt that will last long after the current debate is over. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Simpson defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School 
professor, describes a recent Justice Department study of murder in families as 
concluding that "women kill almost as often as men do." The numbers in the 
study are: Women commit 41% of familial murders; men, 59%. There is no counting 
system in which 41% is "almost as" great as 59%. And these aren't the national 
statistics. The 1992 FBI numbers for murders of spouses show 70% are men 
killing their wives and 30% are women killing husbands. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the huge disparity between the real numbers and the Dershowitz numbers? 
The Justice Department study Dershowitz used looked only at the largest 
counties in the United States, which are substantially nonwhite, and African 
American wives kill their husbands at a higher percentage than white wives do 
(although the ratio is still not 50-50). And his figures count the deaths of 
children as well as spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 So, nationally, Dershowitz's almost half of family murders committed by women 
turns out to be less than one-third if you look at spousal murders alone. It 
didn't take a Harvard professor to figure this out. It came from the same 
report and the same human source at Justice that Dershowitz used. Defense 
lawyers don't usually get cross-examined about their statements, but if this is 
the way Dershowitz prepares his witnesses, Simpson had better stick with 
Shapiro for the courtroom work. 
</P>
<P>
 This misrepresentation of the numbers is just the most recent variation of the 
Big Lie technique much in vogue among the debunkers of gender violence. 
Christina Hoff Sommers, an associate professor at Clark University in 
Massachusetts, published a book, "Who Stole Feminism?" claiming that the 
common-law doctrine of the "rule of thumb," which allowed a man to beat his 
wife if he used moderation, as in a stick no thicker than a thumb, is a 
"feminist fiction." Conservative columnists John Leo and Mona Charen glommed 
onto this assertion and crowed about how newspapers and television stations had 
been taken in. 
</P>
<P>
 There's only one problem: It's Sommers who is wrong. There are at least three 
19th-Century American cases referring explicitly to the "rule of thumb" that 
allows a man to beat his wife if he used moderate means (State vs. Olivor, 
State vs. Rhodes and Bradley vs. State). Sommers knew about the cases because 
she refers to the two that convicted the husband anyway. But she never mentions 
the case that let the husband off. 
</P>
<P>
 Sommers also didn't do her homework. The cases and the articles about the rule 
of thumb refer to the universally accepted authority on old English common law, 
William Blackstone. Sommers looked at Blackstone's Commentaries, she says, in 
which Blackstone found that the common law prohibited violence against wives. 
She even cites a volume in her footnotes. A real scholar would ask how all 
those 19th-Century U.S. state court judges who refer to Blackstone could have 
been so mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that Sommers must have been looking at some sort of condensed 
version of Blackstone that left off the Latin parts, perhaps for the benefit of 
the common modern reader. Her quotation stopped right in the middle of a 
sentence. In the real volumes of Blackstone, available in many libraries, a 
husband's right in the old common law to moderate chastisement of his wife is 
there in black and white. Violence is allowed, Blackstone says, if it "lawfully 
and reasonably belongs to the husband for the due government and correction of 
his wife." (Book 1, Chapter 15, pages 444-445) Blackstone even talks about the 
limits on the permission in civil law to use scourges (whips or straps) and 
sticks. Perhaps Charen and Leo also lack libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 So I just found two whoppers -- Dershowitz's numbers and Sommers' "feminist 
fiction" -- and the research didn't take me half an hour. Regardless of one's 
politics, we must ask ourselves whether the truth of gender relations is so 
terrible that it must be concealed with a curtain of lies.

 For years, scientists have known the anti-carcinogenic benefits of fiber, yet 
the average daily intake of fiber is 10 to 20 grams, while experts recommend 30 
to 40. Daily diets also need plenty of vegetables and fruits rich in 
anti-cancer agents such as beta-carotene and vitamin C, yet Americans only get 
about half the recommended servings of vegetables and fruits. 
</P>
<P>
 It is well-accepted that vegetarians, have a much lower chance of developing 
cancer than non-vegetarians. The absence of meat, in particular, dramatically 
reduces fat intake. Dietary fat speeds the growth of abnormal cancer cells. 
Americans on average consume 37% of daily calories as fat; fat intake should be 
closer to 10% or 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetarians also appear to have much stronger immune systems; one study of the 
cancer-fighting ability of white blood cells found the vegetarians' more than 
twice as effective. Clearly, doctors are not doing their jobs; they are not 
communicating to the public what needs to be done to prevent a leading cause of 
death in this country. When we are equipped with the ammunition to fight but 
are losing the war, war strategies need to change.

GOP CANDIDATE HAS FOES IN OWN PARTY; POLITICS: CONSERVATIVES VOW TO KEEP TABS 
ON MARILYN BREWER, A SOCIAL ISSUES CENTRIST WHO IS FAVORED TO WIN O.C. ASSEMBLY 
RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a nervous time for Marilyn C. Brewer, who had just won a three-way 
slugfest in the June primary to become the Republican nominee in the 70th 
Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 There she was in the state capital, not yet knowing when, or if, her 
"mainstream Republican" views would ever be embraced by the party's 
archconservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 They did not like her position in support of abortion rights and were angered 
when she refused to denounce pending legislation expanding the rights of gays. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at this political orientation session designed to introduce the GOP 
nominees to their party's legislative caucus, Republican Assembly Leader Jim 
Brulte, an opponent of abortion rights, decided to break the ice with humor. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an often-repeated account of the dinner party held at a 
Sacramento hotel, Brulte introduced Brewer as "the baby killer from Newport 
Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it was a joke, but Brewer, 57, was thrown for a loop. 
</P>
<P>
 "My head kind of went back," she remembers. "I had just come through a very 
contentious primary, and there was a congressman from this area (Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan of Garden Grove) sending out letters addressed to 'Dear protector of the 
pre-born, watch out for this wicked witch of the North that kills babies.' And 
nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a sensitive area because, while I am pro-choice, you could almost 
call me pro-life." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte later said those weren't his exact words, but he conceded he gave 
Brewer and other newcomers an initiation intended to welcome them to the GOP 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact that the story has been so widely circulated by her critics calls 
attention to the political oddity that Brewer is a fiscal conservative who 
leans toward the center on social issues, nominated for office from what many 
consider to be one of the most conservative counties in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 If this political novice thinks the campaign against two conservatives was 
grueling, wait until she gets to the Assembly, her political rivals have warned 
her. They have not let her rest on the laurels of her primary victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Brewer win the Nov. 8 election against Democratic underdog Jim 
Toledano, which is likely because of the overwhelming Republican registration 
in their district, conservatives said they will watch every vote she casts and 
write down every word she utters, with hopes of taking her on again in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative activists don't just disagree with her -- they don't believe 
what she says. 
</P>
<P>
 They claim Brewer was a "stealth" candidate -- a liberal cloaked by 
Republican-sounding policy themes that will quickly be shed once she settles 
into office. 
</P>
<P>
 If she is compared to Gil Ferguson, the incumbent Newport Beach Republican who 
is giving up the seat, "she might as well be a Democrat," said the Rev. Lou 
Sheldon, who heads the conservative Traditional Values Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Garden Grove), who endorsed one of Brewer's 
opponents, said after the primary conservatives were turned off by her gleeful, 
post-election announcement that her primary victory signaled a change in local 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are offended with her Barbara Boxer routine," Conroy said, referring to 
the Democratic U.S. senator from Northern California. "Savor your victory and 
be quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brewer may have a key ally in Brulte, a coalition builder, who contends 
that the coastal Orange County district is not as conservative as some claim. 
Except on the abortion issue, he added, Brewer is a conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to business issues, when it comes to taxes, when it comes to 
regulations, when it comes to local control, when it comes to welfare reforms, 
when it comes to illegal immigration, I don't think there's a dime's worth of 
difference between Marilyn Brewer and Gil Ferguson," Brulte said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brewer is always careful not to say anything that might offend the 
local party leadership or its most conservative members, she also vows not to 
wring her hands with worry for the next two years, should she be seated in the 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to spend my time looking over my shoulder," Brewer said. "By 
virtue of the fact that I put so much money into my own campaign, I go to 
Sacramento owing no one and I do what I believe is the right thing, based on my 
values and principles." 
</P>
<P>
 Those values were grounded in the middle-class home of her Italian American 
parents, who voted for Democrats while she was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Amerigo Cerolini, worked as a crane operator in Pennsylvania and 
Michigan and taught Brewer and her two younger sisters the value of an 
education and a strong work ethic. Despite the modest income, a Catholic school 
education was a top priority in their household, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer swears that her Republicanism emerged when she was 11 years old. She 
begged her father on Election Day to vote for Republican presidential candidate 
Thomas E. Dewey instead of the Democratic incumbent, Harry S. Truman. "Did you 
vote for Dewey?" she remembers asking when he returned from work that evening. 
"No," he replied. "I voted for a True-man." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1949, the family moved to Compton, where her father joined his brother in 
establishing a restaurant and bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of going to college, she married Chuck Brewer, the "boy next door" who 
was two years older. By the time she was 29, the couple had four sons and a 
yearning to start a manufacturing business of their own. Her husband had the 
technical expertise, and she became the secretary, bookkeeper and floor 
sweeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, now 28 years old, produces plastics that are used in computers 
and medical laboratories, including the blood oxygenator machines used for 
open-heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout most of her adult life, Brewer said she watched politics but never 
imagined running for office. She was a registered Democrat until 1985, but says 
that President John F. Kennedy was the first and last Democrat she voted for on 
the national level. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband was always a Republican, and I realized very early on that my 
philosophy was aligned with the Republican Party," Brewer said. "Given the era 
I was raised in, it was a matter of maintaining my independence by staying a 
Democrat even though I agreed with my Republican husband." 
</P>
<P>
 Satisfied with her contribution to the family business, Brewer quit work, went 
back to school and became involved in charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of curiosity, she said, she applied for and won appointment to an Orange 
County grand jury. It opened her eyes to the workings of government and led her 
to seek employment in the office of Supervisor Thomas F. Riley in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, she worked for no money and answered constituent complaints about 
barking dogs and broken street lights. Eventually, she would become a senior 
staffer earning $40,000 to $60,000 a year (she refuses to disclose her salary) 
and be placed in charge of criminal justice and related budgetary issues. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider credits her with aggressively 
doing her homework on issues, while avoiding the internal political conflicts 
that are often a part of county government. "She was not a real flashy, 'I have 
to be the center of attention' kind of a person," he added. "But I found her to 
be thorough and a good person to work with." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Coley, a county employee who worked regularly with Brewer on public safety 
issues before she quit this year to run for the Assembly, said she was always 
concerned about wasteful spending and making sure that services were equally 
distributed. Logic and fairness, not politics, guided her work, Coley added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt comfortable that I could go talk to her in a candid way and not feel 
that I was going to be compromised or that she was going to abuse that 
relationship and trust," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that she was not considered a "political animal," other co-workers and 
Riley, her boss, said they were a little surprised to hear her plans to seek 
the Assembly seat. "And then I knew that she would probably do an outstanding 
job. I knew she would be very aggressive," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer had begun considering the race after watching Costa Mesa Mayor Mary 
Hornbuckle get clobbered in the 1992 election by Ferguson. When Ferguson 
announced he would not seek reelection but instead run later for the state 
Senate, Brewer jumped into the race, not really mindful of what the rest of the 
candidate pool would look like. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my naivete, I had not thought it through enough to realize that if it was 
me against only one of (the conservative candidates), that it would not work," 
Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her two opponents in the primary election, Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond 
and attorney Thomas G. Reinecke, split the conservative vote, making Brewer the 
nominee with 34% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a costly win. Brewer lent her campaign about $240,000 -- more than 
twice the amount she and her husband had initially budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Her victory also caused division within local Republican ranks. Conservatives, 
unwilling to accept defeat, briefly considered waging a write-in campaign 
during the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration with Brewer among local conservatives stemmed from the 
"mainstream" label she gave herself during the campaign, which she defines as 
"to the right of center." She said she is more conservative than Gov. Pete 
Wilson, but more moderate than former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 Engaged in discussion, she concedes not really knowing the difference between 
a moderate and a "mainstream" conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know because I didn't come into this politically savvy," she said. 
"When (conservatives) begin to know me and look at me a little closer, they are 
going to find that we align probably on 85% of the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives, however, have not been convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, they noted that she opposes the political "agenda and tactics" of 
the National Organization for Women and her tendency to favor "parental 
consent" laws that would require minors seeking abortions to have their 
parents' approval. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brewer also has stated that it is not "government's place" to be involved 
in a woman's right to have an abortion. She also helped form a bipartisan group 
that helps elect moderate, abortion-rights women. And she is scheduled to be a 
guest speaker at an upcoming meeting of the National Women's Political Caucus 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people try to have it both ways. You can't do that," said Mike Spence, 
vice president of California Pro Life Council Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 On another issue, Brewer said she has no position on a pending bill that would 
allow domestic partners to officially register their relationships with the 
state and share rights now enjoyed by married couples. Conservatives believe 
she would support it because she received strong campaign support from members 
of the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer's general position on gay rights is: "I don't believe in special rights 
for any group, but I believe in equal rights for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, the roar of criticism is being replaced by calls for party unity. 
Except for Conroy, all of Orange County's GOP Assembly members have signed a 
letter endorsing Brewer. Ferguson, who backed Reinecke, said "it would be wrong 
not to endorse a Republican candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), the Assembly's assistant minority 
leader, said it's up to Brewer to define her role within the state's mostly 
conservative GOP caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can emphasize those areas where she's in agreement with most members of 
the caucus, or she can emphasize those areas where she is not," Pringle said.

HUBER CASE A CHALLENGE TO DEFEND OR PROSECUTE; COURTS: CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE 
OF SLAYING LOOKS BAD FOR FAMALARO, BUT SOME DETAILS COULD WORK IN HIS FAVOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It seems like a damning case: A long-missing Newport Beach woman turns up 
dead, her body nude and handcuffed in a locked freezer stowed away in a rental 
truck parked in the prime suspect's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 A search of that suspect's home turns up keys to the handcuffs and the 
freezer, a box containing the woman's clothing and personal effects from her 
purse, as well as yellowed newspaper clippings about her disappearance -- even 
documents proving he rented the truck and bought the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorneys and criminal law authorities caution against assuming 
that prosecutors will have little difficulty proving John J. Famalaro, 37, of 
Dewey, Ariz., fatally bludgeoned Denise Huber, 23, then wrapped her corpse in 
plastic bags and kept her in a freezer for nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because he has the body doesn't prove he did it. Just because evidence 
points in one direction doesn't mean you can assume the person must be guilty," 
said Orange County Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia, before he 
unexpectedly became responsible for Famalaro's defense and decided he should 
avoid further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia is currently embarking on the most critical aspect of his case, experts 
say, mapping out a defense strategy that could run the gamut from self defense 
to an insanity plea to arguing that he was threatened by the real killer into 
keeping the horrible secret in the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 As the case stands now, it's a classic example of circumstantial evidence, say 
Famalaro's original attorneys in Arizona and Sacramento Deputy Public Defender 
James R. Ramos, who handled a similar case several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Schinkel, dubbed "Freezerman," was convicted of first-degree murder in 
Sacramento in November, 1991, for killing his girlfriend during a heated fight, 
and carrying her body around in an unplugged freezer for almost five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take a set of facts that seem to say, 'Hey, this guy is guilty of 
everything,' but to find him guilty, you would have make a leap and infer that 
that means he did it. But you still have no evidence of that," said Ramos, 
whose client admitted to police that he killed the woman when she attacked him 
during an argument. 
</P>
<P>
 When jurors are faced with two reasonable interpretations of the facts, and 
one points to guilt and one points to innocence, jurors are bound by law to 
acquit the defendant, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yavapai County Deputy Counsel Thomas B. Lindberg, who was set to prosecute 
Famalaro in Arizona before he relinquished the case to Orange County 
prosecutors, said "I completely disagree" with that assessment. He points out 
that most murder cases are circumstantial: the key witness -- the victim -- is 
no longer alive to testify, and there are rarely first-hand, eyewitness 
accounts of a killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you'll have a jury that says, 'Oh, you have a body and there's 
all this other evidence, but we'll let you go because no one saw you do it,' " 
said Lindberg, adding that the evidence against Famalaro appears greater than 
in most murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who have been following the Huber murder case as it unfolded after 
Famalaro's arrest say a troublesome point for prosecutors may be proving 
allegations that would make Famalaro eligible for the death penalty under 
California law. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors have filed charges alleging Huber was kidnaped and 
murdered. California law requires prosecutors to prove the murder took place 
during a kidnaping, sexual assault or in one of several so-called "special 
circumstances" before a convicted murderer can be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Arizona law, prosecutors must only prove a killing was sufficiently 
"depraved and heinous" before seeking the death penalty, leading some to 
speculate it would be more difficult for California authorities to secure a 
death penalty conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber, a 23-year-old UC Irvine graduate who was working as a waitress, was 
driving home from a concert in Inglewood in June, 1991, when a tire on her blue 
Honda Accord suffered a blowout on the Corona del Mar Freeway. She was never 
heard from again, but her parents launched a tireless public search for her 
whereabouts, making Huber's name easily recognizable by many Orange County 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 No witnesses have come forward to testify that Huber was kidnaped or ambushed 
by her attacker. The final results of an autopsy could lead to additional 
charges, but decomposition and the frozen condition of the body may forever 
conceal evidence of any possible sexual assault, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's personal belongings were found in Famalaro's garage, but she was not 
stripped of rings and other jewelry. A savvy defense attorney could fight a 
robbery allegation by saying the items were taken after her death, or were in 
fact mementos of a macabre sort -- not stolen goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say their "gut reaction" tells them Huber was too 
smart to fall for a stranger's ploy in the middle of the night and she must 
have been abducted or lured from her crippled vehicle by a sophisticated ruse. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also admit that the gut instincts of even the most experienced 
detective do not equal convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith said the discovery of blood in a Laguna Hills 
storage facility helps pinpoint the murder scene and indicates that Huber must 
have been abducted from the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 While many criminal attorneys agree it will not be a simple case for 
prosecutors, they also say the defense has an uphill battle ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 How can Famalaro explain away a body in his freezer -- which he apparently 
took pains to keep plugged in at all times -- if he goes on trial? 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas K. Kelly and Warren Darrow, two Arizona defense attorneys who until 
recently were planning to defend Famalaro against Arizona murder charges, have 
declined to comment on what their strategy might have been had the case gone to 
trial in Yavapai County, where Famalaro was living at the time Huber's body was 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 But legal motions filed in Yavapai County court late last week indicate they 
intended to scrutinize the prosecution's case at every turn for evidence that 
police focused only on their client as a suspect -- and may have doctored their 
notes to help prove their case. 
</P>
<P>
 It is anticipated that Kelly and Darrow will assist Gumlia as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think there are a limitless number of issues here for the defense to 
seize upon," said one prominent Orange County defense attorney. "They could 
argue that other people had access to the freezer and lived at the home as 
well. They could try to point the finger at someone else, and (Famalaro's) 
brother doesn't have the best record in this area," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 But police say that, barring additional evidence, they have ruled out Warren 
Famalaro as a possible suspect. As an Orange County chiropractor, Warren was 
convicted more than a decade ago of sexually assaulting a young boy and a 
teen-age girl, both patients of his at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 John Famalaro's first defense attorney, Lawrence W. Katz, seized upon some of 
these same ideas during a bail hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz repeatedly questioned Lt. Scott Mascher of the Yavapai County Sheriff's 
Department about whether authorities could prove that Famalaro knew the 
contents of the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 He also questioned how Mascher could be sure Famalaro's brother-in-law, Duane 
Thobe, had taken all his belongings when he moved from the house. Records show 
the home in which Famalaro lived is owned by Thobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Thobe's civil attorney in Arizona, Eric Chester, became enraged when a 
reporter called to ask him about Katz's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will only do our explaining to the authorities," he said, threatening to 
sue if any further questions were asked. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA law professor Peter Arenella said the bizarre nature of the case could 
pave the way for an insanity defense -- although he noted that such cases are 
rarely successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not simply a question . . . that a person did a bad thing, so he is 
guilty of all the charges," Arenella said. "There remains the question of the 
person's mental state at the time, and that's an issue that could lead to an 
acquittal or a conviction of a less serious charge." 
</P>
<P>
 William Thompson, professor of criminology, law and society at UC Irvine, said 
he expects psychiatric experts will be examining Famalaro before long. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said the prosecution may face difficulty proving premeditation and 
deliberation -- elements needed for a first-degree murder conviction -- 
especially since so much time has passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides disagree on how the lapse of time between Huber's disappearance and 
the unsettling use of the freezer and handcuffs will impact the case. Huber's 
mouth and eyes were covered with cotton and sealed shut with duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 For the prosecution, those elements can be used to argue premeditation and 
consciousness of guilt. For the defense, it could help in an insanity defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides, however, say key evidence that could help their case may have been 
lost or destroyed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it possible she died accidentally? It may not seem plausible, but remember 
the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the standard of proof is high," 
Thompson said. "One can speculate on any number of defense theories to be 
advanced. He could argue it was in the heat of passion, after an argument. He 
could even argue self-defense. He tried to kidnap her, took her back to his 
place, in her struggle to get away she came after him with a knife, and he beat 
her to save himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecution will have to establish both the act and the mental state for 
the act," Thompson said. "At this point, the defense will be looking at the 
evidence like it's a chain-link fence, and wondering where the weak links are."

MOTHER HOLDS GARAGE SALE TO OFFSET FAMALARO'S LEGAL FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The ad in the local newspaper said "Paint Give-Away," and the address was 
familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen days after Denise Huber's battered body was found stashed in a 
freezer in a stolen Ryder truck parked in John J. Famalaro's driveway here, his 
mother stood in the same driveway, hawking her son's paint, tools and old 
pickup truck in an effort to offset his legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to do this right now to pay some of the immediate bills," 
said Anna Famalaro, 69, as she puttered about the driveway Saturday morning, 
greeting each customer personally and bidding them goodby with a "God bless 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all been very hard," she added, picking out dried leaves from a planter 
in her son's front lawn and stuffing them into a garbage bag. "I don't know if 
I'm going to be alive tomorrow. . . . My husband is dying, my son is in jail. 
How would you feel if your family was falling apart?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, John Famalaro, 37, a handyman and house-painter, faces charges of 
first-degree murder and kidnaping of Huber, a 23-year-old waitress from Newport 
Beach who disappeared June 3, 1991, after a rock concert. He is being held 
without bond in Yavapai County Jail while he awaits extradition to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the trauma, Anna Famalaro was cheerful Saturday morning as she played 
host to a steady trickle of visitors at the makeshift garage sale in a 
blue-and-yellow floral frock, black flats, and a smile coated in bright pink 
lipstick. Her husband, frail with Parkinson's disease, sat in a parked car at 
the driveway's edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on in and see what you see," Anna Famalaro repeated each time a car 
arrived on the quiet street inside the Prescott Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 3,000 cans of brand-name paint and a couple dozen larger buckets crowded 
most of the driveway and surrounded the white pickup John Famalaro used to 
drive around town. The truck, with 140,000 miles on it, was priced to sell at 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A chain saw, leaf blower, electric paint washer, extension cords, jumper 
cables, wooden rods, shovels, cassette-tape holder and an old pair of sneakers 
were awaiting an offer among the assorted tools lining one wall of the 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paint is $2 a gallon, any of it, and this stuff," she told shoppers, 
pointing to the tools. "If you see anything you like, we can talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 When one man held up a rake, she asked, "Well, how much do you think I should 
charge for that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Lunsford, 69, a Californian who moved nine years ago to a house around the 
corner from the Famalaros, bought a couple of gallons of paint to use for a 
base coat on the shutters of his patio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good buy if I can find what I need," Lunsford said as he peered at the 
veritable mountain of cans whose colors were not clearly marked. Estimating 
that the paint would normally cost up to $15 a gallon in a store, Lunsford said 
of the price, "Hell, you can't touch it." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Lunsford, most of the customers Saturday knew of Famalaro's arrest, but 
shrugged it off in the name of a good bargain. And, some expressed sympathy 
toward Anna Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got to get rid of (the stuff). The sheriff's moved all the stuff out 
onto her driveway, and now the county is on her tail to clean it out," said Ron 
Frank, a house painter from neighboring Prescott Valley who bought a $20 
ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 "A ladder is something you can always use, and also I feel bad for the 
family," said Frank, 41, who used to live in Ventura County. "I mean, I feel 
bad for the family of the victim, but the family of the accused is also going 
through hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Between customers, Anna Famalaro spoke gravely about her son's predicament, 
saying she was unsure whether she would prefer a trial in Arizona or 
California. She said she had not yet decided whether she would travel to Orange 
County if he is sent there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything about which state has stiffer penalties," she said. "I 
don't know if Afghanistan would be better." 
</P>
<P>
 While she has visited her son at every opportunity since his arrest, Anna 
Famalaro said she has "seen him but I haven't talked to him. How can you talk 
to someone through glass?" 
</P>
<P>
 The morning was marked by a small stream of potential buyers, and sales were 
slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking for three cans of water-based brown paint," said a white-haired 
man who walked away empty-handed and refused to give his name. "I don't know if 
they have it or not, I just don't want to rummage through all that." 
</P>
<P>
 Two couples from Prescott Valley piled back into their station wagon almost as 
quickly as they'd gotten out when they discovered that the paint was not 
exactly free. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't say paint sale, it says paint give-away," one young man said, 
fingering the classified ad that had lured him. "We were just going to come out 
and get a few gallons and paint our trim, but now she says it's $2 a gallon! 
That's why it's all still there." 
</P>
<P>
 Incredulous, Anna Famalaro said, "I can't believe they thought it was really 
free." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was being clever. It was an advertising gimmick," she sighed. 
"Now they're mad at me. Like I don't already have enough people mad at me?"

COLUMN ONE; DEFENDING KILLER WHO SEEKS TO DIE; A LAWYER HONORS HIS CLIENT'S 
WISH TO PLEAD GUILTY IN A MURDER CASE. BUT CRITICS RISE IN ANGER, SAYING HIS 
GREATER OBLIGATION IS TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK BY FIGHTING FOR THE MAN'S LIFE.

<P>
 From the moment Summit County public defender Elliott Levine first heard about 
him, he sensed James Holland was going to be a tough client to represent. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, they'd caught him in Bonifay, Fla., guzzling beer while barreling 
85 miles an hour down Interstate 10, some 18 miles from the service station 
where he'd just pulled an armed robbery. In his car were a .38-caliber pistol, 
40 rounds of ammunition and a paper bag filled with cash. Within hours, he'd 
confessed to a string of armed robberies and two murders, one in Utah, another 
in Idaho. Within days, he'd arrived here at the Summit County Jail, extradited 
from Florida to face charges for the Utah murder. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, Levine nonetheless entertained hopes of forging a defense. 
Usually there's a twist to a client's brush with the law, an opening a good 
criminal defense attorney can parlay into a deal, if not an acquittal. My guy 
confessed under duress; my guy didn't get his Miranda rights; my guy was beaten 
up -- you could always argue something. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine's hopes, however, quickly evaporated when he finally met Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I did it, I killed him," Holland said, sitting across from Levine in a 
Summit County Jail interview room. "I talked to the sheriffs on the way up from 
Florida. Told them everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland sounded polite, reasonable, relaxed. He was lanky, 5 feet, 11 inches, 
and 152 pounds, with long sideburns and several tattoos on his hands and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine asked questions, searching for a defense. Instead, he heard ominous 
hints of other, unsolved crimes. "You really never know what's going on with 
me," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine considered. Holland had spent 35 of his 47 years behind bars, including 
22 for a second-degree murder committed in Iowa in 1964. He'd never managed to 
stay free for more than a few months. He'd also never managed to express 
remorse. The Iowa state psychiatric reports, diagnosing a "severe antisocial 
personality," had described him as "a pathetic man who has been destructive to 
life and property . . . . Constantly defensive and sensitive of being regarded 
as skinny and mild-mannered . . . . Quite uncivilized and unsocialized . . . . 
Unaccustomed to being treated like a human being." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have options," Levine said. "We can file motions. We can get ACLU-type 
groups involved. You're facing the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just get it over with," Holland said. "I did it. I want to plead 
guilty. I don't want to fight. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine liked to look into people's eyes, but when he looked into Holland's, he 
felt flat-out scared. They were the darkest he'd ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 He means it, Levine realized. This is what my client wants. I'm supposed to be 
a zealous adversary against the state, but I'm also supposed to represent my 
client's interests. What to do? 
</P>
<P>
 So began Levine's fateful descent into the tangled ethical perplexities of 
criminal defense law. At a time when high-profile defense attorneys seem 
willing to go to any length to exonerate their clients, Levine has found 
himself obliged to ponder the boundaries and obligations of his profession. How 
far to go for an obviously guilty and unremorseful client who does not wish to 
fight? Which to serve, the client's desires or the state's demands? 
</P>
<P>
 Levine eventually decided he should, above all, honor his client's wishes. 
Levine eventually decided that an unfettered adversarial stance was not always 
best. Levine eventually decided to stand silent and rest on the record when it 
came time to argue for Holland's life. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there came a moment much later when Levine deemed it fair to say, in 
a written brief, that Holland was a "prime candidate" for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the Utah legal community has risen in dismay. In recent weeks, 
lawyers have denounced Levine in public comments, formal complaints and 
appellate motions. The Utah Supreme Court has removed him from Holland's and 
another murder case. The Utah State Bar has filed a formal complaint charging 
him with violations of rules concerning competence, diligence, misconduct and 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a zealous adversary for the defense, Levine's critics fume, the system 
breaks down. No matter what the defendant wants, the defense lawyer must play 
his role. The defense attorney must argue; the defense attorney must file 
motions; the defense attorney must fight for his client's life, if not his 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Levine is not doing what a criminal defense attorney should do," declares an 
exasperated Loni Deland, past president of the Utah Assn. of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unmoved, Levine disagrees, and grows ever more defiant, even as he faces, at 
age 45, his likely undoing as a lawyer. His is a doomed, utterly impractical, 
but not incomprehensible vision of a world where lawyers sometimes stop 
battling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have," he says, "a somewhat different viewpoint of the criminal defense 
attorney's role." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was not by accident that James Holland fell into the arms of the law in 
Bonifay, Fla. By that Friday in July, 1987, he'd been trying for some time to 
get caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling across the country, he'd stand in front of security cameras and wave 
while robbing convenience stores. He'd leave fingerprints all over the place. 
He'd speed along curving mountain roads and wide-open interstates. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in Florida, he backed his car right up in front of a convenience 
store window, so the girl inside could see his license plates clearly. He laid 
his gun on the counter. He told the clerk to put the money in a sack and walk 
into the cooler. Then he roared up Interstate 10 with a beer in his hand. When 
Bonifay Police Chief Joe Roberts pulled him over, Holland was as direct and 
unguarded as could be, and not just about the armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, he said, he killed a man in Utah whom he'd met at an Idaho rest 
stop while hitchhiking along Interstate 84. A few days ago, he killed another 
man at the same rest stop. In between them, he'd committed a string of armed 
robberies from California to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland sounded relieved as he talked. He hated prison, but at least he knew 
how to live there. He didn't know how to live on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks later, Holland waived his Miranda rights and filled in the details 
of the Utah murder for the Summit County sheriff's detective who'd come to 
Florida to fetch him. Four days after that, in the Summit County Jail, Holland 
again waived his rights, this time to describe the Idaho murder to the Oneida 
County, Ida., sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 In each instance, the officers reported, Holland displayed no emotion or 
regret. "He got what he deserved for calling me a bum," Holland said of the 
Idaho victim. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Elliott Levine met him, Holland had told his story to just about 
any officer of the law who happened to pass through the Summit County sheriff's 
office. Levine soon found, however, that his client wasn't entirely 
indiscriminate with his confidences. Holland would not talk to doctors or 
psychologists. Nor would he take their tests. 
</P>
<P>
 To Levine, the question of Holland's mental competence promised the best line 
of defense. But by refusing to talk to the doctors, Holland was preventing him 
from making that case. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Holland wouldn't let him make any case. Instead, Holland talked to 
Levine for hours, looking back at his past and forward to his future with equal 
melancholy. In prison, he said, he spends 23 hours a day alone in a 5-by-7-foot 
cell. He gets out only one hour a day to walk around a yard. No one writes or 
visits. No friends, no family, no one anywhere. Locked up 35 years, he's never 
had a single letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to spend the rest of my life in prison," Holland told Levine. 
"Let's get it over with. I'm not getting out, so I might as well die." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland was right, Levine thought. He wasn't ever going to get out. He was a 
career criminal, unable to function in society. This was what you got when you 
kept someone behind bars for most of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 What did he owe the client? Levine wondered. What did he owe the system? 
</P>
<P>
 These were questions Levine had never faced before. A peripatetic background 
-- a year on a Chevrolet assembly line, law school at the University of 
Mississippi, years of meandering from one small-time law firm to another -- had 
taken Levine from Michigan to Utah, but it had never exposed him to someone 
like James Holland. At midlife Levine had a wife, a graying beard, a balding 
dome and no certain answers. He would, he realized, have to grope for the 
proper course. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, some of Levine's critics would suggest his difficulties stemmed mainly 
from his lack of experience or accomplishment in the field of criminal law, 
particularly death penalty cases. Levine was public defender in Summit County, 
they would point out, only because he offered the lowest bid for the county's 
contract. Hiring the lowest bidder was many a rural county's way of saving 
money in Utah. Before this, Levine was doing mainly divorces, collections, 
bankruptcies. What do you expect to get for a $14,000-a-year retainer? 
</P>
<P>
 "Levine lacks the time, the talent, the experience," said Loni Deland of the 
criminal defense lawyers' association. "He never was a criminal defense 
attorney in the first place. The only way he can call himself that is because 
he was lowest bidder." 
</P>
<P>
 There may be some truth in such comments, even after discounting for the 
obvious animosity against an out-of-county attorney who stole business by 
lowballing the locals -- an attorney who some in Summit County refer to 
privately as "a short, funny little guy." The fact is, even above-average 
public defenders can't serve clients nearly as well as do highly paid private 
attorneys, and nothing in Levine's legal background suggests he is above 
average. All the same, some of those most concerned about the underfunding of 
Utah public defenders say the core of the Levine brouhaha involves something 
other than that issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine agrees. He has enough time, resources and experience to do his job, he 
argues. If not overly distinguished, his legal training at the University of 
Mississippi and his legal practice for small firms in Michigan and Utah have 
seasoned him well enough. What his background has not done, he feels, is 
convince him to go around saying to clients, "I'm going to get you off." That 
just isn't always possible, he believes, or even desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 To Deland, pleading guilty to first-degree murder without a deal for leniency 
in sentencing was the definition of incompetence. To Levine, a plea bargain in 
Holland's case looked utterly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a little difficult, after all, to bargain when your client was 
regularly making it clear to his jailers that he wanted to "get it over with." 
In other circumstances, a defense attorney might be able to negotiate down to 
manslaughter or second-degree murder. But Utah had a newly adopted statute that 
essentially raised a second-degree murder to a capital crime, punishable by 
death, if the accused had a prior conviction for murder or a violent felony. 
</P>
<P>
 We can go to trial, Levine advised his client. We have nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 To Levine, Holland seemed not so much to have a death wish as an inclination 
to accept what was coming. It was sort of like having a patient in a hospital 
say he wanted no life support. Levine wasn't inclined to abandon Holland. But 
he also wasn't inclined to ignore his client's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 18, 1987, 19 days after arriving in Utah, Holland pleaded guilty to 
the murder of Sam Patt and asked for an expedited penalty hearing before a 
judge, not a jury. When that hearing began at 10:20 a.m. on Sept. 17 in the 
Summit County courthouse, it soon became clear just how adamant Holland was 
about "getting it over with." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine began by asking for a continuance. In the week before the hearing, 
Holland had finally, grudgingly, agreed to talk to clinical psychologist 
Michael D. Decaria. But the two had only met twice, for a total of 3 1/2 hours, 
the second exchange occurring just the day before. Holland had refused to take 
any psychological tests. Decaria wanted more time, particularly to explore 
information he'd just received about Holland's childhood. The prosecution did 
not object, nor did the judge. Only Holland objected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go on today, now, be done with it," he told the court. "I don't 
want to talk with (Decaria) no more, period. I want it to go today." When 
Levine began to object, Holland rose, told the jail guards, "Let's get out of 
here," and marched in shackles toward the courtroom doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Extended pleading and explanation could not sway Holland: "My desire is to 
just go ahead and get it over with and do it now and be done with it. Two or 
three weeks or a month is not going to make any difference at all. It is still 
going to be the same outcome . . . . Let them go ahead and do what they have 
got to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine clearly felt torn by two obligations. "When I came to court today," he 
told the judge, "I was put in this quandary between what Dr. Decaria was 
telling me and what Mr. Holland is telling me, and I don't want Mr. Holland to 
think that I am going against him or undercutting him in any way . . . . All I 
am saying is that I determined it is in his best interest . . . that we be 
allowed the additional time . . . . I would certainly hope that Mr. Holland 
would realize that I am still working for him . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 When Holland wouldn't bend after several recesses, Levine finally decided to 
honor his client's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is Mr. Holland's desire -- it is at his insistence that we go forward with 
the hearing today . . . " he told the court. "I would say definitely I have 
advised him fully of all the consequences . . . . Mr. Holland still desires to 
go ahead . . . . Based upon that, I will stand by Mr. Holland." 
</P>
<P>
 Called as a witness, guided by Levine, Holland for much of that afternoon 
retold the life story he'd already shared in private hours with his attorney. 
In some ways the litany was regrettably familiar, beginning with an abusive, 
alcoholic father who disappeared when Holland was 6. But as the details 
accumulated, Holland's tale grew increasingly singular. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd been sad and alone, Holland said, ever since his mother died when he was 
8. One night after he went to bed, someone woke him and told him his mom was 
dead. An auto accident. It felt to Holland like putting your finger in a light 
socket. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, his brother and two sisters were sent to one aunt and uncle's 
home, he alone to another. His aunt and uncle beat and scorned him. Every 
chance he got, he'd run off, trying to find his siblings, trying to escape the 
ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 9, his aunt and uncle put him in a reformatory, where he stayed 
until 17. From the reform school he went straight to a penitentiary, punishment 
for trying to escape. After he got out a year later, he met two boys while 
hitchhiking. They had pistols and the notion to rob a filling station. Holland 
joined them, netting $61. For that, he spent five years in the Florida state 
prison at Raiford. 
</P>
<P>
 When he got out at age 24, in 1964, he started hitchhiking again. One early 
July day that year, a fellow giving him a ride in Iowa suddenly pulled off the 
road into the woods near a river, stripped naked and insisted that Holland join 
him in a swim. When Holland declined, the fellow grabbed him by the shirt. 
Holland tripped, fell, pulled out a gun and shot five times at the man standing 
over him. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have gotten away with it, Holland explained, but when he soon after 
was caught for a robbery in Elgin, Tenn., he confessed. "It must have been just 
self-punishment," Holland said. "It was kind of weighing on me, and I just 
wanted to get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
 This time he went to prison for 22 years for second-degree murder. When he was 
released on Dec. 17, 1985, he felt lost. He had nobody to talk to, no sense of 
what to do. Get on the road, was all he could figure. He tended bar and chopped 
wood in Tennessee, picked cherries in California, then wandered back through 
Utah, confused. He couldn't relate to people; he couldn't deal with them. The 
world felt pretty crazy to him. Rolling down the interstates, he sometimes 
pulled to the side to drink whiskey and cry. Other times, he'd drive for hours, 
then turn around and drive the other way. In one month alone he covered 23,000 
miles -- up to 1,000 miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Six and a half months after his release from prison, Holland met Sam Patt at 
the Juniper rest area off Interstate 84 in Idaho. Patt was 72, an itinerant 
fruit-picker from Florida. Patt asked Holland where he was going and whether he 
had a driver's license. Would you mind driving if I give you a ride? Patt 
wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 They started south down Interstate 84, stopping in Ogden for gas, where Patt 
took over the driving. Past Ogden, the region grew dark and cold and remote. 
Patt suddenly braked, right on the interstate, and ordered Holland out of the 
car. Holland didn't want to get out. Holland drew a .32-caliber pistol from his 
waistband and laid it on his left leg. If anyone's getting out of the car, it 
will be you, he said. Patt reached for the gun with one hand, and clawed at 
Holland's face with the other. They struggled. Holland pulled the trigger five 
times, then dragged Patt's body from the car and drove off. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, he traveled to Tucson, then back to Tennessee, then to Texas, 
where he worked on an offshore oil rig for a while and later stayed with his 
brother. When his brother's criticisms started riling him, he left, scared of 
himself, scared he'd hurt his brother. He was aware, by now, that summers made 
him feel particularly irritable, restless, depressed; in summers he slept only 
an hour or two at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer after killing Patt -- in fact, precisely one year to the day after 
killing Patt -- he pulled again into the Juniper rest area. For two hours there 
he vainly tried to sell a hunting knife for gas money. He approached Karl Behm, 
a 24-year-old from Ohio, who snarled something to him like, "Get away, bum." 
This offended Holland, for he had just as nice a car and clothes as Behm. 
Holland knew instantly he was going to kill Behm. The more he thought about it, 
sitting on a rest stop bench, the madder he grew. He decided he was going to 
kill everybody in the rest area. 
</P>
<P>
 On his way to get the gun from his car, though, a lady with two children 
pulled into the rest stop. Holland couldn't hurt a lady or children, so he 
waited until they left. By then only a truck driver and Behm were still there. 
Holland was approaching the truck when the truck driver happened to pull away. 
That left Behm. Holland walked over to Behm's car and shot him through the 
window as he lay asleep in the front seat. He dragged Behm's body across the 
sidewalk into the junipers, took his wallet and drove off. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days later, he pulled the armed robbery in Bonifay, Fla., that finally 
brought him back to the relief of prison life. "That's why I went ahead and 
confessed to this murder here, I guess, just to ensure that I was in for good," 
Holland said. "It just kind of lifted a load off of you . . . . I didn't want 
to hurt anybody else . . . . I go off the deep end sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland shrugged when asked about the choice between life in prison and the 
death penalty. "I don't know," he said. "I am going to die in prison sooner or 
later anyhow. If I get the death penalty, I will just die a little sooner is 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 He could make no promises about avoiding violence in prison. "I couldn't say 
what I would do because I never know what I am going to do from one minute to 
the next." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because Decaria was known as a professional defense witness, who was 
flatly opposed to the death penalty, it apparently mattered little to Judge 
Homer F. Wilkinson when the psychologist minutes later testified that Holland's 
"extreme depression" and great longing for "relief" rendered him incompetent to 
enter a plea. After digesting the matter for two weeks, the judge announced 
Holland's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Grants Wish of Summit Killer," declared the local Salt Lake Tribune 
headline that day. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Much passion colors arguments in the legal community about just how far a 
criminal defense attorney should go with a client such as James Holland. To 
many, the issue reaches well beyond a concern for the defendant's Sixth 
Amendment right to effective counsel. To many, the need for a zealous adversary 
in the criminal defense attorney's chair arises even more out of concern for 
the workings of the legal system, and all of society. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the desire of an individual defendant, argues a host of scholars, 
jurists and lawyers, the integrity of the law as an institution must be 
sustained. At stake is the Eighth Amendment's proscription against arbitrary 
and capricious punishment. If the defense attorney does not fill his role as 
adversary, if the defense attorney is seeking the same goal as the prosecution, 
the system just doesn't work. The defendant and his attorney must fight, even 
if they don't want to. The state's interest in a just society takes precedence 
over a defendant's autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's interest, adds Utah's Chief Justice Michael Zimmerman, also takes 
precedence over public sentiment. The public probably identifies with Levine, 
Zimmerman observed recently, talking in his chambers, "because it doesn't like 
the sense of lawyers as amoral hired guns and because it sees the system 
thrashing endlessly on people who are clearly guilty . . . . There is a great 
gap between the public's sympathy for Levine and the legal community's horror. 
People don't understand the adversary role, particularly in criminal cases. 
Where the might of the state comes against an individual, then a lawyer's duty 
must be unalloyed to his client. It is a political model, not a legal one. The 
public doesn't acknowledge this, but the defendant is surrogate for you and me. 
That is why the system has to put a check on the state." 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt that is also why, after James Holland's conviction, the Utah Supreme 
Court ordered Levine to file an automatic appeal and remained unmoved when 
Holland objected in a personal letter to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I comprehend your statement that you have not authorized an appeal," Geoffrey 
Butler, clerk of the Supreme Court, wrote back to Holland. "But your 
court-appointed attorney, Mr. Elliott Levine, really has no choice. The Supreme 
Court has instructed Mr. Levine to . . . prepare the review . . . . This 
explains why Mr. Levine is proceeding without your expressed consent." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the Supreme Court wasn't impressed with Levine's appeal, 
which centered chiefly on the issue of competence. From the record, the 
justices said, it was clear the defendant was competent to assist in his 
defense and "fully knew and understood" what was going on. Nevertheless, the 
justices sent the case back for a second penalty hearing, saying the trial 
judge had not followed proper procedure in reaching his sentencing decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The second time around, doctors of all sorts managed to gain at least some 
exposure to Holland, although he still usually refused to take their tests. 
</P>
<P>
 In Idaho (where Holland was sent briefly to plead guilty to first-degree 
murder and draw a life sentence), a state clinical psychologist found him 
polite, calm, rational, stable, in control, with no convincing evidence of 
mental illness -- and no remorse. What he was, the psychologist concluded, was 
an "extremely dangerous individual" with a "severe antisocial personality 
disorder" and a "very poor" prognosis for improvement or rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Utah doctors did not disagree. Halfway through their evaluation, Utah 
State Hospital medical administrators urgently asked that Holland be 
transferred back to prison because they believed he presented "an extreme 
danger to the hospital." Members of the staff, they explained, were utterly 
frightened of this patient. 
</P>
<P>
 All the same, Dr. George J. W. Smith, the acting hospital clinical director, 
felt moved to add some unusually personal notes to his evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the interview the patient over-related to me much as the symbiotic 
child does . . . " he wrote. "I found myself developing a loving feeling for 
him . . . . I could have cried for him, as he did for himself, as he described 
the accidental death of his mother, her funeral and how he can still see her in 
her casket and frequently talks to her as if she were present." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland described his mother's death and loss, Smith wrote, "as some people 
describe religious experiences . . . . He felt as if a severe electrical shock 
had gone through him, which he has continued to experience to the present time 
and which appears to be always connected to killing or wanting to kill. It is 
almost orgastic in nature, following which he feels much relaxed and sometimes 
falls asleep. He is really quite frightened of his own impulses, begging for 
help and not understanding what it is that comes over him." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, Smith added, as soon as Holland left this revealing interview with 
him, he became "an entirely different person with an entirely different tone of 
voice . . . . As we walked among other patients, he became tense and hostile, 
speaking in a much higher pitch and rapid form of speech. He said, 'I don't 
hate any individual; I don't want to kill anybody specifically; I just hate 
society in general and want to do something about it!' " 
</P>
<P>
 It did not escape Smith's attention that Holland had committed all three of 
his murders in early July and thus might have a manic-depressive disorder 
affected by changes in season or light. Smith looked at his calender with some 
alarm. It was June 1, 1990. "This patient must be placed in a more secure 
environment just as soon as possible," he wrote to Judge Wilkinson. "As we near 
the beginning of July, his potentiality for dangerousness becomes ever 
increasingly greater!" 
</P>
<P>
 Since Smith and a court-appointed clinical psychologist thought Holland not 
competent to stand trial, Levine filed a motion to set aside Holland's guilty 
plea. Wilkinson refused, instead ordering psychiatric treatment for Holland 
while he sat in the Summit County Jail, awaiting a second penalty hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 This treatment, from Dr. Breck Lebegue, director of the Forensic Psychiatry 
Service at the University of Utah, would provide at once medical succor for 
Holland and a legal impasse for Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a period of six weeks, Lebegue reported in a letter to the judge on Jan. 
14, 1991, Holland has responded dramatically to heavy daily doses of lithium 
carbonate and Sinequan. Holland's irritability, hostility, hopelessness, 
insomnia and anxiety have decreased significantly, and his capacity for 
rational thought has sharpened considerably. He has "responded to the fullest 
extent possible to medication treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation, however, had done nothing to change Holland's mind about 
his fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Presently, he still wishes to die," Lebegue reported. "But this is not a 
symptom of nor the product of his psychiatric disease . . . . Rather, his 
desire to die is an existential choice based on the significant misery he has 
experienced in life, and on a preference for death as punishment for his crime, 
rather than life imprisonment. He is quite familiar with the circumstances of 
imprisonment, and does not choose to continue to exist under those 
circumstances . . . . My knowledge of Mr. Holland is derived from many 
interviews . . . . Mr. Holland's mental state is presently as calm and 
non-depressed as I have ever seen him . . . . His decision is not the result of 
depressive suicidal hopelessness, but rather a rational decision to accept the 
sentence of the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, Lebegue's judgment substantively reduced Levine's chance of 
putting on an effective defense. Other doctors might be regarded by the judge 
as hired guns with axes to grind, but Lebegue was a highly respected, 
board-certified specialist in forensic psychiatry. When the second penalty 
hearing began in Coalville one month later, on the morning of Feb. 14, 1991, 
the Summit County prosecutor simply entered Dr. Lebegue's letter into evidence, 
then rested his case. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine in response tried briefly to mention Holland's bad physical reaction to 
medication two weeks before, involving episodes of shaking, but Holland stopped 
him. "Mr. Levine . . . " Holland interrupted. "I'm the only person that knows 
what happened, so how can you outline it? Just drop it . . . . I am as 
competent as anybody in this room . . . . My hands still shake. But there isn't 
nothing shaky about my mind . . . . I want to get it over and done with." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine now stood at the edge of a nebulous legal wilderness. He could not look 
to Utah for exact precedents. The closest model came in California, where the 
state Supreme Court in 1985 held that an attorney who acquiesced to his 
client's request not to present mitigating evidence failed to effectively 
represent the client. But more recent California decisions, noting the defense 
attorney's "unenviable and wrenching choice" and "paramount duty of loyalty to 
the client," have explicitly rejected the notion that defense counsel should be 
forced to present mitigating evidence over a client's objections. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, in California and elsewhere, judges on occasion have appointed a 
third party to investigate and offer mitigating evidence once the defense 
counsel rises to say his client declines to do so. Even here, though, there is 
dispute. To require a defense attorney to rise in this manner, some argue, is 
to require him to acknowledge that mitigating evidence exists. The defendant, 
through the mouth of his attorney, is in this way being required by the state 
to say what he does not want to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's in charge? Levine wondered. Was he merely a puppet in the state court 
system, an actor reading a script? Can the system always require him to push 
back when the defendant doesn't want to push back? Can they orchestrate the 
whole thing, write the script, and call you unethical if you don't follow it? 
Must he play the game as the courts want? 
</P>
<P>
 Levine thought about Holland's abiding sadness. Maybe there was more comfort 
for Holland on the other side. Who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 Levine's critics would later wonder how a lawyer could decide that his client 
should die. How can you not argue mitigating evidence? What of the doctors who 
thought Holland had suffered for years from an untreated manic-depressive 
illness -- wasn't that worth pursuing? Even if your client is competent and 
responsible, even if you don't want to defy him, how can you side with the 
state? You should instead withdraw; you should instead just refuse to represent 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the Summit County courtroom at Holland's second penalty hearing, 
Levine saw matters differently. Wilkinson had heard all the evidence the first 
time around and now had the transcript of that session, along with the current 
medical reports. Levine felt he'd said all he could. 
</P>
<P>
 How many motions do you file, how many objections do you raise? People always 
complain that the legal system drags on, especially in death penalty cases, 
because defense attorneys just never stop. Levine more or less agreed. Arguing 
that your client's mama ruined his synapses by giving him too much cocoa when 
he was a baby -- that went too far. It seemed to Levine that defense attorneys 
sometimes let their egos and ambitions get the best of them. It seemed to 
Levine that defense attorneys sometimes ignored ethical boundaries in their 
drive to win at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
 If he withdrew, who would represent Holland; who would honor his wishes? He 
had to defer to Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I said initially . . . it's Mr. Holland's desire to submit the matter to 
the court based upon the transcripts . . . " Levine finally told the court. "As 
far as our obligation to point out to the court any mitigating circumstances, I 
feel that the transcript from the last sentencing contains exactly the same 
information that I would . . . present to the court today . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the prosecutor's incomplete account of the murder -- he failed to 
mention that Holland shot Patt only after the victim grabbed for and struggled 
over a gun -- altered Levine's course. "Your honor, I waive any response," he 
said when the prosecutor finished his closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson needed no time to contemplate his decision. "The court does . . . 
impose the death penalty upon the defendant," he announced when the lawyers had 
finished. "The penalty should be carried out by a firing squad or the 
administering of lethal intravenous injection, that being at the option of the 
defendant. Mr. Levine, is Mr. Holland prepared to make a selection?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It don't make no difference," Holland answered for himself. "It doesn't make 
any difference to me which way I go. I'll leave that up to the court." 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT: Levine pleads another murderer guilty.

U.S., ALLIES BACKTRACK ON USE OF FORCE AGAINST SERBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher and four European counterparts meted out 
a diplomatic wrist slap Saturday to the Bosnian Serbs after the nationalist 
rebels had rejected a last-chance peace plan, killed a U.N. soldier, reimposed 
a blockade of Sarajevo and fired on aid flights. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign ministers of the five-power Contact Group had billed their meeting 
here as a get-tough session aimed at punishing any Bosnian faction blocking the 
path to peace. 
</P>
<P>
 But differences among the mediating nations over how to deal with the latest 
spate of Serbian aggression compelled them to retreat to a symbolic tightening 
of leaky economic sanctions against the rebels' backers in Belgrade, leaving 
the deadliest crisis in Europe in half a century to be dealt with another day. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic backtracking from threats to punish Serbian intransigence also 
risked diminishing the credibility of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
which had vowed to bomb Serbian gun emplacements, munitions factories and 
supply lines unless the rebels ceased attacks on U.N. troops and Bosnian 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 What emerged from the gathering of five of the most militarily powerful 
nations in the world was a collective recognition that they are unwilling to 
resort to armed force to persuade any Balkan belligerents to respect the 
principles and decisions of the community of nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made a decision not to seek to impose a solution," Christopher replied 
when asked if the great powers deemed themselves incapable of forcing an end to 
the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd emphatically insisted that the Contact 
Group, consisting of the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, is 
powerless to do more than exert economic pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is this assumption that the international community or the Contact 
Group has the power to impose solutions. I don't think the United States or 
anyone has that power," Hurd said at a press conference after the ministerial 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Christopher and the European statesmen threatened a 
military response if the Serbs spurned their plan for a partition of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which they unveiled in the first week of July and cast as a 
take-it-or-leave-it formula for restoring peace to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-led Bosnian government endorsed the proposal that would nominally 
retain an independent Bosnia while ceding half its territory to the control of 
Serbian separatists. The Serbs rejected the plan nearly two weeks ago and 
reiterated their opposition last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels, led by nationalist warlord Radovan Karadzic, had been warned that 
they might face NATO air attacks if they rejected the plan. They were also 
warned of the possibility that the five nations might support lifting a U.N. 
arms embargo that has prevented the Sarajevo government from acquiring weapons 
to defend itself against the heavily armed Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the face of Russian reluctance to take action against the Serbs and 
concern among the French and British that their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia 
might be subjected to Serbian reprisals, the foreign ministers decided only to 
reaffirm their support for economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The diplomats did agree to propose a resolution to the U.N. Security Council, 
probably this week, aimed at closing a few loopholes in the existing sanctions, 
such as blocking financial remittances from offshore activities to the 
government of rump Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serb-dominated Yugoslav regime has armed and supplied the Bosnian Serbs 
throughout their 27-month-old campaign to conquer territory for a Greater 
Serbia. Belgrade also backed Serbian separatists in Croatia who seized 
one-third of that country in a 1991 rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite more than two years of severe economic sanctions levied against his 
country, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has shown no sign of readiness to 
pinch off the supply lines to his proxy warriors in Bosnia and Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher and the Europeans raised the prospect of future NATO air strikes 
to enforce weapons exclusion zones proclaimed around Sarajevo, the Bosnian 
capital, and the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde, both of which have been 
repeatedly violated over the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs' history of violation with impunity appeared to make it unlikely 
they would take the latest vague threats any more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev made clear his country's continued 
opposition to air strikes, warning that the Russian contingent of the U.N. 
peacekeeping force in the Balkans would be withdrawn if NATO nations decided to 
bomb Serbian weapons that are violating the exclusion zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministers repeatedly sought to present their actions to tighten sanctions 
as firm resolve to bring the Serbian rebels into compliance. They portrayed 
their agreement on the symbolic measures as a great success, emphasizing the 
importance of unity among the five powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even U.S. officials who had pressed for a forceful response to provocative 
Serbian actions of the past week executed a diplomatic backpedaling to renounce 
the use of force to pressure the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nature of this process is to get a 'yes' from the Serbs (on the partition 
formula) and to produce a negotiated settlement. It's not punishment for 
punishment's sake," said one senior U.S. official, insisting the mediators must 
"keep the door open" for a Serbian change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said he was convinced by Kozyrev, who was en route to Belgrade 
after the Geneva meeting, that the Bosnian Serbs might eventually accept the 
peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 As an inducement to the holdouts, the foreign ministers plan to couple their 
proposals for stricter economic sanctions against Serbia with assurances that 
the punitive measures will be suspended if the Bosnian Serbs comply with the 
peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the European ministers suggested the relief would be immediate, 
Christopher said it would be a "phased" lifting of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials fear that Karadzic's followers might agree to the peace formula 
to get sanctions removed from their patrons in Belgrade and then refuse to 
abide by provisions requiring them to withdraw from areas they have cleared of 
Muslims and Croats.

STAKES GROW IN BATTLE OVER REGULATION OF CARD CLUBS; GAMBLING: SHOULD STATE SET 
UP A GAMING COMMISSION? CASINOS, CITIES, RACETRACKS AND NATIVE AMERICANS ENTER 
FRAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moments before landing at Los Angeles International Airport, millions of 
airline passengers soon will see one of the largest neon signs in the world 
boldly promoting a Las Vegas-style casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly the size of the famous Hollywood sign, the red neon lights will 
advertise from the rooftop of the newest card club in California -- the 
Hollywood Park Casino. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will certainly be a nice beacon for the pilots," said casino Chairman 
Eddie LeBaron, the former football star. 
</P>
<P>
 But this beacon is more than a symbol of one casino's effort to put itself on 
the map. It is a sign of the dramatic growth that is transforming the state's 
once-small card clubs into palatial casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 A battle is now raging in the Legislature about whether to establish the 
state's first gaming commission to oversee an industry in which more money 
changes hands than in the state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 California is the only state where the primary control of card clubs rests at 
the local level, usually with small cities that are heavily dependent on card 
room taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervision by the state attorney general's office, which runs the Gaming 
Registration Program, is so weak that officials call it a "toothless tiger." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Gaming Registration Act is woefully inadequate to prevent and control the 
potential of crime and corruption in California card rooms," said Atty. Gen. 
Dan Lungren, the leading advocate for the creation of a gaming commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials said the state has been hampered by skeletal 
staffing, weak oversight of cash-rich casino operations, and an inability to 
swiftly revoke the licenses of card clubs where criminal activity has been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 But George Hardie, general manager of the Bicycle Club Casino in Bell Gardens, 
said criticism of the card club industry is overblown. "Gambling has always 
been a favorite whipping boy of the press and politicians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last decade, some of the state's largest card casinos have been 
tarnished by political corruption, profit skimming, hidden ownership interests, 
tax law violations and other illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 There also have been weaknesses in the state's regulatory system, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, records show, the mastermind behind the kidnaping of singer 
Frank Sinatra Jr. in 1963 played a key role at one of California's biggest 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers, Barry Worthington Keenan said he handled various real estate 
and gaming ventures for the Commerce Casino. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consultant, a special assistant and director of development for the club 
from 1988 to 1992, Keenan said, he had a master passkey to the casino just off 
the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 What Keenan did not have was a state gaming registration. 
</P>
<P>
 A casino spokesman confirmed that until Keenan was terminated in December, 
1992, he served as an assistant to the club president. But he said Keenan was 
an independent contractor with no direct control over gambling so he did not 
need to be registered. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was it likely that Keenan could have been registered, state officials 
said, because he is an ex-felon who served four years in federal prison for 
kidnaping the younger Sinatra from a Lake Tahoe casino in December, 1963. 
Sinatra was released several days later after his father paid a $240,000 
ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said Keenan never applied for a state gaming registration. 
Keenan, who settled a wrongful termination suit against the club last year, 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollman Cheung, operator of Asian games at the nearby Bicycle Club Casino, 
also was not registered. 
</P>
<P>
 For seven years, Cheung ran the club's most lucrative games as a consultant 
until his indictment in March on federal loan sharking and extortion charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say Cheung, who was indicted last year on federal charges related to 
a separate gold bullion enterprise, had been denied state registration. But he 
continued to operate the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such problems, card clubs have proved increasingly attractive to some 
financially struggling cities that see gaming as a source of jobs and tax 
revenues to pay for police and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Jose, the Bay 101 Club is poised to become one of the largest casinos 
in Northern California after a long fight to win state registration. 
</P>
<P>
 On the outskirts of San Francisco, Colma plans to build a casino to bolster 
the finances of a town where the residents are outnumbered by the dead in local 
cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the bay, officials in Albany, faced with a deep budget deficit, are 
encouraging operators of Golden Gate Fields to add a Hollywood Park-style 
casino. Voters in nearby San Pablo recently endorsed plans for a major card 
club in their community. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fowler, just outside Fresno, the thirst for card club dollars is so strong 
that the police chief drove a casino promoter's license application to 
Sacramento for processing. 
</P>
<P>
 But efforts to open casinos in the Orange County communities of Cypress, 
Stanton and Westminster have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition has been led by Orange County law enforcement officials and the 
operators of some Los Angeles County casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael Capizzi has warned that casinos are magnets 
for crime because they handle huge amounts of cash. "If they're such a good 
neighbor," Capizzi said, "let's leave them in the neighboring county." 
</P>
<P>
 In Palm Springs, the City Council this week will consider placing a card club 
measure on the November ballot. The proposal has infuriated a local Indian 
tribe with plans of its own to build a casino on reservation land in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Card casinos also have been proposed in the San Gabriel Valley cities of 
Pomona, South El Monte, Irwindale and Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of the clubs in the 1980s mirrors an influx of Asian immigrants, 
especially in Southern California and the Bay Area, where the Asian games of 
pai gow and super pan nine attract crowds around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry and law enforcement officials also say the growth of card casinos is 
being spurred by a widespread belief that full-scale gambling, including slot 
machines and other illegal games of chance, someday will come to California 
cities. Casinos on Indian reservations are running slots and video gambling 
machines, although their legality is being contested in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office has been flooded with applications for licensing 
more than 20 new casinos. "It's a fast freight train out of control," said 
Debbie Wiley, manager of the gaming registration program. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 265 card rooms, the vast majority with only a few tables. 
But from humble beginnings in the smoky back rooms of bars and pool halls, a 
number of card clubs have grown into latter-day poker palaces that look and 
feel like Nevada's casinos. The Commerce Casino has 200 gaming tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources estimate that as much as $7.5 billion is wagered in 
California clubs each year, more than three times the betting on the California 
lottery. But hard numbers are difficult to come by. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Nevada, players in California card clubs do not play against the house, 
which is illegal here. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs earn their money by renting seats or charging players a fee for each 
hand played. The largest now collect more than $90 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the biggest casinos are in Los Angeles County, where more than 40% of 
the state's 1,715 gaming tables can be found. The clubs have taken root in 
unlikely places -- small cities such as Gardena and Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the prospect of millions of tax dollars that has sparked the interest of 
cities hard hit by recession and declining state support. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1992 riots, Inglewood officials embraced the prospect of a glitzy 
casino adjoining the Hollywood Park grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
 Promises of more than 2,000 jobs, up to $10 million a year in casino taxes and 
a site for a new police headquarters proved irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 The $25-million Art Deco casino is the nation's only card club at a racetrack. 
Owing to its unique location, bets on certain horse races can be placed legally 
from the casino's 150 gaming tables. 
</P>
<P>
 A 300-seat sports lounge with a vast bank of TV screens beckons fans, but not 
sports betting, which is illegal. Players can partake in a health club, massage 
room, barber shop and beauty parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest-stakes games are played in exclusive rooms off the main floor. The 
cashier offers players safe deposit boxes and club bank accounts to reduce the 
risk of follow-home robberies that officials say have occasionally occurred at 
some clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a club can be established, a vote of the community is required by the 
state's 1984 Gaming Registration Act, unless the city had a gaming ordinance 
prior to passage of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, card club interests have spent millions of dollars waging 
hard-fought political campaigns for and against casino proposals. Most have 
gone down in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood was an exception. Hollywood Park spent more than $480,000 in 1992 to 
convince voters that the casino would benefit the city, records show. The 
track's campaign contributions to Inglewood politicians also climbed. 
</P>
<P>
 By narrowly approving the casino, Inglewood voters rejected warnings that the 
club would worsen problems with drugs, gangs and prostitution. Ironically, 
those warnings were spread by rival casinos, particularly the Bicycle Club, 
which spent more than $80,000 on an ill-fated effort to prevent establishment 
of a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 In elections and city council hearings throughout Southern California, the 
case of card club opponents was bolstered by the history of corruption at some 
casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bicycle Club was built in part with $12 million in laundered drug money 
from Florida. The U.S. government seized the club in April, 1990, and still 
owns a controlling interest. 
</P>
<P>
 In City of Commerce and Bell, city officials were sentenced to federal prison 
a decade ago for awarding city licenses to clubs in which they had hidden 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, during a state investigation of profit skimming, the California Bell 
Club in Bell closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Its successor, the Regency Card Club and Casino shut down in 1992 during a 
state investigation into the ownership and management. The club's owner fled 
the country, and the city was forced into a financial crisis that caused 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the largest club in Northern California, the Garden City Club in 
San Jose, were forced to give up control last year after pleading guilty to 59 
felony charges, including skimming, tax evasion and illegal campaign 
contributions. The owners agreed to pay a $5-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
 In the East Bay town of Emeryville, the wife of a proposed owner of the King 
Midas Club was arrested in December, 1990, after paying a $20,000 bribe to a 
state agent to expedite a gaming registration. She pleaded guilty, and her 
husband fled to Hong Kong, according to an attorney general's report. 
</P>
<P>
 To many law enforcement officials, this history underscores the importance of 
tightening state regulation of casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing system is flawed, Atty. Gen. Lungren said, because communities 
may have a built-in conflict of interest when it comes to controlling card 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't question the . . . honesty or the integrity of local jurisdictions," 
Lungren said. "I'm just saying that it's a pretty heavy thing to require them 
to . . . try to police and regulate an operation that may be . . . the 
lifeblood of their community." 
</P>
<P>
 But local officials defend their regulatory efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing I'm going to tolerate is illegal operations in the club," Bell 
Gardens City Manager Charles G. Gomez said. "I don't want to ruin that little 
pot of gold we have there that is feeding us money every month." 
</P>
<P>
 For this community on the Long Beach Freeway, the casino means survival. Bell 
Gardens received more than $10.3 million from the Bicycle Club in the last 
fiscal year, amounting to 60% of the city's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said the city audits the casino and checks the background of its 
employees. "Our police chief meets every week with security people in the 
club," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce City Administrator Lou Shepard defends his city's regulation of its 
biggest taxpayer, the Commerce Casino. 
</P>
<P>
 The city collects more than $12.1 million, nearly 40% of its general fund, 
from the casino. Audits ensure that the city is getting its full share of 
gambling revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "If local government doesn't have the resources and ability to regulate this 
industry, then local government doesn't have the ability to regulate anything," 
Shepard said. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged the conviction of the four City of Commerce officials on 
corruption charges in 1984 was "very much a black mark in the city's history." 
Since then, he said, the city has put a comprehensive system of regulation in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 The card club business is not the only industry that has suffered from 
corruption, Shepard said, noting that savings and loan institutions, banks and 
the securities industry all have experienced scandal. "There is not one 
industry that has not been subject to illegal acts of individuals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Lungren has been attempting to win approval of a bill to 
establish a state gaming commission, patterned after Nevada's. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said state law is too weak to ensure that clubs remain free from 
criminal activity. And other law enforcement agencies have echoed his concern. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Treasury Department warned in a confidential March, 1993, report that 
Asian organized crime groups are using card clubs to facilitate criminal 
activities, including money laundering, narcotics trafficking and loan 
sharking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lacking a gaming commission, and with minimal law enforcement resources 
assigned to the problem, the state of California is unable to monitor and 
regulate the activities of card clubs," said the report by the department's 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. "Without increased regulation of the card 
clubs, the criminal activities will likely continue to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency urged that consideration be given to strengthening licensing 
requirements, conducting more thorough background investigations of owners and 
employees, and imposing strict record- keeping requirements to guard against 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you have such huge sums of money flowing through such an 
organization, you have to be very vigilant to guard against illegal activity," 
said former U.S. Atty. Terree A. Bowers in Los Angeles. California needs 
"appropriate supervision and monitoring to ensure all of these new enterprises 
remain untainted by criminal activity." 
</P>
<P>
 The gaming commission legislation by Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg 
(D-Sacramento) is the focal point of a lobbying battle among local governments, 
Nevada casinos, California card clubs, racetracks and Native American tribes 
operating casinos on reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) has voiced opposition to the 
legislation, saying it is unnecessary and would make Lungren the "gambling czar 
of the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
 After the legislation passed the Assembly by one vote last month, Brown ally 
John Burton (D-San Francisco) invoked a procedure to have the bill 
reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would create a seven-member California Gaming Control Commission 
with three members appointed by the governor, two by the Assembly Speaker, and 
two by the Senate Rules Committee. The commission would license casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the attorney general's office would have the power to investigate 
and license owners and other key officials, as well as to monitor gambling 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, publicly traded corporations such as some Nevada casinos 
would be allowed to operate card rooms in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The state program would be financed by a fee on each gaming table, depending 
on the size of the club. Local governments would continue to have the option of 
adopting their own regulations and imposing their own casino taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Inglewood City Manager Paul D. Eckles expressed concern that the 
state might usurp the city's ability to collect casino taxes in the future. 
"We're a little bit wary about the state sticking its nose in our tent," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's major card clubs agree on the need for more regulation and a 
gaming commission of some description, said Hollywood Park Casino general 
manager Tom Bowling Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our industry believes in regulation. Our industry historically has shown that 
regulation is healthy. We are a cash-flow business," said Bowling, a former 
executive director of the California Card Club Assn. "We want to be a 
respected, clean form of the entertainment complex of the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Bowling said, there are "very valid, differing opinions as far as what 
form that regulation or regulating body should take." A Growing Business

 Here are the 10 biggest card casinos in California. There are about 1,715 
gaming tables statewide, with 42% of the tables in Los Angeles County. Although 
the amount that card clubs contribute varies widely, some casinos are the 
largest taxpayers in their communities. 05,24,15,08,15,08 INCOME % OF CARD CLUB

<P>
 Betting on card and dice games has been a part of California history since the 
Gold Rush days. By the turn of the century, a dozen games had been outlawed, 
including 21, roulette, fan-tan and hokey-pokey. Nearly a hundred years later, 
the state's gambling law remains basically intact. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's legal: Since California prohibits only specific games of chance, this 
allowed the introduction in the 1980s of the Asian games of Pai Gow and Super 
Pan 9, which resembles baccarat. A new variation of blackjack called California 
Aces or 22 also is legal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Card clubs: Players in California card clubs can bet only against each 
other, not against the house. Card clubs make their money by charging players a 
fee per hand or renting seats at poker tables. 
</P>
<P>
 * Neighbor state: In Nevada, all gambling is illegal, except for certain games 
played in licensed casinos. Slot machines, video gambling devices, blackjack, 
craps, and a number of games prohibited in California card clubs are hallmarks 
of Silver State casinos.

CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN PUSH MEETS 'SHOW ME' STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton came here Saturday to begin what aides described as a final 
push to build support for universal health care. The crowd that met him in 
front of the Harry S. Truman Courthouse made it clear just how far he still 
must go. 
</P>
<P>
 Leave aside the hundreds of well-organized opponents -- some wearing Rush 
Limbaugh T-shirts and bearing anti-abortion placards -- who lined the streets 
and surrounded the perimeter of the President's rally with a distant roar of 
protest as he exhorted the crowd to "finish Harry Truman's fight" for universal 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's real problem is not them but people like Kim Woods and Judy Barlow, 
unionized auto workers from a nearby Ford plant in Claycomo, Mo., who, despite 
having stood in the sun for more than five hours awaiting Clinton's arrival, 
said they remain uncertain about his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to wait and see; I want to see what he says," Woods said. "I've got 
pretty good health coverage, but my kids (ages 17 to 30) don't. It's a question 
of how much am I going to have to give up to get my boys covered." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing better underlines the depth of the problem facing the President: At 
this late date, he must still persuade active members of a union, the United 
Auto Workers, that has campaigned for national health insurance since its late 
president, Walter Reuther, began to push the subject more than 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harry Truman would say: 'The buck stops here.' The buck stops in Congress and 
the buck stops with you," Clinton told the crowd. But so far, many seem 
reluctant to take up that challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite more than a year of work, Clinton's aides concede -- and polls confirm 
-- that his Administration has yet to persuade the main potential beneficiaries 
of their plan -- particularly lower-income workers and the elderly -- that this 
time a government program will really help them. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponents, on the other hand, have no doubt about what Clinton has in mind 
and are firm in their dislike of it. 
</P>
<P>
 As the most recent Times Poll showed, lower-income Americans typically say 
they understand much less about the details of the opposing health care plans 
than do those who are better off. And those with higher incomes are far less 
likely to support a government-backed universal health care plan than are 
members of lower-income working families. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides hope that as the seemingly endless debate gives way to final 
congressional votes, the public support they have been lacking will 
crystallize. "It's like the (National Basketball Assn.)," said Clinton's 
pollster, Stanley B. Greenberg. "A lot of people don't pay attention until the 
playoffs. That's where we are." 
</P>
<P>
 If potential Clinton supporters now begin to tune in, and if they actually 
support the sort of plan Clinton and congressional Democrats want, the shift 
will come not a moment too soon. "It's almost over," said one White House 
official. "We have two weeks left." 
</P>
<P>
 As the final phase of the debate begins to fall into place, Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) called a press conference in Washington to denounce 
the latest health plan put forward Friday by Clinton's allies in the Democratic 
congressional leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan represents "even more government" than Clinton's original proposal, 
Dole said, pointing to its provision to create a new Medicare Part C, intended 
to cover millions of people without access to workplace-based insurance, such 
as part-time and seasonal workers and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a hitch has developed that threatens to further delay plans by 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) to introduce his own health 
care reform proposal early this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem involves technicalities of legislative drafting that could require 
time-consuming rewriting by congressional staff members, according to Sheila 
Burke, Dole's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 As currently drafted, Dole said, the legislative language "has no resemblance 
to the Finance Committee bill that people thought they were passing, and there 
may be some effort not to file that bill until it's reconciled with what many 
people who voted for it thought it contained." 
</P>
<P>
 Out on the road, however, Clinton, accompanied by his wife, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton; Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper; country music singer 
Willie Nelson and dozens of supporters who have been riding a bus from Oregon 
to Washington, D.C., eschewed such fine points. Their rally was designed to try 
to draw the distinctions between the President's plan and the opposition in the 
simplest possible terms: fear against hope, us against them. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges that have been made against his plan, Clinton said, are the same 
as those made against President Truman when he tried to get Congress to pass 
national health insurance in 1945, 1947 and 1949. And they are the same as 
those leveled against President Lyndon B. Johnson when he pushed for Medicare 
in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 To drive home the point, rally organizers brought out a Truman impersonator to 
deliver one of the late President's speeches denouncing "reactionary 
Republicans" for their opposition to his health plan. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was his turn, Clinton exhorted the crowd with one of his favorite 
messages: the importance of being open to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think about your own life," he said. "Every time you've been asked to change, 
you may have a mixture of hope and fear. And the real test every time is: Are 
your fears going to overtake you, and are you going to give in, or are you 
going to live by your hopes and your courage and charge forward?" 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by many in the crowd, however, that argument may be premature. Health 
care reform did have some ardent supporters here, but for many of them, 
Clinton's plan is merely an achievable substitute for what they would really 
like -- a Canadian-style, government-run health plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of ardor, Clinton's proposals -- and those of congressional Democratic 
leaders, who have done their best to distance themselves from Clinton even as 
they support him -- seem to draw a mix of emotions that run from cautious hope 
to confusion to strong opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the contrast between Mark Schuler, 39, and Melinda Clarke, 31, 
standing a few yards apart as they waited to get into the rally on Independence 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuler is the sort of person one might expect to oppose Clinton's plan -- a 
manager at Kansas City Power & Light, a Republican, a conservative. His remarks 
fit his demographic profile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very much opposed," he said. "I don't think the government has the right 
to mandate how much business should spend on health care. I think this plan is 
being ramrodded through Congress. It's a federal power grab." 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke, by contrast, is the sort of person from whom Clinton might expect 
support. "I don't like private health systems," she said, explaining that her 
family has twice in the last year had to change doctors because her husband's 
insurance changed. "I think it stinks," she said of the current system. "I just 
don't know where I'm going." 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked what she thinks of Clinton's plan, she replied: "I'd like to 
hear a lot more about it. I'm just not sold. There are just a lot of questions 
I have, and I think it's moving awful quick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Clinton," she added. "But I didn't vote for him. Actually, I've never 
voted. I'm really here to see Willie Nelson."

TRANSCRIPTS REVEAL NEW DETAILS IN SIMPSON CASE; INVESTIGATION: EX-BOYFRIEND OF 
NICOLE SIMPSON TOLD GRAND JURY OF DEFENDANT'S INTIMIDATING BEHAVIOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of pages of grand jury transcripts in the O.J. Simpson investigation 
reveal new details about how police and prosecutors scrambled to put together a 
case against the superstar athlete -- weaving together preliminary DNA tests, 
testimony and other evidence, but reeling when one of their witnesses sold her 
story to a tabloid television show. 
</P>
<P>
 The transcripts offer a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the 20-member 
grand jury, which was dismissed from the Simpson case because jurors had been 
exposed to the enormous publicity surrounding it. The newly released documents 
also provide several nuggets of information that have not been revealed in the 
public court hearings involving the June 12 killings of Nicole Brown Simpson 
and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded "absolutely 100% not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the disclosures contained in the 460-page grand jury transcript, 
obtained last week after it was unsealed by a Superior Court judge: 
</P>
<P>
 * A police criminalist testified that DNA analysis known as PCR tests 
determined that blood samples from Simpson's car and the foyer of his house 
were consistent with his blood, as were droplets leading away from the murder 
scene. A glove discovered at his Brentwood mansion contained a mix of DNA 
markers that were consistent with blood from the two victims and Simpson, a 
police analyst testified, calling it a "possible mixture." The test results for 
the glove were not conclusive, however, and PCR tests are not as definitive as 
more rigorous DNA analysis that is now being conducted on the samples. 
</P>
<P>
 * A restaurateur named Keith D. Zlomsowitch testified that O.J. Simpson 
threatened and intimidated him when he began dating Simpson's ex-wife in 1992, 
and that the former football star once spied on him and Nicole Simpson through 
a window as they were having an intimate encounter on a couch. Zlomsowitch's 
testimony almost certainly would create a significant legal debate if 
prosecutors attempted to have him take the stand in Simpson's trial, experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The medical examiner who examined the bodies told grand jurors that all the 
wounds to both victims could have been caused by a single knife. That same 
doctor later testified at Simpson's preliminary hearing that two weapons could 
have been used, a statement seized upon by the football Hall of Famer's lawyers 
to suggest that there could have been multiple assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 * A police expert, Dennis K. Fung, testified that blood was recovered from a 
sink in Simpson's bathroom and that evidence at the scene of the crime 
suggested that the assailant did not run but rather walked away from the murder 
scene, dripping blood. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Santa Monica resident named Jill Shively testified that Simpson "turned 
around and glared at me" after almost hitting her car with his Ford Bronco just 
after the killings were committed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shively testimony might have dramatically bolstered the prosecution case 
by presenting an eyewitness who allegedly saw Simpson in the neighborhood where 
the killings occurred. But Shively misled prosecutors when she told them she 
had not spoken to anyone else except her mother about what she had seen. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she had sold an interview to a television tabloid show for $5,000 and 
had done the interview before she testified for the grand jury on June 21. When 
prosecutors discovered that, they were furious. They called her back to the 
grand jury a second time and pointedly inquired about her television 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark, Shively acknowledged 
that she had misled prosecutors but said she had not meant to do anything 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am, I was nervous and hadn't slept all week and wasn't really thinking," 
she said. "I wasn't trying to hide anything because I knew it was being aired 
the next day, and I assumed I would be involved in the trial, so I wasn't doing 
anything to break the trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with that embarrassment, prosecutors elected to drop Shively from 
the case altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must ask you to completely disregard the statements given and the testimony 
given by Jill Shively in this case," Clark told grand jurors. "I cannot allow 
her to be part of this case now that she has proven to be untruthful as to any 
aspect of her statement." 
</P>
<P>
 Having dropped Shively from the grand jury proceedings, prosecutors elected 
not to call her during the preliminary hearing. As a result, the grand jury 
transcripts offer the only look at her sworn testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Zlomsowitch also has yet to testify in any open court hearing, and his account 
is potentially explosive, portraying Simpson as intimidating and threatening 
toward him and Nicole Simpson, with whom he was romantically linked for about a 
month in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 During his time before the grand jury, Zlomsowitch, director of operations for 
the Brentwood restaurant Mezzaluna, related a series of chilling stories with a 
common theme: that O.J. Simpson became intensely jealous and angry when he saw 
his ex-wife with another man. All the reputed incidents Zlomsowitch described 
occurred in the spring of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The two first met in Aspen, Colo., in January, 1992, Zlomsowitch testified. 
Soon after arriving in California a few months later, he added, he got together 
with Nicole Simpson and several of her friends at the Mezzaluna in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 As they were sitting at their table, Zlomsowitch continued, Simpson entered 
the restaurant and came over. "He leaned over our table, rested his hands on 
the table and sort of stared at myself and the other male individual at the 
table and introduced himself as Mr. O.J. Simpson and replied: 'I'm O.J. 
Simpson, and she's still my wife.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Zlomsowitch said he felt "very intimidated" and said Nicole Simpson, who was 
then legally separated from the former football star, seemed quite upset. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, at a newly opened Westside eatery called Tryst, Nicole Simpson 
and Zlomsowitch and some friends had just been seated when Simpson abruptly 
entered the restaurant, Zlomsowitch testified. He said O.J. Simpson strode by 
their table, seated himself nearby, turned his chair 180 degrees and stared at 
their party for eight to 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This actually was so uncomfortable that one of the guests at our party felt 
so shaken she got up and left the restaurant," Zlomsowitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clark asked him how Nicole responded, Zlomsowitch said: "She was very, 
very nervous, very uncomfortable and shaken." 
</P>
<P>
 Those disconcerting encounters were followed by a third, more explosive one, 
Zlomsowitch said. After an evening at a comedy club and then dancing, 
Zlomsowitch said, he and Nicole Simpson returned to her home in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got to the house, we lit a few candles, put on a little music, poured a 
glass of wine and we sat on the couch in the downstairs living room of the 
house and we began to become intimate," he testified. After a few hours, Nicole 
Simpson went to bed and Zlomsowitch went home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next day, Zlomsowitch said, he returned to her place and was giving 
her a neck massage when the two were startled to look up and see O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Zlomsowitch and Nicole Simpson were fully clothed, Zlomsowitch said. But 
Simpson was livid, according to Zlomsowitch's testimony: "He said: 'I can't 
believe it. I can't believe it. Look what you are doing. Look what you are 
doing. The kids are right out here by the pool. Look what you guys are doing.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Zlomsowitch said Simpson then sat down next to them and declared: " 'I watched 
you last night. I can't believe you would do that in the house. I watched you. 
. . . I saw everything you did.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Zlomsowitch -- who said Simpson spoke with his ex-wife privately and then came 
back to extend his hand and say, "No hard feelings . . . You understand, you 
know, I'm a very proud man" -- could prove a powerful witness if allowed to 
testify at Simpson's upcoming trial, legal experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Childs, chief spokeswoman for Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, said Saturday 
that it would be premature to say whether Zlomsowitch will be called as a 
witness by the prosecution. If prosecutors do try to call Zlomsowitch, experts 
predicted that a major legal battle would ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 Myrna Raeder, a Southwestern University law professor, predicted "a real fight 
over this testimony." Peter Arenella, a UCLA criminal law professor, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, California law prohibits the prosecution from introducing 
evidence of a defendant's prior bad acts or bad character to support the 
inference that the defendant committed the charged offense," Arenella said. 
"However, the California Evidence Code does provide an exception to this 
general prohibition when that evidence tends to establish the defendant's 
motive or intent." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Arenella said, prosecutors could argue that Simpson was 
pathologically jealous and that his jealousy could have been a motive for the 
June 12 killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the allegation from Mr. Zlomsowitch that Mr. Simpson admitted to 
him that he had watched the former boyfriend and Nicole make love in the 
privacy of her home one evening suggests the type of pathological stalking 
behavior that could have a powerful impact on a jury," Arenella said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the grand jury began meeting June 17, the investigation had not even been 
under way for a week, and the transcripts reveal the extraordinary speed with 
which police and prosecutors were working. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the delays that we have encountered are due to the fact that the 
investigation is proceeding at a rapid pace but is still very actively being 
pursued," Clark said apologetically to grand jurors at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Philip L. Vannatter, one of the lead investigators in the case, 
echoed that when he testified on June 22, 10 days after the double murder in 
Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this investigation currently ongoing, sir?" Clark asked him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it certainly is," the detective answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very actively?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very actively," he responded. 
</P>
<P>
 In his testimony, Vannatter described his interview with Simpson on the day 
after the killings, noting that he informed Simpson of his rights and that 
Simpson waived his right to remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if he wished to give up his right to remain silent and talk with 
us, with his attorney's knowledge," Vannatter testified. "And he said, 'Yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Without his lawyer present, Simpson told the investigator that he had cut 
himself first at home and later in Chicago, explaining that was why bloodstains 
turned up at both locations. Simpson could not recall exactly how he initially 
had cut his hand, Vannatter said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the detective, Simpson said he re-injured the hand in Chicago 
when police called to tell him of his ex-wife's murder, and he slammed a glass 
down in response to the news. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simpson also said he had not been to his wife's house for roughly a week 
prior to the murders and insisted that he had not left blood there. During the 
preliminary hearing, Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro said that even if 
Simpson's blood were found at his ex-wife's house, it would not necessarily 
suggest his guilt because he could have cut himself there on a previous 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case in which much attention has focused on DNA testing of blood samples, 
the grand jury transcripts also provide the first sworn testimony about some of 
those tests. Law enforcement sources have said a quick procedure known as PCR 
testing showed that blood from the crime scene was consistent with Simpson's, 
as was blood found in his car and at his Brentwood estate. The transcripts 
provide the first sworn evidence of that, as they include testimony from Collin 
Yamauchi, a Police Department criminalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamauchi also told grand jurors that a glove found outside Simpson's home was 
stained with a mixture of blood. The mixture, he said, was consistent with 
blood from both victims and Simpson, though he added that one of the markers 
indicative of Simpson's blood was only a "potential." 
</P>
<P>
 More rigorous DNA analysis known as RFLP testing got under way last week. 
Results are not expected from those tests for at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary DNA findings, the descriptions of Simpson's talk with police 
and the testimony by Zlomsowitch all raise potential problems for the defense 
and come after a week in which Simpson's camp scored several victories. In 
particular, they publicly aired details of a possible witness with information 
indicating other assailants could have committed the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 That witness, a 45-year-old burglar with a long arrest record, has spoken at 
length to detectives and to The Times. He said he was across the street casing 
houses on the night of the murders when he saw two bearded, burly white men 
leaving Nicole Simpson's condominium property after hearing a woman scream. 
</P>
<P>
 The prowler's credibility is certain to be tested as the case moves forward. 
But, without naming him, defense attorneys have suggested that they will use 
his account and those of other possible witnesses to raise doubts about the 
prosecution's theory of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides are next scheduled to be in court Aug. 9. Grand Jury Witnesses 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County Grand Jury began hearing testimony in the O.J. Simpson 
murder case on Friday, June 17. Before the panel was taken off the case a week 
later, grand jurors heard testimony from 16 witnesses -- one of whom testified 
twice. They also received 34 exhibits, including photographs, charts and 
diagrams. 
</P>
<P>
 Most but not all of the witnesses later testified at Simpson's preliminary 
hearing. The witnesses who testified before the grand jury were: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Brian (Kato) Kaelin -- Simpson guest house tenant who testified about 
seeing Simpson in the hours immediately before and after the killings took 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Dr. Irwin L. Golden -- Medical examiner who testified about how the two 
victims died. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Jill Shively -- Santa Monica resident who said she saw Simpson rushing from 
the area where the murders occurred. Shively later admitted that she had 
accepted money to tell her story to a television tabloid. She was not called 
during the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Sukru Boztepe -- Neighbor of Nicole Brown Simpson's who described finding 
the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Bettina Rasmussen -- Boztepe's wife, who also described her role in 
discovering the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 6. John Anthony DeBello -- Colleague of Ronald Lyle Goldman's at Mezzaluna who 
testified about Goldman's last night there. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Jose Camacho -- Knife salesman who said he sold Simpson a 15-inch German 
Stiletto knife several weeks before the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Karen Lee Crawford -- Colleague of Goldman's who said Nicole Simpson called 
her about some glasses her mother had left at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Keith Douglas Zlomsowitch -- Restaurateur who described dating Nicole 
Simpson and being intimidated by her ex-husband. He said Simpson once spied on 
them through a window while they were in an intimate situation. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Allan William Park -- Limousine driver who came to take Simpson to the 
airport on the night of the murders but was kept waiting because no one came to 
the door. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Detective Tom Lange -- One of the lead investigators in the case, Lange 
testified about the condition of the bodies and the bloody crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 12. Officer Robert Lance Riske -- One of the first patrol officers on the 
scene, he told grand jurors about securing the area and taking Nicole Simpson's 
children out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 13. Detective Philip L. Vannatter -- One of the lead investigators, Vannatter 
described interviewing Simpson on the day after the murders as well as 
testifying about the search of Simpson's estate that same day. 
</P>
<P>
 14. Thano M. Peratis -- Registered nurse who testified about taking a blood 
sample from Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 15. Dennis Kirk Fung -- LAPD criminalist who testified about finding blood at 
the crime scene and at Simpson's estate, including samples recovered from a 
sink in the master bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 16. Jill Shively (recalled) -- In her second appearance on the stand, Shively 
was questioned about her paid interview with the tabloid television show "Hard 
Copy." 
</P>
<P>
 17. Collin Yamauchi -- LAPD criminalist who testified that preliminary DNA 
tests of blood samples showed that blood at the scene of the crime was 
consistent with O.J. Simpson's, as were samples recovered from his car and 
estate. A glove found on his property could contain a mixture of his blood and 
that of the two victims, Yamauchi added.

FLORIDA CITY IS UNWITTING VORTEX OF ABORTION WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tourism is up by 30% here over last year, convention business is on the rise, 
and most who live within easy reach of the white sand beaches that skirt the 
Gulf of Mexico would prefer that their home be known only as part of the 
booming American Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead, as a defrocked minister was brought into court on two charges of 
murder and one of attempted murder here Saturday, assigned a public defender 
and ordered held without bond, Pensacola again is fighting to dodge a 
reputation as being the bloodstained crucible of the anti-abortion movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called my husband last night and told him I was in the terrorist capital of 
the South," said college instructor Maresa Brassil, 41, minutes after she and 
her two young daughters stuck red roses in the fence around an abortion clinic 
where two people, including a doctor, were shotgunned to death Friday. "It's so 
tragic." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, Paul Hill, 40, wearing a green prison jumpsuit, was asked by 
Escambia County Judge James Roark III if he needed a public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't decided as of yet, sir. I really don't have any counsel in the 
matter, sir," said the straw-blond Hill. "I don't know how the system works 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he asked the judge: "What would be the wisest thing to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Roark advised him to take the public defender and he could decide later to get 
a private attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, I'll try that," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roark scheduled Hill's arraignment for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Hill was facing the judge, the mayor of Pensacola was on the telephone 
with other local officials discussing ways to hold down the public relations 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This community does not deserve this," Mayor John Fogg said. "This is a 
community of good people who despise this type of activity, and we are not 
going to allow ourselves to be characterized in this way by two or three 
individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, an outspoken abortion foe well known to police and other area residents 
for his regular Friday morning protests outside The Ladies Center, is accused 
of waiting in ambush for John Bayard Britton, 69, a physician from Florida's 
east coast who performed abortions here one day each week. Britton and James H. 
Barrett, 74, a retired Air Force officer who regularly picked up Britton at the 
airport and drove him to the clinic, were killed by 12-gauge shotgun blasts to 
their heads as they arrived in the clinic parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett's wife, June, 68, who also volunteered as a clinic escort and was in 
the back seat of the couple's pickup truck, was wounded in the arm. She was 
released from the hospital Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The slayings have refocused international attention on this Florida Panhandle 
city, which was first colonized by the Spanish in 1559 but did not make modern 
history until March, 1993, when it became the site of the country's first 
abortion doctor murder. In that killing, Dr. David Gunn was fatally shot 
outside Pensacola's other abortion clinic, about two miles from The Ladies 
Center. Michael Griffin was convicted of first-degree murder and is serving a 
life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind a ribbon of yellow crime scene tape, Pensacola police technicians 
combed the grounds of the clinic and adjacent parking lot for evidence 
Saturday. Police also executed a search warrant of Hill's home, but did not say 
if anything was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Few, however, doubt that Hill, who publicly advocated the killing of abortion 
doctors, is the man who has propelled this city back into the headlines. A 
shotgun, believed to be the murder weapon, was found behind an oak tree on the 
clinic grounds minutes after the shooting. When he was arrested a few hundred 
yards away, Hill was carrying several shotgun shells. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could have happened in any other city where abortion is seen as a 
problem," said Sgt. Jerry Potts, spokesman for the Pensacola Police Department. 
"This is just unfortunate. It happens when you have weak-minded people, people 
who get so strong in their beliefs that they get just fanatic and live it day 
to day." 
</P>
<P>
 But why here? Although this part of Florida, much closer geographically and 
socially to parts of Alabama and Georgia than it is to Miami, is known for its 
political conservatism and bedrock Christian fundamentalism, Mayor Fogg insists 
"there is no broad-based sentiment for this kind of action." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pensacola does have a history of anti-abortion violence, beginning with a 
bombing of The Ladies Center in 1984. There were other bombings tied to 
abortion protests that year, and several people were arrested in 1986 when they 
tried to storm The Ladies Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Pensacola has shown tolerance for change as well. Earlier 
this year, for example, Pensacola hosted a national gay and lesbian conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always been proud of my hometown," said Julie Braswell-Simpson, a 
Pensacola native home for a weekend visit from Jacksonville. "It was a little 
dot in the South until this. Now I am so embarrassed. I have friends in 
Jacksonville who tease me about it. I always said this violence was an isolated 
incident. But it's going to be hard to call it that now."

CAR RUNS DOWN 5 CHILDREN IN DRIVEWAY; ACCIDENT: A BOY, 2, KNOCKS IDLING VEHICLE 
INTO GEAR. THREE ARE INJURED CRITICALLY, ONE SERIOUSLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a freak accident that overwhelmed even veteran emergency response workers, 
a 2-year-old knocked an idling Thunderbird into gear, running down five 
children playing in a North Hollywood driveway Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Horrified parents and neighbors turned into rescuers, lifting the vehicle up 
and dragging the children out before paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were crying from pain, we could hear them moan," said rescuer Alverto 
Torres, 41. "One didn't move." 
</P>
<P>
 Three girls -- two 10-year-olds and a 5-year-old -- were hospitalized in 
critical condition, and a 6-year-old girl was in serious condition. The fifth 
victim, a 7-year-old boy, suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy unfolded in a working-class area of North Hollywood shortly before 
10 a.m. when Estela Lopez started her car in the driveway and then ran back 
into her house to grab her purse and hurry her three children along for a 
special Saturday treat: breakfast at McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 Her youngest child, a 2-year-old boy, made it outside first, Lopez said in an 
interview. When she turned to go back out to the car, she said, the child 
climbed into the driver's side and the car began to move forward toward the end 
of the drive, where five children were playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said she screamed and then grabbed the rear bumper in a desperate and 
futile attempt to stop the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing the scream and the thud of the car hitting the youngsters, neighbor 
Olga Vega left breakfast cooking on the stove and ran to her doorway. She saw 
her 5-year-old daughter under the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the sound," Vega said, starting to sob. "I see the little kids and 
the car is over them. I wanted to pull her feet. I tried." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time his fire engine and ambulance got to the three-unit apartment 
complex on Agnes Avenue, Fire Capt. Frank David said, the children had been 
rescued from under the car by the neighbors -- who had lifted the vehicle by 
hand and shoved a 4-by-4 board and a car jack underneath. The victims were 
lying on the driveway in various states of consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's toys, two bicycles, a pair of children's safety scissors, a bag 
of Oreo cookies and a picture book were visible under the 1984 Thunderbird, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were expecting to see a typical child hit by a car," David said. "We were 
overwhelmed because it was such an emotional scene and there were a lot of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 When the 2-year-old knocked the steering column gearshift into drive, the car 
moved forward 20 to 30 feet at about 2 to 5 m.p.h., said 0fficer Richard 
Prindle of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at that speed, the car knocked the children and their toys down. "It just 
rolled right over them," Prindle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said it is unclear where each of the children were at the time of 
the accident, Prindle said some were playing on the driveway and others were 
sitting on a couch slightly to the side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a freak thing," he said. "The public needs to know that you don't let 
your car be running with children anywhere near there." 
</P>
<P>
 Prindle said it is unlikely that any charges will be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the injured are siblings: 10-year-old Janette, 6-year-old Guadalupe 
and 7-year-old Alex Rodriguez. The two others are cousins of each other: 
5-year-old Leslie Vega and 10-year-old Valeria Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Janette was in critical condition at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles. Alex, 
who suffered minor injuries, was taken to the Medical Center of North 
Hollywood, and Guadalupe was in serious condition at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie was in critical condition at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Valeria -- in critical condition at Childrens Hospital -- had come from 
Pacoima for a visit, said Leslie's father, Sergio. Having Valeria spend time 
with her young cousins in North Hollywood seemed like a nice break for her, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors who live in the small, well-kept houses along the narrow street 
where the accident took place continued to drop by the scene throughout the 
morning, asking Lopez to recount the horrible tale again, some of them crying 
with her at the retelling and then offering consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can it happen, this?" asked Maria Lopez, the Rodriguez children's 
great-aunt. "How can it happen?" 
</P>

RWANDA RELIEF GROUPS TO HELP FITTEST SURVIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monique Nagelkerke, a Dutch nurse, wasn't surprised when one of the first 
Rwandan refugees to stumble into her new field clinic here Saturday simply 
collapsed and died. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the old woman had walked for three days after fleeing the hunger 
and disease of the refugee camps in eastern Zaire. The road was long and hard, 
a cold climb through rugged mountains. No food was distributed along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got here and just dropped dead," Nagelkerke said, as workers carried the 
corpse by in a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 The only real surprise was that the woman was a casualty of a deliberate new 
policy by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food 
Program and several non-governmental humanitarian groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual attempt to stop the refugees' now-ebbing cholera epidemic from 
spreading into Rwanda, the agencies agreed Saturday not to transport any of the 
tens of thousands of refugees now trying to return home -- even the old, the 
lame and the ill -- until they have walked nearly 50 miles to the city of 
Ruhengeri. The effect, officials said, is to weed out the sick and weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one will be picked up," explained Nagelkerke, a coordinator with the Dutch 
chapter of Doctors Without Borders. "However cruel it might sound, you'll get 
some sort of natural selection." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes Sayagues, the World Food Program spokeswoman, said the agencies met 
Saturday in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, and agreed to a request by the new 
government not to begin assisting refugees until they have reached Ruhengeri. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the request of the (government)," she said. "They are very much 
afraid of bringing cholera into Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes sense," she added. "We think the people who have walked all that way 
are healthy and strong." 
</P>
<P>
 She said 11 empty World Food Program trucks heading back to Uganda will begin 
transporting refugees today from Ruhengeri to Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, Darwinian-style repatriation policy reflects the painful moral 
dilemmas the overwhelmed relief groups have faced since an estimated 1.2 
million refugees flooded into Zaire two weeks ago in fear of the advancing 
rebel army of the Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
</P>
<P>
 Many refugees unquestionably died, for example, when relief officials 
consciously decided not to distribute food or water to tens of thousands of 
sick and hungry refugees in the city of Goma and at the nearby Munigi camp, the 
center of the cholera epidemic. The goal was to force the refugees to move 
miles down the road to other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, relief workers recognize that the international aid effort sustains 
others besides the innocent. After all, among the refugees are many of the 
government soldiers and members of paramilitary militias who carried out what 
human rights groups have called a genocidal campaign of massacres against 
ethnic Tutsis that left up to half a million dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The relief effort also reflects the reality of the ethnic landscape here. Aid 
officials say privately that the Rwandan government fears that its former 
enemies, now in the refugee camps, could infiltrate back into the country if 
trucks are used from the border. The walkers pass innumerable roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the new repatriation policy means that tens of thousands of refugees -- 
some strong, but many weak -- are walking down a mountain road as empty trucks 
roar by, adding yet another chapter to this country's epic tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, at least one boy hobbled slowly on crutches. Four men carried a 
woman in a litter. Most simply trudged along, carrying sleeping mats and 
cooking pots on their heads. Many, including children, had babies swaddled on 
their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic was erected here Saturday, outside Ruhengeri, to screen the 
refugees for cholera. But even as the white canvas tents went up, dozens of 
passing refugees stumbled in and fell to the ground in exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are in very weak condition," said Nagelkerke, who spoke as she stocked 
a storeroom with supplies of medicine, bandages and soap. "They've been walking 
for days. And they don't have enough food. They're tired, weak, hungry and 
sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, a woman was shaking with fever and carrying a baby who whimpered 
weakly as flies crawled on his face. "I've got three sick children," Francoise 
Nzacharinya, 28, said as she shivered. "And I'm sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Colonelle Nsenguyumva lay on the ground with his crutches. Shot in the 
ankle in June, the 15-year-old had large metal pins poking from the heel and 
shin of his withered leg. Passing military vehicles and other drivers had given 
him rides this far, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agnes Musigiyaha sat silently as her 2-year-old tried to suck milk from her 
withered breasts. "I have no milk," she said. "I did not eat for three days." 
</P>
<P>
 A white Toyota suddenly pulled up. Johanna MacLeod jumped out and gently 
helped about a dozen women and children out of the back and into the medical 
tents. Most were dazed, near collapse, walking like zombies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very malnourished," she said. "And dehydrated." 
</P>
<P>
 She had found them at a military checkpoint a mile or so down the road. 
"Today's the first day we could pick them up even from there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Food Program last dropped food along the road Wednesday. The 
International Committee of the Red Cross has promised to provide food today. 
Ultimately, a truck belonging to Doctors Without Borders will be sent down the 
road to pick up the dead, and two will be assigned to offer rides to the sick. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, there are too few trucks, too little water, too few high-protein 
biscuits and too many problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not acceptable," said Rex Hendriksen, a sanitation engineer with Doctors 
Without Borders. "But what's our choice? What can we do?"

MODIFIED PRO SURFING CHAMPIONSHIP CATCHES A MELLOW WAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Despite mostly gloomy skies, about 25,000 people flocked to Huntington Beach 
on the first weekend day of the 13th annual Ocean Pacific Pro Surfing 
Championship, but the event that once earned distinction as the city's biggest 
beach party this year lured a more sedate crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're seeing the hard-core surf fanatics out there, and that's what 
this event is all about," said Op Pro spokesman Mike Kingsbury. "It's not a 
beach party anymore. It's a surf event, and that's the crowd we're really 
marketing to." 
</P>
<P>
 The surf contest that boasts more competitors than any other in the world 
began Thursday and wraps up today with the men's, women's, junior's and long 
board finals. This year's competition included a record number of 54 women 
performers, more than twice as many as last year, out of about 400 surfers who 
entered the competition, Kingsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the mood was mellow in this security-sensitive beach town, where 
city officials have described the surfing competition as a chance to improve an 
image tarnished by Fourth of July disturbances two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Onlookers dotted the bleachers and packed the beach, some clad in bikinis and 
others in slacks, hats and sunscreen to ward off the rays that finally broke 
through the gloom late in the day. Others toted video cameras poised to capture 
the stunts of their favorite surfing stars, and a few small children played in 
the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyal fans mobbed former world champion and teen-age heart-throb Kelly Slater 
for autographs. Others paid homage to the long board surfing legends of years 
gone by and cheered the couples who performed acrobatic feats during a tandem 
exhibition, the first ever featured at the Op Pro contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up around surfing. This is the happening event in Huntington Beach," 
said 28-year-old Mendi Blake, who attended her first championship 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The surfing bonanza, which features more than $70,000 in prize money, is a 
qualifying event for surfing's U.S. Open, which starts here Tuesday and is the 
first Assn. of Surfing Professionals world tour competition on the U.S. 
mainland since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's event was marked by choppy two- to four-foot swells that made for 
some rough surfing, and a few complaints from beach-goers angered at a 
first-ever $5 charge for bleacher seating that organizers say will help offset 
the cost of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake said crowds looked thin compared to previous years. Spectators used to 
line the pier free of charge, she said, but Saturday the pier was lined with 
the pricey bleachers. Bleacher seating was free during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake also said that by her standards, Saturday's swells were definitely not 
pumping. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kingsbury said contestants could still pull multiple maneuvers on a wave, 
and after Slater wowed onlookers with his "patented aerials" he was bombarded 
by fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The surfing championship has worked hard to recover from its own negative 
image: In 1986, hundreds of beach-goers went on a rampage, pelting police 
officers with rock and bottles and overturning and burning police cars. At 
least 12 people, including five Huntington Beach police officers, were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials have tightened security at the event and organizers changed the 
format and marketing to lure a more dedicated surfing crowd, Kingsbury said. 
Last year, they moved a bikini contest, the flash point of the 1986 unrest, to 
a weekday, and this year they eliminated it. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than one fight late in the day off Main Street that drew dozens of 
onlookers, police reported no problems.

DEMOCRATS FILE COMPLAINT OVER WILSON'S L.A. CONDO; POLITICS: RENTAL BY 
NONPROFIT GROUP VIOLATES LAW, OPPONENTS CHARGE. FOUNDATION OFFICIALS SAY DEAL 
IS LEGAL AND HAS SAVED TAXPAYERS MONEY. 
</P>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's Democratic opposition is calling it "condo-gate." 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, a private charitable foundation set up by the governor's 
friends and supporters has been leasing a $4,000-a-month Century City 
condominium for Wilson and his wife to use whenever they are in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in an election year, the California Democratic Party is charging that the 
deal violates state law -- an allegation vehemently denied by foundation 
officials and the governor's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats have filed a complaint with the Fair Political Practices 
Commission charging that the Wilsons' use of the condo is a gift from private 
corporations and violates a $270 limit on gifts to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the donors identified in the foundation's public filings are Hollywood 
Park, Bank of America and Southern California Edison -- all of which have an 
interest in legislation that could come before the governor and are regulated 
by his appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson does not report the free housing on his personal income tax return or 
on his annual statement of economic interest, which the Democrats contend is 
required by law. The Democrats also argue that Wilson's campaign committee 
illegally transferred more than $20,000 to the foundation despite a prohibition 
on spending campaign funds for personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 State Democratic Party Chairman Bill Press accuses Wilson of being "an outlaw 
governor" and he calls the two-bedroom, one-story condo in a gated community "a 
special interest Shangri-La." 
</P>
<P>
 "He deliberately . . . set up this foundation as a means of violating the laws 
of the state," Press said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials of the California Governor's Foundation, which leases the 
condominium, argue that the lease is a gift to California taxpayers and is 
legally neither a gift nor income to the Wilsons. 
</P>
<P>
 The real beneficiaries of the foundation are the state's taxpayers, said 
foundation Chairman John Davies, a San Diego attorney who is a longtime Wilson 
friend and contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't pay for (the governor's housing in Los Angeles), the state will," 
Davies said. "There's no personal benefit to the governor. . . . The foundation 
is relieving the taxpayers of payments that they otherwise would have to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies, whom Wilson appointed to the University of California Board of 
Regents, describes the condominium as comfortable rather than posh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not describe it as plush by any means," Davies said. "I don't think 
it's excessive at all for a governor of 32 million people. It isn't Bel-Air and 
it isn't Brentwood and it's not palatial." 
</P>
<P>
 In its complaint, the Democratic Party notes that Davies is also the sole 
trustee of a blind trust set up by the Wilsons to manage their investments and 
avoid conflicts of interest. The Democrats say "this cozy, multifaceted 
relationship" between Davies and Wilson is further proof that the free use of 
the condominium is a gift to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's lawyer, Vigo G. (Chip) Nielsen Jr., who is also treasurer of 
a Wilson campaign committee, said he is confident that Press will lose the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he knows that and doesn't care," Nielsen said recently. "He got 
exactly what he wants from this interview and others." 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen noted that the state Fair Political Practices Commission last year 
dismissed a Democratic Party complaint against Wilson for using private funds 
to pay for an official state trade mission to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are other critics of the leasing arrangement who are not party 
to the Democrats' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 California Common Cause has urged the foundation to release the names of all 
of its donors -- not just those of a handful of corporations who contributed 
$5,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the potential for conflict of interest," Common Cause lobbyist 
Melissa Gamer said. The nonprofit group would like to see the state provide 
living quarters for its governor to avoid the problem, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen said the foundation board decided voluntarily to publicly identify all 
contributors of $5,000 or more -- information that must also be included on the 
group's tax returns but that need not be made public. 
</P>
<P>
 To quell criticism that it has kept the complete list of donors secret, the 
foundation's board, after a request from The Times, has decided to release the 
full list of donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies said that as soon as he has the permission of contributors, he will 
release the names of about 20 donors who contributed a total of $57,750 to the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, because of a flurry of news stories this month, the state attorney 
general's charitable trust office is reviewing the foundation's papers looking 
for any improper spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "We screen the newspapers and other services for stories about nonprofit 
corporations and when we find one, we look at it when it's in California," 
Assistant Atty. Gen. Carole Ann Kornblum said. "This is a very routine review." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's defenders say the root of the controversy is that the state's 
taxpayers no longer provide the state's chief executive with a governor's 
mansion -- forcing a succession of governors to either buy or rent their own 
lodgings or depend on the kindness of charitable foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 The proud Victorian house in downtown Sacramento that was once the official 
residence of California's governors became a museum after Nancy Reagan declared 
it a firetrap and refused to live there. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, then-Gov. Ronald Reagan and his family rented a house a few miles 
from the Capitol. Some of Reagan's top political supporters eventually bought 
the house so it would not be sold from under the state's first couple, and the 
same group also raised enough money to buy an 11-acre site in suburban 
Carmichael to build a mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the state completed work on the $1.3-million, 17-room official 
residence, bachelor Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. had become governor. He dubbed 
the mansion "a Taj Mahal" and refused to move in, preferring a sparse apartment 
near the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Brown left office, the Legislature agreed with the then-governor, and 
approved legislation selling the Carmichael house. 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming governor, George Deukmejian, who owned a home in Long Beach, 
found himself renting a small apartment in a downtown Sacramento high-rise. 
Deukmejian's chief fund-raiser, Los Angeles attorney Karl Samuelian, formed a 
nonprofit foundation using a sizable surplus from the Deukmejian inauguration 
to buy the governor a $400,000 house. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Governor's Residence Foundation, the group promised to make the 
house available to any governor who wished to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wilson was elected governor in 1990, he and his wife sold their 
Washington home and a Los Angeles condominium and moved into the Sacramento 
house vacated by the Deukmejians. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's supporters set up their own charitable foundation to pay for the 
upkeep and furnishing of the house and for entertaining dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest source of income for the foundation was $353,000 in surplus money 
raised from corporate interests for the Wilson inauguration, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen said the new Wilson-formed foundation was modeled on the Deukmejian 
one. Both groups were established as charitable organizations, and 
contributions could be deducted from donors' income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 In his second year in office, the governor and his wife, Gayle, found that 
they were spending a considerable amount of time in Los Angeles -- living in 
hotel rooms for two or three days a week. "They found the condominium and asked 
the foundation to see if it was willing to pick up expenses (for it) as well, 
including lease payments," foundation Chairman Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group amended its statement of purpose to provide explicitly for "a leased 
gubernatorial residence in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen said the foundation continues to qualify as a charitable foundation 
and the leased condominium is a gift to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that "the fair rental value of the 
official residence furnished a governor by the state is excludable from the 
governor's gross income." 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1983, Gov. Deukmejian obtained an opinion from the IRS saying it did 
not matter whether the house was owned by a foundation or the state as long as 
it was an official residence. Nielsen said he relied on that opinion when 
advising Wilson that he did not have to treat the condominium rent payments as 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Democrats contend that the condo is not the same as the 
3,300-square-foot house in Sacramento. "The mansion is permanent," Press said. 
"The condo is only for Wilson's term." Wilson's staff, as well as Davies and 
Nielsen, deny there is any such distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation has reported receiving $21,312 from the governor's campaign 
committee. The Democrats contend that the payment violates a prohibition on the 
personal use of campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nielsen said the money represented a repayment of funds inadvertently 
charged to the foundation that should have been charged instead to the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is dismayed by the leasing controversy -- saying the foundation has 
saved the taxpayers money for the governor's legitimate, business-related 
living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're damned if you do and damned if you don't," he said. "There's no 
decision anymore that seems to work."

BLOCKING KILLERS' PAROLE CAN'T BE RETROACTIVE, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Calling into question a key component of Gov. Pete Wilson's anti-crime 
platform, a federal magistrate judge has ruled that Wilson cannot block the 
parole of convicted murderers whose crimes occurred before 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 If the magistrate's recommendation to U.S. District Judge David Levy is 
affirmed, the state could be forced into freeing up to 30 men and women serving 
time for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Magistrate Judge Gregory G. Hollows said in a ruling made public Friday that 
Wilson cannot apply a 1988 initiative granting California governors the power 
to block parole to prisoners whose crimes occurred before enactment of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 88, which went into effect in 1989, was passed by voters in the 
wake of failed efforts by then-Gov. George Deukmejian to block the parole of 
former Death Row inmate Archie Fain in a case that drew wide attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollows found that Wilson's policy of applying the initiative retroactively 
"without a doubt has actually disadvantaged . . . a class of prisoners whose 
offenses were committed prior to the effective date of Proposition 88." 
</P>
<P>
 "The court finds," Hollows wrote, "that the substance of the governor's power 
was intended to, and has worked to, retrospectively make (the prisoners' 
sentences) more burdensome. In this respect, California's law violated the ex 
post facto clause of the federal Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the governor denounced the ruling and vowed to fight it. But 
the lawyer for the prisoners hailed it as affirming a cornerstone of U.S. 
constitutional law -- that new laws cannot be applied retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here comes the federal government sticking its nose in the state's business 
again," said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Wilson. "It's an outrage. . . . We're 
talking about keeping dangerous dirt bags in prison for the life terms they 
were sentenced to." 
</P>
<P>
 The incendiary nature of parole again became apparent when, earlier this year, 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown, Wilson's Democratic challenger, attacked the 
Republican incumbent for not taking steps to block the parole of serial rapist 
Melvin Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter received a specific determinate sentence of 25 years for his crimes, 
and he was released after serving half of that term because of penitentiary 
work and good behavior. By law, Wilson says, he had no power to stop Carter's 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor contends however that he does have the power to block release of 
convicted murderers serving "indeterminate sentences" -- and he instituted a 
policy to that effect upon taking office in 1991. Most people convicted of 
murder are given such sentences that can be as long as life in prison. But 
under sentencing law, they can seek parole for the prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 People sentenced to an indeterminate life sentence appear before the Board of 
Prison Terms after serving a set number of years. The board rarely grants 
release dates. But Wilson's policy has been to review decisions in which the 
board granted parole dates, and then rescind or modify them so release dates 
are delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, it is important," Walsh said of the governor's policy of revoking 
the parole dates of murderers serving such sentences. "Those are 30 murderers 
who could be on the street plying their trade again, and that's something the 
governor does not want. He doesn't want any murderers getting out and having 
the opportunity to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, after Wilson blocked the release of one of the prisoners, San 
Francisco attorney Dennis Riordan wrote to the governor warning that his policy 
blatantly violated the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan brought the suit challenging the policy in state court, where a state 
court of appeal affirmed Wilson's policy.

STUDIES LINK EMF EXPOSURE TO HIGHER RISK OF ALZHEIMER'S; HEALTH: THOSE WHOSE 
JOBS INVOLVE GREATER LEVELS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS, SUCH AS TAILORS AND 
DRESSMAKERS, MAY BE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO DEVELOP THE DISEASE, RESEARCHERS 
SAY.

 Electromagnetic fields, previously implicated in triggering leukemia, brain 
tumors and breast cancer, may play a far more important role in Alzheimer's 
disease, a USC researcher will report today.  
</P>
<P>
 Results from two new studies conducted in Finland and one in Los Angeles 
indicate that people with a high occupational exposure to EMFs are at least 
three times as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease as those without 
significant exposure, Dr. Eugene Sobel is scheduled to report at the Fourth 
International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders in 
Minneapolis. In comparison, the cancer risk associated with EMFs is generally 
believed to be 1.5 to 1.8 times as high among those with occupational exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobel and his colleagues also found that dressmakers and tailors were 
overrepresented among Alzheimer's victims. Further study showed that industrial 
and home sewing machines produce much larger EMFs than other appliances and 
that people who use sewing machines regularly have the greatest exposure of any 
occupation -- as much as three times that of electric power line and cable 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike the case for leukemia and tumors, the researchers say they have a 
biological rationale for how the EMFs produce the suspected Alzheimer's-related 
defects and animal evidence that supports their observations.  
</P>
<P>
 "This opens up a whole new frontier in terms of potential EMF effects," said 
EMF expert Louis Slesin, editor of Microwave News. "EMF has long been a 
backwater area with a lot of skeptical people taking potshots at the research . 
. . . This could signal a major change in the way EMF health risks are 
addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James Mortimer of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis said 
Sobel's findings were very surprising. "Nobody ever even thought it 
(Alzheimer's) was related to EMF. This is a much stronger finding than the link 
to leukemia." 
</P>
<P>
 Alzheimer's disease afflicts at least 2.5 million Americans and perhaps as 
many as 4 million, most over age 65. 
</P>
<P>
 It is characterized by memory loss, disorientation, depression and 
deterioration of bodily functions. It is ultimately fatal, causing about 
100,000 deaths in the United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of Alzheimer's is still unknown. Genetics almost certainly plays a 
major role in its onset, experts say, but environmental factors may contribute 
as well. Most previous studies of environmental factors have focused on 
chemicals. Sobel's findings offer entirely new possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Helsinki studies -- conducted by USC with researchers from the 
Universities of Kuopio and Helsinki -- and one in Los Angeles involved a total 
of 386 Alzheimer's patients and 475 healthy control subjects. Subjects were 
divided into two categories -- those with medium to high occupational exposure 
and those with low or no occupational exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Those people with the higher occupational exposure to EMFs averaged three 
times as likely to develop Alzheimer's as those with low exposure, Sobel 
reported. The relative risks were consistent in the three studies: 2.9, 3.1 and 
3 times higher than the low exposure group. 
</P>
<P>
 Women were more susceptible to the effects of EMFs: in the three studies 
combined, women with the higher exposure had a relative risk of 3.8 compared to 
women with the lowest exposure. In one of the Finnish studies, those women with 
the highest exposure were 7.3 times as likely as women in the low exposure 
group to develop Alzheimer's; in the other two studies, the relative risks were 
3.3 and 4.2 times as great. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was an outgrowth of laboratory findings by one of Sobel's 
co-authors, neurologist Zoreh Davanipour of Loma Linda University. Davanipour 
and her colleagues have found that EMFs increase the number of calcium ions 
(charged atoms) in nerve cells grown in the laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcium is extremely important in the cells because it is directly involved in 
many biological responses, especially communication among nerve cells. Sobel 
speculates that increased levels of calcium ions kill the cells. That finding 
suggests that EMFs could affect neurological diseases, a conclusion that the 
researchers said seems to be supported by the study results. 
</P>
<P>
 Some animal work also suggests that EMFs might damage the brain, although the 
mechanism proposed in that case is different from Davanipour's. In the 
mid-1980s, physicists Henry Kues and Sam Koslov of Johns Hopkins University's 
Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., studied the effects of low levels of 
microwave radiation on the eyes of two different types of monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
 They found that persistent exposure to the radiation, at levels well below 
safety guidelines, damaged the cornea, apparently by opening the blood-brain 
barrier in the eyes. The blood-brain barrier is a tightly packed layer of cells 
on the inside of blood vessels in the brain that prevents microorganisms and 
many toxic chemicals in the blood from reaching delicate brain tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 Examination of the monkeys' brain tissue by Dr. Linda Cork of Hopkins showed 
that it contained neurofibrillary tangles and other changes characteristic of 
Alzheimer's disease. Koslov believes that opening the blood-brain barrier in 
the affected cells allowed toxic chemicals to leak in, eventually killing the 
cells and producing the tangles. The research was later abandoned for lack of 
funding, Koslov said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, tumors have never been induced in animals by exposure to EMFs, 
Slesin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobel noted that he had spent five years studying the links between EMFs and 
cancer before abandoning the field in frustration because of the relatively low 
increased risks he had observed and the difficulties of reproducing those 
studies. He joined the current study at Davanipour's urging, he said. "We're 
really excited about this," Sobel said. "It's a very dramatic effect."

DICTATOR'S DEATH UPSETS S. KOREAN POLICY; ASIA: IN SEOUL, A COLD WAR CONSENSUS 
IS OVER. EVEN BUSINESS HAS BACKED A SOFTER STANCE TOWARD THE NORTH SINCE ITS 
LEADER DIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The death of North Korean leader Kim Il Sung has brought to a head a dilemma 
for the government of South Korean President Kim Young Sam: How does a 
pluralistic nation deal with a monolithic rival? 
</P>
<P>
 A former opposition leader who made demands for democracy the core of his 
political career, Kim Young Sam turned away from those roots when a small 
minority started urging his government to express condolences over the death of 
the man who had launched war and terrorism against the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of merely criticizing that position, Kim banned it. He also ousted a 
newspaper publisher who dared to visit the North and express sympathies over 
the northern leader's death. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike last year, when he allowed citizens to organize a chain of hands 
extending from Seoul toward the North, Kim has forbidden a similar expression 
of the desire for reunification planned for Aug. 15 -- "liberation day," 
commemorating the 49th anniversary of the end of Japanese colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of North Korea's 1.1-million-strong armed forces stationed just 
north of the demilitarized zone 25 miles from Seoul, a security threat to the 
South is obvious. In addition, the North has tried consistently to foment 
anti-government opinion in the South and has torpedoed gestures of 
reconciliation, such as a North-South agreement in December, 1991, to free the 
peninsula of nuclear weapons and ban nuclear fuel reprocessing. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Kim Young Sam's government, insisting that it remain the only 
authority entitled to deal with the North, has kept a National Security Law 
forbidding espousal of communism or support of any "anti-state organization," 
including North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Although softened from the old days of authoritarian rule, the law still 
"violates freedom of expression, association and travel" in South Korea, a 1993 
U.S. human rights report charged. Earlier this year, to Kim's displeasure, 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher openly criticized the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, Seoul does not permit South Koreans or the mass media to receive 
unfiltered North Korean media reports. Naewoe, a government-controlled "news 
agency," monitors North Korean publications and feeds filtered reports to South 
Korean media. 
</P>
<P>
 Although CNN televised Kim Il Sung's funeral procession and a memorial 
ceremony in countries around the world, South Korean TV showed only snippets of 
both events. 
</P>
<P>
 But South Korea's old consensus on dealing sternly with the North has broken 
down. "There is no unity of opinion anywhere," complained a leading businessman 
who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the lack of consensus, he said, is that many of the 40,000 
people convicted over the years of violating the National Security Law have 
entered the political process that Kim helped democratize, thus destroying the 
old Cold War unanimity. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissent against an unyielding government approach to the North has been rising 
even within the nation's business community. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Korean Trade Promotion Corp., better known as KOTRA, urged that 
the government start promoting trade with the North while treating worries 
about North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons as a separate 
issue. KOTRA counts most leading business firms among its members, and the 
organization is supported by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 A notable difference between government and public perceptions surfaced with 
Kim Il Sung's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Young Sam's reaction was to order a military alert. The public's, 
according to a Gallup survey, was disappointment that an opportunity for 
reconciliation offered by a first-ever summit of North-South leaders had been 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem spoon-feeding an increasingly prosperous and sophisticated 
population is becoming a more difficult task.

SEAMSTRESS SNIPS OFF HUSBAND'S PENIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A seamstress snipped off her husband's penis with a pair of scissors Saturday 
and said he deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to face charges.I'm also ready to fight for my rights," Gina 
Espina, 21, said from a Manila city jail. "He deserved what I did to him 
because he has been abusing me for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Espina said she had agreed to stay with her husband, Donald Jacolo, despite 
learning two years into their marriage that his first marriage had not been 
annulled. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that early Saturday, while her husband slept in a motel where they 
had checked in to discuss their marriage problems, she snipped off his penis 
and threw it onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacolo woke up to find himself bleeding and called security to apprehend his 
wife. He immediately sought medical help to reattach his severed penis, but the 
doctors' efforts failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacolo told a local radio station later that he will press charges.

1ST U.S. TROOPS REACH RWANDAN CAPITAL TO SECURE AIRPORT; AFRICA: MISSION WILL 
PREPARE THE WAY FOR MORE AID. DEFENSE SECRETARY IS SCHEDULED TO INSPECT EFFORTS 
TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first U.S. troops landed in the Rwandan capital Saturday to secure the 
airport for an expanded international aid effort. The next step is encouraging 
millions of scared, displaced people to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton on Friday ordered 200 U.S. soldiers to Kigali to support the 
relief effort in Rwanda, where millions have fled their homes to escape ethnic 
carnage that killed up to 500,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry was scheduled to inspect the U.S. aid 
mission today. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Daniel Schroeder, commander of the joint U.S. task force, said it was 
unclear how many American soldiers will eventually be sent to Rwanda, whether 
they will be deployed outside Kigali or how long they might stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, Canadian commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force 
here, said total U.S. troop strength in Rwanda could reach about 2,000 -- if 
the Americans agree to take on all jobs the United Nations would like them to. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials hope a new commitment of American, Canadian and British troops 
will help them carry out their mission and prompt other nations to send the 
troops they have pledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact the Americans are here will make the other countries send their 
troops quicker," said Shaharyar Khan, special representative for Rwanda for 
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of refugees have died in a cholera epidemic in Goma, Zaire, where 
hundreds of thousands of Rwandans are packed into squalid camps. Relief efforts 
so far have concentrated on providing them with food, medical care and clean 
water to prevent the spread of the water-borne cholera bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal now is to persuade the refugees to return home. Most are majority 
Hutus who fled in fear of reprisals by the victorious Tutsi-led rebels for the 
mass killings of Tutsis. The rebels have installed Rwanda's new government. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid officials in Goma said Saturday that they thought the cholera epidemic was 
coming under control. But in Kimumba, the most crowded of the camps around 
Goma, hundreds of refugees rioted as a Red Cross convoy distributed bags of 
cooking oil, beans and corn flour. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees said at least one person was killed and others were wounded as men 
wielding clubs fought off mobs that surrounded the bags of food. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallaire said all 200 of the first Americans ordered in should arrive by 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder, the U.S. commander, said the size and scope of the U.S. mission in 
Rwanda were "still ambiguous." He said those factors will be determined by 
security conditions and humanitarian needs. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the plan is to 
use additional U.S. troops to help move relief supplies to distribution hubs 
within Rwanda. The Canadian and British troops would join in to move supplies 
from the hubs to the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Special Forces psychological warfare teams would bring in radio equipment 
to help the new government encourage more than a million refugees in 
neighboring Zaire to return home. The Tutsi-led government has assured Hutu 
refugees that there will be no reprisals for the massacres of Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucks used to carry food into the country would bring back refugees on the 
return trip. Dallaire said a convoy of six small trucks sent as a test brought 
back 400 refugees and was mobbed by others wishing to return. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Dallaire said, refugees would be brought back only from Ruhengeri, in 
northwest Rwanda, to prevent the spread of cholera from Goma or the Rwandan 
border town of Gisenyi. 
</P>
<P>
 Cholera has an incubation period of two days, the amount of time it takes for 
refugees to walk from Goma to Ruhengeri. Dallaire said way stations and medical 
aid stations would be set up along the route. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. forces in Rwanda number about 750, but Dallaire said he hopes to increase 
that number to about 4,000 in the next few weeks. The U.N. Security Council has 
authorized 5,500 new peacekeepers for the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain is sending 600 soldiers to help Rwandan refugees return home, Defense 
Minister Malcolm Rifkind said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. commander said an additional 4,000 troops would help replace the 
2,500 French troops withdrawing from the protection zone they established in 
southwestern Rwanda. The French are credited with preventing another 2 million 
people from fleeing into Zaire by providing them with a haven in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dallaire said he did not want to create a situation in which refugees 
would be returning only because foreign troops are in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to put a soldier on every street corner to give Rwandans a 
sense of security," he said.

PANEL RULES FRENCH LAW AGAINST FOREIGN WORDS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 France's constitutional watchdog Saturday partially overturned a controversial 
law to enforce use of the French language. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member Constitutional Council ruled that the government had no right 
to impose official French translations of foreign words on private citizens, 
companies and the media. It could only force their use by public authorities 
and nationalized companies other than radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the words the government sought to ban in advertisements, broadcasts, 
menus and books were "cheeseburger," "cash flow," "marketing," "software" and 
"air bag." 
</P>
<P>
 The council said articles of the law, adopted by Parliament on July 1, 
violated freedom of expression and communication as guaranteed in the preamble 
to the French constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Freedom of expression implies the right of each citizen to choose the most 
appropriate terms to express his thought," the council ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like any living language, the French language evolves. . . . It cannot remain 
frozen." If official terms were imposed, French "would risk becoming a dead 
language," the ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council upheld the section affecting government officials and 
employees, citing Article 2 of the constitution, which stipulates that "the 
language of the republic is French." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Malvy, president of the Socialist caucus in Parliament that challenged 
the law, called the ruling "good news for democracy and for the French-speaking 
world," which he said "needs more writing than gendarmes." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper Le Monde called the ruling a triumph of common sense, but the 
ruling was read quite differently by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Culture Minister Jacques Toubon, who initiated the law to try to repel an 
"Anglo-Saxon invasion" of English words, called the ruling "extremely positive" 
but acknowledged that it meant the government could not tell private citizens 
what words to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Toubon said the legislation was vital to the long-term survival of the French 
language, which was being eroded in such areas as medical and scientific 
seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridiculed abroad, the law enjoyed broad public support in France, according to 
opinion polls, except among people under 25, whose slang is often peppered with 
English terms picked up from rock music. 
</P>
<P>
 Fines of up to $3,700 had been proposed for violations of the law. Fines 
already exist for announcements such as theater posters and airline boarding 
passes not printed in French, but the regulations have rarely been enforced.

ITALY OFFICIALS UNDERCUT PLAN OF BERLUSCONI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and Umberto Bossi, a key partner in the 
governing coalition, have thrown cold water on Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi's efforts to distance himself from his vast business holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalfaro said in a statement that while he appreciated Berlusconi's plan, 
constitutional restraints would probably prevent him from helping guarantee its 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would wait to take a stand on Berlusconi's proposal until a panel 
of jurists issued its report. 
</P>
<P>
 Bossi said the prime minister's plan "didn't stand up" and said his federalist 
Northern League would draft an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister announced Friday that he would submit a bill under which 
Scalfaro, the two Speakers of Parliament and antitrust authorities would 
jointly appoint a committee to oversee Berlusconi's firm, Fininvest, as long as 
Berlusconi remained in office.

NIGERIAN LABOR FEDERATION CALLS STRIKE IN SUPPORT OF DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The military government faced more pressure Saturday after the country's 
biggest labor federation called a general strike to back a pro-democracy 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers in the oil industry, Nigeria's economic lifeblood, launched the 
campaign four weeks ago with a crippling strike to demand the release of 
detained politician Moshood K. O. Abiola and a return to democratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
 A general strike called by the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) to begin 
Wednesday could bring Nigeria to a halt if it receives significant backing from 
the 3.5 million members of its 41 affiliate unions. 
</P>
<P>
 The NLC said Friday night that its efforts to persuade the military government 
to free Abiola and other political detainees had failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consequently, in view of our conviction that an industrial action has become 
inevitable, Congress calls on all its affiliates, state councils of congress 
and Nigerian workers to, as from Wednesday, August 3, 1994, embark on a 
sit-at-home protest action and await further directives," it said in a 
communique. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike by the oil workers' unions to try to force the release of Abiola, 
undeclared winner of army-organized presidential elections in 1993, has 
disrupted domestic fuel supplies, transportation and normal business. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also begun to threaten vital exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell Petroleum Development Co. of Nigeria said last week that it was losing 
38% of normal production. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell produces roughly half of Nigeria's 2 million barrels a day of oil, 1.6 
million of which is exported to provide Nigeria with its main source of income. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria's worst crisis for decades deepened after Abiola, a wealthy southern 
businessman, was arrested last month and charged with treason for declaring 
himself president. 
</P>
<P>
 There is rising concern that the crisis could degenerate into ethnic chaos as 
southern resentment grows at what political leaders there see as the 
determination of the northern ruling elite to retain power.

SOMALI MILITIAMEN LOYAL TO WARLORD ATTACK U.N. BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Militiamen loyal to powerful Somali faction leader Mohammed Farah Aidid 
attacked and disarmed Zimbabwean U.N. peacekeepers stationed in the central 
town of Belet Huen, a U.N. military spokesman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are unable to make contact with the troops, and the situation is still 
somewhat confused," Maj. Richard McDonald, the U.N. military spokesman, told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald said the United Nations did not know whether there were any 
casualties after skirmishes that began Friday. He gave no further details, and 
it was not immediately known how many Zimbabweans were in the town -- scene of 
recent fighting between feuding militias loyal to Aidid and his rival, northern 
Mogadishu warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Unconfirmed reports said militiamen of the Habre Gedir sub-clan allied with 
Aidid attacked the compound of about 150 Zimbabwean peacekeepers on Somalia's 
western border with Ethiopia, confiscating the peacekeepers' weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference earlier last week in Nairobi, Kenya, U.N. special envoy 
Victor Gbeho acknowledged that the lightly armed Zimbabweans were no match for 
the militias, which have rearmed since the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers in 
March.

LAST FLIGHT OUT COMPLETES HAITI ISOLATION; CARIBBEAN: TICKETS ARE HARD-WON AS 
AIR FRANCE BECOMES THE LAST CARRIER TO SUSPEND OPERATIONS IN THAT NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The isolation of this Caribbean nation from the outside world, at least by 
air, was complete Saturday as the last scheduled flight left Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air France jet that took off in the early afternoon for the French 
Caribbean island of Guadeloupe was the airline's last, bringing it into line 
with other carriers who stopped flying to Haiti late last month after President 
Clinton tightened sanctions against Haiti's military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and the United Nations imposed the sanctions and other 
economic embargoes to try to unseat the army chiefs, led by Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras, who took power in a military coup almost three years ago. So far, 
Cedras has shown no intention of leaving and allowing the return of ousted 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 People leaving and trying to leave Saturday said money and contacts were of 
utmost importance in securing seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Although scores of people had been desperately trying to get a place on the 
last flight, one man said he was able to buy a ticket Friday by paying twice 
the normal price. 
</P>
<P>
 Long lines formed early Saturday at the Port-au-Prince airport as passengers 
sought to confirm their bookings aboard the final commercial flight with 141 
seats. One passenger carried a rooster inside a small basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to leave this troubled country," said Alain Daniel, 19, a Haitian 
who was going to Canada to study economics. "I don't think for a good many 
years there will be a stable Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Two anxious Dutch families said their consulate had arranged a meeting for 
them with senior Air France officials Saturday morning to try to get them a 
reservation. One of them, aid worker Alieke Catsburg, said they had waited for 
hours to get on the penultimate flight but had been unable to get a space, 
despite having tickets, because of huge competition for seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "They overbooked terribly," she said. "We were quite angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Competition to get on Saturday's flight did not seem nearly as hectic as 
earlier this week, when hundreds fought for places. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a lot of panic. People are pretty confident they can get out 
somehow," said Canadian diplomat Tim Morson. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, there were still some frayed tempers and pushing and shoving 
between soldiers and travelers desperate to get into the airport check-in area.

 Although the plane's departure in theory cuts Haiti off from the rest of the 
world, there are still ways to enter and exit the country, which shares the 
island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats and sources close to the military said Haiti's border with the 
Dominican Republic is still passable, and Haiti's military-backed authorities 
are granting landing rights to private charter flights. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tough sanctions are affecting Haiti in other ways. The amount of 
electricity being distributed by the state-run power company has fallen 
spectacularly in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 Many neighborhoods now receive fewer than six hours of electricity a day, 
compared to the 20 hours a day they were getting in May, June and the first 
half of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian experts said the recent sharp drop came because the water level in the 
country's main hydroelectric dam had fallen, but there was no way to confirm 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of power being given is still far above the dark days of March and 
April, when most areas of Port-au-Prince were getting two or three hours of 
electricity per week.

 Four German climbers were killed Saturday in a fall in the Swiss Alps, police 
said, one day after the hiking death of a German woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The climbers reportedly slipped as they left the summit of an 11,200-foot 
mountain in the central Alps. The 32-year-old German woman died when she lost 
her balance on a pass in Stechelberg.

JACKSON CITES PERILS IN NIGERIA DEADLOCK; AFRICA: PRO-DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS ARE 
PREPARED TO SABOTAGE OIL FACILITIES, HE WARNS. CLINTON IS ASKED TO SEND A 
SPECIAL ENVOY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson returned Saturday from a White House-backed mission to 
Nigeria and called on President Clinton to appoint a special envoy to help 
resolve an increasingly violent political deadlock in that oil-rich West 
African nation. 
</P>
<P>
 He called it a "combustible situation that may soon lead to civil war." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a press conference arranged for a convention of minority 
journalists, Jackson said that a Nigerian civil war could be imminent because 
pro-democracy activists in that country are now prepared to destroy oil 
production facilities in their bid to pressure military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha 
to surrender power to detained politician Moshood K. O. Abiola, the apparent 
winner of last year's annulled presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The various factions are creating tensions that threaten to tear Nigeria 
apart at the seams," Jackson said. "The President needs a special envoy to 
establish links between the (various) power centers in Nigeria." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he delivered a letter from Clinton to Gen. Abacha on Thursday. In 
that letter, Clinton asked that the votes from the aborted Nigerian elections 
of June, 1993, be tabulated and announced, Jackson said. It also said that any 
military-sponsored conference on the future shape of a Nigerian government 
would be illegitimate unless the results of the 1993 elections are considered. 
</P>
<P>
 If civil war erupts, the carnage could dwarf the Rwandan crisis and interrupt 
Nigerian oil shipments that are crucial to the U.S. economy, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One quarter of all Africans are Nigerian," Jackson said. "A war would result 
in a reduction of the world's oil supply, and the United States would lose 5% 
of its supply. Initially, that would create inflation and eventually lead to 
the loss of some (U.S.) jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he is not interested in serving as envoy to Nigeria but said he 
is willing to assist the Clinton Administration in any mediation effort. He 
said he would deliver a report on his Nigerian findings to the White House on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he met with jailed presidential candidate Abiola during his 
Nigerian visit. Abiola was charged with treason after he declared himself 
president to mark the first anniversary of the 1993 presidential election, 
which was voided by the military while ballots were being counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Early returns showed Abiola winning by a large margin. Jackson said that 
Abiola has a moral claim to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abiola is in no mood to surrender what he won on June 12," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic activity in Nigerian cities has been brought to a virtual halt as the 
31-day-old pro-democracy strikes led by oil unions have grounded transportation 
and shut factories. Scores of demonstrators have been killed in clashes with 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the situation is now more volatile because large numbers of 
students have joined the protest and because unionists are now threatening to 
destroy oil production facilities -- Nigeria's economic lifeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he met with unionists and other pro-democracy dissidents during 
his visit. "The unions have asked the multinational oil companies to stop 
production," Jackson said. "If they don't respond, the protesters said they are 
prepared to stop production through sabotage." 
</P>
<P>
 The military claims there were improprieties in the Nigerian election and 
leaders said they are planning to hold a constitutional conference and set new 
elections at some unspecified date. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point the two sides in the conflict are not talking," Jackson said.

FIRE SKIRTS WASHINGTON STATE TOURIST TOWN; DESTRUCTION: SEVERAL HOMES LOST IN 
AREA WITH BAVARIAN THEME. OREGON BLAZES DIMINISH. OTHERS RAGE IN UTAH, MONTANA.

 A speeding forest fire destroyed several houses near this Bavarian-theme 
tourist town Saturday after forcing workers to shut down the water plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smoke is hanging in heavy and there's a lot of anxiety," said city 
administrator Mike Cecka, although the fire had turned away from the town 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 miles northeast, a fire that had burned across 86,000 acres of grass 
and pine trees was moving away from the lake resort town of Chelan, but a 
number of houses in the area remained evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 Fires started mostly by lightning also burned out of control in Utah and 
Montana, where two people were killed when a tanker plane crashed, and 
elsewhere across the West. Conditions in Oregon had improved enough that more 
than 200 state firefighters were being sent to help Washington state crews. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rat Creek fire near Leavenworth broke out Friday in Icicle Creek canyon 
south of the town in north-central Washington. By Saturday it had destroyed 14 
structures, mostly houses, the Chelan County sheriff's office reported. The 
homes had been evacuated, and no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Harris lost his home and a rental house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were getting ready to evacuate, but the thing was coming down the canyon 
so fast there was hardly any warning," he said. "There was hardly any time to 
think, but I got out my most valuable tools and my snowmobiles." 
</P>
<P>
 By late Saturday, the fire had spread to more than 5,000 acres. It was moving 
away from Leavenworth, but an evacuation alert remained in effect, telling 
residents to be ready to flee. It was among a series of about 34 fires, dubbed 
the Hatchery Complex, threatening the Leavenworth and Lake Wenatchee areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leavenworth water treatment plant, which serves about 3,000 area 
residents, was shut down Friday because plant employees were evacuated as the 
fire crept to within four to five miles of town, Cecka said. The plant was 
spared, but residents were told to continue boiling drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 Near Chelan, about 100 miles east of Seattle, the Tyee Creek fire was moving 
quickly toward the west side of Lake Chelan, toward an area with only a few 
houses. The town of Chelan is on the southeast corner of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of two housing developments west of Chelan were kept away from home 
for a second day Saturday, but residents of another area were allowed to 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 In western Montana, crews fighting two major range and forest fires made some 
gains Saturday but high winds threatened to fan the flames. Firefighters dug a 
line along one-third of the 6,500-acre Henry Peak fire, said fire information 
officer Jack Kendley. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of smaller fires in Montana included the 80-acre Squaw Peak fire, which 
began Friday when the firefighting plane crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Oregon fire crews that had been slowed by rugged terrain made progress on 
that state's last big blaze. The Mendenhall Fire more than doubled in size to 
7,500 acres during the morning, said Roberta Hilbruner of the Northwest 
Interagency Coordination Center in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Elevator Canyon fire sprawling across the Idaho-Utah border had grown to 
more than 20,000 acres but crews kept it from threatening the small towns of 
Portage, Utah, and Samaria, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Wyoming, the Dutch Joe Fire, in heavy timber in the Bridger-Teton 
National Forest, had grown to 200 acres and forest officials closed more than 
30 square miles of the Big Sandy area to recreational use.

ENGLISH MURDER NOT WHODUNIT BUT WHERE-IS-HE; MYSTERY: AFTER 20 YEARS, THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF LORD LUCAN, SUSPECT IN WOMAN'S DEATH, REMAINS UNSOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the British, it is the most intriguing murder mystery of the century, with 
enough sensational elements of class and criminality to satisfy any tabloid 
editor's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 The story: Richard John Bingham, dashing seventh Earl of Lucan and a gambling 
rakehell whose great-great-grandfather ordered the Charge of the Light Brigade 
in the Crimean War, allegedly tries to murder his wife, the Countess, but kills 
the nanny instead by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 After the crime in London's most fashionable neighborhood, Belgravia, Lord 
Lucan flees, makes mysterious phone calls, writes mysterious letters from a 
friend's country house -- and then abruptly disappears from the face of the 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The question remains: Is Lord Lucan, protected by rich friends, hiding out 
somewhere in South Africa, South America, south Australia, or the south of 
France, where various sightings of him have been reported? 
</P>
<P>
 It all happened about 20 years ago. Yet so thoroughly has the crime gripped 
the imagination of class-conscious Britons that the mystery has turned into 
something of a media gold mine: No fewer than three books, three TV 
documentaries and a movie have had their release dates moved forward rather 
than wait until the November anniversary of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great story," says gossip columnist Taki Theodoracopulos. "Of course, 
I think he's absolutely dead. But a lot of people think he's alive. A reader of 
mine in the New York Post says he's alive and well and living in Southampton. 
Sees him almost daily." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have changed their minds, possibly to keep the story alive. Detectives 
Roy Ranson and David Gerring, who when investigating the case believed that 
Lucan was dead, have just published separate books arguing the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 The events in question took place on the night of Nov. 7, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord Lucan, then 39, tall and mustachioed, was called "Lucky" by his friends, 
all men-about-town who frequented multimillionaire John Aspinall's Clermont 
Club on Berkeley Square. Lucan would often spend hours there, gambling, playing 
bridge, eating and drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of the exclusive Eton prep school, Lucan served for a couple of 
years as an officer in the army's elite and fashionable Coldstream Guards 
regiment before joining a London bank and the West End's sporting set and 
squandering his inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, he married attractive Veronica Duncan, a typical "English rose," and 
when he succeeded to his title a year later, she became a countess. They had a 
son and two daughters, but the marriage was rocky, and friends said he found 
her difficult and erratic. 
</P>
<P>
 They separated. He said she was mentally ill and gained temporary custody of 
the children. But he lost possession in a subsequent action, which cost him 
heavily. He complained that his wife was crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucan's checks began bouncing. His children's school fees went unpaid. He 
borrowed money from his friend Theodoracopulos, a millionaire shipping heir, 
and got a large loan from another friend, financier Sir James Goldsmith. Lucan 
acted strange, friends said, and was drinking heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 On the fateful night, as police reconstruct it, Lucan went to the Clermont 
Club and made a fuss with the doorman -- apparently to create an alibi -- but 
he slipped back to his apartment near his wife's house in Lower Belgrave 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucan changed into casual clothes, police said, and headed for his wife's 
place -- since it was the night off for the nanny, 29-year-old Sandra Rivett. 
Lucan allegedly entered with his key, carrying a large canvas U.S. Mail sack 
and a 10-inch lead pipe. His wife and children were upstairs watching 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife would normally make tea in the downstairs kitchen around this time, 
and Lucan, lying in wait, unscrewed the light bulb, leaving the room dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after 9 p.m., a woman appeared, and Lucan struck her repeatedly with the 
pipe. Blood spilled everywhere. Lucan, police said, began stuffing the woman's 
body into the mail bag. He planned to bundle the body into the trunk of his 
borrowed car and then dispose of it -- later slipping back into the club. 
</P>
<P>
 But from the top of the stairs came the voice: "Sandra. Sandra, what's keeping 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
 The nanny had decided not to take the night off. The wrong woman was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Lucan came down the stairs, and her husband grappled with her, police 
said, striking her on the head. She fought back, but the struggle suddenly 
ended as she calmed him down and persuaded him to take her to the bathroom to 
wash off the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she dashed out of the house and up the street to a pub called The 
Plumber's Arms, bleeding and screaming: "Help me! Help me! I've just escaped 
from a murderer. He's killed my nanny." 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived at the house, they found blood everywhere and the mail bag 
containing Rivett's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lucan had fled. He made a call to his mother from an unknown 
location telling her of a "terrible accident" and asked her to get the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Around midnight, he turned up at the country house of friends in Sussex, a 
dozen miles from the English Channel, driving a car borrowed several days 
earlier from a London friend. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked for a stiff drink and told his friend Susan Maxwell-Scott that he had 
been walking by the home and, as he glanced in the window, saw a man attacking 
his wife. He entered, slipped on the blood, and the intruder ran off. His wife 
in the dark mistook him for the assailant. No one would believe this, though it 
was the truth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He drank heavily, wrote two letters to Veronica's brother-in-law Bill 
Shand-Kydd -- also the brother-in-law of Princess Diana's mother -- asking them 
to look after the children. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1:15 a.m., Lucan asked for sleeping pills and was given Valium. He thanked 
Maxwell-Scott and departed in the borrowed Ford Corsair. He was never seen 
again. The bloodstained Ford was found two days later at Newhaven, near the 
ferry terminal for France. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, prominent friends met at John Aspinall's house to discuss 
Lucan's future. Some commentators suggested they acted as an "escape" 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last letter to Shand-Kydd, Lucan wrote, "I will also lie doggo for a 
bit, but I am only concerned for the children." 
</P>
<P>
 One friend, newspaper columnist Charles Benson, believes Lucan is dead. "He 
must certainly have killed himself," Benson said. "He was unhideable abroad. He 
would stick out like a sore thumb anywhere in the world, an Englishman from top 
to toe." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, think Lucan is alive. Restaurateur Michael Proudlock, another 
old Etonian, speaks for many when he argues: "No body was ever found. If he had 
jumped off a ferry, it would eventually have surfaced. I think he got to 
Portugal through friends with private airplanes and then to southern Africa, 
where he is living now on some remote farm." 
</P>
<P>
 The detectives say in their books that he is alive and in hiding -- and 
guilty. Writer Sally Moore produced an earlier book arguing that Lucan is 
innocent of the crime. And one aristocratic woman who used to go out with Lucan 
before his marriage says flatly: "I think he's alive and innocent. He was not a 
murderer. Totally out of character. I think the nanny may have been killed by 
her boyfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 No close friend or family member -- nor those of the slain nanny -- has ever 
made a significant comment outside the court inquiry, at which they recounted 
the above events with slight variations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Countess of Lucan, now 55, is a recluse, living in the same Belgravia 
area. She was temporarily committed to a mental institution when she was found 
wandering in a dazed state several years ago, and according to those who know 
the family, she has been in delicate mental health for the past 20 years. She 
attempted suicide 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She allowed her sister and brother-in-law, the Shand-Kydds, to raise the 
children, who went to the best schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Lucan's son, George Bingham, 26, is a successful merchant banker who 
refuses to accept the title of Earl of Lucan while the mystery lingers. One 
daughter, Frances, 29, is a London lawyer; the other, Camilla, 23, was a 
brilliant classics scholar at Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family," says the son, "has a policy of maintaining as dignified a 
silence as possible."

MAN SENTENCED FOR KILLING DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Lincoln man who killed his daughter by shoving her into the path of a truck 
on Interstate 80 has drawn a 25-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada County Superior Court Judge John Darlington imposed the sentence Friday 
on Mitchell Patterson, 36, who once headed the Lincoln chapter of Ross Perot's 
United We Stand organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson grabbed his 10-year-old daughter, Adrianna, from his parked vehicle 
in the eastbound lanes of I-80 and pushed her into the path of a 
tractor-trailer rig in March, 1993, near Floriston, just west of the 
California-Nevada border. She died from the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 He will have to serve two-thirds of the minimum 25-year sentence -- 16 years, 
8 months -- before being eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender David W. Humphreys sought probation for Patterson. He 
said Patterson was mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assistant Dist. Atty. Ronald Wolfson said Patterson has a history of 
violent and abusive behavior toward his wives. He used his daughter in a 
murder-suicide plan but only succeeded in killing her, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted Patterson of first-degree murder this year.

COURT DEALS FINAL DEFEAT TO SUPERVISOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty months ago, a rancher named Willy Chamberlin won a seat on the Santa 
Barbara County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Or did he? 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the more bizarre election disputes in recent California history, 
Chamberlin's narrow victory over veteran Supervisor Bill Wallace has been in 
question since November, 1992, tied up in a legal fight over a ballot count. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the matter was finally settled by the California Supreme Court. The 
upshot: Chamberlin is officially out. Wallace is in. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began with that fall election in 1992, the one long ago when Bill 
Clinton was elected President. In a high-stakes battle where spending topped $1 
million, Chamberlin -- a conservative who is friendly to coastal development -- 
was declared the winner over Wallace -- a slow-growth environmentalist -- by 
seven votes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the finish so close, Wallace paid for a recount, which narrowed 
Chamberlin's winning margin to 5 votes. He appealed to a Superior Court judge, 
who further cut the margin to 2 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, Wallace pressed on, and finally found victory in April at the 3rd 
District Court of Appeal. In a 62-page decision, the justices declared Wallace 
the winner -- by 12 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, however, Chamberlin had grown comfortable in his supervisor's seat, 
and he appealed to the California Supreme Court. On Thursday, he lost. In a 
two-sentence order, a majority of the state's high court declined to hear the 
appeal. That means the lower court's ruling will stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace, who has been working as a veterinarian since his apparent election 
defeat, was out of town and could not be reached for comment. But slow-growth 
advocates were jubilant, noting that Chamberlin had given the board a 
development-friendly majority at a time of crucial decisions about the county's 
open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace's attorney, Phil Seymour, predicted that his client would be back in 
the supervisor's seat by Aug. 9. "This is very good news" for Santa Barbara 
County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamberlin was not talking. But his close political ally, Supervisor Timothy 
J. Staffel, was gloomy: "I'm disappointed. With Supervisor Chamberlin on the 
board, this county was experiencing a positive change of direction."

BRUSH FIRE BURNS 1,800 ACRES NEAR CONDOR SANCTUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire in Santa Barbara County, fueled by high temperatures and low humidity, 
burned about 1,800 acres of brush in Los Padres National Forest on Saturday 
night and caused concern about a nearby condor sanctuary, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's burned pretty quickly," said Santa Barbara County Fire Capt. Andy 
Rosenberger."It's arid and hot up there." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which began about 11:25 a.m. in the town of New Cuyama, was being 
battled by more than 300 personnel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four air tankers hovered over the blaze, dropping fire retardant, said Ron 
McClain, incident commander of Los Padres Forest Fire Management Team. 
</P>
<P>
 McClain said the state Department of Fish and Game had been notified because 
of concerns that smoke from the fire might harm condors at a nearby sanctuary 
in the forest. But he said the sanctuary was not in any immediate danger of 
being burned. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported, and authorities said no evacuations had been 
required. The fire was burning about two miles north of California 166, 
Rosenberger said. The cause of the blaze had not been determined.

HIGH COURT TO RULE ON MAN'S RIGHT TO VETO SON'S ADOPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Revisiting an emotional issue of family law, the state Supreme Court has 
agreed to decide whether a San Diego man could veto an adoption the day after 
his child was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the seven justices, all but Ronald George, voted Thursday to review a 
lower court ruling that allowed the father, Mark King, to exercise parental 
rights on the grounds that he had shown a full commitment to assume parental 
responsibilities after the birth. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing had been sought by the adoptive parents, John and Margaret Stenbeck 
of San Diego, and a lawyer appointed to represent the 3-year-old boy, who has 
lived with the couple since birth. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves an issue that the state's high court addressed in 1992, when 
it said a biological father who makes a prompt and thorough commitment to 
assuming parental responsibilities has the same right as the mother to veto an 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 King, of Prescott, Ariz., was 20 when he impregnated his 15-year-old 
girlfriend, Stephanie Harman, in 1990. He was surprised by the pregnancy 
because he had undergone a vasectomy, and he had twice beaten Harman, used 
drugs and attempted suicide halfway through the pregnancy, said the 4th 
District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple agreed to the adoption by the Stenbecks, but King changed his mind 
while recovering from his suicide attempt, the court said. However, he did not 
tell the Stenbecks until a day after the child, Michael, was born in February, 
1991. Over the objections of Harman, from whom he had separated, he sued for 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the Stenbecks said in court papers that the appellate ruling in 
King's favor "sends a brutal message both to unmarried teen-age women 
considering adoption and prospective adoptive parents and "opens the door to 
litigation threatening the prospects of a stable home environment." 
</P>
<P>
 But King's lawyer said his client was not to blame for the Stenbecks' pain. 
"They chose to prevent him from having the child and they're now suffering the 
consequences," attorney Paula Mendell said after the appellate ruling in April. 
She also said she did not think the child was suffering because of the dispute.

 President Clinton took a tumble while jogging past the Watergate complex 
Saturday morning, scraping a knee and elbow. He continued running into Rock 
Creek Park, where his motorcade stopped and Secret Service agents tended to his 
cuts. Asked later by reporters how his knee was, the President gave a "thumbs

<P>
 An Afghan reporter for the British Broadcasting Corp. was found shot dead 
Saturday near the Afghan capital, Kabul, where rival factions fighting for 
supremacy blamed each other for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mir Wais Jalil, 25, was killed Friday night by gunmen who captured him when he 
was returning from interviewing Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar at his base 
south of Kabul, the reporter's relatives said in neighboring Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 The BBC in London condemned the killing, and a spokesman described Jalil as "a 
highly professional journalist who was widely respected for his accurate, 
impartial reporting of the events in Afghanistan."

5 CHILDREN ARE RUN DOWN IN FREAK ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a freak accident that overwhelmed even veteran emergency response workers, 
a 2-year-old knocked an idling Thunderbird into gear, running down five 
children playing in a North Hollywood driveway Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Horrified parents and neighbors turned into rescuers, lifting the vehicle up 
and dragging the children out before paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were crying from pain, we could hear them moan," said rescuer Alverto 
Torres, 41. "One didn't move." 
</P>
<P>
 Three girls -- two 10-year-olds and a 5-year-old -- were hospitalized in 
critical condition, and a 6-year-old girl was in fair condition. The fifth 
victim, a 7-year-old boy, suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy unfolded in a working-class area of North Hollywood shortly before 
10 a.m. when Estela Lopez started her car in the driveway and then ran back 
into her house to grab her purse and hurry her three children along for a 
special Saturday treat: breakfast at McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 Her youngest child, a 2-year-old boy, made it outside first, Lopez said in an 
interview. When she turned to go back out to the car, she said, the child 
climbed into the driver's side and the car began to move forward toward the end 
of the drive, where five children were playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said she screamed and then grabbed the rear bumper in a desperate and 
futile attempt to stop the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing the scream and the thud of the car hitting the youngsters, neighbor 
Olga Vega left breakfast cooking on the stove and ran to her doorway. She saw 
her 5-year-old daughter under the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the sound," Vega said, starting to sob. "I see the little kids and 
the car is over them. I wanted to pull her feet. I tried." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time his fire engine and ambulance got to the three-unit apartment 
complex on Agnes Avenue, Fire Capt. Frank David said, the children had been 
rescued from under the car by the neighbors -- who had lifted the vehicle by 
hand and shoved a 4-by-4 board and a car jack underneath. The victims were 
lying on the driveway in various states of consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's toys, two bicycles, a pair of children's safety scissors, a bag 
of Oreo cookies and a picture book were visible under the 1984 Thunderbird, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were expecting to see a typical child hit by a car," David said. "We were 
overwhelmed because it was such an emotional scene and there were a lot of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 When the 2-year-old knocked the steering column gearshift into drive, the car 
moved forward 20 to 30 feet at about 2 to 5 m.p.h., said Los Angeles Police 
Officer Richard Prindle. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at that speed, the car knocked the children and their toys down. "It just 
rolled right over them," Prindle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said it is unclear where each of the children were at the time of 
the accident, Prindle said some were playing on the driveway and others were 
sitting on a couch slightly to the side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a freak thing," he said. "The public needs to know that you don't let 
your car be running with children anywhere near there." 
</P>
<P>
 Prindle said it is unlikely that any charges will be filed, but Los Angeles 
police will continue investigating the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the injured are siblings: 10-year-old Janette, 6-year-old Guadalupe 
and 7-year-old Alex Rodriguez. The two others are cousins of each other: 
5-year-old Leslie Vega and 10-year-old Valeria Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Janette was in critical, life-threatening condition at Childrens Hospital Los 
Angeles. Alex, who suffered minor injuries, was treated and released from the 
Medical Center of North Hollywood, and Guadalupe was upgraded at UCLA Medical 
Center to fair condition Saturday night with leg injuries and multiple 
abrasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie was in critical condition with chest injuries at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Valeria -- in critical condition at Childrens Hospital -- had come from 
Pacoima for a visit, said Leslie's father, Sergio. Having Valeria spend time 
with her young cousins in North Hollywood seemed like a nice break for her, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has such a laugh," Sergio said. "Valeria laughs in such a way that 
everybody wants to laugh when she laughs." 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives said the Rodriguez children often played together outside with the 
neighbor children from the apartments next door. The three loved sharing their 
two pets, Lassie, a golden retriever, and Brandy, a small, fluffy terrier mix, 
with their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Janette, the Rodriguez's oldest, is happiest coloring or playing with her 
dolls, said her cousin, Silvia Lopez. The young girl is also remarkably 
sensitive to the needs of Silvia's sister, Diana, who is retarded, Silvia said; 
the two are particularly close, and Diana carries Janette's picture everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 School has been tough for Janette. With little English spoken at home, the 
girl has struggled through some of her lessons, Silvia said. Playing with her 
older cousins is a diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Rodriguez children, 7-year-old Alex and 6-year-old Guadalupe, whom 
the family calls Lupita, are inseparable, said their great aunt, Maria Lopez. 
Alex adores his youngest sister and she, in turn, follows him everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupita happily goes along with her big brother's three favorite suggestions: 
cops and robbers, cowboys and practicing their favorite Mexican dances. Little 
Lupita is also a daddy's girl, Silvia said, and follows her father, Berto, 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Vega could be any 5-year-old girl, said her father, Sergio, who smiles 
every time he says her name. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a big sister is important to the little girl, her father said. She 
revels in the few minutes here and there when, for a few seconds, her mother 
lets her "watch" her 4-year-old brother and 8-month-old sister. Quiet and a bit 
shy, Leslie's favorite treat is to go to the park with her father for vanilla 
ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors who live in the small, well-kept houses along the narrow street 
where the accident took place continued to drop by the scene throughout the 
morning, asking Lopez to recount the horrible tale again, some of them crying 
with her at the retelling and then offering consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can it happen, this?" asked Maria Lopez, the Rodriguez children's 
great-aunt. "How can it happen?" 
</P>

ALL HE EVER NEEDED WAS A BREAK; SURFING: SUPPORTIVE BOSS, TOP PRO GAVE NORTH 
HOLLYWOOD'S JENKINS THE IMPETUS TO JOIN THE TOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joey Jenkins has always broken new ground. Then again, there weren't many 
professional surfers from North Hollywood to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 None, actually. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jenkins joined the world championship tour in 1989, he was the first from 
the inland locale he calls home. And in four years, his surfing has steadily 
improved to where he is now 13th in the world, though in the minds of sponsors 
he remains that guy from North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've definitely done it the hard way," Jenkins said after dominating his 
20-minute heat Friday to advance to the third round of the Op Pro Surf 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In the water again Saturday, Jenkins led the heat for the first 15 minutes, 
then fell into third place (only the top two finishers advance). With a minute 
left, he caught the wave he needed and scored 5.33 on the judges' 10-point 
scale. When the final buzzer sounded, he was in second place, .30 points ahead 
of the third-place finisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins, 26, learned to surf in Ventura where his family lived until he was 
12. When his family moved to North Hollywood, he stopped surfing for a couple 
of years. In high school he found the desire again and hasn't taken a break 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I joined the tour I used to drive from North Hollywood to Oceanside 
every day to surf because the break is like this," Jenkins said, pointing to 
the Huntington Beach surf. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two-hour, twice-daily drive was an inconvenience, it was nothing 
compared to his life in the months before. At one point, he worked 12-hour days 
selling specialty advertising products, attended evening classes at Valley 
College and continued to work on his surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., then I'd drive straight here in dead traffic and 
paddle out around 8 or 9," Jenkins said. "I'd surf under the lights on the pier 
until about midnight, drive home, catch a few hours of sleep and do it all 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins also was competing in amateur contests on the weekends and finishing 
high enough to crave tougher competition. His family and friends supported him 
all along, but the biggest boosts to his surfing career might have come from 
his boss first, and later, Sunny Garcia, the defending Op champion and a top-10 
surfer on the world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "My boss was a hockey player but he quit to start the company and always 
regretted quitting his sport," Jenkins said. "It was a great job. But he said, 
'Don't do it. Don't quit surfing. Enjoy your youth.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins took his advice, quit that week and entered a contest in Oceanside. He 
wasted no time making his presence known. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunny saw me surfing and said, 'You should be on the tour,' " Jenkins said. 
"I said, 'It sounds great, but. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hawaiian, Garcia is not your standard-issue surf star, either. He 
overcame a broken home and a drug addiction before attaining his lofty position 
on the world tour.  
</P>
<P>
 "Joey and I have a lot in common. His parents were divorced like mine and he 
grew up with his mom and grandparents, like I did," Garcia said. For Garcia, 
encouraging Jenkins to surf the tour was not idle talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I paid his way a couple of times and then I got him all my sponsors," Garcia 
said. "He was so hyped to surf and I was so content, we really pushed each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 The first two years on the world tour, Jenkins improved his surfing and his 
competitive skills but finished 87th and 58th in the rankings. The next year, 
he moved up only one notch to 57th. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the "low-budget years," as Garcia refers to them. Before each 
event, Jenkins sold boards, wet suits and anything else to buy plane tickets to 
contests. Once he slept in a park in Durban, South Africa, and another night he 
shared a tent with Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Assn. of Surfing Professionals, which oversees the competition, 
decided to change the format of the world tour. Originally, the tour consisted 
of more than 20 open events. 
</P>
<P>
 Under reorganization a two-tiered system was created. The world qualifying 
series events remained open and would serve as a proving ground for 
up-and-coming surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 The world championship tour was restricted to the top 44 surfers and only 11 
events. Each year, the top 28 finishers hold their places on the tour and the 
other 16 are filled from the qualifying series. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins finished 45th in 1992 but scrambled onto the 1993 tour courtesy of an 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished 37th overall, which would not have guaranteed him a place this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing he couldn't count on a world-tour berth that way, Jenkins competed in 
qualifying events all year long as well. He finished 11th in qualifying points 
and returned to the world tour for another try. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joey gives 110 percent every time, and sooner or later it's going to pay 
off," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Jenkins is 13th on both tours, but clearly he wants more. 
Paddling out before his heat Friday, Jenkins grabbed a wave at the opening 
buzzer. He scored one 6 and a couple of 5s while the other three surfers in his 
heat were finding 4s. He led from beginning to end, but when he left the water 
he was still not satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't surfing to my potential. Near the end I was doing a little better, 
but I'd like to do better tomorrow," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Saturday, after advancing by the narrowest of margins, it was the same. 
"I'm not making any mistakes but I'm not surfing as explosively as I'd like 
to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than content with the life of a surfing professional, Jenkins has but two 
wishes -- more from the sponsorship community and more from himself. And at 
least one he can count on. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't feel I was improving, I'd be long gone from this tour," he said.

BASKET CASE; AUSTRIAN YOUNGSTER KNOWS THE MAGIC IN GAME HE LOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sandro Bennati doesn't just enjoy basketball. The 16-year-old from Austria 
worships the men who play it. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, his room is wallpapered with posters of Michael Jordan, Charles 
Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon and his favorite player, Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 So perhaps it's not surprising that Bennati found a way to come all the way 
from his native land to attend the Magic Johnson basketball camp at Cal 
Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennati's insatiable appetite for basketball may have finally been satisfied 
Thursday when the camp concluded with a graduation ceremony. "I'll never forget 
this," he said. "This was the greatest week of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennati got this chance only because of a remarkable turn of events nearly a 
half-century ago when the lives of two soldiers -- one an American, one an 
Austrian -- crossed and changed each other's lives forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennati's grandfather, Guenther Flaig, is Austrian, but was conscripted into 
the German army before World War II. In 1946 he was transferred to a 
prisoner-of-war camp at Gorizia in northern Italy after Germany surrendered to 
Allied forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Newmark, a resident of Reseda who was in the U.S. Army, was stationed in 
the camp where Flaig was imprisoned, but they did not know each other at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Newmark was discharged in 1946 and returned to the United States, but went 
back to Europe in 1950 to study languages on a Fulbright scholarship at the 
University of Grenoble. He needed someone to teach him German and put out a 
call for a private tutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Flaig, who was studying philosophy at Grenoble on scholarship from the 
Austrian government, answered, and he and Newmark became lifelong friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just think, had it been a few years before, we could've been shooting at each 
other," Newmark said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Newmark and his wife, Deborah, who helped make Sandro Bennati's journey 
possible. The Newmarks have visited the Bennati family every year in Bludenz, a 
small town nestled in the Alps. During the annual visits, Newmark observed the 
flourishing of young Sandro's love of sports, especially basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such a sports fanatic," Deborah Newmark said. "Every 15 minutes he would 
be calling Jerry to give him updates on tennis, basketball . . . any sport." 
</P>
<P>
 During last year's visit to Bludenz, Newmark told Bennati about the Magic 
Johnson camp. Did Bennati want to go? Was there ever a doubt?  
</P>
<P>
 "At first (people back home) didn't believe it," Bennati said. "My friends 
didn't believe, my coaches didn't believe. Then I showed them (the brochure) 
and then they believed." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennati arrived in Los Angeles last Sunday for the first day of camp. Johnson 
addressed campers for the first time on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fantastic," Bennati said. "The greatest moment for me was when I saw 
Magic for the first time."

 The tuxedoed Baldwin brothers were all smiles as they strolled through the 
ballroom of the Four Seasons hotel in Newport Beach, listening to the fizz of 
champagne, the rustle of sequined socialites and the glowing accolades of their 
peers in the real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
 During the $2,700-a-table charity dinner honoring longtime Orange County home 
builders Alfred E. and James P. Baldwin, Auxiliary Bishop Michael Driscoll of 
the Diocese of Orange blessed the brothers and their ventures -- a blessing 
that seemed already bestowed, given the $155-million junk-bond deal that 
Baldwin Co. had completed 10 months earlier and the $60-million credit line it 
had arranged with General Electric Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Befitting the glitzy occasion, the bishop was followed by a king as 
home-building giant William Lyon mounted the podium at the May 18 dinner to 
praise the Baldwins for their fiscal acumen. 
</P>
<P>
 In a humorous aside, Lyon called the Baldwins' bond deal "the great train 
robbery of 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, that remark now reflects critics' skeptical view of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Former executives allege that bondholders were misled, and some investors are 
nervous about the firm's financial condition. Since collecting the bond money a 
year ago, Baldwin Co. has seen its management team collapse, much to the dismay 
of investors who bought the company's IOUs partly because of their faith in 
that team. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also has left a trail of unpaid and unhappy subcontractors and has 
angered hundreds of Anaheim Hills homeowners by failing to build a 
long-promised community park. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Baldwin Co. is scheduled to make the second of its semiannual bond 
interest payments, and company President Al Baldwin says the $8.5-million check 
will be in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The company must pay about $17 million each year in bond interest -- a big 
chunk of its annual cash flow. In public documents, the company reports it had 
earnings of $28.5 million before interest in 1993, down from $38.2 million the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first quarter of 1994, the company reported a $4-million profit, down 
13% from $4.6 million a year earlier, and said that the costs of stepping up 
construction activities on its various projects caused it to end the quarter 
with $14.8 million "negative operating cash flow." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts look for earnings to exceed high-yield debt payments by a 2 to 1 
ratio each year before they feel comfortable with a company's ability to pay 
off junk bonds. Baldwin reported a 1.9 to 1 ratio for 1993, down from 2.39 to 1 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 75% of the proceeds from last year's bond sale gone to pay off 
old debts, however, the company has little left for ongoing operations. At the 
end of the first quarter it also had used up $41.5 million of its $60 million 
credit line. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin said the company's financial situation is solid and maintains that 
suggestions to the contrary are coming from embittered former employees and 
people who don't understand corporate cash management techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our earnings are up and our sales are up," he said, pointing out that the 
company's revenue from home sales jumped 35% to $63 million for the first six 
months of this year. He would not disclose second-quarter profit until it is 
reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, probably within two months. 
</P>
<P>
 One indication of how tight money is at Baldwin Co., however, is the number of 
subcontractors who are filing liens against Baldwin projects and lawsuits 
against the company, alleging that they are not being paid. In the past month, 
almost $1 million worth of claims have been filed in Orange County Superior 
Court against Baldwin Co. and its various subsidiaries. Other claims for 
non-payment have been filed in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a lot," said Irvine real estate attorney R. Michael Joyce. "A big home 
builder would not want that and would normally have the economic wherewithal to 
get them dismissed." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin shrugs off suggestions that the spate of non-payment suits is an 
indication of financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at the Baldwins as having deep pockets, (with) all this money 
from our bond offering, and some of them think we should pay them for work they 
haven't done," he said. "But the bond money was used to develop lots and pay 
off debt, and now that we're going through a major gearing up and starting a 
lot of homes, we've had to manage our cash." 
</P>
<P>
 In an example of just how tightly managed that cash has been, Baldwin 
representatives pleaded with Anaheim officials this month for a two-year 
extension of their deadline to build a community park in the company's flagship 
development, The Summit at Anaheim Hills. The company argued that it cannot 
afford to build the $1.5-million project yet. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, the company is facing legal action filed by two former top 
managers -- division presidents who say they were forced out because the 
Baldwins didn't want to pay them what they'd been promised. In their suits, 
former Baldwin Ventura division President Robert Burns and Orange County 
division President Geoffrey Fearns also allege that the Baldwin brothers misled 
bond investors by omitting critical information. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns states in his civil suit that he was told by the Baldwins that he would 
have a 10% partnership interest in all company projects within his division, 
but he alleges that the brothers repeatedly put off executing a formal, written 
partnership agreement. The suit alleges, too, that Burns' partnership agreement 
was not disclosed to bond investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns was hired to create a Los Angeles-Ventura division for Baldwin and do 
advance planning for projects. None of the homes planned for the seven projects 
he identifies in his suit had been built when he left the company in January, 
but he states in the suit that he is entitled to 10% of future profits -- an 
amount he estimates to be "not less than $35 million." 
</P>
<P>
 If Burns prevails and does have a claim to a share of future profits, that 
could make the company vulnerable to suits by bondholders. Siphoning off a 
share of project profits for Burns would reduce the amount available to pay 
interest on the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin said that Burns is lying and that he is not concerned about the 
outcome of the suit. "He's a lawyer," he said, "and if there were a partnership 
agreement it would be in writing. There isn't any." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns also alleges in his suit that former Baldwin employees Fearns and San 
Diego division President Gregory Smith were approached by the Baldwin brothers 
who tried to "coerce them into engaging in a sham tax transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers, the suit states, wanted Fearns and Smith to agree to have the 
company "transfer to them certain properties encumbered by substantial 
indebtedness, in exchange for their partnership interest," in the properties. 
The exchange would enable Baldwin Co. to avoid reporting taxable income from 
the properties, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there is no indication that the Internal Revenue Service has begun 
investigating Burns' allegations, Baldwin Co. revealed in its recently filed 
1993 annual report that the IRS is examining it for the years 1979 to 1987 and 
that the result could be a demand for payment of about $8.6 million in back 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin's response to the Burns and Fearns suits is that they were filed to 
create negative publicity about the company in order "to leverage us to pay a 
lot of money they don't have coming to them. And we're not going to pay them 
for work they didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Burns, Fearns and Smith all have left the company since the 
bonds were sold may ultimately have more effect on Baldwin Co. than anything 
alleged in the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Goldman, head of bond trading at the Los Angeles brokerage Jefferies & 
Co., said a large mutual fund that invested in the Baldwin bonds is very 
concerned about the exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start asking questions," he said, when the management team presented 
during the sale of a bond issue is gone six months later. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds, which are now yielding about 12.5% interest, have been trading 
recently at a 10% to 15% discount from their sale price -- not unusual given 
the overall drop in the bond market recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond nervous investors and angry former employees, the Baldwin brothers are 
dealing with other woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Martinez bought a home in the Summit development partly because the 
company promised to build a 16-acre park there. But at a July 19 public hearing 
before the Anaheim City Council, Martinez was one of more than 100 homeowners 
who attended to express anger over what they characterized as foot-dragging by 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the start of construction on the park is months overdue, the 
council negotiated a compromise that requires construction of a playground by 
early next year but postpones completion of the rest of the park until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Feldhaus and other council members told homeowners at the 
hearing that they were concerned that Baldwin Co. could be pushed into 
bankruptcy if the park issue were forced -- and the company's representative at 
the meeting did not step up to the podium to counter the impression that a 
single park was all that stood between the company and bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had cash flow troubles, and then they sold some junk bonds. That's the 
way I know they are having trouble," Feldhaus said in an interview. He said 
company officials didn't tell him, however, that they were going bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't audit their books, so I don't know what their position is," he said. 
"But that's the alternative -- they could file bankruptcy and walk away from 
the park completely." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin denies vehemently that such a thing could happen, and such a 
scenario certainly would have been unthinkable in the 1980s, when Baldwin Co. 
consistently ranked among the top 10 builders in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 30 years since it was incorporated, Baldwin Co. has built 15,000 homes 
in Southern California, most of them in master-planned communities in Orange, 
San Diego and Ventura counties. Before the California real estate boom went 
bust in 1990, the Baldwins outgrew the role of merchant builder -- buying lots 
from other, bigger developers -- and began purchasing huge tracts of land 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Those developments include the 800-acre Portola Hills in Trabuco Canyon, the 
591-acre Summit in Anaheim Hills, the 850-acre Carmel del Mar in San Diego and 
the 24,000-acre Otay Ranch planned-community project near Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have some exceptionally well-located properties, but it remains to be 
seen whether they can bring those projects to the market on a timely basis," 
said Kenneth Agid, an Irvine real estate marketing consultant. "It's a major 
challenge for a company with a seasoned management team to bring these projects 
on line, and right now there's a lot of change inside the Baldwin Co." 
</P>
<P>
 Other challenges are coming from bitter subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've always been slow to pay, and if you work with them, you know that," 
said Mark Job, an estimator with Banner Concrete in Riverside. His company 
worked for Baldwin on a Summit condominium project. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've had a lot of problems with subcontractors who they haven't paid, so 
they can't get them to work," he said. "They always pay us, but the pay has 
been slower in the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Another subcontractor, Orange cabinetmaker Canac Kitchens Ltd., is suing 
Baldwin for nearly $300,000 it says it is owed for four projects in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wouldn't pay until we filed the suit. They just ignored all of our 
demands," said Irvine attorney Robert L. Bachman, who is representing Canac 
Kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once the suit was filed, they started making weekly payments, which is 
very unusual. The norm is cash in 30 days." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Canac, a major supplier of kitchen cabinetry to home builders across 
the West, has had payment problems with many builders during the recession. The 
Baldwin situation, however, "has gone on longer than most," he said. "I think 
Canac let the debt build because of Baldwin's size and reputation. They 
couldn't believe the company wouldn't pay." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canac suit was filed June 2. On Friday, the day after Al Baldwin was 
interviewed and asked about the case, Canac General Manager Brian Magee called 
The Times and said his company plans to drop the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Canac has five contracts with Baldwin Co., he said, and the companies' 
relationship "is a good one." Baldwin Co., he said, "has paid substantially all 
of the money" that Canac was seeking in its lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Canac, subcontractors who have sued Baldwin Co. in Orange 
County Superior Court in the past month include the company's longtime grading 
subcontractor, Ebensteiner & Co. The Agoura Hills firm has filed two suits 
alleging that Baldwin has refused to pay about $500,000 in bills for work at 
several projects in late 1993 and early 1994. The company has been Baldwin's 
principal grading contractor for almost a decade. Company owner Paul 
Ebensteiner did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin said Ebensteiner has surrendered control of the company and that 
Baldwin officials "don't like what they are doing now." He said Ebensteiner & 
Co. has billed for work that Baldwin Co. doesn't think was properly done. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth suit was filed this month by Prime Plastering Co. of Norco seeking 
$63,000 that is says Baldwin Co. has refused to pay for work done at one of the 
company's condominium projects in Portola Hills earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is not unusual for a large building company to have a long list of 
liens filed against it by subcontractors, lawsuits are less common. They 
indicate that the builder is refusing to pay rather than delaying payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald P. Therrien, Baldwin's chief financial officer, said such suits are a 
fact of life for builders and often stem from disputes over the quality of a 
subcontractor's work. Subcontractors who blame Baldwin Co. for their own woes, 
he said, just aren't facing reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin Co. was strapped for cash last year when it turned to Wall Street. The 
company was in default on more than $100 million of its $183 million in debt 
and had to use most of the bond proceeds to pay off overdue loans. It was left 
with only about $30 million for new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 That a company mired so deeply in financial difficulty could sell bonds based 
on its promises of a rosy future caused other Southern California developers to 
cheer. After three years of deep recession, they said, the Baldwin deal showed 
that investors were finally regaining their confidence in Southern California 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin agrees with that: The company's valuable land holdings, he said, 
were more attractive to the investment community than its 30-year history of 
profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond issue in July, 1993, was well received on Wall Street. The deal was 
oversubscribed by hungry investors -- meaning that more bonds were sold than 
were initially offered. 
</P>
<P>
 But some traders now say their initial enthusiasm waned quickly. Though the 
bonds' value picked up Friday with news that the company had completed a 
$14.9-million land sale Thursday in San Diego, they had dropped shortly after 
they were issued last year when the company posted lackluster quarterly 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Mueller, managing director of the high-yield department for Bear, 
Stearns & Co., the New York brokerage that sold the bonds for the Baldwins, 
defends the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "What investors anticipated were the quarterly numbers predicted in the road 
show," such as home sales and the number of homes built but unsold, he said. 
"But the Baldwins look at the big picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the company is privately owned, he said, it was not as concerned with 
the differences between quarterly and long-range numbers as a publicly traded 
company might have been, "so people got a little jittery," Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin says that no such numbers were ever tossed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made no projections on the road show or in the prospectus," he said. "We 
talked about our historic performance, about our land holdings and about future 
product lines, but we made no projections." 
</P>
<P>
 That was not the perception in the investment community. 
</P>
<P>
 David Siegel, chief financial officer for Presley Cos., a Newport Beach home 
builder, said that the Baldwin bond deal made his company's private sale of 
$200 million worth of junk bonds last month more challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the Baldwins didn't make their numbers, as many people have 
stated, really created some caution on the part of bond buyers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If a company prices a deal "and then comes out with really bad results, people 
are upset," said one trader who asked not to be identified because of concern 
that the comments could affect the price of the company's bonds and the 
trader's relationship with clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts see Baldwin Co. in a much more positive light. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Allen, a home building expert with the brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin & 
Jenrette in New York and a satisfied owner of a Baldwin condo in Del Mar, said 
she sees a bright future for some Southern California builders, especially 
those like Baldwin that have access to Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Agid agreed. "They are pioneers," he said of the Baldwin brothers, 
"and they have survived what have been some very tough and lean years. Those 
two are survivors."

JAMES FLANIGAN: MEDICAL INDUSTRY RESPONDS TO MARKET'S TONIC DOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the big health care debate enters the home stretch in Congress, many 
particulars of the Clinton health plan -- regional alliances, health boards, 
employer mandates -- are mostly dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a dramatic slowdown in medical cost inflation, a stated goal of the whole 
exercise, is being realized as the industrialization of medicine proceeds 
apace. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical costs are rising roughly 5% to 6% this year after more than a decade 
of double-digit increases. And the trend is toward further cost containment. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical field is getting a dose of what already has happened in the 
pharmaceutical industry, where benefit managers simply order lower prices on 
the drugs they buy for corporate health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Now insurance companies and corporate health plan buyers are saying bluntly 
just how much they will pay for medical procedures. And, like steel mills and 
auto parts suppliers before them, hospitals, research labs and medical 
practices are merging and forming alliances, seeking economies of scale to 
lower the cost of services. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices are coming down. Some hospitals that do a large volume of operations 
are offering open heart surgery for $17,000 as opposed to $45,000, the going 
rate in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of cost reduction is coming out of doctors' wallets. Incomes of 
specialists -- the higher-paid 60% of America's 650,000 physicians -- are said 
to be dropping, although definitive statistics from the American Medical Assn. 
have not yet been published for 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers are picking up more of the tab. The hottest item in the medical 
marketplace is an insurance plan called point of service that allows consumers 
to choose their own doctors if they shoulder higher deductibles or co-payments. 
Thus, consumers are asked to pay for something -- choice of physician -- that 
used to be taken for granted and paid for by all insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend has been building for a few years, so where we're headed is pretty 
clear. When and if a health bill is passed in August, U.S. medical care will 
continue to be financed through employers and insurance companies, with 
physicians at their financial mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk of rising costs used to fall on employers, in days when doctor and 
hospital bills were not questioned. Now the balance of power has shifted, and 
pools of medical service purchasers -- big companies and coalitions of small 
and medium-sized businesses -- are taking advantage of an oversupply of 
hospitals and doctors to dictate terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan, which in theory was to be consumer-dominated, might have been 
easier on doctors. Under the plan, regional alliances would have formed buying 
groups of 1 million or more individuals to wield market power. But doctors and 
hospitals might have had a better chance arguing costs with them than with the 
business world's sharp-eyed purchasing managers. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the Clinton plan, which was hatched in some secrecy, was dead 
almost before it arrived. The public didn't believe White House claims of low 
costs but found the insurance industry's Harry and Louise commercials warning 
of bureaucracy to be credible. The American Medical Assn. failed to get behind 
Clinton's plan early and even now says it is only "nonpartisan." 
</P>
<P>
 But there should be no regrets, because the marketplace revolution we do have 
may bring good health care at lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gresham's law -- of bad driving out good -- is not working in health care. 
Rather, the superior organizations in U.S. medicine are likely to improve with 
reform, as the best companies -- Ford, Hewlett-Packard, Shell Oil and such -- 
have improved as their industries have constantly restructured. 
</P>
<P>
 Premier institutions such as Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic are making 
alliances nationwide. The Scripps Institute of Medicine and Science in San 
Diego has formed alliances with major hospitals in its area and is talking 
about merging hospital operations with UC San Diego. Kaiser Permanente, a 
pioneer of managed health care, has formed a joint venture with PacifiCare, a 
major health maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Institutions don't have to be large to succeed. One of the most efficient 
operations in the country is Mercy Hospital in Janesville, Wis., southwest of 
Milwaukee, which serves as the critical care facility for a four-county area 
extending to Rockford, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology is playing a big role. The Marshfield Clinic in central Wisconsin 
is hooked into 65 localities via computers and telecommunications. Rural 
communities are no longer isolated from superior medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 In large cities, hospitals are specializing -- one will concentrate on heart 
surgery, another on kidney transplants -- achieving greater skill as well as 
economy. Productivity will rise in the medical field as it has in manufacturing 
and agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Change was inevitable for the economics of some medical practices. AMA 
statistics show incomes of some specialists -- surgeons, 
obstetrician-gynecologists -- almost doubling from 1982 to '92. Nothing wrong 
with earning more, but you have to expect countervailing influences to arise in 
our market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Kenneth Abramowitz of Sanford C. Bernstein, a New York research firm, 
captures the outlook in a major new report. "Ten years from now, this 
revolutionary change will lead to far more cost-effective hospital, 
pharmaceutical and medical supply industries to the benefit of the most 
innovative companies," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "However," he adds, "the odds do not favor a painless transition." 
</P>
<P>
 For the long term, Abramowitz recommends major HMOs, such as FHP International 
and PacifiCare, and also United Health Plans, which serves the Southeast. And 
he calls Johnson & Johnson the best positioned health care company in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Schumarry Chao, who formerly headed a clinic at County-USC Medical Center 
and the medical practice of Aetna Life & Casualty, sees export opportunity -- 
especially in China, where she was born. "With China's policy of one child per 
family and rising affluence, the demand for the best medical care will grow," 
she said. "And U.S. care is the best." 
</P>
<P>
 The year of debate has not been in vain. It has focused attention on the real 
challenge in U.S. medical care, which is to rein in costs without impairing 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet that challenge, the Clinton Administration thought government had to 
remake the system. Instead the marketplace is adjusting, at a lot lower cost. 
It wasn't Harry and Louise who defeated the White House, but its own lack of 
understanding of how the country works.

IN THE SHADOW OF THE '80S; YESTERDAY'S HIGH ROLLERS STRUGGLE IN A NEW ERA OF 
SOBRIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Like other scoundrels caught red-handed, convicted con man Barry Minkow says 
he has renounced crime and found Jesus -- and he's banking on his dramatic 
conversion from Judaism to make a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentenced to 25 years in prison in connection with one of the largest Wall 
Street scams ever, the founder of the ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning company in the 
San Fernando Valley may be paroled from federal prison as early as next July, 
after serving about a third of his term. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll be only 29 and ready for a new career in the public eye: writing and 
talking about past errors and his redemption through religion. Eventually, he 
says, he hopes to repay his victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus are the deeds and misdeeds of the glitzy 1980s transmogrified in the 
1990s, as the high rollers of yesteryear struggle to survive in a new era of 
sobriety. Long gone are the myriad tax shelters, rocketing property values and 
swelling securities markets that marked the 1980s as a time of easy money 
unprecedented in American history. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast is especially stark in California, which suffered through the 
worst recession in the nation following unparalleled real estate inflation. It 
is here that one easily finds those whose careers symbolized the successes and 
excesses of the time -- and those who now are coping with the decade after. 
</P>
<P>
 Legitimate business executives became overextended and endured painful 
retrenchments. Others started out as legitimate businessmen and became involved 
in increasingly questionable activities that eventually landed them in trouble. 
A few seemed headed for trouble from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
 Terren Peizer was a financial prodigy who became rich while still in his 20s, 
working for Michael Milken's marvelous money machine, as Forbes magazine once 
dubbed Drexel Burnham Lambert's junk bond operation in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Spiegel was a controversial trailblazer in the highly uncertain world 
of banking deregulation. His relatives were majority shareholders in Beverly 
Hills-based Columbia Savings, once the fastest-growing thrift in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 John Peter Galanis was the ultimate promoter in the golden era of tax 
shelters. Even then, though, Galanis went about his business largely behind the 
scenes, because of a previous conviction for securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are they today? 
</P>
<P>
 Peizer is quietly prospering, having distanced himself from Milken and Drexel 
following his testimony about some of the worst financial excesses of the 
period.  
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel will soon face charges that he looted Columbia Savings & Loan, whose 
failure could ultimately cost taxpayers more than $1 billion. He says he is 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanis is back in jail, with little chance of parole any time in the 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Terren Peizer would just as soon let go of his past, when he literally worked 
at Milken's elbow on the legendary black, X-shaped trading desk from which 
Milken oversaw his financial empire. From there, Peizer had a ringside seat to 
a financial circus of junk bonds and debt-financed mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 When law enforcement officials cracked down on Drexel, Peizer agreed to 
testify against Milken in exchange for immunity. In the process, he earned the 
reputation as "the man who ratted out Mike Milken." 
</P>
<P>
 Peizer denies he gave up Milken to save himself. For one thing, he says, he 
did nothing illegal. For another, he notes that he was only one of several 
witnesses who cooperated with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a private investor, Peizer still lives in the condo he bought nine years 
ago, when he came West to sit at Milken's left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Peizer was brought on to handle the account of money manager David Solomon's 
firm, a major customer of Drexel junk bonds. He was entrusted with the blue 
notebook that detailed the deals between Solomon, Milken and a junk bond mutual 
fund called the Finsbury Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The transactions included generating false commissions, inflating the prices 
of bonds and creating phony tax losses for Solomon, wrote author James B. 
Stewart in his best-selling book, "Den of Thieves." Details of the transactions 
are contained in court documents in the Milken case and in Peizer's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Peizer says today that he was unaware of the nature of the transactions or 
their legality: "I didn't really know why we were doing (any of it). I didn't 
have all the information." 
</P>
<P>
 As law enforcement officials closed in, Peizer relinquished control of the 
blue notebook at Milken's request. But he says he kept copies of other critical 
Drexel documents, which helped form the basis of a deal to testify against 
Milken in exchange for immunity. 
</P>
<P>
 After being indicted on 98 counts of securities violations, Milken ultimately 
pleaded guilty in 1990 to six felony charges, including manipulating stock 
prices, and served two years in prison. (Through a spokeswoman, Milken declined 
to comment for this article.) 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Peizer has fared well since that time. Now 34, he manages his 
own investments through a private holding company, Beachwood Financial, named 
after his hometown in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Peizer has invested heavily in about half a dozen emerging companies, often 
taking a large stake and sometimes assuming the role of chairman. In March, he 
traveled to West Africa to study possible investments in mining companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Peizer confirmed that he is worth more than $50 million, but he avoids the 
usual accouterments of wealth such as big houses and expensive cars. He says he 
prefers the company of old friends and the informality of blue jeans and 
sweats. 
</P>
<P>
 He remains in touch with a few acquaintances from Drexel, whom he declines to 
identify. As for the mood of those days in Beverly Hills, he says now: 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a very Jonestown type of environment. A lot of us used to joke 
about it: 'Who drinks the punch, and who didn't.' It was like a cult, because 
Mike Milken made a lot of people very wealthy." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Thomas Spiegel, the former head of defunct Columbia Savings & Loan, has fallen 
long and hard since the days when he was the nation's highest-paid S&L 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 He remains free on $1 million bail as he awaits a trial in September on a 
60-count federal indictment charging that he looted Columbia to finance his 
lavish lifestyle. If convicted, Spiegel, now 48, faces fines of more than $10 
million -- and the prospect of spending virtually the rest of his life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "He systematically took advantage of the institution," alleges John Walsh, 
assistant U.S. attorney and chief of the major frauds section in Los Angeles. 
"The institution was a victim and, ultimately, (so were) the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 In better days, Spiegel was a wheeler-dealer who schmoozed with people he 
deemed important and lived a fabulous lifestyle virtually unheard of in the 
banking industry. His father, who survived a Nazi death camp, had been a highly 
successful Southern California home builder. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hailed the younger Spiegel as a visionary who understood how to operate 
a savings and loan in a deregulated environment. But most regulators and 
competitors regarded his securities investments with disdain. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel invested so much of Columbia's deposits in junk bonds that the 
financial institution eventually became Drexel's single largest customer. 
Columbia failed in 1991 after the junk bond market crashed, severely eroding 
the value of its assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure meant the end of Spiegel's perks. Out went the corporate jets, 
chauffeured limousines, ski resort condos and gun collections. Government 
liquidators disposing of Columbia's assets evicted him last year from his 
Beverly Hills mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel remains on a budget; his assets were frozen in July, 1990, by the 
Office of Thrift Supervision, which has ordered him to pay back more than $40 
million. That covers both money he allegedly looted from Columbia and some of 
the losses incurred while Spiegel was chief executive, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Spiegel is impoverished. He has leased a new home only a block south 
of his old digs on North Palm Drive. And he is allowed to spend $250 an hour 
for a lawyer and $2,500 a month for office space, according to court records. 
(Spiegel has vigorously challenged the spending limitations, so far to no 
avail.) 
</P>
<P>
 As he prepares his defense, Spiegel has sublet office space in Westwood from 
his friend Merv Adelson, a former vice chairman of Time Warner Inc. who was 
also a friend of Milken's. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Spiegel administers the Columbia Charitable Foundation, the 
successor to the savings and loan's nonprofit foundation. The foundation had 
$22.7 million in assets at the end of 1992, according to the state Registry of 
Charitable Trusts. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his lawyer, Spiegel denied repeated requests for an interview. When a 
reporter showed up unannounced at his marble-lined office suite -- where he 
appeared fit, wearing shorts and polo shirt -- he refused to comment.  
</P>
<P>
 In court documents, Spiegel has steadfastly maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 John Galanis was, to put it mildly, a piece of work: At times so crude he 
resembled the character played by John Belushi in the film "Animal House," he 
once spent more than $15,000 for a dinner party at the tony New York restaurant 
Lutece. 
</P>
<P>
 Jailed once before for securities fraud, Galanis rode the wave of Reagan-era 
tax laws that allowed investors to write off passive tax losses from real 
estate developments. The new laws unleashed a torrent of cash from wealthy 
investors eager to cut their taxes, and it was in this environment that the 
300-pound Galanis found himself swimming in money. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 51, Galanis was eventually convicted in 1988 of 44 federal counts of 
racketeering, fraud and other charges in connection with a series of fraudulent 
tax shelters and oil and real estate investment schemes that occurred 
nationwide. He later pleaded guilty to New York state charges as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanis now lives in decidedly modest accommodations on Seaside Avenue in San 
Pedro, having lost his luxury homes in Rancho Santa Fe and Del Mar as well as 
his $2.5-million estate in Greenwich, Conn. He's at the federal prison on 
Terminal Island, where he is likely to be a resident for at least the next nine 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a lavish spender and epicure of Gargantuan proportions, Galanis is now 
penniless, his lawyer claims. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time called one of the Top 10 white-collar criminals in America, 
Galanis is estimated to have squandered $150 million from thousands of 
investors -- among them actors Eddie Murphy and Kirstie Alley. His schemes 
eventually led to the failure of savings and loan institutions he secretly 
controlled, former prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanis was sentenced to 27 years in prison, one of the stiffest sentences 
ever given a white-collar criminal. He declined to be interviewed for this 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, the major civil suits against Galanis have been settled. In some 
cases, former investors have had to accept a return of pennies on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanis now spends his days as an orderly, or janitorial helper, in his cell 
unit. He also teaches reading classes to other inmates. His lawyer says he is 
in poor health. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the federal parole board upheld a ruling that Galanis had to serve at 
least 15 years of his sentence. Galanis is still trying to get that reduced. In 
the meantime, his presumptive parole date is July 30, 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Chandra, now lives quietly in a modest home in Encinitas with two of 
Galanis' four sons, according to Brian Barrett, one of Galanis' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of his lawyers, Barry Feiner, said much of the coverage of Galanis' 
story has been full of "mischaracterizations." 
</P>
<P>
 "His conviction stemmed primarily from two issues: tax fraud and 
non-disclosure of his participation. . . . " Feiner said. "In addition, it was 
never established that Mr. Galanis' actions were responsible for the closure of 
any federally insured institutions that would not otherwise have failed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Minkow now starts his day at 3 a.m., when he reports to work in the 
bakery of the Lompoc Federal Prison Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Minkow has been a model prisoner. And his good behavior may 
result in an early release, now tentatively scheduled for next July. 
</P>
<P>
 Minkow freely admits today that he was wrong. "The company and me . . . were 
both frauds," he said in a recent videotape detailing his scams. 
</P>
<P>
 After starting ZZZZ Best in his parents' Reseda garage at age 16, Minkow was 
barely 20 when he sold shares in the firm to the public. Articulate and 
charming, he was a natural for television and was soon being touted as a Boy 
Wonder of Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether because of the times or the credulous reporting by the media, many 
were taken in by Minkow -- not just wealthy investors, but also auditors for a 
large accounting firm and major banks that lent him -- and eventually lost -- 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1987, the company was revealed as a giant Ponzi scheme. Money from one 
set of investors was recycled to pay off others. Investors lost as much as $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Minkow -- who was raised in a non-religious Jewish family -- attributes 
his new humility to a conversion to fundamentalist Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran the wrong way with ZZZZ Best," he said in a recent telephone interview. 
"I embarrassed my family. I hurt a lot of people. But Christ says, 'Get back in 
the game. . . . Go get 'em for me.' . . . And that's what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last seven years, Minkow has earned bachelor's and master's 
correspondence degrees in religion from Liberty University, founded by Jerry 
Falwell, in Lynchburg, Va. He is working on a second master's degree and a 
doctorate in theology by correspondence with the University of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 In prison, he teaches courses in apologetics, the religious defense of faith. 
And as a chaplain's assistant, he occasionally delivers sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he has appeared without pay in a video produced by the 
National Assn. of Certified Fraud Examiners, advising accountants how to avoid 
scams like ZZZZ Best. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of all this, he has written a 350-page autobiography, scheduled to be 
released by a Christian publisher sometime next year. His agent, Clint Horsley, 
is receiving a $14,500 advance for the book, most of which defrays expenses, 
Horsley says. 
</P>
<P>
 Minkow's plans include a second book, a speaking tour and, ultimately, a 
ministry. Any money, aside from modest living expenses, is scheduled to go to a 
victim's reimbursement fund, officials say. (At the time of his conviction, 
Minkow was also ordered to repay victims $26 million out of his future 
earnings.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, one of the last remaining investor lawsuits arising from the scam, 
against the successor to the accounting firm that audited ZZZZ Best, is 
scheduled to go to trial early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Are people convinced of Minkow's rehabilitation? "He has the ability to be 
enormously successful by operating legitimately," says James R. Asperger, the 
former U.S. attorney who led the prosecution of Minkow and his cohorts. 
"Whether he is truly rehabilitated remains to be seen."

BRETTON WOODS: THE ECONOMIC EQUIVALENT TO D-DAY INVASION; WORLD TRADE: 
CONFERENCE'S POLICIES LED TO POST-WAR PROSPERITY. BUT ARE CHANGES NEEDED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty years ago this month, representatives of 44 nations gathered in the 
northern New Hampshire town of Bretton Woods, against the backdrop of the green 
slopes of Mt. Washington. There, far from the battlefields of World War II, 
they designed a massive, unprecedented reconstruction of the world's shattered 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a century later, the legacy of that conference is an integral part of the 
global economic landscape. From households in Anaheim to conglomerates in 
Zurich, the world is still reaping major rewards of Bretton Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 From that small town in New Hampshire sprang the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund. Of even more overarching importance, Bretton Woods 
gave birth to a philosophy of openness in world commerce that remains the holy 
grail of international economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It spawned a world in which economic liberalism has become the dominant 
philosophy," said C. Fred Bergsten, a senior Treasury official in the Carter 
Administration and now the director of the Institute for International 
Economics. "Economic prosperity has been unprecedented. Economic stability has 
been unprecedented. There's been no major collapse. It has underpinned global 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as they salute the lasting accomplishments of the coordinating system 
conceived at Bretton Woods, an elite group of central bankers, corporate 
executives and financiers from around the world has raised a fundamental 
question for global leaders to ponder: Is it time to do it all over again? 
</P>
<P>
 After a decade of financial market gyrations that recently propelled the U.S. 
dollar to new post-war lows, there is a move afoot to craft a sweeping reform 
plan that would revitalize some of the central ideas and institutions of the 
original Bretton Woods accord. While the proposal elicits a skeptical response 
from government policy-makers in Washington, Bonn and Tokyo, it has provoked a 
flurry of debate among global financial experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the 50th anniversary hubbub surrounding D-Day and other events, the 
anniversary of Bretton Woods has drawn little notice outside the tightly knit 
world of international economists. Yet in its own way, it is just as important. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bretton Woods participants gathered in July, 1944, allied troops were 
pressing through northern France toward Paris. In the South Pacific, U.S forces 
were routing the Japanese from their island strongholds. 
</P>
<P>
 Those battles, and the economic precursors to the war, were the backdrop for 
the deliberations at the Mt. Washington Hotel. The site was chosen because, 
unlike some New England resorts, it would provide a room to U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr., who was Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 Woven throughout the conference were the lessons learned from World War I and 
the troubled years between the two global conflicts. It was an era of political 
weakness, protectionism, hyperinflation and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 If the post-war world was to prosper, the participants recognized, it would 
have to learn from the economic failures that fueled the war that was still 
raging. Put simply, it would have to conduct its future business -- from broad 
monetary policy to country-by-country trade -- in a much more open, but 
orderly, fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 The philosophical descendants of the Bretton Woods economists -- the 
participants included John Maynard Keynes -- say the openness has been the 
conference's enduring legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the anniversary observation has also led to a critical examination of the 
structures set up at Bretton Woods, the coordinating system it put into place, 
and their lasting impact on world affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly sharp criticism has been aimed at the International Monetary Fund 
and the World Bank for what some observers regard as extravagant spending on 
staff travel and perquisites. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the twin institutions have been accused of having little to 
show for their efforts to underwrite development projects in Africa and Latin 
America despite 50 years of staggering economic growth in Europe, the United 
States and, more recently, Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Another primary objective of the original Bretton Woods accord has been 
abandoned altogether. Strict control of currency exchange rates was abandoned 
in 1971, replaced by a system of floating exchange rates.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the shift provided the United States and other leading nations more 
flexibility to pursue domestic economic priorities, it introduced the 
volatility that has periodically shaken the international monetary community. 
</P>
<P>
 Two major changes in the world financial structure were recently recommended 
by the independent Bretton Woods Commission, chaired by former Federal Reserve 
Chairman Paul Volcker and made up of corporate officials, former government 
officials, academics and bankers from the United States, Germany, Japan and 15 
other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report, the panel recommended that major industrial nations strengthen 
their fiscal and monetary policies to achieve greater harmony, and do a better 
job of coordinating their activities in order to avoid exchange rate 
volatility. 
</P>
<P>
 A failure to deal with the problems caused by skewed or wildly fluctuating 
exchange rates can create uncertainty that chokes off the international 
investments, the report warned. That, in turn, could lead to "protectionist 
pressures from vulnerable industries in one major country after another as 
their international competitiveness waxes and wanes" with changing currency 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the study will have any lasting impact is debatable. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, speaking to a group of conference 
participants who were considering the recommendations, was nonplussed, saying 
that quiet cooperation and consultation between governments are preferable to a 
radical restructuring. Among other global economic leaders, most notably those 
from Japan and Germany, there was no evident enthusiasm for the Volcker 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Other criticisms have come from a group called Fifty Years is Enough. The 
coalition of 82 environmental, religious and labor groups, among others, wants 
to pressure the World Bank to give greater weight to the social and 
environmental impact of its lending policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the accepted rules of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, 
new borrowers must attempt to bring down trade barriers, develop sophisticated 
markets, reduce labor costs and remove subsidies that offer domestic industries 
unfair trade advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're polarizing these countries' economies and politics, and that is going 
to come back to hurt the international community," said Doug Hellinger, 
managing director of the Development Group for Alternative Policies, one of the 
founding members of the "Fifty Years is Enough" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In its broadest sense, Bretton Woods spawned a largely free-flowing system of 
global trade and investment. What was in 1944 a relative trickle of 
cross-border commerce -- less than $1 billion a day -- has become a financial 
torrent estimated at more than $1 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have an open trading system, Americans would have gotten VCRs 10 
years later, and they wouldn't now be getting to rent videos," said Lawrence H. 
Summers, undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs. "If we 
didn't have an open trading system we'd still be driving gas-guzzling cars. If 
we didn't have an open trading system, we'd still be producing steel in 
large-firing plants where people went deaf. If we didn't have an open trading 
system, clothing would cost twice as much as it does." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Summers, the spirit of Bretton Woods produced a more dynamic 
world economy. "It spurred a good deal of the innovation that took place in 
this country, and it gave us access to a whole set of things at lower cost than 
we otherwise would have had access to," he said. "And all of that translated 
into higher real income" for most Americans.

 The economic system put in place by Bretton Woods may have also played a key 
role in preventing a third global conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing that happened after World War II is there wasn't a 
World War III. The reason there wasn't a World War III is in no small part 
because a network of economic interconnections was created, and capitalism 
succeeded," Summers said. "We won the Cold War because we in the West prospered 
together, and we prospered together because we integrated our economies." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, "economic thinking was homogenized in the way that McDonald's has 
homogenized our taste," said Antoine van Agtmael, president of Emerging Markets 
Management, a firm that invests in developing countries. "It is overlooked, but 
it is incredibly important."

 The U.S. dollar has fallen roughly a third in value against the Japanese yen 
since 1989 and about 12% against the German mark since 1988. Yet, the greenback 
has also held fairly steady against the British pound in recent years and 
appreciated 19% against the Canadian dollar. The dollar in these currencies:

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: ASK FOR TAX REFUND AFTER SHOPPING IN 
EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're the typical American traveling to Europe this summer, chances are 
you're going to spend at least some of your time shopping. But you might not 
realize that you may be entitled to a partial refund on what you pay for goods 
purchased there. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping consistently ranks among the top vacation activities for U.S. 
travelers overseas, according to the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration in 
Washington. The average American spends more than $2,500 on a European vacation 
-- and some estimate that at least 10% of that goes to clothing, china, 
crystal, watches, souvenirs and other goods that tourists plan to bring home. 
</P>
<P>
 However, few Americans realize that "value-added taxes" account for up to 24% 
of the price of goods they buy in Europe. A value-added tax is essentially a 
sales tax that's tacked on to the cost of goods at every stage of production. 
While the tax is substantial, it's hidden because it's simply factored into the 
cost of everything you buy, rather than added in at the time of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, in some cases, the tax is refundable. 
</P>
<P>
 If you buy a $100 sweater in Sweden, for example, you can apply for a $20 VAT 
credit. The $500 designer gown bought in Paris, where VATs account for 15.7% of 
your purchase price, would make you eligible for a $78 refund. And the $350 
crystal set you pick up in London could net you a 14.9% refund, or $52. 
</P>
<P>
 You also pay VATs on car rentals, hotel accommodations and meals. The refunds 
apply only to items that tourists take home. (Separate, and somewhat more 
generous, rules apply to business travelers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, roughly $30 million in VAT refunds go unclaimed each year, says Steve 
Jarmel, a spokesman for Europe Tax-Free Shopping, a Chicago-based service that 
helps U.S. tourists get VAT refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? The taxes are complicated and easily misunderstood, and the rules about 
how to qualify for a refund vary. For example, though VATs are charged all 
through Europe, in some cases you can get a refund only if your purchase 
exceeds a certain amount. The amount varies from country to country, sometimes 
even from store to store. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sweden, a tourist can get a 20% VAT refund if he or she buys something 
worth more than about $15. (The minimums are set in each country's currency, so 
fluctuations in the value of the dollar affect the VAT minimum purchase 
hurdle.) In France, tourists can receive VAT refunds only if they purchase 
merchandise worth more than 2,000 francs -- that's about $385 at today's sorry 
exchange rates -- in a single store.  
</P>
<P>
 In Britain, stores set their own minimums. Typically, British merchants won't 
fill out the VAT refund paperwork unless you buy more than $50 to $75 worth of 
goods, says Robin Prestage, a spokesman for the British Tourist Authority in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 To further complicate matters, refunding the VAT is voluntary. Generally 
speaking, merchants do it because it's good business. But some don't -- and 
they don't have to. Even merchants who provide the refunds won't necessarily 
offer them unless you ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salespeople don't talk as much in Europe as they do here," says one European 
official. "They tend not to volunteer a lot of information about the VAT or 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: If you want a VAT refund, ask in the store if it's available. 
And you must ask the clerk to fill out the paperwork before you leave. 
</P>
<P>
 How exactly does it work? Again, the answer varies in different countries, but 
consider how the system works in England, one of the top destinations among 
U.S. tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants decide whether to provide VAT refunds, then set their own minimums. 
Once you exceed the threshold, however, the refund amount is calculated on the 
entire purchase price, not merely on the amount that exceeds the threshold. In 
other words, a $100 item would net a $14.90 refund in a London store regardless 
of whether the store's minimum is $50 or $75 or $100. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the refund, ask the sales clerk to fill out a VAT refund form for you. 
Then hold on to your sales receipt and the paperwork until you leave the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 At the airport, a customs agent must sign the VAT form, verifying that you 
are, indeed, exporting the purchased items out of Europe. (If you're having the 
item shipped home, the store should subtract the VAT from the cost at the time 
of sale, because the store is exporting the item. But again, ask to be sure.) 
</P>
<P>
 Once customs has stamped your VAT form, you have two choices: You can apply 
for a refund directly through the government -- there are often government VAT 
refund desks in the airport -- or you can take the paperwork to a refund 
service, such as Europe Tax-Free Shopping, also frequently found in airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Refund services should give you the refund immediately, either in cash or by 
crediting your charge card. But they'll charge a hefty fee to do it. Europe 
Tax-Free Shopping, for example, charges 20% of the refund amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The government will give you the full amount, but it may take months. Checks 
are denominated in the foreign country's currency, so you could have to pay a 
bank fee to convert the money to U.S. dollars. But if you ask, you can often 
have foreign government refunds credited to your charge card. The credit card 
company automatically converts the refund to U.S. dollars.

BROTHERS' RISE TO RICHES BEGAN ON THEIR FATHER'S CHICKEN FARM; DEVELOPMENT: 
AFTER 38 YEARS AND 15,000 HOUSES, THE BALDWINS' NEWPORT CENTER-BASED COMPANY IS 
AMONG THE TOP 15 BUILDERS IN THE SOUTHLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Noel Baldwin was well into his 40s when he quit his job as a mail clerk and 
turned his Temple City chicken farm into a housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget the day my dad walked out into our front yard, where we 
actually grew sweet potatoes," said son Alfred E. Baldwin, now 50. "He took 
some white chalk and drew a square area, then he handed me and my brother two 
shovels and said, 'Start digging.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's where we built our first house. It took about a year." 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Baldwin started that new business in 1956 and, with the help of Al, 
who was 12 at the time, and son James, then 16, built five homes in the next 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The first house sold for $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the company is one of the top 15 builders in Southern California and 
ranks among the top 100 in the nation. It has built more than 15,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Piloted by Al and Jim for more than 20 years, the company has weathered 
several recessions and is now building in six master-planned communities. The 
largest is the 24,000-acre Otay Ranch in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 After their father retired in the early 1970s, the Baldwin brothers moved the 
company to Orange County, first setting up near builder William Lyon on Campus 
Drive in Newport Beach and later moving to Newport Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Baldwin, now 55, is the driven older brother who overcame polio to become 
a collegiate skin-diving champion. After graduating from Woodbury College in 
Los Angeles with a degree in business administration, he joined the company 
full-time in 1964. That same year, he married his fiancee, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of four is an accomplished off-road race car driver and owner, a 
former U.S. national spear fishing champion and an avid deep-water fisherman 
who pilots his motor-sail yacht, the Osprey, on jaunts to his beachfront home 
in Baja California's Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin, now 50, shares that passion for fishing, especially fly-fishing, 
and is also a hunter. He built his first home when he was just 20. The 
two-story California ranch house with a white picket fence was completed in 
1964. Al graduated from USC with a business administration degree and joined 
the company full-time in 1965. He and his wife, Deeanne -- they married the 
same year as Jim and Nancy -- also have four children. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many major developers, the Baldwins have given generously to local 
organizations such as City of Hope, the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 
Orangewood Children's Home and the Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian cancer 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwins and their wives also support various political candidates, 
individually and corporately. Each gave Gov. Pete Wilson nearly $2,500 on March 
17 for his reelection campaign, for a total of $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers who grew up on a chicken farm are now known for their lavish 
lifestyle. They own a ranch in Wyoming, a ski lodge in Sun Valley and a home in 
Cabo San Lucas -- Al is still building his. They travel often. Their primary 
residences are custom homes in the exclusive Emerald Bay community adjoining 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Al is the soft-spoken public relations man, while Jim is the tough, blunt 
brother who handles the company's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 That the two complement each other is the source of the company's strength, Al 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You talk different to your brother or your sister than you do anyone else," 
he said. "I mean, you grew up together. . . . There is an underlying 
relationship of confidence and trust that permeates the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Though several of Noel Baldwin's grandchildren now work at the company, too, 
Al said he and Jim aren't trying to build a dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to control the destiny of my children," he said. "Yes, I have a 
company, and, yes, I want to see it continue. . . . But I don't want to force 
them into anything.";

MEN FIND THEIR PLACE IN KITCHEN, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Picture this: a kitchen, pots simmering on the stove. Someone is chopping 
ingredients for a gourmet meal. Expect this to be a woman? 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. Chances are very good that the chef, and the purchaser of the wine, the 
china and the espresso machine, is a man. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study shows that men, either as part of families or alone, are in 
large numbers buying household goods and foods and consider themselves 
knowledgeable and interested. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate study also says men are becoming more interested in purchasing skin 
care and fragrance products, with part of the growing demand stemming from the 
increasing frequency of men doing the household shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Although women are consistently targeted by advertisers and marketers as the 
primary household purchaser, men are shopping, cooking and giving parties, the 
statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Shifrin Research, a public opinion research firm, men who enjoy 
food and wine -- epicures -- make up 30% of the adult male population. 
</P>
<P>
 And according to the survey for Food and Wine magazine, men who like to cook 
at home and eat in restaurants appear to be as involved in buying food as women 
in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Male epicures may not define themselves as such, but for the purpose of the 
study they are, because they fit certain criteria, such as enjoying fine 
dining, wine and purchasing and preparing food. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring men as potential purchasers is as foolish as car companies that until 
recently targeted their advertisements only to men, said Cheryl Wilbur, 
director of research, sales and development for Food and Wine. 
</P>
<P>
 While more than 90% of women surveyed buy various common food items, male 
epicures and male subscribers to Food and Wine buy them at slightly higher 
percentages. 
</P>
<P>
 In all categories of purchasing food and non-food items, the men were as 
involved or slightly more so than women. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, more than 68% of male epicures were likely to buy pots and pans, 
a figure equal to that of women. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to knives and cutlery, 56% of male epicures said they purchased 
them in the past year or intend to buy the items. Women were below 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the male epicures (61%) said shopping for food is fun, compared 
to 49% of women in the control group. 
</P>
<P>
 What does the male epicure look like? According to Shifrin, he's between 25 
and 54 years old and has an average household income of $37,500 a year. More 
than 80% have at least some college education. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-eight percent of male epicures are married or in domestic partnerships 
and 53% have children under 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty percent own their own homes and 62% always or frequently do the grocery 
shopping for the household.

SECURING YOUR CHIMNEY IN CASE OF QUAKE; HOME IMPROVEMENT: ANCHORING BRICK 
CHIMNEYS CAN HELP KEEP THEM FROM COLLAPSING DURING AN EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

on home improvement topics for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps the most powerful lesson of the Northridge earthquake is that living 
where we do -- in one of the most seismically active areas of the world -- we 
must take as many realistic steps as possible to reduce the hazards we face in 
our homes. 
</P>
<P>
 We have heard a lot about the importance of bolting houses to their 
foundations, anchoring furniture and water heaters, installing automatic gas 
shut-off valves to protect against fire and other safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
 One very important precaution that has not been publicized, however, is 
anchoring or bracing brick chimneys to the roof-rafter system to help keep them 
from collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chimney failures were extraordinarily widespread on Jan. 17. A number of 
people were injured by flying debris, and it was only the luck of the timing of 
the temblor that many deaths did not result from tons of bricks falling into 
living rooms all over the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchoring a chimney to the roof rafters requires some expertise with welding 
equipment. If you are fairly handy this can be a do-it-yourself project, but 
most homeowners would be better off contacting a welding or iron installation 
company for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 A brace for the typical chimney consists of a band of steel about two inches 
wide and one-quarter inch thick encircling the brick stack about a foot below 
the top. It is bolted into the bricks in several places. 
</P>
<P>
 Welded to this band (usually at the corners) are at least two lengths of 
"angle iron" or "flat bar" steel about the same thickness and width as the 
band, that serve to tie the chimney to the roof. These supports will normally 
extend back toward the roof about the same distance that the chimney extends 
above the roofline. Ideally they are positioned at an angle to form a rough "V" 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, they are bolted with heavy lag bolts through the roof surface and 
into the roof rafters. To prevent rain leakage, the bolt holes are predrilled 
and filled with silicone sealant before fastening, then the entire attachment 
point is covered with roofing cement. The hardware can be painted to match the 
chimney and/or roof surface to help camouflage it. 
</P>
<P>
 As with any seismic safety measure, there is, of course, no guarantee that the 
brace will hold in any and all earthquakes here in the Southland. However, no 
chimneys I know of that were properly braced failed last January, and, given 
the small investment of time and money relative to the possible pay back, most 
building inspectors, architects and engineers would agree that it makes sense.

REEL ESTATE; OFFICES OF MOVIE MOGUL IVAN REITMAN CAPTURE THE SLEEK, POLISHED 
LOOK OF A HIGH-TECH MOVIE SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Success in Hollywood is measured in many ways. For most of the princes of the 
industry, success may be calculated in such ephemera as box office grosses and 
Oscars. For the top-most movie makers, success is represented by something more 
tangible -- a private building. 
</P>
<P>
 This show-biz edifice complex is almost as old as Hollywood. It dates back 
beyond Charlie Chaplin, who built his own studios on La Brea Avenue in the 
early 1920s, up to super-agent Michael Ovitz's grand new headquarters in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 More than any other form of accolade, the office-studio building with one's 
own name on it marks a player as top dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, only a handful of producers and directors connected with local 
studios have earned this ultimate privilege. Two of them have name buildings 
located on the grounds of the Universal Studios in Universal City: Stephen 
Spielberg and Ivan Reitman. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast between the styles of the two adjacent buildings is illuminating. 
The creator of "E.T.," "Jurassic Park" and "Schindler's List" opted several 
years ago for a fake-adobe Southwestern style for his private enclave. Reitman, 
creator of "Ghostbusters" and "Dave," has chosen a highly sophisticated Late 
Modernist design for his new complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by Barton Myers Associates, Reitman's $4.5 million studio-office is a 
subtle update of the style made internationally famous by such local masters as 
Richard Neutra and Rudolph Schindler in the 1930s and '40s. It's a style marked 
by a crisp geometry of white stucco surfaces, large areas of clear glass and 
sleek, uncluttered detailing inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-story, 21,000-square-foot building overlooks the Tujunga Wash and 
the Lakeside Golf Club to the north. It is designed like an amphitheater, 
embracing this foreground and the more distant view of the San Gabriel 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's spine is a curved wall of stucco and glass facing the view. 
This wall, supported by free-standing circular steel columns, ties the various 
elements of the complex together and provides a visual focus for the interior 
layout. 
</P>
<P>
 The first floor, above a semi-subterranean 50-car garage, is divided into 
three zones. You enter up a stairway from the garage, past a glass-block 
water-wall into a two-story lobby. The lobby is dominated by a sweeping 
internal stairway with a glass balustrade, capped by a glazed rotunda equipped 
with motorized screens that move with the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 This stairway is the pivot of the plan. To the right on the first floor are 
the production company's staff offices. To the left is a 30-seat screening 
room. Set apart on the far side of the curved spine wall is a separate pavilion 
housing the conference and dining rooms, which open onto a paved terrace 
overlooking the golf club. 
</P>
<P>
 The upper floor houses Reitman's own office suite and the main editing rooms, 
plus a private gym. 
</P>
<P>
 An airy, understated elegance pervades the building at every level. The 
screening room, finished in mahogany and ash with gray leather upholstery, is 
luxurious without ostentation. The glass-fronted conference room allows the 
view to dominate the decor, with only an elaborate floating ceiling over the 
central table as a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Reitman's own office underplays his status as movie mogul. The finishes are 
simple: they comprise a mahogany floor, an irregular-shaped lacewood and maple 
desk and a wall of bookshelves and audio-visual equipment. Here again the 
clarity of the design counterpoints the landscape beyond the wide windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The same simplicity of finish and detail gives the building's exterior its 
distinction. Taking his clues from Neutra, Myers has carefully considered the 
junctions where glass meets stucco. 
</P>
<P>
 To emphasize the Cubist clarity of his compositions, Neutra always strove to 
make these junctions as crisp as possible. With the advantage of a technology 
Neutra would have envied, Myers has used a high-tech, structural silicone 
glazing material that eliminates window mullions and allows large panels of 
unframed fixed and movable glass set directly into the stucco. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that, from the inside, the wide, floor-to-ceiling glass areas 
seem to float past the walls. From the outside, the windows appear as 
transparent screens contrasted against the solid white stucco. Where the 
windows wrap around a corner, the edges of the building appear to float in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 A slatted redwood screen on the south-facing entry is the only exterior 
surface that varies from this strict counterpoint of stucco and glass. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a mistake. The crudeness of the slats shows up against the sleekness 
of the rest of the building's surfaces. If this was a deliberate gesture, 
intended to point up the sophistication of the rest of the finishes, it fails. 
</P>
<P>
 This lapse of taste apart, the Reitman studio-office complex stands as one of 
the finest Hollywood ego-palaces ever built. To find its equal in elegant 
simplicity you have to look back to the best 1920s, '30s and '40s Art Deco and 
Moderne film set designs, admired around the world.

AT HOME: AFFORDABLE HOMES DRAW FAMILIES TO VALLEY; RESEDA: DESPITE EARTHQUAKE, 
ETHNICALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITY HOLDS APPEAL FOR FIRST-TIME BUYERS.

 After Ronit and Hilton Sher were married in the mid-1980s, they moved to the 
United States from their native South Africa and rented a townhouse-style condo 
in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw a nice condo on a beautiful street in Reseda. We liked its central 
location," said Ronit Sher, an executive secretary who works in Chatsworth, 
"and found it was the most reasonably priced place to move." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years later, when the Shers, now with two young sons, decided on a home 
of their own, they stayed in Reseda for the same reasons they rented. 
</P>
<P>
 They bought a half-acre lot and built a 3,000-square-foot two-story home with 
four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a formal living and dinning room, and a family 
room. And the neighbors, said Ronit Sher, "are fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought a property and built a house that someplace else would have cost us 
double," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda, an ethnically diverse community of 80,000, including Latino, Asian and 
Middle Eastern residents, is situated in the center of the San Fernando Valley. 
It is bounded by Roscoe Boulevard on the north, by Victory Boulevard on the 
south, by Corbin Avenue on the west and by White Oak Avenue on the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Shers, Elaine Adler was also attracted to Reseda for its 
affordability when she bought her home 21 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my husband and I went to buy a house, we looked in West Los Angeles, but 
everything was old and small," Adler, a public librarian, recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I made an appointment with a realtor in the San Fernando Valley. I told 
her our price range and she took me to this house. I was impressed. The house 
was almost new and it looked enormous to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Adlers paid $37,500 for a three-bedroom, two-bath, 1,400-square-foot home. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some changes since Elaine Adler bought her house two decades 
ago. She's now single with two sons and two dogs, and her Reseda home is 
considered to be in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a year ago, residents campaigned to change the name of a square mile 
section of Reseda located between Victory Boulevard and Topham Street. "I'm in 
Tarzana now, but the ZIP code is the same, so none of the neighbors use the 
name," Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with the change, her feelings about where she lives are the same. 
"It's a nice home to start out with and end up with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda is a moderately priced neighborhood, said Herb Lambert, a real estate 
agent with the Jon Douglas Co. in Encino. "Even though there are some new 
houses, most of the homes were built in the '50s and have three bedrooms and 1 
1/2 baths," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices range from $92,000 for a 900-square-foot home with two bedrooms and one 
bath to $237,000 for a 2,300-square-foot home with four bedrooms and three 
baths, he said. The median house sells for about $144,000 and is 1,200 square 
feet with three bedrooms and 1 1/2 baths. Condos sell from the $90,000s to the 
mid-$100,000s. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, Lambert said, home prices fell only a small percentage 
because they are already low. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda's business district, located near the intersection of Sherman Way and 
Reseda Boulevard, has several blocks of storefront shops as well as a variety 
of international markets and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last several years the business community has had problems with 
boarded-up stores, dilapidated buildings and graffiti. With the Northridge 
earthquake (the epicenter was actually in Reseda), there's also been damage to 
buildings, causing some businesses to go under. 
</P>
<P>
 A group called the Reseda Business and Community Alliance is trying to turn 
the business district around. They expect to receive federal earthquake relief 
funds and plan to use the money to renovate buildings and clean up the streets 
to attract new business. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it became a San Fernando Valley suburb, the land was home to sheep and 
cattle ranches. But a drought in the late 1800s killed many of the animals, and 
soon after, the ranches were replaced by farms growing wheat, lima beans and 
lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1913, the landowners, the Suburban Homes Assn., planned to develop the 
area. They named the community Marian, after the daughter of Gen. Harrison Gray 
Otis, one of the association's directors. The post office objected to the name 
because there already was a town named Mariana. So the name was changed to 
Reseda, a Spanish word for the mignonette flower that grew in the area. Reseda 
remained an agricultural community until late 1940, when several tracts of 
homes were built and the population started to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Efren and Daisy Masangkay bought in Reseda nine years ago, after looking 
throughout the San Fernando Valley for several months. They bought a 
1,400-square-foot home with three bedrooms and two bathrooms on a half-acre lot 
for $116,000. 
</P>
<P>
 With three children, a large yard was top priority for them. "I wanted a place 
for them to play and I wanted some privacy. We have a huge back yard," said 
Efren Masangkay. 
</P>
<P>
 Their house is well built, the couple knows for sure. Although only two blocks 
from the epicenter of the Jan. 17 quake, it suffered only minor cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masangkays like their neighborhood, which has a mix of older people and 
young families. Efren said the crime is low, and they all watch out for one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read about the crime in the newspapers, but over here, I haven't heard of 
anyone having their house broken into or their car stolen in the nine years 
that I've lived here," said Efren Masangkay. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior lead officer Mark Pryor of the Los Angeles Police Department's West 
Valley Division said crime in Reseda is a little higher than last year, but 
that it's due to the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake made a lot of places unlivable and people homeless," he said. 
"It made parking structures unsafe, so people are parking their cars on the 
street where they are getting broken into and stolen." 
</P>
<P>
 Pryor said that there are several gangs in Reseda, and some have been involved 
with drive-by shootings. To help cut down on the crime, he said the police 
department encourages the local residents to become more involved with their 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to make people more aware of how to protect their property by 
using Neighborhood Watch," Pryor said. "We also have an 'Eyes and Ears 
Program.' Volunteers work with the police by standing on top of buildings using 
walkie-talkies to report crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pryor, whose beat includes the business district: 
</P>
<P>
 "Every one of these businesses is owned by a different ethnic group. There's 
Indian, Vietnamese and Japanese restaurants. There's a couple of Persian 
markets that draw people from all over the Valley because of the variety of 
food and produce that they carry. 
</P>
<P>
 "People from all over are buying little businesses and trying to make ends 
meet. It's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Greenspan hadn't even thought about looking in Reseda when she went 
searching to buy a home in 1988. She knew she wanted a convenient location to 
shopping and her job as a manicurist in Encino. After looking at several small 
fixer-uppers in a higher-priced neighborhood, she decided to give Reseda a try. 
</P>
<P>
 "The houses I could afford were old and dilapidated. I don't know how to screw 
in a light bulb, so tearing down a kitchen just wasn't for me," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
 She saw an ad in the newspaper for new townhomes in Reseda and drove to the 
site. She fell in love with all that she could buy for her money. "There were 
just the frames of the building, not even a model," Greenspan said. "But from 
the pictures and sketches they had, it seemed to be everything I really 
wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 She bought a 1,500-square-foot townhouse with an attached garage, two 
bedrooms, two bathrooms and a small back yard for $142,500. The complex also 
has a pool and spa. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Greenspan like owning a new home in a convenient location, the 
single mom enjoys taking her son Jake, age 1 1/2, to Reseda Park. "Jake and I 
feed the ducks and the squirrels. We love it here," she said. At a Glance

YOUR MORTGAGE; TAX GLITCH HURTS MANY FIRST-TIME BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Distributed by the Washington Post 
Writers Group.

<P>
 Here's the deal: Zero dollars down payment on a brand new three- or 
four-bedroom house. All you pay up front are the closing costs on the loan, 
transfer taxes, title insurance and inspection fees. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, you've got to be a bona fide first-time home buyer. You've got to 
have a monthly household income sufficient to handle mortgage payments equal to 
100% of the home price -- at least for the first five years. 
</P>
<P>
 One other requirement: The home you're buying can't be expensive. Its price 
should be no more than 75% of the cost of the average newly constructed 
single-family homes in your area. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound inviting? Sound like the sort of financing that can help solve the 
toughest problem confronting many would-be first-time home buyers: How to 
accumulate the 10% or 20% down payment needed to qualify for a mortgage? 
</P>
<P>
 Tax and homebuilding experts say such a concept could indeed put thousands of 
renters into homes they can economically afford nationwide if Congress would 
simply correct a little-noticed glitch in federal tax law. 
</P>
<P>
 The glitch, focus of a bill soon to be introduced by Rep. Bill Goodling 
(R-Pa.), crept into the federal tax code through legislation passed in the late 
1980s. Inadvertently, Goodling said, the change had the side effect of killing 
fledgling, private efforts under way to bridge the affordability gap for 
first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 York, Pa., homebuilder Barry R. Rauhauser's zero down payment program caught 
Goodling's attention. Rauhauser's Eagle Building Inc., has developed, 
constructed and sold 150 moderately priced, single-family homes to first timers 
-- all using no or low-equity conventional, non-governmental financing to 
enable the purchasers to swing the deal. In one 18-month period, Rauhauser sold 
100 new homes in the $70,000-$80,000 range with zero or minimal down payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The financing was the key: If buyers could demonstrate that they had almost 
everything needed to qualify for homeownership -- good credit, stable jobs, 
steady incomes -- Rauhauser would supply the sole missing piece to the puzzle: 
all or most of the down payment dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Through an agreement with a local savings bank, Rauhauser's firm provided 
qualified first-time purchasers a conventional 30-year first mortgage of 80% at 
prevailing market interest rates. On an $80,000 house, that would mean a 
mortgage of $64,000. The 20% balance due -- the buyer's equity -- took the form 
of a second mortgage note held by Rauhauser. The note carried the same market 
rate as the first mortgage, a 30-year amortization schedule, with a lump sum 
balloon payment due at the end of the fifth year. Only purchasers with incomes 
adequate to handle the combined first and second payments were permitted to 
participate. The cash requirement for closing and escrow expenses averaged 
$2,500 per house. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept had obvious attractions for consumers. But it also worked for the 
local lender and for Rauhauser. The lending institution was willing to 
participate because it knew the mortgaged houses and land represented solid 
collateral, well beyond its 80% risk exposure on the first mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauhauser liked the arrangement: It produced a huge jump in sales volume and 
the second mortgage notes also created a steady cash flow. The loans have 
proved to be "extremely high quality," says Rauhauser, with just "three or 
four" of the 150 houses experiencing serious payment delinquencies or other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is this innovative, privately funded and run program for first-time 
buyers now dead? Because it was blind-sided by tax law changes aimed at targets 
far different from Rauhauser -- primarily firms and individuals seeking tax 
shelters. In their wake, the second mortgage notes paid by Rauhauser's young 
buyers now constitute installment contracts, to a "dealer" in real property. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the dealer -- Eagle Building -- must pay taxes immediately on the 
full price of each home sold, even though it never collected 20% of that amount 
(the deferred down payment), and is receiving it in monthly dribs and drabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind paying taxes on income when I receive it," Rauhauser said, "but 
I can't pay taxes on income I haven't even gotten in my pocket yet." The tax 
code glitch has already cost Eagle about $300,000 to cover taxes due on 100 of 
the 150 homes. The others were sold prior to the effective date of the code 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is where Goodling's forthcoming tax bill enters the picture. Though it 
wouldn't get Rauhauser his $300,000 back, it would amend the Internal Revenue 
Code to allow builders like Eagle to use traditional installment sale treatment 
-- paying taxes only on the profits as they're received pro-rata -- on second 
mortgage notes provided to finance qualified first-time home buyers acquiring 
newly built, modest-cost dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal already has attracted the backing of trade groups like the 
National Assn. of Home Builders and the Pennsylvania Builders Assn. Analysts at 
the Treasury Department are "studying it," according to a spokesman, but have 
no definitive comment on it yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, according to Rauhauser: "When the private market comes up 
with an intelligent, effective way to put people into houses -- with no 
government bureaucracy involved -- why should federal tax policy stand in the 
way?"

CONDO Q & A: FINDING RIGHT ATTORNEY FOR ASSOCIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Hickenbottom is a past president of 
the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), 
a national nonprofit research and educational organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I live in a 28-unit homeowner association in the San Fernando 
Valley. I was recently elected to serve on the board of directors. Our 
association needs to consult with an attorney about the meaning of our legal 
documents. How do we find an attorney that specializes in community association 
law? Were can we obtain a legal reference book that contains all of the laws 
that govern homeowner associations? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: The Los Angeles County Bar Assn. has a referral line that you can 
call. The number is (213) 243-1525. Be sure to specify that you want to be 
referred to the panel of condominium and homeowner association attorneys. You 
will be provided with one attorney's name unless you state that you would like 
to interview more than one attorney. There is a $25 referral fee. 
</P>
<P>
 You can obtain a list of attorneys who are members of Community Assns. 
Institute by calling the Greater Los Angeles chapter at (310) 285-8286. There 
are several other CAI chapters throughout the state and the nation. The CAI 
chapter cannot endorse or recommend any particular lawyer, but a list of the 
attorney members can be provided to you. 
</P>
<P>
 An excellent, comprehensive legal reference book is available for $46.90 from 
the publisher, Capco, 1200 Pasep Camarillo, Suite 160, Camarillo, Calif. 93010. 
The book, called the California Community Assn. Reference Guide, contains 
portions of the Civil Code, Corporation Code, Code of Civil Procedure, 
Non-Profit Mutual Benefit Corporations Code, Health and Safety Code and 
Business and Professions Code that pertain to community associations, as well 
as Department of Real Estate regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 An abbreviated, pocket-sized reference book, the Condominium Bluebook, is 
available from Community Assns. Institute for $10, plus shipping and handling 
charges. All of the local CAI chapters throughout the state of California sell 
these and other helpful publications. Contact the local chapter. Board Members 
Should Be in Good Standing 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Our association recently held its annual meeting and new board members were 
elected. One of the board members is delinquent in the payment of his monthly 
assessment. Some people believe that he ran for the board of directors so that 
he could have his delinquency forgiven when he became a board member. There is 
a rumor that he intends to sell his unit or make arrangements with the mortgage 
lender to release him from his financial obligations. What can be done if the 
rest of the board members go along with his scheme? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your association's declaration or bylaws should be consulted. The documents 
may state that only members "in good standing" can be elected to serve on the 
board. In that case, the election could be challenged if less than nine months 
have elapsed since the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors is not the privileged class of the association. The 
board members must pay their monthly assessments just like all of the rest of 
the owners. All of the board members have a fiduciary duty to oversee the 
finances of the association in a prudent manner and enforce the collection 
procedures fairly and consistently. Failure to collect from one owner means 
that all the rest of the owners will eventually pick up the tab. This affects 
every owner. 
</P>
<P>
 You have the right to review the financial records if you believe that the 
board is failing to collect the delinquent assessments. Send a letter to the 
board requesting permission to have access the records. The board should 
respond to your request within 10 days. If the board fails to disclose 
information to you, that may be an indication that they are not actively 
pursuing the delinquency. The board may think that they should protect the 
delinquent owner's privacy but they also must consider the other owners right 
to know whether delinquent accounts are being collected. Board members can be 
held responsible if they fail to carry out their fiduciary duties. If you feel 
that the board members are willfully neglecting their responsibilities or if 
you want to challenge the election, consult an attorney who specializes in 
community association law. How to Get Board of Directors' Attention 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My gated community has private streets that are maintained by the 
association. The paving in one of the cul de sacs has settled to the extent 
that water does not drain off properly. This results in stagnant puddles of 
rotting leaves and trash. The board of directors won't make the repairs. Can 
the affected homeowners withhold the monthly assessment? Can we open a separate 
bank account and pay our assessments into the account until the association 
makes the repairs? 
</P>
<P>
 If not, what can we do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Never try to get your board's attention by withholding your monthly 
assessment. That is definitely the wrong approach, because most associations 
file liens against owners whose accounts are 60 or 90 days delinquent. 
</P>
<P>
 Your letter does not state whether the board has ignored the problem or if 
they have considered repairs but then determined that the repairs would be too 
costly. The board has the responsibility to maintain the association's property 
but they also have the right to make decisions about when and how the work will 
be done. Perhaps the board has more important tasks that they are working on. 
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion, you have a choice between appealing to the board for the repair 
or minimizing the problem by doing some physical work yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 First, you can try the business-like approach with the board. Prepare and send 
to the board a petition letter with owners' signatures who are affected by the 
debris in the street. Include photographs so that the board will be able to see 
the problem. If the stagnate water is a mosquito breeding spot, call this to 
their attention. Include in your letter a request for some time during the next 
board meeting to present you letter in person and discuss the board's response. 
If possible, volunteer your time to assist the board in getting bids, so that 
you will find out the cost of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board fails to take action after you have presented your letter and 
spoken to them at the meeting, it may be because they do not feel that the 
problem is serious. At that point, you may want to consider using a mediator to 
resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an alternative. You may not like my practical approach, but I suggest 
that you take a shovel or broom and clean up the debris from the street when it 
accumulates. You may resent it the first time that you do it, but you will 
probably be happy that you have improved the appearance of your street. Perhaps 
your neighbors will assist you and you can organize the neighborhood broom and 
shovel brigade.

 The war has begun! 
</P>
<P>
 Well, let me back up a little. It didn't start out as a battle. In fact, it 
began much more innocently. After our first spring in our new home, when we 
lugged over 150 bags of weeds out of our not-so-big back yard, we wanted life a 
little easier. We decided to spend our fall and winter tending to the yard a 
few hours a week and save the huge effort we normally spent before planting 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 With the weed situation well under way, we spent our energies turning in soil 
amendments, seeding the lawn and ordering seeds for our next season's vegetable 
crop. But being the impatient person I am, I just can't wait for my herbs to 
come in. So off to the local nursery I went. I had had problems with ants 
destroying my dill, so I bought a clay strawberry pot to plant the dill, sage, 
chives and oregano in. The basil (my favorite) never had any bug problems, so 
that went into the ground with collars made out of old two-liter plastic 
bottles to guard against bugs (just in case). 
</P>
<P>
 After carefully planting my bountiful crop, I went out a few days later and 
checked on its progress. The basil was nothing but chewed off stalks and the 
dill and sage were just beginning to get eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a plethora of gardening reference books and subscribing to many 
gardening magazines, I was sure slugs/snails were "the enemy." The damage was 
just like what those slimy creatures normally did. One cure for these garden 
pests that I had read about was putting up a copper barrier. Apparently, when 
they cross copper, it reacts with their body chemistry and causes an electric 
shock. I relished the idea! Since I do stained glass as a hobby, I have rolls 
of adhesive-backed copper foil. I wrapped this around the bottom of my 
strawberry pot and waited. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, I sent my boyfriend, Jason "The Bug Slayer," out to see how many 
smoldering corpses he could find. To our shock and disgust, it wasn't slime 
balls that were eating my herbs, but earwigs. Next to the potato bug, there is 
not a more repulsive garden creature to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 We knew there were tons of earwigs infesting our garden, but just assumed they 
were somehow "beneficial." I mean, who ever heard of earwigs eating your 
seedlings? It was back to the gardening books for us. In all of those books, 
only one even mentioned these vile creatures. It suggested rolling up wet 
newspaper at night and in the day (when the earwigs hide in tight, damp places) 
just tossing the bug-infested rolls in the trash. That sounded easy enough. Of 
course, it just wasn't that easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Our yard already has plenty of much more attractive tight, damp places for the 
little vermin to hang out in. If you could choose between a Motel 8 or the 
Ritz, where would you go? 
</P>
<P>
 So back to the local nursery we went. The Certified California Nurserypeople 
who work there were full of about as much advice as our gardening books. The 
best advice they could offer was to poison them. We try to stay away from as 
much poison in the yard as possible for two reasons: 1) we eat what we grow and 
don't like eating chemicals; and 2) we have a lovely dog that we like alive. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked like we would have to come up with our own battle strategy. I 
decided to start with a minor offensive. I bought one of those plastic trays 
you put under pots for $1.29 and coated the inside with Vasoline and a sticky 
pest barrier. I set the pot inside this contraption. We also purchased some 
slug traps (the ones you half bury in the ground and fill with beer). We seeded 
these traps with beer and a little sprinkle of extra yeast. A few days later, 
the traps were brimming with drunk and drowned earwigs, and a slug or two. As 
an added precaution, "Colonel Bug Slayer" also dug up some gazania bushes 
around the artichokes and vegetable garden that are a favorite earwig hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, so good. Damage has been minimized. The dog is still alive. But there 
are many earwigs to go. This is a never-ending battle. The troops are still on 
alert.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Remember to keep the mower blades high two and two and one-half feet inches 
tall to give the lawn enough foliage to produce food. 
</P>
<P>
 * Roses suffer in the heat of August. Water deeply, mulch around the root zone 
if you want roses into the fall months. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant garden mums now. There will be a good selection at your nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feed tuberous begonias and fuchsias with 0-10-10 fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Divide and transplant bearded iris.

HANDYMAN Q&A: HOME IMPROVEMENT; FAN MOTOR CAUSE OF REFRIGERATOR NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By POPULAR MECHANICS, FOR AP SPECIAL FEATURES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My Sears Coldspot frostless refrigerator-freezer whistles, wheezes 
and hisses. Sometimes it sounds almost alive even human. What do these strange 
sounds indicate? Is the refrigerator about to break down? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Your refrigerator's strange noises are probably coming from the 
evaporator fan motor located on the back wall of the freezer compartment. 
Usually before the evaporator's motor bearings give out, they will make 
chirping sounds. As the bearings continue to wear, the motor will produce 
strange noises similar to the ones you describe. Usually this means the fan 
motor is about due for replacement. A new fan motor kit can be purchased from 
any Sears parts store. Your local appliance center may also have a fan motor 
that would fit. Test for Radon to See If You Have Problem 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I live in a part of the country that has lots of radon gas. Can you help me 
find information on the air-to-air heat exchanger? It seems to me that if we 
change the air in the house without losing too much of the desired temperature 
inside the house, any airborne contaminants would not be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Just because your house is located in a radon belt, doesn't mean that your 
house will have a radon problem. Before you install an air-to-air heat 
exchanger, test your house to determine radon levels. The U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) advises taking action only if the radon gas occurs at 4 
pico curies per liter of air (pCi/L). For more information on radon, contact 
the EPA's regional office or your state health department. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA booklet "Radon Reduction Methods -- A Homeowner's Guide" explains 
several methods to correct a radon problem. An air-to-air heat exchanger (also 
called a heat recovery ventilator) is one method. It extracts the heat in the 
air that is being exhausted and uses it to warm the fresh incoming air. If used 
by itself, it will not reduce radon levels to below 4 pCi/L if the levels start 
out above 16 pCi/L. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the heat exchanger, you will need to install duct work. Radon 
Control Incorporated sells heat exchangers to contractors. To locate an 
EPA-certified radon control contractor in your area, call the company at (800) 
523-2084 or write: RCI, 511 Industrial Drive, Carmel, Ind. 46032.

HOT PROPERTY: BIG NAMES BUY LITTLE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comic-impressionist RICH LITTLE's house on nearly two acres in Malibu has been 
sold to actor-director JAMES KEACH, who is married to actress JANE SEYMOUR, for 
close to $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Little, who sold the home as part of his 1990 divorce settlement, has been 
living in Las Vegas, where he bought a $1-million house in 1992. He and his 
ex-wife, who had owned the home since the early 1980s, still own nearly six 
acres adjacent to the Malibu house. 
</P>
<P>
 Little, 53, ended a run this weekend at the Osmond Family Theater in Branson, 
Mo., where he co-starred with comedian-impressionist Jeannette Markey. He's 
preparing to kick off a tour in February of his one-man show, "The Presidents," 
and plans to tape a comedy album in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Keach, who sold his Wilshire-area home last fall for about $415,000 to actress 
Tyne Daly, married Seymour in the spring of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Keach, 44, the younger brother of actor Stacy Keach Jr., has appeared in more 
than 50 films and directed the ABC movie "Passion for Justice: The Hazel 
Brannon Smith Story," which aired in April and featured Seymour, star of the 
CBS series, "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 He just finished directing the upcoming western "The Stars Fell on Henrietta," 
starring Robert Duvall, and he directed the "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" segment 
for which Seymour received an Emmy nomination for the awards this fall. He and 
Seymour also just inked a deal with CBS for their Catfish Productions company, 
their publicist said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple lived in Seymour's Montecito home until it was sold in January as 
part of her divorce settlement for about $2.9 million. They moved to Malibu 
then and leased a house until he purchased Little's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The five-bedroom, 6,000-square-foot house is English Country in style with 
ocean views and a motor court. It was for sale in 1992 at about $7 million on 
about two acres or $9.5 million on 7.5 acres. The last asking price without the 
extra acres was about $4.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 BRIGITTE NIELSEN, the Danish actress who was married to Sylvester Stallone and 
later had a headline romance with football star Mark Gastineau, has sold her 
Wilshire House condo for close to $895,000, sources say. The unit was 
originally listed at $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen, who made her American debut in the 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger movie 
"Red Sonja" and then appeared in several other forgettable films, lives in 
Scandinavia, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray Weisberg and Brad Kimball of Fred Sands Estates, Brentwood, had the 
listing, and Marilyn Dunn, Prudential Rodeo Realty, represented the buyer, 
described as a businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox-TV's "Earthman" DAVID GARCIA, a veteran newsman who reports on 
environmental issues, and his wife, Susie, have purchased a contemporary-style 
house in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, which sold for close to its $500,000 asking price, has city views 
and a sunny studio for Susie, a designer of parade floats for the Pasadena 
Tournament of Roses. The couple recently sold their smaller, Spanish-style home 
in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Howell of Prudential California Realty in Glendale represented the Garcias 
in both deals. The couple's new home was listed with Ed Tracey, of the same 
office, and the buyer of their former home was represented by Bobbi Burns, Jon 
Douglas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL LYNTON, the publishing executive from New York who was named in June 
as president of the Walt Disney Co.'s Hollywood Pictures division, and his 
wife, Jamie Alter, have purchased a walled and gated Los Feliz home, built in 
1920, for $1.4 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-bedroom, 5,600-square-foot home, listed at $1.65 million with a guest 
cottage and art studio, was sold by an insurance company executive who moved to 
the East Coast. Kurt Rappaport and Victoria Risko, both of Nourmand & 
Associates in Beverly Hills, represented the buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 MARTINA RITT, daughter of the late blacklisted director Martin Ritt ("Norma 
Rae," "Hud"), has restored a 100-year-old New England-style farmhouse in 
Montecito and listed it at just under $2.7 million with Penelope Williams of 
Rodeo Realty, Montecito. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritt worked with her father on such films as "Murphy's Romance" and "Nuts," 
and she co-produced "Denial" (1991), starring Robin Wright and Jason Patric. 
Martin Ritt died in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Martina Ritt bought her Montecito home in 1991 and then took a sabbatical from 
work with the birth of her two children. Now that she is writing a screenplay 
and producing again, Ritt is said to be looking to buy a smaller home in 
Montecito and a small place in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Her five-bedroom house is on two acres and has a sports court and Waterford 
crystal fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 CLARIFICATION: The Benedict Canyon home of the late actor MacDonald Carey sold 
for $357,500, not $370,000 as sources said in the July 10 Hot Property column. 
Selling agent Ron Holliman of Jon Douglas Co.'s Sunset Strip office also notes 
that the buyer was a lawyer from England, not Ireland, as was reported.

<P>
 Sales of new and existing homes in Southern California jumped by more than 25% 
in the second quarter of 1994 compared to the same period last year, according 
TRW REDI Property Data, a real estate information company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern California's housing market is clearly emerging from recession," 
said Nima Nattagh, TRW REDI market analyst.TRW REDI's figures, which are based 
on closed escrow transactions, show that sales have been particularly buoyant 
for entry-level existing homes. That market sector now accounts for 52.4% of 
all home purchases compared to 50.3% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Builders have also seen significant market improvements. Sales of new homes, 
which constitute 13% of overall purchases, increased by 6.7% in the second 
quarter. All counties in the region have posted strong gains in new home sales, 
with the exception of Los Angeles County. Second Quarter Home Sales

SPEAKING OUT: EVOLUTION OF GETTING 'ESCREWED' WHEN BUYING AND SELLING A HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARRIE WULF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Wulf lives in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an amazing evolution in history that man has gone from walking onto a 
piece of land and staking a claim to buying property through escrow. Or as my 
husband and I now call it, "escrew." 
</P>
<P>
 I was taking a walk one day when I noticed many houses in my neighborhood had 
gone up for sale. I got the itch myself and decided to sell my single-family 
dump. Surprisingly, it sold in two weeks, at a $55,000 loss of course. My 
husband looked over at me with one of those "this-was-your-idea" looks and 
said, "I think we just got escrewed," and I agreed. And that was before the 
realtor got his chunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the realtor. Another modern day phenomenon. Who invented this job? Can I 
not find ads and look for houses myself? I thank my grant deed we don't need 
these agents in other areas of our lives. Can you imagine a realtor for 
Bullocks charging 6% to find you those Liz Claiborne pastel suit sets you've 
been looking for? Or imagine a 6% charge by the grocery store agent for cutting 
those turkey slices? All I know is, my realtor took 6% for coming over and 
crunching numbers with me one night over a Diet Coke (which I bought without an 
agent), running a listing and having all his realtor friends over to my house 
for lasagna and Chianti during their caravan: $12,000 he got for this. And my 
husband just looked at me and said, "I think we just got escrewed," and I 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's buying your new home. I went out with my realtor and looked at 
homes for a total of five hours before we made an offer on a house we ended up 
buying. Not only that, but we bought his listing. By my calculations, it was 
not hard to see that he had made about $18,000 for a long afternoon's work 
showing us houses we couldn't afford. I wondered all afternoon if he used an 
agent when he bought his $70,000 car. Then I decided I didn't care. I was the 
one who was buying the front end.  
</P>
<P>
 Then we opened escrow, the derivation of which must come from the Latin root 
meaning "to screw or to take advantage of." I thought I was prepared. I am not 
young. I am not a naive person. We'd been through this two times before. But 
I've come to realize, escrow is like labor. How easily we forget the pain. I 
found myself signing document after document practicing three hees and a blow. 
My husband kept looking around for a nurse to get some ice chips. I began 
calling for an anesthesiologist before the 45 days was over. And all I can say 
is, thank goodness we had a short escrow. I don't think I could have handled 
the usual 90-day formality without an epidural drip. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the loan shopping and subsequent underwriting fees, processing 
fees, assumption fees, document preparation fees, and my favorite, the loan 
origination fee. How nice. And to think I got to pay that on top of points, and 
then of course, let's not forget the interest rate for 30 years. My husband 
said to me, "I think we're getting escrewed," and I agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in our closing there were notary fees, document fees, fax fees, 
reconveyance fees, recording fees and this was my husband's favorite: Not only 
were there escrow, but also sub-escrow fees. Can anyone tell me what that 
means? Is my telephone bill going to start coming with a "sub-bill?" Will my 
Summer cruise include the "sub-cruise?" My husband just looked at me and said, 
"I think we just got escrewed," and I agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there were those little, minor miscellaneous expenses that I could have 
bought the Trump Tower with. The association charging us $185 for a "transfer 
of owner" fee. What is that? Did someone need that much money to white out the 
old owner's name and scribble in the new? I know those slope maintenance 
workers sure don't care.  
</P>
<P>
 Then of course all the utility companies charge disconnecting and reconnecting 
charges. Appraisers need their money for appraising. Pest controllers need 
their money for pesting, inspectors need their money for inspecting, and the 
title companies need money for titling. My weary husband looked over at me 
while we were finally signing papers and said, "I think we just got escrewed," 
and I cried.

<P>
 Steep price declines that have occurred over the past few years are beginning 
to level off, according to Dataquick Information Systems, a La Jolla firm that 
tracks home prices statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though overall market conditions are out of the homeowner's control, 
other factors are not. For example, adding a $10,000 swimming pool in the back 
yard will probably not increase one's sales price by a like amount. 
Well-planned and executed remodeling jobs are a good investment and some 
specific home improvements even can increase the value above the initial cost. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Remodeling magazine, a bathroom remodeled in the Los Angeles area 
(at an average cost of $7,221) returns 75% of the investment to the owner; a 
major kitchen remodel (cost $22,665), 91%, and a master bedroom suite (cost 
$21,147), 78%.

MISERY RULES IN THE CITY'S STRIKE ZONE; TRANSIT: WITHOUT BUS SERVICE, COMMUTERS 
ARE INCONVENIENCED BY THE THOUSANDS. BUT BANDIT CABBIES FIND A SILVER LINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Last week's transit strike inconvenienced hundreds of thousands of commuters 
last week but put a smile on the face of Sixto Gutierrez, whose unlicensed 
transportation business was thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen, 20 people fit in here," said Gutierrez, 32, in the driver's seat of 
his Chevy van as it pulled up to the corner of 6th and Alvarado streets. 
Charging his passengers $2 or $3 apiece, Gutierrez said he was clearing $100 to 
$150 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' first transit strike in more than a decade began Monday when 
1,900 of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's mechanics walked off the 
job in a dispute with management over subcontracted work. About 5,000 bus and 
train drivers and clerks honored picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
 With only about 300 of the usual 1,900 buses running along 30 of 200 routes, 
many riders found themselves stranded and in need of alternate travel plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fares last week were reduced to 50 cents on MTA buses and the Blue Line, with 
no fee on the school buses that the MTA rented to provide auxiliary service. 
Red Line fares were 25 cents.  
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez and his colleagues operating bandit taxis and vans converged on 
MacArthur Park, teeming with commuters stranded at the terminus of the Red Line 
subway that has been running despite the bus strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the driver of an unmarked yellow car who declined to identify himself: 
"We're cheaper than the regular taxis. And now the police aren't bothering us 
because we're providing a genuine service." 
</P>
<P>
 The driver added that instead of making his usual $40 a day, he's cleared more 
than $100 each day since the strike began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But happy entrepreneurs were in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Ortiz, a sidewalk vendor in the MacArthur Park area who sells hot 
dogs wrapped with bacon and smothered with onions, said the strike has forced 
her to spend more money to get between work and home. She said unmarked cab 
operators had charged her $5 to $7 for a bus ride that would regularly cost 
$1.35. 
</P>
<P>
 Candida Romero, who runs a magazine stand, said her business suffered last 
week. Normally, she said, sales are robust because of her location near a bus 
stop at Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street. With the disappearance of many 
loyal customers, she said, sales are going nowhere. Romero, who depends on the 
bus herself, said she has had to walk to and from work, a two-mile trip. "I'm 
afraid since it's not safe for a woman to walk home alone in this city," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 More fortunate bus riders were able to fit the functioning Metro Red and Blue 
lines into their commutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Line light rail and the Red Line subway ran an abbreviated schedule 
all week, with many passengers finding the bus line connections running late or 
not at all. Trains bulged with extra passengers; MTA officials said ridership 
was up but couldn't estimate the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 For Liliana Guzman, who works at a Downtown clothing assembly factory, the 
strike put a heavier burden on her and co-workers who did make it to work 
Monday: "I had to do other people's work, since the 16 of us who showed up 
today had to do the work of 50. Things went pretty slow." 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to get a bus, the 28-year-old Compton woman said she walked about two 
miles from home to the Blue Line station for her commute into Downtown, but 
arrived late for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirna Salazar, a mother of four, missed her 3-year-old's appointment at the 
San Judas Medical Group on Wilshire Boulevard. Salazar, who lives in Los 
Angeles, said she waited 3 1/2 hours for bus service before deciding to take 
the Blue Line. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived at the clinic late, only to find that her daughter's appointment 
had already been rescheduled; she'd have to come back another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Salazar, who said that caring for her daughter keeps her from working, can't 
afford a car. "It's hard enough not having a car in times of emergency," she 
said. "With this strike, (commuting) will probably get worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Gi Gi Jimenez, a receptionist at San Judas Medical Group, where Salazar's 
daughter, Angeles, went for care, said the low-income clinic experienced a 
large drop in patients because of the MTA strike. San Judas usually receives 
about 150 patients a day, Jimenez said, but Monday that number fell to well 
below 100. Many of San Judas' patients depend on public transportation, she 
said.

BUSINESS LURE; TRAINING PROGRAM AT SOUTH-CENTRAL RESTAURANT HELPS DISH UP JOB 
SKILLS TO TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE SEO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the outside, the Rainbow Inn Fish Market looks like nothing more than a 
homey South-Central take-out joint that serves up everything from half-pound 
burgers to banana pudding to fried catfish platters. 
</P>
<P>
 But something special is taking place inside the modest Main Street eatery -- 
and it isn't on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten youths have completed or are in the midst of a four-month training program 
to acquire fundamental job and business skills. The program, funded by a 
$20,000 California Community Foundation grant, was established last fall by the 
Abundance of Christ Church in South-Central and the Kehillath Israel Synagogue 
in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We opened the restaurant because we wanted to give something back to the 
community," said Pastor Robbie Horton of Abundance of Christ Church, which is 
across the street from the restaurant. "We only employ people from the 
community and give them opportunities they might otherwise not have." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, four young women in their teens and early 20s stood 
around the tiny eatery, slicing vegetables, weighing fish and waiting on 
customers eager to sample the restaurant's red beans and rice and other 
Southern fare. The smell of grilled hamburgers and fried fish filled the 
kitchen as the young women wearing white T-shirts and jeans went about their 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eeeeew," 15-year-old Brisa Becerra said as she tried unsuccessfully to chop 
off the head of a catfish. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no. This is how you do it," manager Anita Harrison said as she grabbed a 
knife and sliced off the fish's head with one swoop. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're learning how to prepare food, but they're also learning how to 
operate office equipment and do bookkeeping," said Harrison, who is responsible 
for training the youths and running the business. "We're trying to teach them 
how to run a business so that they can get other jobs or maybe open their own 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 The job-training program grew out of a partnership between the church and 
synagogue called Two Cultures/One Heart. The church's gospel choir first 
visited the synagogue in early 1992, as part of a Martin Luther King Jr. 
birthday celebration. After the riots, synagogue leaders contacted the church 
and offered their assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took care of 2,000 families by delivering them food, clothes and 
furniture," Horton said. "After that, we decided to create a long-range plan. 
We informed them that the church was going to open a restaurant, and they have 
been a tremendous support to us since then." 
</P>
<P>
 A synagogue member, who works in the personnel department at Target, helped a 
program graduate get a job at one of the department store chain's nearby 
locations. Other members have offered employment counseling and have donated 
supplies and materials. Church and synagogue members also have sponsored joint 
religious services, recreational activities and other programs for 
South-Central residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten to be a very comfortable relationship," said Sandi Merwitzer, a 
member of the synagogue who stops by the restaurant on a weekly basis. "We try 
to provide them with whatever they need." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Merwitzer showed up at the fish market with a stack of coupons she 
had printed for the restaurant and a pile of practice Scholastic Aptitude 
Tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought this would help some of the kids prepare for college," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four participants who have already completed the program, two went to 
college or training schools, one is enrolled in a different job-training 
program and one works at Target. 
</P>
<P>
 Becerra, a Jordan High School student who has worked at the restaurant for the 
past two months, learned of the program by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked the pastor if he could open the church's gate so I could play 
basketball, and he asked me if I could work," she said. "I asked my dad, and he 
said it would be OK. So far, it's been going pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants receive $4.25 an hour and work 15 hours a week. The program is 
funded by California Community Foundation's Community Bridges program, a 
$1-million effort to support inter-ethnic collaborations. Sixteen 
community-based organizations were awarded grants late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the job-training program at the Rainbow Inn Fish Market has gone 
smoothly, its future remains in doubt because the grant money will expire this 
fall. The restaurant also is struggling financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business has been slow," Horton said, "but we're going to try really hard to 
keep the program going." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harrison: "The majority of the kids have never worked before and don't 
have skills that could get them jobs. I didn't know how much of a need there 
was for a program like this until we got started. The kids find out that they 
can be somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rainbow Inn Fish Market, 9106 S. Main St., 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through 
Saturday.

JOBS CENTER AWARDED $750,000 FEDERAL GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $750,000 federal grant has been awarded to the Opportunities 
Industrialization Center to help pay for employment training and development 
services for dislocated workers, the long-term unemployed and other residents 
of neighborhoods hit by the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, at 11100 S. Western Ave., was awarded the grant this month from 
the U.S. Department of Labor.The center receives funding from public and 
private sectors and offers out-of-work residents training for jobs in stores, 
restaurants and auto repair shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the center started offering classes in January, center officials said, 
140 students have completed or enrolled in training programs for jobs in retail 
sales, office occupations, culinary arts and automotive services. Officials 
project graduating 300 people a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, one of 70 nationwide,opened in January to help increase employment 
in southern Los Angeles.

U.S. SUPPORT FOR SHELTER CONTINUES DESPITE PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD and JAMES BORNEMEIER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal officials reviewing plans for a homeless center operated by a 
South-Central group on surplus Navy property in San Pedro say they have no 
reason to reverse their earlier approval of the project, although a final 
decision has not been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Health and Human Services' continued support of the plan, 
which hundreds of local residents have challenged in recent months, is one of 
several developments in the dispute over bringing the center to the harbor 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the department approved an application by Turner's Technical 
Institute Inc. of South-Central to use housing on Taper Avenue for homeless 
families. Turner's would use the 27-acre site after the Long Beach Naval 
Station Closes this summer and moves out its personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 But department officials agreed to review their decision after local 
politicians and community members raised questions about the ability of 
Turner's to house as many as 880. Opponents also pointed out inconsistencies in 
the group's application for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 During the height of public outcry, Turner's onetime executive director, 
Johnathon C. Marzet, resigned amid claims that on the application two letters 
of endorsement were forged and that he had falsified his academic 
qualifications. The reputed endorsers of Turner's said they did not sign the 
letters. Marzet has acknowledged false claims of college degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the tumult apparently has not changed the opinion of Health and Human 
Services officials about Turner's qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times asked the department if its review had uncovered any inaccurate or 
misleading material in the Turner's application. Kathleen Furey Martin, the 
official who approved the selection of Turner's, replied: "To date,our review 
has not provided any basis on which to reverse our previous approval of 
(Turner's) application." 
</P>
<P>
 But a decision on the project isn't final, said Martin, who is director of the 
department's division of health-facilities programming.  
</P>
<P>
 Her statement drew angry local reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The department) is basically saying it's OK to commit fraud or forgery," 
said Doane Liu, chairman of the San Pedro Area Re-Use Committee. "It's probably 
not going to be pursued by any federal agency, but it's a federal crime and we 
view it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents San Pedro and also is 
fighting the homeless center, called Martin's response "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 "HHS knows they made a mistake with a hasty decision. Now they're so afraid to 
admit their mistake, they're going to allow their incompetence to prevail," 
Svorinich said. 
</P>
<P>
 A review by the Department of Housing and Urban Development has apparently 
been completed, but officials said no decision has been made. In response to 
local concerns, HUD officials re-examined safety questions about two aviation 
fuel tanks near the 144 units of housing at Taper Avenue.

STATION HOPES TO BRIDGE THE PACIFIC; RADIO: KMAX-FM OFFERS THE LATEST IN NEWS, 
TRAFFIC AND WEATHER -- EVEN HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S YOMIURI GIANTS 
GAME -- FOR THE LOCAL JAPANESE-SPEAKING COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE BERGMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new contender has entered Los Angeles' morning drive-time radio market, only 
this one stands apart from the others: it's in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcast from 7 to 9 a.m. weekdays, "Bridge USA" premiered this month on 
KMAX-FM (107). "Bridge USA," an offshoot of the monthly magazine of the same 
name, originates from Torrance with a Japanese and Japanese American on-air 
crew who provide the latest in news, traffic and weather for the local 
Japanese-speaking community. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gallagher, vice president of marketing and programming for Douglas 
Broadcasting, which owns and operates KMAX, said "Bridge USA" will provide 
local and national news from a Japanese perspective: "If the story plays on 
issues like racial bias, or if a news story involves someone Japanese, then the 
story will get attention." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Advances in technology have made it not only easier to provide highlights from 
the previous night's Yomiuri Giants game, Gallagher said, but, more 
significantly, to help people "maintain a cultural and linguistic identity, 
even while they operate in different environments." 
</P>
<P>
 The program also features breaking news and cultural reports via a live feed 
from Japan-based correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanna Iizuka, 28, one of the show's local on-air reporters, said so far 
listener feedback has been positive. "Some people call to say it's good," he 
said, "and some call to give advice or to request more sports, or more music, 
whatever they want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Four popular Japanese songs are broadcast every half-hour, Iizuka said, 
because "we can hear American music everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 KMAX hopes to reach Japanese business people working here, students, recent 
immigrants and second-generation Japanese Americans who still speak Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Shunji Shinoda, a 64-year-old business consultant who emigrated from Japan in 
1971, said the show is a welcome alternative to American programming.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very interested in what happens in Japan, with where it stands 
politically and economically. There's not very much about Japan on the American 
news. But mostly I miss news from a Japanese perspective: What do the Japanese 
think about O.J. Simpson?" 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 1990 U.S. Census, the 52,000 people of Japanese descent who 
live in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area have a median household income of more 
than $44,000.  
</P>
<P>
 KMAX anticipates the number of expatriate Japanese will only grow, a 
significant argument for devoting coveted drive time to Japanese-language 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lynne Choy Uyeda, 55, founder of the Asian Business Assn., said the 
audience for an all-Japanese show will swiftly become "limited as the Japanese 
economy continues to shrink and fewer and fewer Japanese are assigned to the 
U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 Uyeda, who also runs a public relations and advertising company in Los 
Angeles, added: "They're going to have to be really creative to keep their 
listener level up." 
</P>
<P>
 Listeners shouldn't expect a Japanese answer to Howard Stern or Rick Dees. 
While the show features several personalities, there's no bantering or what 
Gallagher calls "that cutesy stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing really controversial," he said. "We're aiming for a wider 
audience, not to overly targeted groups. We're casting for both teen-agers and 
older adults, not to anyone in particular."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; A BLAST FROM THE PAST IN CAPSULE FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "By 2005 you will no doubt be flying from Los Angeles to London in from four 
to six hours." 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles County will have a population of 12 million." 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a cure for cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Skies will be clear and free from smog." 
</P>
<P>
 No, these aren't predictions from TV's "Psychic Friends Network." These 
optimistic and offbeat forecasts were compiled nearly 40 years ago by a group 
of countywide business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a flight from Los Angeles to London takes an average of 10 hours; the 
county's population is about 9 million; cancer remains the nation's No. 2 cause 
of death behind heart disease, and Angelenos still fight allergies from the 
daily blanket of smog. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 11 years to go until 2005 rolls around, those soothsayers from the 
past can claim they have time on their side. 
</P>
<P>
 Their typewritten thoughts about the county's future growth and development 
were among the items found in a Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce time 
capsule -- cemented behind a cornerstone on March 22, 1956, to commemorate the 
chamber's new building at 404 S. Bixel St. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-inch-by-2 1/2-foot-by-2-foot copper box was to remain untouched until 
2005. 
</P>
<P>
 But chamber officials decided to dig it out in late June because the chamber 
is moving to a new home across the street -- its eighth since it formed in 
1888. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get it out was about a six-hour period with hammers and jackhammers," said 
chamber President Ray Remy. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of waiting until 2005 to see what's inside, the chamber board agreed 
to open the warped, rusted box and check the condition of its contents -- some 
of which date back to March, 1903, and have been damaged by moisture, Remy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a part of Los Angeles history," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not made a complete review of the items," Remy said. "I would think 
if there were some things here that would have some particular historic value, 
we would want to either display it or donate it to a particular society." 
</P>
<P>
 Though most of the books, Los Angeles promotional pamphlets, directories, maps 
and newspaper editions found inside the capsule were related to or produced by 
the chamber, some reference materials could be considered rarities. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection includes a March, 29, 1903, edition of the Los Angeles Times, 
which sold for a nickel, and March, 22, 1956, editions of such rival papers as 
the Los Angeles Examiner and Mirror News. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the time that the capsule was buried in March, 1956, actor Ernest 
Borgnine captured an Oscar, the Mirror News editor and publisher interviewed 
then-Philippines President Ramon Magsaysay about the threat of Communism and 
Russia tested more nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Also noteworthy are the predictions of the chamber members themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney James L. Beebe, a partner at O'Melveny & Myers, predicted the rise of 
such areas as the City of Industry in the San Gabriel Valley and Warner Center 
in the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most significant governmental development will be community centers, not 
merely shopping centers but centers of manufacturing, business, banking, 
administrative government and courts," wrote Beebe, then chairman of the 
chamber's state and local government committee. "This community center 
development will outpace downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood and Miracle Mile." 
</P>
<P>
 J.E. Fishburn Jr., vice president at Bank of America, so far is missing the 
mark about cars being equipped with radar to prevent collision in poor weather. 
But Fishburn's statement about how "the freeway system in Los Angeles will be 
double-decked with the top level used solely for express traffic" foretells a 
similar project on a portion of the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Mouse and his Disney friends should run for cover if this prediction 
from D.L. Marlett comes true:

 Organizers of a concert honoring two Japanese college students who were slain 
during a March carjacking raised $500 to help establish a $20,000 endowment 
fund in the victims' names. 
</P>
<P>
 Go Matsuura and Takuma Ito, film students at Marymount College in Rancho Palos 
Verdes, were shot to death March 25 in a supermarket parking lot in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, Raymond Oscar Butler, pleaded not guilty Tuesday and is awaiting 
trial in Long Beach Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to raise money for an annual film lecture series in the students' 
names, the Japanese Village Plaza and Marymount College sponsored the July 23 
concert and dinner program. 
</P>
<P>
 The event at Oiwake Restaurant drew 100 people, mainly members of the Little 
Tokyo and South Bay business communities and Marymount College officials, said 
Tom Kurai, Japanese Village Plaza spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials have raised more than $15,000 and hope to collect enough 
money to begin the campus lecture series this fall, inviting noted filmmakers, 
directors and screenwriters as speakers. TOMMY LI

 At least 2,500 people are expected to participate locally Tuesday evening in 
the first citywide observance of "National Night Out," joining in an anti-crime 
march throughout the Rampart area.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WINDSOR SQUARE; CHURCH STRUGGLES TO RECOVER FROM FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The congregation of the Wilshire United Methodist Church today will celebrate 
the eighth Sunday service since a fire gutted much of its historic building, 
and church leaders say they are still unsure what type of recovery effort they 
will mount. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 6 fire that caused an estimated $120,000 in damage is still being 
investigated by fire officials, and the church's senior pastor, the Rev. Chang 
Soon Lee, said discussions are continuing with insurance company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Lee said, most services have been moved from the fire-scarred 
church, at 4350 Wilshire Blvd., to the vacant Scottish Rite Masonic Temple 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions that remain for the 1,200-member congregation are how to rebuild 
and whether any recovery effort could coincide with a much-needed church 
expansion. Also, in the short term, there is the issue of continuing the 
church's myriad activities with limited room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still in the primitive stages of recovery," Lee said. "The physical 
recovery may be going slow, but we are not discouraged spiritually." 
</P>
<P>
 The electrical fire swept through the church's Fellowship Hall and the 
68-year-old sanctuary, destroying a large pipe organ, the machinery that 
operates the church's chimes, banners, decorative rails and items used during 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Willie Barnes, who leads the church's fledgling recovery committee, 
said leaders would be meeting with insurance company representatives and some 
general contractors this week to survey the damage and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Church leaders have noted the need for an expansion for several years, and 
Barnes said if financing is available the church might consider combining that 
project with the recovery effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a long way off, though, and it would require approval from several 
levels," he said. "It's very early in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief concern for church leaders in the meantime is to keep the church's 
activities running smoothly. It has not been easy. A shortage of elbow room has 
programs vying for space. Besides Sunday school classes, the church has a 
variety of clubs and plays host to a long list of community groups, from the 
Cub Scouts to Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the juggling problem, the congregation has to contend with some 
communication challenges because of its diversity. Services are held in four 
languages -- English, Korean, Tagalog and Spanish -- and worshipers hail from 
40 different nations, church leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That variety makes some things difficult, but it is also what makes us 
great," said Lydia Martinez, pastor for the church's Spanish-speaking branch. 
"It calls for a lot of energy on our part to keep things organized, but it also 
provides us with a lot of creativity." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Christmas, for example, the church put on a stage re-enactment of the 
manger scene, with Latino angels, Korean wise men and a Filipino infant 
portraying the infant Jesus. "That makes a theological statement, the church as 
a world community, and it shows the future of the church today. That's our 
strength." GEOFF BOUCHER

<P>
 Residents will soon see the development of a new public safety community 
center, according to a plan unanimously approved last week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which will include a police substation and community center, will 
be housed in a now-vacant bank building at 1819 S. Western Ave. donated to the 
city last month by Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city will retain title to the property, it will be leased for a 
minimal fee to the Koreatown Public Safety Assn., said City Councilman Nate 
Holden. The community group, which formed in March with the intent of setting 
up a neighborhood public safety facility, will be responsible for the 
building's rehabilitation and upkeep, Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do whatever we can to make it a resounding success, not just 
for our community but for the whole city," said Yohngsohk Choe, secretary 
general for the association. "We want to set an example." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the council also approved the formation of a city-police task 
force that will estimate rehabilitation costs. In the meantime, Choe said, the 
association is trying to raise $2 million to $3 million with which to finance 
the work needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Choe said the facility will also serve as a meeting place for community 
groups. LESLIE BERESTEIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: MID-CITY AREA; DEVELOPMENT ZONES PLAN TO CONSOLIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of five of the Mid-City area's seven Community Advisory Committees 
voted unanimously last week to consolidate their commercial corridors into one 
large redevelopment project to help speed the recovery of riot-damaged 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other committees had already approved the proposal in a previous 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In consolidating, Community Redevelopment Agency officials said Tuesday, the 
seven project areas stand a better chance of gaining support through bonds from 
financial markets, which will make funds available more quickly to start 
development activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea to consolidate presented itself a month ago, said redevelopment 
agency project manager Edward Saulet, when planners realized that some of the 
land tracts encompassed by the seven individual corridors were too small to 
attract backing from financial institutions.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time the agency has attempted a redevelopment effort 
encompassing non-contiguous zones, Saulet said. Most of the seven commercial 
corridors, which run along the main streets of the Mid-City area, are separated 
by residental tracts that will not be included in the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all seven committees had already chosen to set up redevelopment zones 
individually, the prospect of consolidating had several advisory committee 
members thinking twice about having to prioritize some of their pet projects, 
as well as having to work together as one project area committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Representation doesn't always guarantee what it's set out to (guarantee)," 
warned one resident.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the idea of speeding up their projects, as well as the knowledge that 
remaining separate and at risk for funding could put an end to the area's 
revitalization efforts, spurred the committee members to choose consolidation.  
</P>
<P>
 Kim Pfoser, the redevelopment agency's principal planner for the area, said 
the next step will be to draft a preliminary redevelopment plan, which is 
expected to go before the City Planning Commission by late August. LESLIE

<P>
 Proclaiming that television networks are "recycling racist practices," the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson urged South-Central community leaders last week to join him 
in building an organization to protect minorities' interests in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 In a July 25 meeting and press conference at the African American Unity 
Center, Jackson said the newly formed Rainbow Coalition Commission on Fairness 
in the Media plans to encourage viewers to boycott networks that refuse to 
schedule programs with positive ethnic images or to place minorities in key 
decision-making positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Marguerite Archie-Hudson (D-Los Angeles), who represents 
South-Central, was named chairwoman of the commission. Serving as co-chairs are 
Curtis Owens, executive director of the unity center; Ester Renteria, executive 
director of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, and Sumi Hari, president of 
the Assn. of Asian Pacific Artists. Eddie Wong, regional director of the 
Rainbow Coalition, was selected director of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think they have the right to not include us in recruitment, hiring, 
promotion, protection, decision-making," Jackson said. "But we have the 
consumer power; we have viewer power; we have the power to change dials. We 
will do just that until there is change." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the commission has become increasingly concerned about what it 
sees as a significant lack of representation of African Americans, Latinos, 
Asian Americans, Native Americans and women among network news anchors, 
prime-time entertainment writing staffs and in prominent acting roles that do 
not portray criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens emphasized the Unity Center's ties to the community and the power 
networking has to make Jackson's media campaign succeed. The center is part of 
a coalition of 60 nonprofit minority community organizations in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be able to bring the manpower necessary for the selective television 
viewing," Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Spratt, a South-Central community leader and network coordinator at 
Genesis Food Distributors, which assists 97 churches, said the only way viewers 
will boycott is if they are educated enough to want to react. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you know what it is you're fighting for, you can't take action and 
expect if from anyone else," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 One media observer said that although Jackson's organization has legitimate 
complaints, boycotting is not always effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly part of democracy to boycott . . . and it's fun to threaten," 
said Joe Saltzman, a professor of journalism at USC. "But to make it work is 
actually a different story. It's hard to show the public how shutting off their 
favorite television program is going to change public policy."  
</P>
<P>
 However, Saltzman said, the networks are very sympathetic to these types of 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the commission is researching the networks' hiring practices and 
the portrayal of minorities. Findings will be presented at a September 
workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The networks have time now to get their houses in order. They can begin to 
change now," he said. ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; POLICE TO BE TRAINED IN MEXICAN CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to strengthen community ties, the Los Angeles Police Department 
has established a program to educate officers in Spanish and in Mexican 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which began this month with the training of 31 senior-lead 
officers from the South Bureau, is one of the department's latest attempts to 
bridge the gap between the Latino neighborhoods of South-Central and the 
police. Many residents immigrated from countries where police are dishonest or 
have been linked to death squads. Often, police say, they are afraid to 
officially report crimes or would rather remain silent, fearing that police 
will turn them over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very important in our department that we understand the 
(diversity) of Los Angeles," said Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker, commander of the 
South Bureau, which extends from South-Central to the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is a joint project between the Los Angeles Consulate of Mexico, 
the University of Guadalajara and the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of the program consists of classroom instruction in which 
officers attend weekly three-hour sessions taught by members of the University 
of Guadalajara. The classes include instruction in basic Spanish conversational 
skills. The officers will attend lectures on Mexican life, history, geography, 
demographics, arts and culture, and on the life of Mexican immigrants in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers who successfully complete the six-month classroom portion then enter 
the second phase, in which they will live for 10 days with a family in 
Guadalajara. During that visit, the officers will be exposed to such things as 
language usage and cultural awareness. During their time with the host 
families, they see firsthand the everyday life of a Mexican family. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials will evaluate the first two phases in January, then determine 
whether the program should be expanded departmentwide as the third and final 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of the $17,000 program has been funded by Lilly Artenstein for 
Euro Star. The shoe company donated $4,000. "I feel businesses should 
participate in education, and this is our contribution," said Artenstein, whose 
business is in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At about $14,000, flying the 34 officers to Guadalajara is the most expensive 
element of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeker is seeking financing for the second phase and is confident the money 
will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly believe that after this program we'll come back changed in our 
attitude and understanding," Kroeker said. AMANDA S. CASTILLO

</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 teen-agers are expected to march Wednesday against the state's 
"three strikes and you're out" law. 
</P>
<P>
 The current "three strikes" law mandates 25-year-to-life prison terms for 
criminals convicted of a third felony if their previous convictions were for 
violent or serious offenses such as robbery, arson or murder.The law includes 
offenses committed by 16- to 18-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest is designed to catch the attention of lawmakers and to push for 
the removal of the provision of the law that includes juvenile offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by South Central Youth Empowered Thru Action, the procession begins 
at 2 p.m. at the Welcome Baptist Church, 8615 S. Central Ave., and will move 
its way toward 76th Street. At 3 p.m., marchers will protest the law in front 
of the Kenyon Juvenile Justice Center, 7625 S. Central Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlo Jenkins, 18, a member of the organization, said the protest is in 
response to a July teen summit in which 300 area youths gathered to devise ways 
to challenge the law. "What we are trying to do is to get our policy-makers to 
write the youths out of the bill," said Jenkins, who said she has several 
teen-age friends who have been convicted of two felonies and could be affected 
by the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth organization proposes that instead of locking up people in jail for 
life and spending funds to build more prisons, more money should be spent on 
creating jobs and improving education to prevent crime. ENRIQUE LAVIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents concerned that an effort to improve the business centers in the 
Eastside could lead to the destruction of their neighborhoods were assured last 
week by a letter from Councilman Richard Alatorre that their homes will not be 
targeted for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 However, no guarantees were given to residents whose homes lie in commercial 
and industrial corridors targeted for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastside Redevelopment Feasibility Study, which is the second phase of the 
Adelante Eastside effort to renovate sections of Boyle Heights and El Sereno, 
is being undertaken to find government and private funds for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrio Planners Inc., an Eastside architectural firm, is conducting the 
feasibility study to update the 2-year-old Adelante Eastside study. Barrio 
Planners is studying traffic and business ownership patterns, analyzing whether 
businesses there are compatible with one other. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are essentially trying to build a case, an argument, that we have these 
problems and we need the redevelopment to correct them," said Raul Escobedo, a 
consultant on the project.

 Escobedo and other consultants gave a progress report on the feasibility study 
Wednesday to the Community Advisory Committee of the Eastside Redevelopment 
Feasibility Study and about 50 residents.  
</P>
<P>
 Mesa & Madrid Development of Bellflower is updating the study's analysis. It 
will analyze property values, business vacancies, population, income and 
employment in the target areas, said consultant Henry A. Madrid.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will look at . . . what is the spending power in our area, how much we 
have existing, what does the community need and what does the community want," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the study will determine the potential tax base for the area. 
The 4,173 parcels in the study area occupy 1,947 acres -- roughly 3 square 
miles -- and have a tax base worth $1.1 billion, said consultant Michael 
Popwell.  
</P>
<P>
 The study's goal, the consultants said, is to figure out how to assist growing 
businesses that want to stay in the area by helping get through city permit 
requirements.  
</P>
<P>
 One part of the study could, for example, identify local commercial and 
industrial spaces that would fit the needs of expanding businesses so they 
won't have to leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are conditions that individually we cannot overcome, but collectively 
we can," Popwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre's letter addressed concerns by residents at previous meetings who 
said they did not trust government efforts to improve their neighborhoods. They 
have formed their own watchdog group, Union y Fuerza de la Comunidad, which 
meets monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre referred to a motion passed by the City Council last August that 
emphasized the "potential for redevelopment in the commercial and industrial 
areas of Boyle Heights and portions of El Sereno." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not and I repeat not a plan for taking away housing from the 
neighborhood," he wrote in the letter addressed to committee chairman Steve 
Barba. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Alatorre's motion does not mention housing within commercial and 
industrial areas, Escobedo stressed to the audience that completing the study 
in itself does not jeopardize those homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we follow that logic, then all the commercial and industrial properties 
are jeopardized," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need to fine-tune that study, but nothing is jeopardized by doing the 
study." MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; MAN ELECTROCUTED BY TRANSFORMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A transient trying to retrieve scrap metal was electrocuted last week after he 
broke into a Southern California Edison substation and stepped on a 
transformer, police said, knocking out power to more than 300 Edison customers 
for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of the victim, who was identified from fingerprints at the county 
coroner's office, has not yet been claimed by relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the man apparently broke into an unmanned substation at 6538 Rugby 
Ave. Tuesday by climbing over a chain-link fence, scaling an exterior building 
ladder and entering a second story window. Once inside, the 41-year-old 
trespasser reportedly began to strip copper cables from the walls and 
electrical machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 He deposited some of the cables at the rear of the location, police said, and 
then entered a locked enclosure area posted with signs indicating high voltage 
and restricted access. The man apparently ignored the danger signs and climbed 
over the protective fencing in search of more copper. While still touching the 
protective fence, he stepped onto a transformer. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison spokesman Charlie Bashum said the average home outlet carries 120 volts 
of electricity; about 4,000 volts passed through the man's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison workers sent to investigate the power outage found the substation's 
rear door unlocked and the man's body inside the locked transformer enclosure.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: JEFFERSON PARK; BUSY CENTER STILL OFFERING QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than six months after a magnitude 6.8 earthquake rocked the city out of 
early morning sleep, many residents in Central Los Angeles are still waking up 
to the Jan. 17 Northridge temblor's devastating effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the San Fernando Valley has received the lion's share of media and 
government attention, the earthquake assistance center set up in the Crenshaw 
district is the busiest in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike their Valley counterparts, many quake victims in Central Los Angeles 
waited much longer to enlist governmental help because they didn't know they 
could or were unsure if they qualified for aid, said spokeswoman Lisa Posey of 
the Crenshaw Earthquake Service Center at 3420 W. Jefferson Blvd. in Jefferson 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was reluctant to come in because I just figured I wouldn't get anything," 
said Maurice Prince, who came to the center to apply for money to repair damage 
to her Mid-City restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I closed for one day after the earthquake, but had to keep going. . . . I 
just got busy. An outreach person here told me that I should come down, so I 
finally did." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 10 government assistance centers that opened in Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties after the quake, Posey said, the Crenshaw location -- the only one 
south of the Santa Monica Freeway -- has processed the most applications for 
aid: 6,726, compared with 4,101 at the Sylmar center. A total of 27,401 
applications have been processed so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crenshaw center has seen about 40,000 clients and is still averaging about 
25 applications for aid per day, Posey said. The daily number of walk-ins, 
including new and repeat clients, frequently tops 190 renters, home and 
business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex, the former site of a Muslim school, houses not only the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and the state Office of Emergency Services but 
several city and county agencies including the county Mental Health, Employment 
Development and Aging Services departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of clients, said Office of Emergency Services manager Floyd Godfrey, 
are elderly residents who were slow to discover damage or were wary of applying 
for government loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbie Deverges, a Crenshaw homeowner since 1950, said she was reluctant to get 
caught up in bureaucratic red tape although her home suffered extensive damage 
inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did get a grant for $4,000, but that didn't cover everything," said 
Deverges, a retiree who was filing an appeal at the center for additional aid. 
"I had to use a lot of my own money to fix things. I need to replace all my 
damaged windows before the rains come." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she used most of the grant money to repair deep cracks and crumbled 
stucco in her living room, dining room and bedroom walls, and estimates it will 
take an another $3,000 to repair similar damage outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Godfrey said most of the clients are living on small incomes and cannot absorb 
much of a loss. The federal and state aid includes grants of up to $22,200 and 
loans for quake-related structural repairs for property owners and personal 
losses for both property owners and renters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing is that though we can help people, it doesn't really 
compensate them, especially homeowners," he said. "You can go anywhere right 
around here, down Bronson Avenue, and find about 10 or 15 houses off their 
foundations. There's only so much we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 But the center, and others like it, will be helping people longer than 
expected: the federal government recently extended the deadline to apply for 
assistance to Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third time the deadline has been extended. With the amount of foot 
traffic the center is still getting, and the follow-up that must be done, 
Godfrey said, the Crenshaw center will keep its doors open at least until 
Christmas. "As long as we're needed, we'll be here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also offers preparedness and damage reduction workshops. It is open 
Monday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: WALNUT PARK; MAIL THEFT SOLUTIONS OFFERED

 Arming postal carriers with high-tech warning systems, building corrugated 
steel storage boxes and instituting a Neighborhood Watch program were a few 
suggestions put forth by residents concerned with this year's increase in mail 
thefts and robberies of mail carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 residents crowded into Walnut Park Elementary School at last 
week's Community Assn. meeting to discuss the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 On hand were authorities from the Postal Service, the Social Security 
Administration, the Sheriff's Department, and the offices of Rep. Lucille 
Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblywoman Martha M. Escutia (D-Huntington 
Park). Although the idea of equipping carriers with cellular phones to put them 
in immediate contact with law enforcement piqued the audience's curiosity, the 
most common suggested was the idea of direct deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sick of this problem just like you're sick of it," said Pamela Prince, 
the media liaison for the Postal Service. "But if you get direct deposit, like 
I have, that means the thieves have no access to your checks." 
</P>
<P>
 Though lauded by authorities as a way to thwart mail thefts, at least one 
resident saw a flaw with this solution: "How can we get direct deposit when 
banks require a minimal balance to begin with. A lot of us can't even afford 
that since we live check to check." 
</P>
<P>
 A field representative for Roybal-Allard said the congresswoman's office is in 
the process of asking area banks to waive the minimum-balance requirement.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; SMOKING BANNED IN MOST RESTAURANTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With little opposition, Huntington Park became the first Southeast city to 
outlaw smoking in most restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 At El Lucero, a restaurant near Pacific Boulevard that seats about 15, the 
reaction to the new ordinance was greeted with mild satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smoke bothers other people, so if someone wants to smoke, they can go 
outside," said owner Juan Guerrero, motioning to the empty patio in front of 
his taqueria.  
</P>
<P>
 But Mary Diaz, owner of El Cordial on Saturn Street, a Cuban and Mexican 
restaurant that seats about 50, fears that less smoking may mean less business. 
"I prefer to let the customers do what they please," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the law, which went into effect July 20, smoking is prohibited in 
restaurants with 30 seats or fewer. In larger restaurants, 80% of the seats 
must be nonsmoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone not complying will be guilty of an infraction, which means they will be 
"tapped on the finger," said Mayor Ric Loya. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who wants to go out and play tobacco cops?" said Loya, who is a former 
smoker. "Before passing this ordinance, we asked: 'How can we be fair, yet make 
a difference on this issue?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which could be superseded by legislation making its way through 
the Legislature, encountered no opposition July 5 when the City Council 
approved it. SIMON ROMERO

CITY TIMES COVER STORY; A STACK OF WOES; BUDGET PROBLEMS HAVE HIT COUNTY 
LIBRARY BRANCHES HARD, CLOSING MANY AND RESTRICTING HOURS AT OTHERS. THE 
CUTBACKS ARE ESPECIALLY FELT BY CHILDREN, WHOSE ACCESS TO A WORLD OF BOOKS AND 
IMAGINATION IS LIMITED.

 On the counter of the Huntington Park library, a small printed sign on a 
plastic water jug beckons to patrons: "Every penny counts. Cada centavo cuenta. 
" The jar is about one-quarter full, with several dollar bills but mostly loose 
change and a few rolls of pennies. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the extent of the fund raising at this county library branch. If the 
staff is thrifty, they'll be able to buy a few new bestsellers that patrons 
have been clamoring for. 
</P>
<P>
 Several miles away in Watts, employees of Los Angeles' Watts branch wait it 
out in a small, cramped building overflowing with books, videotapes and 
computers while construction continues on their new $2.8-million library due to 
open in the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the feast-or-famine world of community libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 A branch's quality -- perhaps its very existence -- can depend more upon which 
system it belongs to and how much private support it garners than on how badly 
the community might need its services. 
</P>
<P>
 People who live in Los Angeles enjoy a city library system that, one way or 
another, has been finding enough cash of late to improve or construct 
buildings, buy materials and fill long-vacant positions. Yet residents of 
nearby cities and unincorporated areas find their county system's branches 
struggling to stay open, let alone buy new books. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public keeps coming in and asking, 'Do you have bestsellers?' And I say 
'What bestsellers? We haven't bought bestsellers in two years,' " said Alfredo 
Zuniga, library manager of the county's Anthony Quinn branch on the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's 63-branch system has an operating budget of $36.7 million this 
fiscal year, an increase of almost 7% over last, but the county's 87-branch 
system has a budget of $47.6 million, down 26% from the previous fiscal year's 
$64.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Library experts say the result is more than some inconvenienced book-lovers. 
Because children using local libraries to prepare homework assignments become 
exposed to literature there, library financial problems could affect the 
literacy of future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In minority areas, especially, you already have some children who are reading 
below their (grade) level -- but at least they could get in the library after 
school and get a book," said Lydia Hammons, manager of the county's Willowbrook 
library. With dwindling operating hours and a declining inventory, that 
opportunity has become more limited. 
</P>
<P>
 The Willowbrook branch is almost hidden in the Kenneth Hahn Plaza, behind a 
key shop and a toy store. The magazine shelves have as many empty spaces as 
they do magazines. And the book selection is sometimes sparse. With two 
elementary schools within blocks of the branch, classes used to visit daily 
before the major budget cutbacks two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the library only being open two days a week we probably lose kids," 
Hammons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayra Jacinto, 10, used to go to her local Huntington Park library every 
afternoon for story time, but not since the library has been closing on 
Thursday and Fridays. "So I stay inside a lot, because it's boring outside," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the days the library is open, Mayra is busy dusting bookshelves, sweeping 
the rugs and putting up posters as a summer junior volunteer worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayra's volunteer work at the Huntington Park branch would happen whether or 
not the county library system was having financial difficulties, said 
children's librarian Karen D. Holmes. But the reduction of staff has created a 
need for more adult volunteers to take over a few extra duties. "It feels like 
our staff has just been wiped out and we just creep along by whatever means we 
can," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county branches are victims of an $11-million library department budget 
shortfall that shows no signs of abating. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the worst it's been (for the county libraries)," said David Flint, 
assistant director for finance and planning with the County of Los Angeles 
Public Libraries. "We were the most severely impacted libraries in the state -- 
both in dollar amount and percentage of our whole budget." 
</P>
<P>
 The county library district closed 10 branches in fiscal 1992-93 because of 
budget cuts, bringing the system down to 87 branches. Since last year's round 
of budget cuts, the system has laid off 370 full- and part-time workers, cut 
service hours by 65% and halted all purchases of new books, magazines and 
tapes. More than half of the libraries are only open two days a week, and seven 
of them are in Central and South Los Angeles and the Southeast cities. 
</P>
<P>
 All this finds the East Los Angeles, View Park and Willowbrook branches and 
the libraries in Bell and Huntington Park hoping their bad situation doesn't 
become worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're considered nonessential services -- jails are more important than 
libraries," Holmes said. "But, really, libraries are more important than jails. 
We keep people out of jail. We give them books for free and they bring them 
back. I'd say that's a pretty important resource, wouldn't you?" 
</P>
<P>
 The county libraries' immediate problems go back to last year, when Gov. Pete 
Wilson and the Legislature shifted $2.2 billion of property tax revenue to 
schools while balancing the state budget. The Los Angeles County library 
system, which relies heavily on property taxes, lost $29.4 million of its 
annual revenue overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When several of the system's libraries were recently threatened with closure, 
the County Board of Supervisors stepped in with a $2.5-million loan to keep 
them open at least until September. By then the county must either raise 
additional funds or set in place a funding operation to ensure that the money 
will be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 This month the board voted 3 to 1 to support a special tax district to fund 
county libraries and allow them to return to a five-day schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 City councils in the 52 municipalities in the county's library district must 
decide whether they will join in. Only property owners in the unincorporated 
parts of the county and the participating cities will be taxed, county 
officials said, estimating that the average homeowner would pay less than $30 
per year. Only libraries in these areas would receive the funding. The 
supervisors have scheduled an Aug. 30 public hearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 County library officials are also hoping for relief through a bill sponsored 
by state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys). The bill, SB-1448, would allow 
public libraries statewide to form special assessment districts to raise 
operating funds. Wilson vetoed a similar bill last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, county libraries have mounted ambitious private fund-raising 
efforts on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Independent of what we hope to get from the state, we have a fairly active 
private fund-raising effort going on, plus the activities we have from our 
Friends groups," Flint said. "Some are fairly active considering the economic 
level of the communities they're in." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 county libraries in Central and South Los Angeles and in the Southeast 
cities have come to rely heavily on their individual Friends of the Library 
organizations, which have helped spread the word about the branches in addition 
to getting donations of money, books or other supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The East Los Angeles' Friends organization, founded last November, has 
garnered strong community support through a door-to-door campaign and 
storytelling festivals. The group's rummage sale during a countywide library 
fund-raiser brought in $1,600. Huntington Park's Friends group for the 
children's library has donated books, magazine racks and periodicals. Holmes, 
the children's section librarian, has brought in a desk and typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
 In Willowbrook, it's been a little harder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day, the plastic water jug placed on that branch's counter to 
collect a few coins, maybe some dollar bills, sat empty. The branch's Friends 
group consists of two people who haven't been able to rally a lot of residents 
to their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an area where you can ask people for money," said Hammons, the 
branch manager. "It's hard enough getting them to come to the library. If they 
do come, it's because they can't afford to buy the books themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Los Angeles system's nearly 30 inner-city branches are not in 
dire financial straits, they still rely on private sources for summer reading 
programs, computer classes or to buy more books than the city budget can 
support. For inner-city branches, raising the funds is more difficult than in 
other areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends groups in places like Woodland Hills, Sherman Oaks and West L.A. can 
raise over $1,000 a month in fund-raising drives," said Arthur Pond, senior 
librarian at the city's Hyde Park branch. "Here we raise about $125. . . . This 
is not a neighborhood that has a lot of money to spend, and it's not one where 
there are a lot of used-book dealers haunting the book sales." 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends of Baldwin Hills and Watts have been sponsoring book and bake 
sales. Volunteers work for little else than the pleasure of being near books. 
</P>
<P>
 And some corporations are doing their part.

 At the Mark Twain branch in South-Central, three computers in a new homework 
center are the results of a $150,000 donation over three years from Sanwa Bank 
California, which adopted the branch as part of the city library system's new 
Adopt-a-Branch project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like the luck of the draw to find out which branch will attract 
the attention of a certain person with money," said Laura Dwan, senior 
librarian at the city's Baldwin Hills branch, which has just a small collection 
of books for adults and focuses more on children. 
</P>
<P>
 In affluent areas, a mere signature on a personal check can provide major 
financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 2,000 Brentwood residents paid for almost all of the $2.4-million 
construction bill for their new 10,400-square-foot library, with one woman 
giving more than $1 million. The Los Angeles City Council put up $350,000 from 
the city's General Fund for the project, a decision that caused controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The distribution of advantages in Los Angeles follows very closely the 
neighborhoods of big campaign contributors," said Jeb Brighouse, a community 
activist in Echo Park, where the local branch library has been housed in 
temporary quarters on North Laveta Terrace since the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money talks. Brentwood talks, and Echo Park is silent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials dispute such comments. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Very often there is a perceived disparity among communities (for public works 
projects)," said Fontayne Holmes, assistant director of branches for the Los 
Angeles Public Library. "But I can say, in the library department, that is 
really not true. There is equitable distribution of library funds throughout 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has just finished taking bids for a new Echo Park branch, but no 
ground has been broken, said Robert G. Reagan, a spokesman for the city library 
system. It typically takes seven years to build a library, he said, from 
securing financing to the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, meanwhile, the City Council doled out $56,000 a year for a 
5,000-square-foot space in the Neptune Building at 701 E. 3rd St. for the 
Little Tokyo library, ending a two-year search to relocate that branch from 
temporary quarters. The branch, now located in a 2,400-square-foot room, will 
be moving into the new facilities in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five of the city branches are undergoing major rebuilding or 
renovation, thanks to a $53.4-million bond issue passed by voters in 1989 and 
federal Community Development Block Grant funds. Eight branches in Central and 
South Los Angeles are being repaired or replaced because the historic sites 
needed to be brought up to seismic code or because the libraries' resources 
were outgrowing their facilities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just too cramped here. We're busting at the seams," said Norma Anders, 
senior librarian at the Watts branch. 
</P>
<P>
 The new 12,500-square-foot Watts branch is scheduled to open at 103rd Street 
and Compton Avenue. This month, workers began renovating the Memorial branch at 
4625 W. Olympic Blvd. in Country Club Park, the Angeles Mesa library at 2400 W. 
52nd St. and the John Muir branch at 1005 W. 64th St. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund-raising efforts led by actress-choreographer Debbie Allen and the J. Paul 
Getty Trust raised more than $700,000 for the rebuilding of the Muir and the 
relocation of the Junipero Serra, 4301 S. Figueroa Ave. The temporary locations 
of both libraries were damaged during the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are under way to build a 10,500-square-foot Junipero Serra branch. The 
original 1923 building on South Olive Street was damaged in January's 
Northridge earthquake and will be repaired and -- like other historic library 
buildings that can't measure up to seismic codes because of book stacks -- 
converted to other public use. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook for city libraries is favorable right now, said Pond, the senior 
librarian at the Hyde Park branch. But it could always change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Libraries have good local support, but when city (or county) government gets 
in a pinch, that's when we tend to bite it," Pond said. "And when libraries 
take a hit, it is really a big deal."

COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM ALL BEGAN WITH 'LITTLE WOMEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles City Library was founded in 1872 when Myer J. Newmark, William 
Workman, Samuel Foy and others opened a reading room of donated books and 
periodicals at Los Angeles and Arcadia streets, where the 101 Freeway meets 
Pueblo de Los Angeles park Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators established an entrance fee of $5 and monthly dues of $1, but the 
enterprise was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that year, more than 200 city leaders met at the Merced Theater on Main 
Street and founded the Los Angeles Library Assn. The organization's first 
library was set up in four small dark rooms over a saloon, where the Federal 
Building stands at Los Angeles and Temple streets. The association was given 
three months' free rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Account books show the librarian spent 25 cents for ice to put in the tin 
water cooler and chess tables were part of the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the city's first librarian, Mary E. Foy, the downstairs bar 
customers often walked up to settle their bets. "Which Webster wrote the 
dictionary?" asked one wavering saloon customer. "Daniel or Noah?" 
</P>
<P>
 The county library system was established in 1912. The first branch was opened 
in Willowbrook in the home of Belle B. Jenks, who served as the branch's 
librarian until she retired in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 The first act of the county district's librarian, Celia Gleason, was to open 
an office consisting of one typewriter and one desk on the then-unfurnished 
10th floor of the Hall of Records. She ordered the first book for the new 
library system, "Little Women" by Louisa May Alcott. JIM WALTERS

100% PURE TALENT; SCHEA COTTON IS 16, BUT HE ALREADY HAS THE ATTENTION OF FANS 
AND RECRUITERS NATIONWIDE AND MAY BE GOOD ENOUGH TO SHIFT THE BALANCE OF POWER 
IN BASKETBALL FROM CENTRAL L.A. TO ORANGE COUNTY.

 What is a manchild?  
</P>
<P>
 In basketball terms, it is a young athlete whose physique and talents belie 
his age. 
</P>
<P>
 To fans who have seen Schea Cotton play, it is Schea Cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA recruit Toby Bailey, formerly of Loyola High School, offers the most 
appropriate summation of Cotton on the hardwood: "He is a kid in a man's body." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey's Cubs lost to Cotton's Mater Dei Monarchs in last year's Southern 
Section Division I-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, like others who have watched and played against Cotton, marvels at his 
athletic ability: "Schea can jump, is incredibly strong and is extremely 
quick."  
</P>
<P>
 Adjectives such as vast and unlimited are generally used to describe the 
16-year-old's potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just go out and let my actions speak for themselves," said the 6-foot--5, 
215-pound sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cotton has everyone listening. 
</P>
<P>
 An article on Cotton in the July 25 issue of Sports Illustrated validates his 
status as high school's newest basketball sensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to get caught up in all the hoopla surrounding me," Cotton said. "I 
just go out and play my game."  
</P>
<P>
 With the national emergence of Cotton, Inglewood's Paul Pierce and Fontana's 
Corey Benjamin, it now seems the Best in the West play outside the central 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, fans could attend a Crenshaw game and see four future Division I 
scholarship athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Southern California's high-profiled players -- Bailey, Fowlkes, 
Johnson, Washington's Dayron Harris (Long Beach State), Verbum Dei's Andre 
Miller (Utah), Manual Art's David Rickenbacker (San Diego State), Crenshaw's 
Tommie Davis (Houston) and Reggie McFerren (Kansas State) played in the Central 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of attention has shifted from Crenshaw to Inglewood, thanks to 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked extremely hard to get to this point so I relish the notoriety," 
said the 6-7 forward, who led the Sentinels (30-4) to their best season in 14 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce averaged 23.2 points and 11 rebounds for Inglewood, while finishing 
runner-up to St. John Bosco's Jelani Gardner (Cal) for 1994 Division II Player 
of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul is the best player in the senior class," said John Bailey, father of 
Toby and Moose. "He reminds me of Toby because he plays a lot of center, but 
can play the (shooting guard) and (small forward)." 
</P>
<P>
 John Bailey was an assistant coach of the California Seniors traveling team 
that won the Slam-N-Jam NIT two years ago. That squad included Toby, Jacque 
Vaughn of Kansas and Charles O'Bannon of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Bailey has been around enough talented players to know Cotton is worth 
the billing: "Schea is a strong all-around player that is every bit as good as 
advertised."  
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, who was named to the Los Angeles Times All-County Team as a freshman, 
averaged 18 points for the Monarchs. He scored a team-high 16 points in Mater 
Dei's 71-67 State Division I semifinal loss to Crenshaw. It was the Monarch's 
second consecutive loss to Crenshaw in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Another player who made a name for himself at the July 1-5 Nike Scholastic 
Festival in Deerfield, Ill., was Fontana's Benjamin. The 6-5 junior was Co-MVP 
of the Citrus Belt League with teammate Travon Carmichael last year, averaging 
18 points, nine rebounds, five assists and three steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nike publicist Tom Feuer of Benjamin's performance at the festival: "He 
was the story of the camp." 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin's brother Sonny, a 6-8 forward at Oregon State, was a member of the 
California Seniors team that won the NIT in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin, who watched many of his brother's games, learned a valuable lesson. 
"Watching those guys play taught me how to conduct myself on the court and to 
be ready to play every game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's seniors have left this year's seniors with a tough, perhaps even 
impossible, act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any big-named players in the Central City like last year," John 
Bailey said. "Toby's class was exceptional in terms of the depth of talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Toby agrees: "There was a lot of talent last year. There may be a couple of 
superstars in the future but there won't be that many great players (in the 
area) in one class for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Kevin Gibson, coach of two-time City runner-up Dorsey, believes there are 
enough talented players to make the 1994-95 season as competitive as years 
past. "I think (talent-wise) the city will come pretty close to last year," 
Gibson said. "We have some players, so do Crenshaw, Washington, Manual Arts and 
Fremont." 
</P>
<P>
 There is certain to be more parity in the area, with the departure of Fowlkes 
and Johnson loosening Crenshaw's stranglehold on the City title. Every team has 
one or two solid players: Bailey at Loyola, Donnie Wilcher at Fremont, Ronnie 
Arch and Travis Reed at Crenshaw, Darwin Carter at Manual Arts, Will O'Neal at 
Dorsey and Ty Lamar Gordon at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year could be the year that Dorsey -- or several other area teams -- 
finally breaks through. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be better than last year, with nine returnees this year," Gibson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every team is a lot more experienced, to a man, than last year. 
Regardless of who's gone, it's going to be a good season."

MIMS FAILS TO FUND SENIOR BOWL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chris Mims Senior Bowl, scheduled for Saturday at Compton College, was 
canceled because Mims did not fulfill his financial obligation to the all-star 
football game, organizer Jerry Weiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiner said he has made several attempts to contact Mims but has not heard 
from the former Dorsey High and current San Diego Charger lineman.Mims was in 
the third year of a four-year contract to sponsor the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no time did he advise me that he was not going to fund his share of the 
game as he has done since 1992," Weiner said. "It's a sad disappointment for 
the 90 players and approximately 60 cheerleaders who were going to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of them have been terribly shocked and frustrated because they could not 
have the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Mims was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont Coach Taja Rodisha and his staff were to coach the East team, which 
included seven Fremont players: quarterback William Yates, linebacker Carl 
Bledman, receiver Andre Johnson, guards Victor Montalvo and Francisco Fausto, 
center Jose Estrada, defensive tackle George Jacobs and kicker Javier Acosta. 
</P>
<P>
 Other East players included quarterback Akili Roberson (Locke), defensive end 
Tavio Daniels (Locke), tight end Andre Griffin (Manual Arts) and defensive back 
John Johnson (Jefferson). 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax coach Terrel Ray and his staff had organized and run practices for the 
West team last week. Among West players scheduled to compete were running backs 
Che Johnson and Chris Phillips (Dorsey), quarterback Jovon Jiles (Crenshaw) and 
lineman Norman Ysaguirre (Dorsey). 
</P>
<P>
 "This game is very important to the community because several players have 
received scholarships," Ray said. "I don't blame Mims because he has flipped 
for the bill for the last two games. Things happen in people's lives, and you 
can't always do the things you would like to do."

DEVOTED FANS TRY TO SHAKE SENSE OF DOOM AT PEP RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMY HYUNJOO KRESTA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sun shone brightly over the soccer field at UC Irvine Saturday afternoon, 
but a sense of pending doom clouded conversations among 300 Rams fans who 
gathered to support their team and to watch them practice -- possibly for the 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to prevent the move of the NFL team to a city outside 
California, Rams Booster Club and Save the Rams committee members organized the 
pep rally to show that the fans support the team and want the Rams to stay in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more of an emotional part of the total plan to get them to stay," 
Booster Club President Frank Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fans, many of whom had followed the team since childhood, didn't feel 
much like cheering Saturday. Instead, they watched practice from the sidelines, 
feeling powerless and frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had money and power," said Bill Weber, 52, of Playa del Rey. "I 
would do whatever it took to keep them here." 
</P>
<P>
 Weber has been following the Rams for nearly five decades. And he was happy to 
make the hourlong drive to Irvine to stand by his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt obligated to be here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lollie Nunez, 50, of Midway City, said she inherited her undying support for 
the Rams from her mother. On Saturday, Nunez showed up at the pep rally with 
her son and grandson, all of whom wore yellow and blue jerseys and caps. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they moved away, it would be like an empty spot in our lives," Nunez said. 
"In our family, it's the church, the government and the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Martinez, 56, of Westminster, said he was born a Rams fan and would die a 
Rams fan. "Probably when I die, I'll be wearing a Rams cap," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the flurry of controversy and business negotiations, Rams team members 
seemed to appreciate the simplicity of their fans' devotion Saturday. They 
autographed footballs, jerseys and caps while heading toward the open field to 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the true people who really care. These are the die-hard fans," said 
Troy Drayton, a tight end. "People like this are the ones who are going to be 
here whether we win or lose." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar booster club rally at Anaheim Stadium several months ago drew a much 
smaller crowd, but people are beginning to pay closer attention now as they 
realize that they may lose the Rams to another city, Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Tucker is certainly paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, who lives in San Francisco, drove more than eight hours to attend the 
rally Saturday. He said he makes the trek for every home game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to show the ownership of the Rams that the problem is not the 
fans but the leadership at the top," said Tucker, 44. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're out here because people need to believe in them -- through the good and 
the bad," he said. "I hate the 49ers. I come here from San Francisco and I'm 
not flying to Baltimore, that's all I can say."

ALL THE ACTION'S ON THE WAVES AS OP PRO SURF FANS CHILL OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite mostly gloomy skies, about 25,000 people flocked to Huntington Beach 
on the first weekend day of the 13th annual Ocean Pacific Pro Surfing 
Championship, but the event that once earned distinction as the city's biggest 
beach party this year lured a more sedate crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're seeing the hard-core surf fanatics out there, and that's what 
this event is all about," said Op Pro spokesman Mike Kingsbury. "It's not a 
beach party anymore. It's a surf event, and that's the crowd we're really 
marketing to." 
</P>
<P>
 The surf contest that boasts more competitors than any other in the world and 
drew major sponsors began Thursday and wraps up today with the men's, women's, 
juniors' and longboard finals. This year's competition included a record number 
54 women performers, more than twice as many as last year, Kingsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the mood was mellow in the security-sensitive beach town, where 
city officials have described the surfing competition as a chance to improve an 
image tarnished by Fourth of July disturbances two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Onlookers dotted the bleachers and packed the beach, some clad in skimpy 
bikinis and others donning slacks, hats and sunscreen to ward off the rays that 
finally broke through the gloom late in the day. Others toted video cameras and 
poised their camera lenses to capture the stunts of their favorite surfing 
stars, and a few small children played in the surf, oblivious to the 
competition taking place on the waves in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Loyal fans mobbed former world champion and teen-age heart-throb Kelly Slater 
for autographs. Others paid homage to the longboard surfing legends of years 
gone by, and cheered the couples who performed acrobatic feats during a tandem 
exhibition, the first ever featured at the Op Pro contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up around surfing. This is the happening event in Huntington Beach," 
said 28-year-old Mendi Blake, who attended her first championship 13 years ago 
as a young surfer star struck by all the big names. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to see all the old guys from when I used to subscribe to Surfer 
magazine," she said, keeping an eye out for Op Surf stars Peter Townend, Corky 
Carroll and Herbie Fletcher. "Out of all the Op Pros, I've probably missed 
four. I've been here from the very beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 The surfing bonanza, which features more than $70,000 in prize money, is a 
qualifying event for the sport's U.S. Open, which starts here Tuesday and is 
the first Assn. of Surfing Professionals world tour competition on the U.S. 
mainland since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's event was marked by choppy two- to four-foot swells that made for 
some rough surfing, and a few complaints from beach-goers angered at a 
first-ever $5 charge for bleacher seating that organizers say will help offset 
the cost of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blake said crowds looked thin compared to previous years. Spectators used to 
line the pier end-to-end free of charge, she said, but Saturday the pier was 
instead lined with bleachers that cost $5 to sit in. Bleacher seating was free 
during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never paid before. This is our beach. We pay taxes!" complained Blake's 
friend, Alison Villegas, 28, of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake said wimpy waves around the Huntington Beach Pier have earned it the 
dubious nickname of "Lake Huntington" in surfers' circles for years, and by her 
standards, Saturday's swells were definitely not pumping. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kingsbury said contestants could still pull multiple maneuvers on a wave, 
and after Slater wowed onlookers with his "patented aerials" he was bombarded 
by autograph-hungry teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun broke through the haze by mid-afternoon, and city lifeguard Capt. Bill 
Richardson estimated 20,000 beach-goers were watching the competition from the 
sand and 5,000 more filled the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came to see the tandem surfing. I'm stoked they put that in there this 
year," said Jeff Loftis, 26, of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could use a swell," he added, as he sized up the water -- gray from cloud 
cover and choppy from an offshore breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 The surfing championship has worked hard to recover from its own negative 
image: In 1986, hundreds of beach-goers went on a rampage, pelting police 
officers with rock and bottles and overturning and burning police cars. At 
least 12 people, including five Huntington Beach police officers, were injured. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But officials have tightened security at the event and organizers changed the 
format and marketing to lure a more dedicated surfing crowd, Kingsbury said. 
Last year, they moved a bikini contest, the flash point of the 1986 unrest, to 
a weekday, and this year they eliminated it altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other than one fight late in the day off Main Street that drew dozens of 
onlookers, police reported no problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to make it low-key, and if this is any indication, it worked!" 
said Jackie Chenelia of Huntington Beach, who came to cheer on her daughter, 
surfing star Tricia Gil. "I'd rather see it like this than with 90 million 20- 
and 25-year-olds running around. They get too wired." 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Merrick, the 18-year-old daughter of surfboard shaper Al Merrick, has 
been coming to the events since she was 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be crazy. I'm glad that it's mellow now because I've grown out of 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Aaron Pai, owner of Huntington Surf and Sport, a more dedicated surfing 
crowd meant bigger sales. He had already sold "well over a thousand" T-shirts 
and anticipates doubling that by the end of the U.S. Open next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going crazy," he said. "It's like night and day compared to last year." 
</P>
<P>
 At Perqs Sports Bar and Niteclub on Main Street, owner Gary Mulligan said the 
tenor of the event has definitely changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd's more conservative. . . . Business is better, there's just no 
violence," he said. "I think our town's maturing a little bit."

RAM BACKERS HUDDLING FOR '4TH-DOWN' TRY; SPORTS: SAVE THE RAMS GROUP HAS JUST 
THREE WEEKS TO SCORE AND KEEP THE PRO FOOTBALL TEAM IN ANAHEIM. A NEW STADIUM 
AND TICKET-SALE GUARANTEES ARE AMONG OPTIONS BEING CONSIDERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each Tuesday morning since mid-June, a plush conference room in the Anaheim 
Marriott is transformed into a war room. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Steinberg, the Newport Beach agent to the stars of professional sports, 
arrives sleepy-eyed from cross-country deal making. Jack Lindquist, respected 
former president of Disneyland, joins him at the head of the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Ron Lane, who bailed burger magnate Carl Karcher out of financial 
troubles last year, clears his schedule to make the 7:30 a.m. meetings. As does 
Bill Taormina, the county's waste disposal magnate, and a dozen others. Orange 
County Supervisor William G. Steiner has been coming for five weeks, even 
though "supervisors rarely go to meetings like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The room crackles with urgency -- and power. One thing has united these chiefs 
of sport, real estate, politics and business: the prospect of losing an NFL 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody remembers that Baltimore, St. Louis and Oakland had the Colts, the 
Cardinals and the Raiders," said Roy Englebrecht, 48, a sports promoter and 
part-owner of a minor league baseball team who is a regular attendee. "These 
are the cities that lost the Colts, the Cardinals and the Raiders. I don't want 
Orange County to have that label for the next 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the battle to keep the Rams were a football game, this roster of heavy 
hitters didn't enter the game until the final quarter. They've never played 
together, and they've only got time for a few last-ditch plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having a fourth down with nine yards to go and needing to score a 
touchdown to win, not a field goal, a touchdown," Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Steiner said the group, which calls itself Save the Rams, has just three 
weeks to score. 
</P>
<P>
 But for group members, it's not as simple as coming up with a state-of-the-art 
stadium plan and an extra $15 million a year in revenue to match the game plans 
of rivals St. Louis and Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 What these men -- all powerful deal makers in their own worlds -- have to do 
doesn't follow the neat rules of football or business. On this they agree: Rams 
President John Shaw may be the team's chief negotiator, but owner Georgia 
Frontiere is its heart -- and they're plotting a quadruple bypass around Shaw 
to win it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our mission in the next three weeks: to present something to make her 
hesitate and blink and say, 'Let's think about this,' " Englebrecht said. 
"Maybe we can get her to say, 'I didn't know that many people are interested in 
the team.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Group members are coy about their plans for courting Frontiere. But hundreds 
of postcards have been distributed reading "Dear Georgia, I/We think the Los 
Angeles Rams should stay in Southern California and P.S. (fill in number) of my 
friends agree with me." Thousands of T-shirts reading "We love you Georgia" are 
being printed. And there's even talk of making one of Georgia's pet projects 
part of any offer: a home for elderly football players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to woo her with respect," said Taormina, chairman of Taormina 
Industries Inc., whose father painted "Rams Here in '80" on the side of a 
garbage truck when Anaheim arranged in 1979 to lure the team south.  
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, the group has waited almost until the final buzzer to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis and Baltimore have been charging down the field since late 1993. 
Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos made a third trip out to see Shaw this 
month. In June, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), St. Louis Mayor 
Freeman Bosley Jr. and St. Louis County Executive George (Buzz) Westfall came 
to huddle with the Ram executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's part of the problem," said Lane of Newport Beach-based Lane Kuhn 
Pacific. "The Baltimore mayor comes out here. The mayor of St. Louis comes out 
here. Orange County is a different animal." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Save the Rams members said they initially thought Shaw was bluffing, or 
already set on leaving, when rumors of a possible move first surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I watched from the sidelines, I was sort of stunned by the lack of 
responsiveness, and I was pretty much going to write off the Rams," Steiner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the group's members joined up after calls from Steinberg and Rams 
Booster Club President Frank Bryant, who painted a bleak picture of how the 
loss of the Rams could tarnish the image of Orange County as a vital business 
and sports area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a business that has intangible value to the area. It reinforces a name 
and an image," said Wayne Wedin, chairman-elect of the Orange County Chamber of 
Commerce. "What we're going to show the league is, of course, we love them. 
There must be some misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the group's members were drawn by the chance to play a part in the 
future of a professional football franchise -- be it helping construct a 
stadium or buying a piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are guys who are on it who went to Rams games when they were 9 and are 
caught up in the emotion of it," Englebrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lane, often touted as a potential investor, said he would only invest if 
it made financial sense -- and included some say over the running of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane, who served as baseball commissioner for the 1984 Summer Olympics 
exhibition games, said the sense that Frontiere will not surrender some control 
is "a stumbling block and a problem" for himself and other potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie Johnson, the Rams former All-Pro free safety, was the Rams' first 
round draft pick in 1980, the year they moved to Anaheim. He joined the effort 
after a call from Steinberg, and his job is to give the group an inside peek 
into what the team and Frontiere want. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the right buttons to push," said Johnson, 37, now an Anaheim real 
estate agent, adding that most of the players want to stay put. "You ask people 
throughout the organization if they want to move and there's only one person 
that does and that's John" Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 With the former free safety in the group, Shaw "can't come back and say you 
don't know what the hell you're talking about," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He tipped Steiner off to the greatest need of the players -- a new training 
facility. Steiner has since made tentative plans with the Orange Redevelopment 
Agency to lease 25 acres across the Santa Ana River from the stadium for new 
practice fields, corporate headquarters and a retail complex. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes according to plan, the group will present Frontiere and Shaw with 
a plan in mid-August and unveil it publicly Aug. 19 at a monster bash it's 
planning for the Rams season kickoff luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the front-runner proposal includes a state-of-the-art, $60-million 
overhaul of Anaheim Stadium for the Rams using revenue bonds, guaranteed season 
ticket and luxury box sales, and a new $100-million stadium for the Angels to 
be built with public and private funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Englebrecht, who heads the stadium committee, said the group can't change the 
way the Rams run the team nor its win-loss record. But a "new" Anaheim stadium 
might. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new house. A new car. It smells good. It feels good. It's a win-win," he 
said.

BILL BOYARSKY: RUNNING THE CITY EFFICIENTLY IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The experience of Mayor Richard Riordan's bureaucracy-cutting task force 
illustrates the rough road facing outsiders trying to reduce the size of 
government and make it more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mayor's Special Committee on Fiscal Administration, composed of business 
executives, came up with controversial and far-reaching proposals for Riordan's 
first budget. Some of the committee's suggestions were included when the budget 
was adopted last month. But the big ones were turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebuff left the committee chairman, Michael E. Tennenbaum, frustrated and 
unhappy. On Wednesday, when the committee issued a follow-up report, he told 
Times reporter James Rainey that "the mayor, together with the City Council, 
failed to do what they needed to do." He said city finances are "worse than a 
kindergarten PTA." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennenbaum, senior managing partner of the Bear, Stearns & Co. brokerage firm, 
who hasn't had many dealings with the press, suddenly and painfully learned the 
awesome power of a sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to defaming PTA finance chairs, Tennenbaum also upset the mayor's 
new chief of staff, Bill Ouchi. The next day, sounding a bit surprised by all 
the fuss he'd stirred up, Tennenbaum told me: "What I tried to say was that the 
lack of charter reform means that the city is run" in an inefficient manner. 
"The city is very lucky to have Dick Riordan as mayor, and they ought to let 
him be in charge," Tennenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tennenbaum got involved early in the Riordan Administration when Ouchi asked 
him to lead a study of how the city could save money through improved leasing 
and debt financing practices. Tennenbaum felt that a deeper look was needed -- 
a study of all city finances and operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force was created and divided into subcommittees. A major task was to 
figure out how the city treasury could get more money from the three big 
departments that produce revenue -- airports, harbor and water and power. The 
latter department went to a subcommittee headed by Dick Roladian, a managing 
partner for Arthur Andersen, an accounting and business services firm. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a formidable job because of the size and political power of the DWP, a 
department whose history is intertwined with that of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP, the nation's largest municipally owned utility, built the aqueduct 
that brought water to Los Angeles in the early 20th Century, permitting a 
metropolis to grow on what had been arid land. Along with the water, the 
department generated electricity for the metropolis's homes and industries. 
</P>
<P>
 In an irony of history, this government enterprise was wholeheartedly 
supported by the businessmen who built Los Angeles, for it provided them with 
cheap water and power for their businesses and subdivisions. The department 
became the pride, and economic engine, of the city's power structure, a status 
symbolized by its Bunker Hill high-rise headquarters and reflecting pond, 
looking down on City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are quite autonomous and don't feel part of the city," said another 
committee member, Linda Griego, president of RLA, the nonprofit rebuilding 
agency formed after the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Roladian told me that his subcommittee compared the DWP's operation to that of 
Southern California Edison, a private power company, and found that the city 
department could be run more efficiently, and earn more money. 
</P>
<P>
 The electric utilities, he said, will soon be deregulated, and companies such 
as Edison will cut prices to big industries. "The DWP will have to put a 
tremendous effort on competitiveness to retain its industrial customers," 
Roladian said. A more efficient department, the task force said, would not only 
keep its customers, but would save enough money to contribute $118 million a 
year to the city treasury. A separate study, done for the City Council, put 
potential savings at more than $223 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The department rallied its own friends in the business community and on the 
City Council. Other departments targeted by the task force also fought back. 
With the task force report under attack, the mayor decided to drop the most 
controversial proposals, including the DWP economies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eli Broad, another task force member, told me attorney Bill Wardlaw and others 
advised the mayor against going for the entire task force package his first 
year in office. "The mayor got conservative political advice on what to go 
ahead with this year and what to do next year," Broad said. "He and his 
advisers felt that to put it all on the table in the first budget would be a 
self-defeating strategy. I don't think it was a lack of will; it was a question 
of doing it at the proper time." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the task facing the mayor's reshuffled team -- Ouchi as chief of staff 
and his predecessor, Bill McCarley, who is now acting general manager of the 
DWP. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll go about it with a heightened awareness of the difficulty of achieving 
change.

TALES OF PATIENCE IN TRANSIT STRIKE; MTA, UNION RECONVENE AFTER MEETING TO 
CLEAR AIR; STRIKE: NEGOTIATIONS RESUME DAY AFTER UNION LEADERS WALK OUT OVER 
AGENCY CHIEF'S LETTER TO MECHANICS. UNION PRESIDENT VOICES CONFIDENCE THAT A 
SETTLEMENT CAN BE REACHED.

 Talks resumed in the transit strike Saturday -- one day after union leaders 
representing idled bus mechanics walked out of negotiations in protest of what 
they said was the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's decision to send a 
"misleading" letter directly to workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's negotiations began in midafternoon after a meeting, arranged by 
state mediator Tom McCarthy, to clear the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks continued throughout the day but no resolution had been reached by late 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Bujosa, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, said McCarthy 
"feels that there's a good chance we can settle this strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Bujosa said of his union: "We're willing to meet around the clock, if need 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy, who has helped settle past Los Angeles transit strikes, could not be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The union agreed to return to the bargaining table after appeals Saturday 
morning from county Supervisor Ed Edelman, chairman of the MTA board and a 
longtime labor ally, and city Councilman Richard Alatorre, also an MTA board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike, which enters its seventh day today, has inconvenienced more than 
half a million bus riders daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public is depending on us," Edelman said he told a union leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks broke down Friday when union leaders expressed disgust with a 
conciliatory letter MTA chief executive Franklin White sent to the 1,900 
mechanics as part of a campaign to bypass the union and speak directly to the 
rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 White said in the letter that the MTA's controversial plan to contract out 
work would not cost any of the mechanics their jobs. He wrote that the MTA's 
proposed contract "provides two years of job protection, with no reduction in 
pay" for all union members whose work has been subcontracted. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders said they saw the letter as an attempt to undercut their 
position that the subcontracting is job-threatening and to confuse the rank and 
file. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they think we're going to sit at (the bargaining) table and they're going 
to conduct a campaign with our members while we're tied up talking to them, 
that's not going to happen," said Jim Wood, secretary-treasurer of the Los 
Angeles County Federation of Labor AFL-CIO, which is participating in the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "That required us to go back (and consult with) our members," Wood said.  
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders spent part of Friday and Saturday morning doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our members want us to continue bargaining," Wood said. "I think the air has 
been cleared." 
</P>
<P>
 White has said that the MTA board approved his sending of the letter and that 
there is nothing inappropriate about an employer communicating directly with 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA's chief negotiator, lawyer Gordon Krischer, declined comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' first transit strike since 1982 began Monday when the mechanics, 
who earn an average of $44,000 a year, walked off their jobs and the MTA's 
5,000 drivers and clerks honored their picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
 To provide skeletal service, the MTA used management personnel to put 350 
buses -- 225 of them rented -- into service on weekdays, when 1,900 buses 
normally run, spokesman Jim Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the weekend, service has been cut back much further. Only portions of Bus 
Lines No. 21 on Wilshire Boulevard, No. 30 on Pico Boulevard, No. 45 on 
Broadway and all of No. 204 on Vermont Avenue will be in service today along 
with limited rail service on the Red Line subway and Blue Line trolley, Smart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Richard Simon contributed to this article. The MTA Strike: 
Day 6 
</P>
<P>
 The region's first transit strike in 12 years began at 12:01 a.m. Monday. Here 
is a look at Day 6: 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ISSUE: Dispute between the Amalgamated Transit Union, representing 1,900 
mechanics and service attendants, and the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. About 5,000 bus and train drivers and clerks are honoring picket 
lines. The major sticking point is the MTA's demand to contract out work. Union 
members say they believe that it will eliminate jobs and result in poorer 
quality work. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE STATUS: Negotiations resumed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT'S OPERATING: MTA buses will operate on four routes this weekend. 
Limited service continues on the Red Line and Blue Line. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ROUTES:  
</P>
<P>
 Portions of these MTA lines will run today. 21 Wilshire Blvd.; 45 Broadway; 30 
Pico Blvd.-East 1st Street ; 204 Vermont Ave. will have regular service.  
</P>
<P>
 * HOURS: MTA buses will run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * FARES: 50 cents on MTA buses and Blue Line, with no transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 * FOR INFORMATION: (800) COMMUTE or (800) 371-LINK (for Metrolink 
information). Recorded information in English and Spanish is available at (800) 
870-0MTA.

TALES OF PATIENCE IN TRANSIT STRIKE; RIDERS KEEP THEIR HUMOR AMID THE CONFUSION 
</P>

 As the transit strike rolled into its first weekend, only six Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority lines were in service -- four for buses and two for 
trains. Commuters who climbed aboard Saturday were trying to get to stores, 
work, the beach, or just out of the house. Here are some stories from the 
front:  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the 103rd Street station, Jasmin Pickering, 6, marched onto the Blue Line 
train in oversize flower-framed sunglasses, clutching a plastic pail and 
shovel, a towel and a T-shirt. She was followed by her brother, Jeremy, 12, 
toting a Boogie Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know if it was running, so we just came over," said their mother, 
Stacy Williams, 29, whose Watts home is not far from the Blue Line station. "I 
knew that it was the only thing that would get us to Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 They were not sure how far the train would take them but they were determined 
to get to the beach. "It's too hot in Los Angeles," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, she said, "my kids like to ride the train. It's like a little trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Jasmin, her braids festooned with bright, colorful barrettes, smiled 
deliciously. "It's fun," she said of the train. "It goes fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a medical assistant in a senior citizens home, left behind a cranky 
car and her car mechanic husband -- who had already spent hours trying to fix 
the auto. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's all bummed out about the car. He wants to stay home and mope," Williams 
said, laughing. "I said, 'Me and the kids are going to the beach.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a trip," Excell Oliver said with a weary smile, settling back on the 
Blue Line train that would take him from the Downtown Metro Center to 
somewhere, anywhere near Orange County, he hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now with the strike, to get to Orange County, it's like trying to get to the 
moon," said Oliver, 35. His usual express bus from Los Angeles to Disneyland -- 
a casualty of the strike -- looked like a rocket compared to the alternates 
Oliver had been desperately trying to piece together since late Friday night. A 
county government word processor most of the week, Oliver works in the city of 
Orange from Friday night to Sunday afternoon for a man who owns a janitorial 
service. He had already missed a Friday night job, but his boss was 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me last night: 'Get anywhere in the vicinity and I'll come pick you 
up,' but I haven't been able to figure out how to get to the vicinity.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He took a bus from his Mid-Wilshire home to Alvarado Street and the Red Line 
train from there to Metro Center and the Blue Line. "I'm taking this hopefully 
to Anaheim," he said pointing out the Anaheim stop on one of his newly 
collected route maps. "Anaheim is Orange County," he said tentatively. 
</P>
<P>
 But a look at a map on the wall of the bus revealed that "Anaheim" is "Anaheim 
Street." It looked like the end of the line in Long Beach was as close as he 
would get to Orange County. But no sooner had he engrossed himself in his 
paperback novel than a voice over the loudspeaker called out: "This is Willow, 
our final stop. . . . If you need to go farther south, we have a shuttle bus." 
</P>
<P>
 The train ride ended four stops short of Long Beach. Oliver lifted the strap 
of his small overnight bag over his shoulder and headed out onto the 
sun-splashed station platform, looking both ways in bewilderment.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is like taking a long walk on a short pier," he said with a chuckle and 
followed the other marooned train passengers in search of a shuttle bus. Out 
for a Jaunt to the Supermarket 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 21 bus deposited her at Wilshire and Westwood boulevards. Immaculately 
dressed in a turquoise blue suit, white pumps and white beaded cotton gloves, 
she looked as if she should have been headed east toward a Mid-Wilshire tearoom 
of another era. Indeed, she is an actress from another era. ("You'll recognize 
my name," she said without any pretension. "Frances Woodward.") 
</P>
<P>
 But on this sunny afternoon, she was waiting patiently for another bus to take 
her farther west to the Saturday afternoon clamor of the Ralphs supermarket on 
Wilshire at Bundy Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband passed away, so I do things the way I want," said Woodward, who 
picked up the bus near her Beverly Glen Boulevard and Wilshire home. "When I 
feel like it, I do it. I looked out, it was a pretty nice day."  
</P>
<P>
 So bus strike or not, she was off to the market for the few items she craved. 
"There were a few things I wanted to have -- I thought: 'That would taste real 
good today.' " She wouldn't identify them. "That's personal," she said simply, 
her pale, translucent skin shaded from the sun by a small-brimmed hat. 
</P>
<P>
 She could have gotten a ride from people who live around her. "They're always 
wanting to take me here, take me there," Woodward said, "but I want to do 
things on my own." For a Veteran Rider, 'Everything's Lovely' 
</P>
<P>
 "Step to the back of the bus," the driver said as dozens of riders squeezed 
into the westbound No. 30 on Pico Boulevard on Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's plenty of room in the back!" called out Jimmie Burkley, grinning 
maniacally from his seat by the rear door. "A dollar for a seat! One dollar!" 
</P>
<P>
 The passengers laughed, and then bellowed when Burkley began popping his 
dentures out of his mouth. The 83-year-old security guard wasn't about to let a 
bus strike spoil his commuting enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's lovely," he said, popping his teeth again to the delight of his 
neighbors. "They're running pretty regular." 
</P>
<P>
 Burkley likes riding buses. "I like sitting aside beautiful people," he said, 
as he proceeded to ask some women if they were married. When they said yes, he 
shrugged and said, "Bye!" 
</P>
<P>
 As Burkley's fellow riders trickled off the bus, he waved to them, popping his 
teeth to a couple of amused passengers as a farewell. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkley has been riding Los Angeles public transit since he came from Ft. 
Worth in 1942. He was taking No. 30 from Clifton's cafeteria, a Downtown 
restaurant where he regularly eats, to his job at 11th Place and Western 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkley thought the substitute driver was doing a pretty good job. "He drives 
good. Hey, bus driver, what's your name?" 
</P>
<P>
 No answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkley began to worry whether he could get to his church today. "Hey, you 
going to be driving tomorrow?" he hollered to the driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not me," the driver said, chuckling. 'You've Just Got to Play Along' 
</P>
<P>
 John Pickford waited an hour in the shade for No. 204 to take him from his 
Wilshire district house to his aunt Dorothy's place in South-Central. But he 
still had a long walk ahead of him, from the stop on Vermont Avenue and 48th 
Street to 48th and Gramercy Place. Pickford has a chronic health problem and 
has missed his last three dialysis treatments at a doctor's office in Compton 
because of the strike, so he was not looking forward to the trek. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to walk everywhere," he said. "It's a terrible feeling, like you're 
going to pass out." His eyes lit up when he saw an open seat in the crowded 
bus, and he slid into it right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickford, 30, plans to stay at his aunt's for the weekend, cooking enchiladas 
for her. His condition keeps him from driving, he said, so during the strike he 
has been staying at home, "doing nothing and watching TV." He has been keeping 
careful tabs on the labor dispute, and was glad to see that service would be 
offered today.  
</P>
<P>
 Pickford said he does not have any other transportation alternatives, and he 
has just got to adapt to the strike. "You've just got to play along with the 
program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that if he misses his next doctor's appointment his life could be in 
danger, so he will take a taxi. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes the strike ends soon, and knows exactly what he'll do when it does: 
"I'll jump on the bus and ride to the beach and kick back and enjoy the sun, 
cook up a few hamburgers and get me a six-pack of soda -- I can't drink beer. 
I'll get my nieces and my nephews and dump them in the bus and take them all to 
Venice Beach." A Field Trip to Downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not regular commuters," said Christina Jokanovich, 27, with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on a field trip," her 35-year-old brother, Nick, added dryly as his two 
sisters and their parents laughed above the roar of the Red Line train heading 
toward MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
 They had started off by driving to Union Station for a tour of the station. 
They hadn't even realized that the Red Line train would be in business Saturday 
because the strike had throttled transit service. "We saw this thing was 
running and said, 'Hey! Let's do it!' " said Peter Jokanovich, 58 of San Pedro. 
His wife, Delia, smiled indulgently at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We usually don't venture east of La Cienega," said Lisa Jokanovich, 33, who 
lives in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jokanovich pere had already led his family through a Saturday morning tour 
of Downtown -- through Pershing Square, the Biltmore Hotel and "once over 
lightly through the library" when they got to Union Station. The Metro was the 
perfect capper to his tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to introduce them to the Metro," said Jokanovich, who grew up 
in Echo Park. "I wanted to show them how beautiful it is, how the trains are 
immaculate. You don't see any graffiti. You don't expect this in L.A., do you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "He does this quite often," Christina said as her father, who works in 
industrial management, continued playing tour guide. "He has a regular job 
though." 'It's Really Bad. . . . I Feel Trapped' 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Alva was waiting with her granddaughter Maria Landeros outside the 
market at 5th Street and Broadway. She had been pleasantly surprised at how 
easy her commute from her home at 87th Street and Broadway had been, but 
Saturday had been an exception to the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike, she said, "is affecting us in a bad way." The 65-year-old 
religious educator has to go all over the city getting bargain-priced classroom 
materials. Her neighborhood, she said, has a dearth of bargains. But with the 
strike she has been kept from making shopping trips to discount stores in 
Huntington Park, and has dreaded the trip Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really bad," she said, shaking her head. This was the first time this 
week she had come Downtown. "There are things that we need here, things that we 
can't buy around" her home, she said as she boarded the No. 45 bus, hefting a 
full shoulder bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Alva, who has been relying on Los Angeles public transportation for 40 years, 
said the strike has marooned her. "I feel trapped, yes, because you can't go 
all the places you want to go."

TRAFFIC SLOWS DOWN WHEN ADVISORY SIGN LIGHTS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As if motorists needed another obstacle to delay their commute, an electronic 
traffic advisory sign that had previously offered a blank stare to southbound 
drivers on Interstate 5 suddenly came to life one afternoon between El Toro 
Road and Alicia Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Gawking motorists, unaccustomed to seeing anything but a dark screen, slowed 
down to read the four-word message, causing a lengthy backup on all lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a test," said the advisory that burned brightly on the matrix screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Having read the announcement, drivers continued on their way, some reaching 
speeds of up to 70 m.p.h. by the time they reached the La Paz Road exit. Until 
then, southbound traffic barely moved between the killer El Toro "Y" and Alicia 
Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The signs are activated when something happens that impacts the freeway, or 
when they're being tested," said Joe Hecker, the Caltrans district chief for 
traffic operations in Orange County. "Otherwise, we don't normally activate the 
signs because it creates congestion when people slow down to read them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have been familiar sights on Los Angeles-area freeways since the 
early 1970s, electronic advisory signs are recent additions to Orange County 
highways. Today, there are 21 traffic signs strategically placed on all major 
freeways in the county, with another 12 scheduled to be operating by January, 
Hecker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local California Department of Transportation officials say the growing need 
for the signs is further proof that freeway congestion is a major problem in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe El-Harake, a traffic operations analyst for Caltrans, said the average 
number of cars using Orange County freeways a day increased 250% between 1966 
and 1986. The national average for the same period was 74%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of motorists using roadways in South County increased 750% during 
the same time, he added, while on the Riverside Freeway daily traffic doubled 
between 1981 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Caltrans statistics, traffic engineers in 1966 counted about 
58,000 vehicles per month at what was then the beginning of the Santa Ana 
Freeway and the junction of the yet-to-be-built San Diego Freeway. By 1992, 
that figure had jumped to 313,000 vehicles per month at the intersection of the 
two freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials use sophisticated technology, which they call 
"Transportation Systems Elements." They include electronic sensors, ramp meters 
and closed-circuit television to keep jammed freeways moving. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensors monitor the speed and number of cars on the freeway, and the 
cameras help officials at Caltrans headquarters in Santa Ana zoom in on a 
freeway problem to determine the best solution for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The electronic signs are one of the most important elements in our system," 
El-Harake said. "The signs are especially efficient when we decide how to 
respond to an incident. We put the message on the screen and the public can 
make intelligent decisions on how to react, as to alternate routes or simply 
getting off the freeway and getting back on up the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Hecker said that Caltrans policy is to activate the signs only when 
"something, an accident or vehicle breakdown, activates a freeway lane closure 
or when we have to shut down a freeway. Time is the key element. We try to 
activate the signs as soon as possible after a major freeway incident." 
</P>
<P>
 Hecker said, however, that the signs are not always activated when there is 
massive congestion because the Caltrans office has not yet received information 
about a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials say each freeway advisory sign costs about $140,000 and 
creates an unavoidable problem when first tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sign on I-5 is a perfect example of this. We take a risk every time we 
test a new sign," Hecker said. "In order for Caltrans to buy the sign, we have 
to make sure that it works. The only way to make sure it's working properly is 
to test it. Even when we show that it's only a test, people slow down to look."

GANGING UP ON GRAFFITI; COMMUNITY: PARK CLEAN-UP EFFORT IN LA HABRA IS AIMED AT 
RETURNING THE SITE TO THE CHILDREN FOR PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raul Ramirez and dozens of other children on Saturday claimed Loma Verde Park 
as their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ours now -- the kids'," declared Raul, 7, who joined about 70 other 
volunteers who spent the day raking leaves and painting over graffiti on Loma 
Verde's basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 The children were at the park courtesy of El Campo, one of the city's largest 
street gangs. Its members finally decided it was time to clean up the place and 
return their territory to the neighborhood so kids could safely play there. 
</P>
<P>
 One of El Campo's leaders, Bernardo Gamez, 24, led the effort, which began 
more than two months ago when gang members painted a block wall alongside the 
park, covering up their own graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday evening, Gamez and a community activist, Reynaldo Moreno, scrubbed the 
basketball court with soap and water, preparing it for Saturday's work. But 
later that night, Gamez was arrested for allegedly violating his parole from an 
assault conviction, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Gamez was unexpectedly jailed, Moreno said, no other gang members, 
except one, showed up Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect Gamez of buying a firearm, said Rosalva Gamez, his sister. Her 
eyes filled with tears as she watched the volunteers clean Loma Verde Park the 
way her brother envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother was just beginning to turn his life around," she said. "He really 
wanted this park to be safe for the children to play in. But even though he got 
arrested, I hope other gang members realize that they can get more out of 
helping the community than hurting themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Police praised the effort to clean up the park and they were glad to see that 
a gang had taken the initiative to do something for the city. Said Sgt. Kevin 
Raisch: "It's great to see any kid involved in a gang do something to better 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno has worked with gangs for nine years, helping them clean up their 
neighborhoods and encouraging them to get jobs or stay in school. He said 
Saturday that Loma Verde has always been dominated by gang members. This makes 
it difficult for the public to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have always been scared to come here because of all the graffiti," 
Moreno said. "It looked like trash. . . . Gangs cleaning up their own mess is a 
step toward living in harmony and peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Naranjo, 16, the lone self-proclaimed gang member who showed up 
Saturday, said he did so because the graffiti he has plastered all over the 
park did not look good. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks real bad actually," Naranjo said, a paint roller in his hand. "Now 
that it's getting covered up, we're going to try not to mark this park any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and youths also praised El Campo for wanting to help the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good idea to give the park to the kids," said Maria Concho, who lives 
behind the park but never lets her children play there because of its 
reputation. Her 12-year-old daughter, Norma, added: "It's good to know the 
gangbangers want to clean this place because they're the ones who messed it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, his wife, Ida, and community activist Rose Espinoza helped El Campo 
organize the event. They provided hot dogs and chips for lunch after the 
volunteers spent about four hours completing their chores. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what it's all about," Moreno said. "This park is meant for kids to 
have a good time. Maybe what happened today is a sign that . . . the kids are 
taking over."

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
WASHINGTON POLICE FAIL TO TAG CONGRESSMAN IN LICENSE RENEWAL MIX-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A mystery: Yes, it's true. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), 
otherwise known as Mr. Law and Order, has expired license-plate tags on his 
Ford, acknowledged one of his aides. But it's not his fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sent in a check for the renewal in November, they cashed the check and 
never sent the tags," the aide explained. Either the Department of Motor 
Vehicles dropped the ball or the post office (Washington was recently found to 
have the nation's worst mail service) never delivered them, the aide said. It's 
a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a bigger mystery: How come the congressman has been driving around the 
federal city all these months and nobody wrote him up? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paddle mania: Hoping to whip up even more public fervor for his proposal to 
paddle juvenile graffiti vandals, Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) is 
handing out 5,000 bumper stickers paid for with campaign cash. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans too: A group of prominent Orange County Republicans joined several 
county Democrats in Washington last week for briefings from members of the 
Clinton Administration and a special tour of the White House. County Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder; developer Kathryn Thompson and her husband, Gus Owen; 
political consultant Bob Nelson; and Anita Mangels, an abortion-rights 
activist, all made the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangels, a Laguna Beach resident and former state chairwoman of Republicans 
for Clinton, said she got a chance to voice her primary concern that "the full 
range of reproductive health services are part of the health care package." 
</P>
<P>
 Mangels said she is unhappy with the partisan politicking now dominating the 
Republican Party. "One of my personal frustrations with my own party is that we 
seem to be dedicated to being the loyal opposition rather than getting anything 
accomplished," Mangels said. "If they are unhappy with President Clinton in 
1996 there will be plenty of time to make their grievances known. But right now 
we have a country that needs all the support of all its representatives to do 
some constructive things."

 Deficit score card: Orange County congressmen Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove) and Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) call themselves fiscal conservatives, but 
their recent voting record shows they "lacked the conviction" to reduce the 
federal deficit, according to a national nonpartisan group called the Concord 
Coalition, which is trying to educate Americans about the impacts of chronic 
deficits on the nation's future. On the other hand, the deficit spending 
records of Congressmen Ed Royce (R-Fullerton), Dana Rohrabacher and Jay C. Kim 
(R-Diamond Bar) are "absolutely fabulous," said Phil Yarbrough, a local 
spokesman for the Concord Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very, very pleased with Royce, Rohrabacher and Kim," said Yarbrough, 
an economics professor at Rancho Santiago College. "But I would hope Dornan and 
Packard would realize the importance of what deficit spending means to the 
future of this country. We cannot keep passing on debt to the next generation 
of Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Both California senators were at the bottom of the group's list, with scores 
described by Yarbrough as "embarrassing" and "discouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Backing Pete: Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi last week joined 33 
of the state's 58 county prosecutors in endorsing Pete Wilson for a second term 
as governor. At a news conference in Newport Beach, the prosecutors threw their 
support behind Wilson, citing his record for getting tough on criminals with 
his support of mandatory life sentences for "three strikes" offenders -- those 
who are convicted of three felony crimes -- and extending the death penalty to 
fatal drive-by shootings and carjack slayings. "Wilson has been a supporter of 
law enforcement issues (throughout) his political career. He's not a 
Johnny-come-lately to this issue because it's an election year," Capizzi said.

 Over and out?: A meeting of the South Orange County Leadership Conference 
scheduled for Aug. 10 in San Juan Capistrano could be its last, unless someone 
wants to pick up the ball and run with it. San Juan Capistrano Councilman Gary 
L. Hausdorfer, the founder and chairman of the 5-year-old organization, is 
leaving the City Council in November. Since leadership conference officers must 
be elected officials, that means he's out of there too, leaving the future of 
the group in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 The real question is, does South County really need this organization anymore, 
which at one time brought together 21 different public agencies and a large 
number of private individuals? Hausdorfer says maybe not, now that almost the 
entire area has been incorporated into cities. "This was started to encourage a 
regional dialogue, and there is a dialogue now," Hausdorfer said. "It probably 
makes sense to dissolve it. Right now, the cities are doing a real good job of 
communicating."

 Three candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election to represent the 46th 
Congressional District. They are Democrat Mike Farber of Santa Ana, Libertarian 
Richard G. Newhouse of Garden Grove and the incumbent, Republican Robert K. 
Dornan of Garden Grove. Here's where they stand on four issues. Health Care 
</P>
<P>
 Farber: "Health care reform affects all Americans. I support efforts toward 
providing all Americans with secure health insurance. However, we must ensure 
that hard-working, middle-class families and small businesses don't bear the 
brunt of the cost. Employers and employees must share the financial burden. 
Legislative reform is also necessary to reduce medical malpractice insurance 
premiums and bring in line the cost of visiting a family doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhouse: "The Clinton socialized health care plan would reduce choice by 
consumers while raising costs by reducing competition. If the consumers 
transfer responsibility for their medical care to the government, they will 
learn that they have traded off their power to choose their doctor, hospital, 
and to control their costs to faceless bureaucrats, maybe recent immigrants 
from the now (collapsed) U.S.S.R." Says he supports the Libertarian Party 
health care plan, which includes tax-exempt medical savings accounts, making 
health care expenditures 100% tax deductible, and privatizing the Medicare and 
Medicaid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan: Co-authored a bill that "relies on the free market, not the government 
as proposed by the President" to provide health coverage and control medical 
costs. Provisions include tax credits for the unemployed and working poor "to 
give all Americans a basic level of health relief," reducing health care costs 
by controlling medical malpractice premiums, and "medical savings accounts" 
similar to retirement accounts that would give tax breaks to those who 
contribute to a fund to be used for medical bills or health insurance. 
Education and Health Care Benefits for Illegal Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
 Farber: "Illegal immigration must be stemmed. A refusal to educate or provide 
health care is a 'Band-Aid solution' that will not help the problems associated 
with illegals. SOS (Save Our State initiative) will only result in putting 'big 
brother' in our schools and hospitals. A drastic increase in taxes would be 
needed to deal with the higher crime rate, costs to hospitals and for 
establishing another government bureaucracy. We need to fight for the federal 
funding that Orange County was promised but has not received because of the 
Orange County congressional delegation's ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhouse: "These 'benefits' paid by working Americans create a 'magnet' effect 
that pulls on the 5 billion people in the Second and Third worlds. This pull 
effect, when combined with the . . . sick economies in most of the world . . . 
means a flood tide of immigration. The forcible taxation of working Americans 
so that the non-working can get government benefits will end soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan: "I favor curtailing educational and some health benefits for illegal 
immigrants. I would never deny emergency medical aid to anyone. It is important 
to remember that illegal aliens--no matter where they are from--are breaking 
the law. Furthermore, before we deny illegal immigrants these benefits, we must 
first prove they are in fact in the U.S. illegally. Thus, I would hope that 
enactment of such a proposal would lead to more vigorous enforcement of our 
immigration laws." Crime 
</P>
<P>
 Farber: "The spiraling crime rate is threatening the very fabric of our 
society. Violence in our schools and neighborhoods cannot be tolerated. 
Gangsters who put our children at risk by bringing guns to school should be 
expelled for no less than one year. I strongly support 'three strikes and 
you're out' for all violent criminals and efforts to address the problems in 
the current sentencing guidelines. Boot camps and other alternatives to regular 
incarceration should be implemented more often." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhouse: "Crime is increasing because the economy is being strangled by the 
welfare state with its bureaucratic, tax-eating, regulation-producing, 
progress-derailing hordes of the publicly employed. 'Demopublicans' pander to 
our anxieties about crime. They want the working person to support even more 
prisoners at about $25,000 per prisoner per year. . . . Such costs will drive 
more private sector jobs out of the country, causing more unemployment, more 
crime, more prisons, in a circle ending in chaos. Prisons must be made 
self-supporting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan: "Although the federal government can do little to affect crime at the 
street level, it can set the national tone. Unfortunately, the Democratic crime 
package sets the wrong tone. A good crime bill must provide swift and sure 
punishment. I want to put a stop to the endless appeals that have made a 
mockery of the death penalty, as well as reform the rules that allow criminals 
to go free on technicalities. I want to build more prisons to get repeat 
offenders, who account for the vast majority of violent crimes, off the 
streets. And I want to see more cops on the beat, which is why I have been the 
lead sponsor of the Police Corps bill. The Police Corps . . . would establish 
an ROTC-type program for young people who want a career in law enforcement. El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
</P>
<P>
 Farber: "Conversion of the El Toro Air Station offers the community a number 
of unique opportunities. None should be dismissed without careful examination, 
particularly the number of jobs that would be created. From most estimates, 
converting the base into an international airport would be the most 
cost-effective use of the land. However, the people from the surrounding 
community must be the ones to make the final decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhouse: "John Wayne Airport is poorly located, too small, and has no room 
for expansion. . . . If El Toro is converted to a full-scale commercial 
airport, it will provide many high-paying jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan: "I have not taken a position on this issue because I believe that it 
is for local, not federal, officials to decide. I will support whatever reuse 
plan the people of Orange County approve."

MAN HELD IN ALLEGED RAPE IN LA HABRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of rape Saturday morning, less than 2 
1/2 hours after he allegedly attacked a sleeping woman in her apartment, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emanual Ascencio of La Habra was arrested by police officers, who saw he was 
driving a Chevrolet pickup that matched the description of a vehicle given by 
the victim's neighbors, Sgt. Kevin Raisch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ascencio was stopped near Walnut Avenue and Whittier Boulevard, about a 
quarter mile from the home of the victim, who later identified Ascencio as her 
attacker, Raisch said. The woman did not know Ascencio, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was held in lieu of $50,000 bail, Raisch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault occurred at 8:30 a.m. after an intruder climbed through a 
screened, open kitchen window at the woman's home, police said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A car pursued by Brea police collided with a van Saturday night at a busy 
intersection where Fullerton and La Habra meet, injuring at least five people, 
Fullerton police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit began at about 9:15 p.m. when Brea officers followed a car 
westbound on Imperial Highway that was driven by a man suspected of involvement 
in grand theft, police said.At the intersection of Imperial Highway and Harbor 
Boulevard, the car hit a van traveling northbound on Harbor.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Auxiliary Citizens Team is looking for at least 10 more volunteers 
to help out the Orange County Sheriff's Department with vacation home checks, 
parking enforcement and traffic control. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, about 20 seniors on the team each have volunteered about 
seven hours per week to aid the sheriff's deputies assigned to Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is hoping to begin another training session for new volunteers ages 
50 to 80 next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The original deadline for applications was July 15. But after a poor response, 
the Sheriff's Department extended the deadline to Aug. 15, PACT member Hal 
Bayer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the satisfaction of knowing you're doing something for the 
community," Bayer said. "There's something for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers aid with clerical work, checking on the homes of vacationing 
residents, enforcement of non-moving violations, traffic control around schools 
and coordinating neighborhood watch programs. 
</P>
<P>
 No law enforcement experience is necessary. Information: (714) 362-4343. LYNN

LOS ALAMITOS WILL KEEP LAW ON HORSEBACK RIDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have decided to keep in the books an ordinance prohibiting 
horseback riding on city streets, though there's a very slim chance of someone 
actually doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 The last known horse stable in the city closed more than 20 years ago, and 
there are no horses here anymore, except at the Los Alamitos Race Track, which 
is in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Although City Atty. Thomas W. Allen said he does not expect to catch a 
horseback rider anytime soon, he said the ordinance is necessary 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the City Council agreed with him and decided to modify the 
horseback riding ordinance while discarding other statutes considered dated. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those repealed were ordinances on food handling, fireworks, traffic, 
zoning, water wells, streets and sidewalks and appearing drunk in public. These 
laws either have been repealed or modified by state law or by county 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the horseback riding ordinance, infractions are punishable by a fine. In 
the old ordinance, anyone caught riding a horse on city streets could be fined 
$500, sent to jail for six months, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has hired a consultant to review current ordinances in an effort to 
create a "clean slate" in preparation for the publication of a new municipal 
code, City Manager Robert C. Dunek said.

HACKER IN HIDING; DIGITAL DESPERADO WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE WORKED FOR THE FBI IS 
NOW BEING SOUGHT BY THE AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First there was the Condor, then Dark Dante. The latest computer hacker to hit 
the cyberspace most wanted list is Agent Steal, a slender, good-looking rogue 
partial to Porsches and BMWs who bragged that he worked undercover for the FBI 
catching other hackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Agent Steal, whose real name is Justin Tanner Petersen, is on the run from 
the very agency he told friends was paying his rent and flying him to computer 
conferences to spy on other hackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen, 34, disappeared Oct. 18 after admitting to federal prosecutors that 
he had been committing further crimes during the time when he was apparently 
working with the government "in the investigation of other persons," according 
to federal court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, by running he has consigned himself to the same secretive life as 
Kevin Mitnick, the former North Hills man who is one of the nation's most 
infamous hackers, and whom Petersen allegedly bragged of helping to set up for 
an FBI bust. Mitnick, who once took the name Condor in homage to a favorite 
movie character, has been hiding for almost two years to avoid prosecution for 
allegedly hacking into computers illegally and posing as a law enforcement 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Petersen's list of hacks includes breaking into computers used 
by federal investigative agencies and tapping into a credit card information 
bureau. Petersen, who once promoted after-hours rock shows in the San Fernando 
Valley, also was involved in the hacker underground's most sensational scam -- 
hijacking radio station phone lines to win contests with prizes ranging from 
new cars to trips to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 The mastermind of that scheme was Dark Dante, whose real name is Kevin 
Poulsen. He is awaiting sentencing in connection with that case, having already 
spent three years in custody, the longest term in jail for any hacker in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen's case reveals the close-knit and ruggedly competitive world of 
computer hacking, where friends struggle to outdo each other and then, when 
they are caught, sometimes turn on each other. Petersen boasted of his alleged 
exploits trapping his former colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen gave an interview last year to an on-line publication called Phrack 
in which he claimed to have tapped the phone of a prostitute working for Heidi 
Fleiss. He also boasted openly of working with the FBI to bust Mitnick. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went to work for the bureau I contacted him," Petersen said in the 
interview conducted by Mike Bowen. "He was still up to his old tricks, so we 
opened a case on him. . . . What a loser. Everyone thinks he is some great 
hacker. I outsmarted him and busted him." 
</P>
<P>
 How much of Petersen's story is true and how much is chest-thumping is at 
issue, for he is a shadowy person who didn't even use his own name during the 
years he spent on the fringes of the Los Angeles rock scene. Tall, 
good-looking, with long hair down the middle of his back, Eric Heinz, as he was 
known by everyone, shattered the computer nerd pocket protector stereotype. He 
frequented the Rainbow Bar and Grill on Sunset Boulevard, often with different 
women on his arm, and handed out cards identifying himself as a concert 
promoter and electronic surveillance specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Riki Rachtman, an MTV "veejay," said Petersen had a reputation for technical 
wizardry among the club crowd. "Everybody knew, if you screwed (him) over, he 
had the power to screw everything" with you, Rachtman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But was he really working as a government informant at the same time to 
ensnare his hacker buddies for the bureau? The FBI refused to talk about 
Petersen directly. But J. Michael Gibbons, a bureau computer crime expert, 
expressed doubts. He advises against such relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not safe. Across the board, hackers cannot be trusted to work -- they 
play both sides against the middle," he said. The agents "could have had him in 
the office. They probably debriefed him at length. Send him out to do things? I 
doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Monica attorney Richard Sherman, who is representing a friend of 
Mitnick's in another hacker case, has accused the FBI of not only actively 
using Petersen as an informant, but also of turning a blind eye to Petersen's 
alleged crimes during the time he was in their care. The crimes involve alleged 
credit card fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a May 19 letter tS. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, Sherman said three agents in Los 
Angeles engaged "in a course of conduct which is illegal and contrary to bureau 
policy" in handling Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Ann Farrington, deputy chief of the public integrity section, responded on 
July 18 that there were no grounds to begin a criminal investigation. Because 
Sherman had called "into question the ethical conduct of the named special 
agents," the letter was referred to the Office of Professional Responsibility 
for review. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is factually incorrect that we allowed Mr. Petersen to commit crimes," 
said Assistant U. S. Atty. David Schindler. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew Petersen best described him as a bright, verging-on-arrogant 
man who dressed well and sometimes walked with a cane, a result of a motorcycle 
accident six years ago that cost him a foot. He sometimes promoted after-hours 
clubs in the Valley and in Hollywood, according to a partner, Phillip Lamond. 
</P>
<P>
 One night the two men were talking about Petersen's adventures. "The 
difference between you and me," Lamond said Petersen told him, "is I get a 
thrill from breaking the law." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Phrack interview, published on the Internet, an international network 
of computer networks with millions of users, Agent Steal bragged about breaking 
into Pacific Bell headquarters with Poulsen to obtain information about the 
phone company's investigation of his hacking. 
</P>
<P>
 He said they found "a lot of information regarding other investigations and 
how they do wiretaps." 
</P>
<P>
 "Very dangerous in the wrong hands," replied Bowen, according to a transcript 
of the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the wrong hands," Petersen said. Bowen said Petersen still calls him 
from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen was arrested in Texas in 1991, where he lived briefly. Court records 
show that authorities searching his apartment found computer equipment, Pacific 
Bell manuals and five modems. 
</P>
<P>
 An FBI affidavit reveals fear that Petersen could have been eavesdropping on 
law enforcement investigations. The affidavit says Petersen admitted 
"conducting illegal telephone taps" and breaking into Pacific Bell's COSMOS 
computer program, which allows the user to check telephone numbers and 
determine the location of telephone lines and circuits. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury in Texas returned an eight-count indictment against Petersen, 
accusing him of assuming false names, accessing a computer without 
authorization, possessing stolen mail and fraudulently obtaining and using 
credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was later transferred to California and sealed, out of concern for 
Petersen's safety, authorities said. The motion to seal, obtained by Sherman, 
states that Petersen, "acting in an undercover capacity, currently is 
cooperating with the United States in the investigation of other persons in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen eventually pleaded guilty to six counts, including rigging a radio 
station contest with a $20,000 prize. He faced a sentence of up to 40 years in 
jail and a $1.5-million fine, but the sentencing was delayed several times 
while, Sherman believes, Petersen continued working for the government. Lamond 
said Petersen told him the FBI was paying him $600 a month "to help them track 
down hackers." 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Oct. 18, 1993, 15 months after entering his first guilty plea, 
Petersen was confronted outside federal court by Schindler, who asked if he had 
been committing any crimes while on bail. Petersen said he had, according to 
Schindler. Petersen met briefly with his attorney, then took off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a big problem and I'm splitting," a friend said he told him the same 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach Petersen were unsuccessful and his attorney, Morton Boren, 
said he has "no knowledge of Justin committing any crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman also scores the government for allegedly allowing Petersen, while an 
informant, to utilize a Pacific Bell Telephone Co. computer called Switched 
Access Services, or SAS. Sherman said the computer allows operators to 
intercept telephone calls and place other calls, making it appear the calls 
originated from other phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Motta, executive director of applications, reliability and support for 
Pacific Bell, said he would not "take a position one way or the other" on 
Sherman's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 While declining to discuss Petersen's actions, Schindler acknowledged that in 
the Poulsen case, "we alleged and he pled guilty to the fact of using the SAS 
system. Among other things, they rigged radio station contests using SAS. It is 
a test technology they managed to hijack and use for criminal purposes. Once we 
became aware of it we took steps to correct it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are tantalizing hints at links between Mitnick and Petersen, despite 
their obvious differences in style. Mitnick was the classic computer jockey, 
overweight and shy, who asked his eventual wife out on their first date by 
sending her a computer message. Petersen, on the other hand, is flamboyant and 
self-assured. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Motor Vehicles has a file on Petersen, but 
refused to divulge any information about him, saying the file was being used in 
another case. "The indications are that it's Mitnick," said Bill Madison, a 
spokesman for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say they think Petersen can survive well on the run. "He's already got 
a lot of experience" living undercover, said one friend. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mitnick may be having a tougher time. Lewis De Payne thinks his friend 
would like to find a way out of his predicament. "It is my opinion he would 
like to surrender to some type of news media that could provide legal counsel," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Phrack interview, Petersen makes no apologies for his choices in life. 
</P>
<P>
 While discussing Petersen's role as an informant, Mike Bowen says, "I think 
that most hackers would have done the same as you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most hackers would have sold out their mother," Petersen responded.

FRUSTRATION LEADS QUAKE VICTIMS TO JOIN FORCES; COALITION: THOUSANDS OF ANGRY 
VALLEY HOMEOWNERS FORM A NEW GROUP TO FACE OFF AGAINST INSURERS AND ELECTED 
OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They're mad as hell -- and not taking it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months after the earthquake, their homes and lives still a shambles, 
thousands of San Fernando Valley homeowners are turning their frustration into 
political action, hoping to give insurers and elected officials a good jolt of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Banded together in a grass-roots coalition that is part activist and part 
educational group called Community Assisting Recovery (CARe), these quake 
victims are fighting back against those they feel have abandoned them. 
</P>
<P>
 "God bless CARe for what they're doing," said Gabriela Segal after the group's 
executive director, George Kehrer, inspected the quake damage to her Northridge 
home last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kehrer, who is both a lawyer and a licensed general contractor, also went over 
her insurance policy with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nobody else to tell me what to do," Segal said. "Nobody else to help. 
I called the insurance commissioner's help line last week and said, 'I need 
somebody to help me read my policy and tell me what my rights are.' He said, 
'We don't do that.' All they do is send out forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand they're (help line workers) overwhelmed," she added. "But there 
should be somewhere we can go for advice."  
</P>
<P>
 Young and old, first-time home buyers and retirees with paid-off mortgages, 
many CARe volunteers don't fit the usual activist mold. 
</P>
<P>
 But circumstances have made them reluctant warriors. They want their homes and 
lives back the way they were before that awful January morning. 
</P>
<P>
 All of them say they are exhausted, stressed out, fed up with living in motels 
with small children, and tired of dealing with insurance adjusters, contractors 
and others whom they don't know if they can trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard 'Trust me' and then been sorry I did so many times in the past few 
months I can't stand it," said a Northridge woman. "At this point, the only 
people I trust are my husband and two children." 
</P>
<P>
 And so they are willing to learn the business of organizing protests, 
gathering signatures on petitions and writing complaint letters to their 
representatives in Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also learning to draft press releases and make colorful protest signs 
that look good on television. 
</P>
<P>
 And at large public meetings, with fire in their eyes, these property owners 
have excoriated State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi for caving in -- as 
they see it -- to powerful industry interests, in part to further his own 
political career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of those people who believed my insurance agent when he told me I was 
covered," said an Encino grandmother. "Now it looks like $50,000 is going to 
have to come out of my pocket and I don't have it."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi "isn't doing anything and I can't afford to hire an attorney," the 
silver-haired woman said, shaking her head. "Who does somebody like me turn to? 
Thank God for this group." 
</P>
<P>
 Elena Stern, a spokeswoman for the insurance commissioner, said, "John 
Garamendi caving in or siding with insurance companies to further his career is 
absolutely ludicrous. For the last 3 1/2 years, John Garamendi has been the 
insurance industry's worst nightmare. The insurance department represents 
consumers' interests, not insurance industry interests, under this 
commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the Encino grandmother and other angry homeowners interviewed for this 
story who are still waiting for insurance checks did not want to give their 
names. Their fear? That the insurers would somehow retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the level of fear and distrust that's out there," said Kehrer. "It's 
terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, CARe volunteers have blown the whistle on questionable insurance 
practices and vowed to boycott some companies, mostly those that now claim they 
can no longer afford to offer quake and homeowners coverage. These quake 
victims say insurance companies are pressuring them to hurry up and settle 
their claims, perhaps for less than they might be entitled to. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'It's been six months and you have to act in good faith too,' " 
said a woman who lives in Chatsworth. "You aren't acting in a fair and 
reasonable manner. But I'm not ready and they aren't going to push me around."  
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of disgruntled policyholders have turned out for each of the more 
than 30 major meetings CARe has conducted in the hard-hit San Fernando Valley 
since April. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them have also organized into smaller groups made up of people who all 
have the same insurer. They meet every two weeks to share problems and air 
grievances against 20th Century, Allstate, Farmers, Republic, State Farm, 
United Services Automobile Assn. and Western Republic insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Woodland Hills-based 20th Century Insurance Co. said last 
week that they are sorry the company's policyholders are unhappy. Like several 
other companies, 20th Century has also said it has settled most quake-related 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Northridge, CARe set up its headquarters in April in an office suite 
donated by the Porter Ranch Center, a mini-mall at Tampa Avenue and Rinaldi 
Street that was also damaged by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the consumer group says it has attracted 2,000 volunteers and 
claims to represent at least another 2,000 victims of the January disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that for every name on our mailing list, there's at least one person 
and probably more who has come to one of our meetings or workshops," said 
Kehrer. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I know we're making a difference by the number of thank-you calls we're 
starting to get," Kehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People call us and say, 'Thank you, my insurance company just conceded it 
will cost $50,000 more to fix my house than they thought,' " he said. "Or, 
'Thank you, now they are going to cover asbestos removal. Thank you, the damage 
to my pool or fence or deck is covered.' It's very satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 On average, the phone rings 25 or 30 times a day, said CARe office manager 
Marcy Contreras, the organization's only paid staffer. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent week she and several volunteers answered more than 100 calls after 
state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) held a well-publicized meeting on 
quake-related insurance problems. Many called to sign up for the free workshops 
Kehrer and other CARe volunteers conduct. Subjects have included how to fill 
out a so-called "scope of loss" form for an insurer itemizing quake damage, how 
deductibles work, what personal-property coverage includes, and dealing with a 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, which is applying for nonprofit status, depends entirely on 
donations. So far, it has received about $7,000 in cash, Kehrer said. Others 
have donated supplies or services. 
</P>
<P>
 The group received its first corporate donation last week from Hughes Aircraft 
Corp. "They asked us to make a list of things we needed," said Marcy, who told 
the company the organization needs tables, chairs, copiers and fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
 One volunteer also offered to donate printing services, until now one of the 
organization's biggest expenses. Kehrer, who has become an advocate for 
disaster victims since he lost his home in the 1991 Oakland Hills fire, 
understands what quake victims are going through. And since moving to 
Northridge -- specifically to help quake victims -- he has seen much of the 
devastation first-hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakland Hills house he was sharing with a friend burned to the ground in 
10 minutes. The pair is still battling with Allstate, their insurance carrier, 
two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on in that battle, Kehrer heard about an Oakland-based consumer group, 
United Policyholders, and decided to attend a meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 "It changed my life," he said. "Suddenly, I discovered all these people who 
were dealing with the same problems, the same difficult recovery process I 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both a general contractor and a lawyer, Kehrer discovered it was the perfect 
combination of skills to make him an effective advocate for disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Oakland fire, he has worked as an unpaid volunteer with victims of 
Hurricane Andrew, last fall's brush fires in Laguna Beach and Malibu -- and, 
now, the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Kehrer and his Scottie dog, Spider, whom he saved from the fire, are staying 
with John and Kathy Trapani. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge couple helped persuade Kehrer to move to the Valley from 
Oakland so he would be more accessible to quake victims. They also helped talk 
him into running CARe for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "George is just great," said Kathy Trapani, currently the group's president. 
"We are very, very lucky to have him."

GUIDELINES MAY HELP IN-HOME OUTLAWS; ZONING: CITY TO CONSIDER PLAN TO LET MORE 
PEOPLE LEGALLY RUN BUSINESSES FROM THEIR HOUSES. BUT SOME SAY IT'S TOO 
RESTRICTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The days may be numbered when the ranks of Los Angeles' outlaws include 
accountants, writers, tailors and attorneys who work out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Culminating nearly 10 years of study and debate, city planners have drafted 
guidelines to allow businesses to operate out of single-family homes and are 
scheduled to present them to the Los Angeles Planning Commission for a public 
hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current city zoning laws, the only people allowed to set up shop in 
residential areas are doctors, dentists and ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 For advocates of home-based businesses, the new guidelines indicate that the 
city has come to accept the growing work-at-home trend that has been fueled by 
technological advances such as home computers, an increase in dual-income 
households and a movement toward downsizing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 For city planners, the new guidelines could mean more revenues for the 
cash-strapped city because it could begin to collect business license fees from 
thousands of illegal businesses that would become legitimate under the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But a cloud of controversy looms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some home-occupation supporters already have criticized the guidelines, saying 
they are too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are terrible," said Judy Corbet, a vocal home-based business advocate 
who convinced zoning officials to give her a temporary exemption to operate a 
costume shop out of her North Hollywood home. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she said, the proposal lists only 27 occupations that would be 
permitted in single-family neighborhoods. It does not include such occupations 
as catering, tutoring, providing music lessons and real estate services. Those 
would remain illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbet's occupation -- costume-making -- also is not on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's idiotic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Edwards, who has written five books and hosts a local radio program about 
home-based businesses, called the proposed ordinance "a step in the right 
direction." But he agreed with Corbet's criticism, saying the criteria for 
legalizing a home-based business should be whether it is a nuisance to 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he criticized a rule that only 25% of a home's floor space can be 
used for work. "Who wants to worry about finding a measuring tape when there is 
no impact on neighbors?" Edwards asked. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cora Smith, the city planner who supervised the drafting of the 
guidelines, defended the proposal and said it can be fine-tuned as it moves 
through the city's approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners have struggled for years, she said, to devise guidelines that will 
legalize many traditional home-based occupations while protecting residential 
neighborhoods from loud, disruptive businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very difficult one to come up with," Smith said. "We want to 
protect the single-family neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the list of permitted occupations, she said it can easily be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick, who made a motion to have city planners draft the 
guidelines, supports the proposal but thinks that it may need to be tougher in 
some areas and more flexible in others, said Ken Bernstein, Chick's planning 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no estimates on how many home-based businesses operate illegally in 
the city of Los Angeles. But approximately 2,500 residents each year are turned 
down by the city's Building and Safety Department for permits to operate 
businesses from home, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Link Resources, a marketing research firm that conducts an annual 
work-at-home survey, estimated that approximately 4 million full-time and 
part-time home businesses operate in California. Nationwide, 24.3-million 
Americans operate home-based businesses, either on a part-time or full-time 
basis, according to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many cities in Southern California have adopted regulations to permit 
home-based businesses in residential areas -- including Santa Monica, Torrance 
and Redondo Beach -- an effort to draft similar regulations in Los Angeles has 
floundered since the idea was first broached in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Public hearings on the issue have bogged down in debate over what types of 
businesses to allow, what restrictions to impose and how to prevent home-based 
businesses from turning quiet residential neighborhoods into noisy commercial 
zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed guidelines try to address those concerns by suggesting more than 
a dozen conditions, including a ban on outdoor signs and outdoor storage of 
equipment or supplies, and limits on noise, dust, fumes and vibrations. In 
short, the guidelines say businesses cannot change the character of the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 If the law is adopted, city officials will rely on neighbors to police each 
other and make sure home-based businesses do not violate zoning guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 And if a business is proposed that does not fit into the list of acceptable 
occupations, Smith said the city can schedule a variance hearing, thus deciding 
such proposals on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, home-based businesses are not allowed in apartments 
because apartments may not be able to meet city safety codes or provide access 
for the disabled, among other potential problems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners, Smith said, decided to "get it into the single-family 
neighborhood first and see how it works." In-Home Jobs 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Planning Department has proposed that the following home-based 
occupations be allowed, although the city Planning Commission may alter the 
list at a hearing this week.

POLICE CALLED OVER BB GUN SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police said an unidentified man was seen shooting a gun that was later 
determined to be a BB gun from the roof of a storage warehouse across the 
street from the Winnetka Drive-In on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Several police cars and a police helicopter responded to the "sniper call" at 
about 5 p.m. on Winnetka and Praire avenues.Police closed off both streets for 
about half an hour, said Sgt. Mike Sonntag of the LAPD's Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 A person on a car phone called police to report seeing a man with brown hair 
shooting a gun from the warehouse roof, Sonntag said. Police searched the area 
and found a BB gun cartridge. He added that no arrests were made and no one was 
injured.

RUNNERS SAY CANINES HELD THEM BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only one of the 12 runners in Saturday's Canine/Human World Cross County 
Championship was honest enough to admit that she slowed down her dog and not 
vice versa in the 2.1-mile race at Woodley Avenue Park. And she came in dead 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 "He normally runs with my husband," panted Diana Baucum, 34, of Agua Dulce as 
she looked at her nonplussed collie, Moku. "He kept looking back at me like, 
'What is the problem?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the runners swore that their times would have been better if only 
the dogs could have kept up. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the participants said they regularly run with their animals. 
Saturday's winner, Peter Mogg, 39, of Moorpark, is a competitive runner in 
training for U.S.A. Track and Field Masters in Oregon.  
</P>
<P>
 Mogg's 6-year-old golden retriever, Rembrandt, twice a week runs five miles 
with his master and so had no problem taking the fire hydrant trophy awarded to 
the first-place winner. Their time was 10 minutes, 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Other teams just came out to have fun. Tim Bell, a veterinarian from 
Chatsworth, brought his 16-week-old Labrador puppy out for his first race. The 
two came in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was dragging, poor guy, the last lap," Bell said. "But I didn't have to 
pick him up. That was the goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the competition, sponsored by Farlar International, a pet 
products supply company, are being divided between American Guide Dogs for the 
Blind and the city of Los Angeles' Department of Animal Regulation.

SNAKE-SIGHTING SEASON HAS CREPT UP ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; RATTLERS: WARM 
TEMPERATURES DRAW REPTILES INTO BACK YARDS, HOMES. FROM APRIL TO OCTOBER, 
OFFICIALS RESPOND TO THOUSANDS OF REPORTS. 
</P>

<P>
 An uninvited guest slipped into the living room of William and Jan Brankin's 
Simi Valley home one day: a baby Southern Pacific rattlesnake. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first my husband thought the dog had pooped on the carpet, because that's 
what it looked like all curled up," said Jan Brankin. "He was about to kick the 
dog when he realized it was a snake -- a rattlesnake at that." 
</P>
<P>
 Such encounters are occurring across Southern California as warmer summer 
temperatures draw snakes into the back yards -- and sometimes the homes -- of 
people living by the deserts and foothills of Southern California. On Friday, 
Donald Mathews of Leona Valley was bitten by a rattlesnake as he peeked through 
a trapdoor into his attic. 
</P>
<P>
 Between April and October, depending on the weather, animal control officers 
and firefighters respond to thousands of snake sightings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell people to expect it because it's going to happen," said Bruce 
Richards of the Los Angeles County animal regulation office in Agoura Hills. 
"It may be only one rattlesnake, but that may be the one that gets you." 
</P>
<P>
 Brankin, the mother of a 3-year-old boy and baby-sitter to two other toddlers, 
said the children had played in their back yard most of the afternoon before 
the reptile wound its way into their living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little worrying, especially with small children around," said Brankin. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're encroaching on his land as much as he's encroaching on ours," she 
said. "Just a few years ago, this whole area was barren. We'll be keeping a 
closer eye on the yard from now on, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Using thick leather riding gloves, William Brankin herded the snake into a 
sealable bucket, and he and his wife then moved the wayward serpent to the 
hills above their Wood Ranch subdivision. Officials say the better course would 
have been to call in an expert. 
</P>
<P>
 California is home to four general varieties of snakes: rattler, gopher, 
garter and king snakes. The non-venomous garter, gopher and king snakes account 
for most of the 120 species that make up the state's four general varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Rattlesnakes -- representing six different species -- are the only venomous 
snakes in California. The most populous by far is the Southern Pacific rattler, 
which grows to about 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that animals are more often the victims of snakebites than human 
beings because they are both curious and ignorant about the reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a riding horse died within 30 minutes of being bitten by a 
rattlesnake at O'Neill Regional Park in Orange County. The woman astride the 
animal told officials that the snake seemed to attack the horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very aggressive rattlesnake," park ranger Ron Slimm said at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 One emergency-room physician said he hopes this season is nothing like a year 
ago, when heavy rains increased the rat and mice populations -- favorites foods 
of many snakes -- and brought him a host of rattlesnake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a real run last year," said Dr. Philip Macniel, an attending physician 
at the UC Irvine emergency room. "At one point, we had four (bite victims) in 
the course of three weeks. One of them was particularly ill and had to be put 
on life support." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Snake sightings typically occur in the deserts and foothills -- and in the 
housing developments that have sprung up next to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific rattlers, however, do not limit themselves to undeveloped 
open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Burbank Animal Shelter routinely answer snake-sighting calls 
in the hills in back of the city. When they do, one officer said, they don't 
bother trying to relocate the snake. Instead, they hack it to death with a hoe 
or shovel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We respond immediately to the call, and the snake is dispatched on the spot," 
said Senior Animal Control Officer Harold Hagler. 
</P>
<P>
 "These mountains have all kinds of hikers," Hagler said. "You can't relocate a 
poisonous reptile to where a citizen could get bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Ventura County fire officials feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's determined to be a rattlesnake, we kill it on the spot," said Capt. 
Ken Maffei. "We're not going to jeopardize our people by playing with 
rattlesnakes." 
</P>
<P>
 There are major, easily discernible differences between venomous and 
non-venomous snakes, said Patrick Musone of the Ventura County Animal 
Regulation department. 
</P>
<P>
 Venomous snakes have triangular heads, thicker bodies, blunt tails, pushed-up 
noses and Loreal pits -- small holes between the nostrils and eyes that are 
used to smell. Non-venomous snakes have none of those characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 Musone tells children -- and anyone else who will listen -- that without the 
serpents rodent populations would swell to even larger numbers, and mudslides 
would become more frequent because of the holes dug by rats and mice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to reach the youth now so the future generation will be a little 
less harsh on animals that are misunderstood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Clark understands just one thing about rattlesnakes: They bite. While 
hiking in Matilija Canyon near Ojai last summer, she stepped on a slumbering, 
6-foot rattler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got very sick from it. I was in the hospital for 10 days," said Clark, who 
owns the Busy Babes hair salon in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still not over it completely, not really," she said. "But as for the 
physical part of it, it was three months before I got better. They gave me 
anti-venin, but that didn't work too well."

SNAKEBITE VICTIM IN STABLE CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The condition of a 64-year-old man who was bitten on the neck by a rattlesnake 
in his home Friday was upgraded to stable from critical Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald L. Mathews of Leona Valley was bitten by a 1 1/2-foot-long rattlesnake 
as he poked his head through a trapdoor in his attic. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews' injuries are no longer considered life-threatening, an Antelope 
Valley Hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indoor snake encounters are extremely rare. 
</P>
<P>
 The last known incident in the area was two years ago, when a 20-month-old 
girl was bitten on the thumb by a baby diamondback rattlesnake that crawled 
into the family's home through the door of an attached garage. The girl picked 
it up and showed her mother, who knocked it out of her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-inch snake was captured and the girl survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews has received 37 anti-venom shots, but doctors fear the venom is 
continuing to spread, his wife said Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 "He is frustrated," said Betty Mathews. "He just wants to get out of the 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews is still not able to speak, but has been writing notes or signaling 
with his hands to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that she has not investigated the attic to try to determine how the 
snake got in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here 19 years and I'm not afraid of anything in the house," she 
said. "But I'm not going up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Snakebites of any kind "aren't all that common," said Capt. Ron Hamilton of 
the Los Angeles County Fire Department. And, most snakebites occur on the legs, 
feet, arms and hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton said Mathews reacted the best possible way to being bitten -- he kept 
calm, which kept the snake's venom from spreading rapidly, and called the 911 
emergency number. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing we can do is get them relaxed and to a hospital for 
anti-venom" serum, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California's only venomous snakes, rattlers begin a brief hibernation in late 
November and come out as early as February, authorities said. They are found 
mostly in deserts and foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews lives in a mountainous area just west of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton said his Antelope Valley station gets a snakebite call about once a 
year. "Over the years, we've killed more snakes than treated snakebites." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that firefighters usually try to capture the reptile and set it free 
in the desert, but sometimes they are forced to destroy the snake if lives are 
threatened, Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of those things you just don't want to take a chance about," said 
Hamilton. "Snakes are serious. They will try to bite you, as Mr. Mathews found 
out."

 Billy James, 11, considers himself just part of an ordinary family. 
</P>
<P>
 The California City boy accompanied his mother and her lesbian live-in lover 
to the first Gay and Lesbian Pride Festival in Antelope Valley on Saturday, 
taking in the sights with the same casualness he might have displayed on a trip 
to the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival ends today at the Antelope Valley Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 James said while some of his classmates make derogatory remarks about his 
living situation, he dismisses them as uninformed. What they say "doesn't 
bother me," James said. "It's no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Dee, said she has been involved in the relationship for three 
years and makes it a point to answer any of her children's questions about it. 
She said all of her kids relate well to her roommate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I leave her, (Billy) wants to stay with her," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the three-day festival estimated that more than 150 people had 
shown up for the event in the fairgrounds' agricultural building by 
midafternoon. More were expected later, as comedians, speakers and various 
performers took the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The event -- featuring about 15 vendors with leaflets, T-shirts, historical 
displays and other materials -- was considerably smaller than similar festivals 
in Los Angeles and other cities, which have drawn thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday's visitors said the chance to show their support for the gay 
community in the area was more important than the event's size. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me it's freedom and support, which we don't always get at home," said a 
35-year-old woman who has lived in Lancaster for two years and works at the 
state prison there. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she keeps her sexual preference a secret at work because many of the 
prison officials "are not real open-minded," but added she has met other 
employees there who are homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a secret handshake," she said jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival wasn't much different from a country fair. Lovers held hands and 
kissed as they walked among the various display tables, while others sat down 
at tables with hot dogs and drinks to watch the entertainers. Outside, those 
taking a break from the loud music and crowded corridors played football and 
Frisbee on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the largest displays was provided by John O'Brien, 45, of the 
International Gay and Lesbian Archives in Los Angeles. In glass cases on 
several tables were 6,000 buttons with gay pride themes dating back to 1905. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has been collecting the pins -- part of a collection of 30,000 he 
has promoting various political causes -- for more then 30 years. When he was 
younger, O'Brien said, he felt isolated because of his sexual identity. He said 
his organization tries to provide the material he lacked then, showing that 
homosexuality has existed throughout history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been much easier in my life when I was young to know I was not 
the only person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of protests from conservative activists lingered after five people 
picketed in front of the fairgrounds Friday night, but none were seen Saturday 
afternoon. Some organizers said they expected the chances of a protest to be 
greater today after church services.  
</P>
<P>
 Security was tight, with people and their belongings checked at the building's 
entrance for weapons, alcohol and drugs. The precautions are standard at other 
gay and lesbian events, said Dee Dicey, a board member of the Antelope Valley 
Gay and Lesbian Alliance, which organized the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want anyone to be hurt," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-gay sentiments have recently surfaced in the Antelope Valley. Both the 
Lancaster and Palmdale city councils have taken positions against gay-rights 
legislation, and a Lancaster church produced "The Gay Agenda," a nationally 
distributed anti-homosexual video. 
</P>
<P>
 But festival-goers said the problem is no worse than it is in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't honestly think there is anything that can be done about it, because a 
lot of people already have preconceived notions," said Mike Liebmann, 39, who 
said he didn't "come to terms" with being gay until 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 An interfaith service with nondenominational churches in the area that do not 
condemn homosexuality is scheduled from 9 to 10:30 a.m. today. The festival is 
open from noon to 5 p.m. at the fairgrounds, located at Division Street and 
East Avenue I.

SANTA CLARITA SMOKING BAN EFFECTIVE MONDAY; LAW: THE ORDINANCE WILL AFFECT MOST 
PEOPLE WHO WORK INDOORS, THOUGH RESTAURANTS, BARS AND SMALL BUSINESSES GET SOME 
LEEWAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Workers taking cigarette breaks here will have to go outside beginning Monday 
when the city's new smoking law goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotly debated tobacco control ordinance, approved by the Santa Clarita 
City Council in June, bans smoking at most indoor job sites. It also prohibits 
cigarette vending machines in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 But restaurants, bars and small businesses were given some leeway under the 
new law. Restaurants and bars may establish their own smoking policies as long 
as they are posted for customers. Any small business that is operated away from 
the public and that doesn't share its ventilation system with another office 
may set its own policy as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the ordinance, with an explanatory letter from Mayor George 
Pederson, have been mailed to Santa Clarita's two chambers of commerce and the 
business association that represents the Valencia Industrial Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important that each business understand completely the requirements 
included within the ordinance before it becomes effective," Pederson said. "We 
don't want there to be any misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ordinance has been debated in Santa Clarita for several months, 
city officials don't expect an uproar when it goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went through a lot of public participation to come up with a plan the 
people in the city want," said Ken Pulskamp, assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The regulation is less restrictive than one the City Council nearly put in 
place seven months ago. Council members had approved a ban in December that 
applied to restaurants as well, with few people having come forward either to 
support or oppose the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was reopened when nearly 200 people packed the council chambers in 
January -- some calling smoking a health issue and supporting the ban and 
others saying businesses' rights were being infringed upon and opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months of subsequent public meetings uncovered support for smoking 
controls by many residents, but also complaints from restaurant owners that 
customers might go to eating establishments in the unincorporated county area 
where they can smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 But the law governing restaurants and bars may change Jan. 1 because of state 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Gov. Pete Wilson signed a statewide smoking prohibition 
that affects virtually all enclosed workplaces, including restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 All cities and counties will be affected by the state ban, removing the 
complaint that patrons might avoid one restaurant to eat in another that allows 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita's ordinance will be replaced when the state ban takes effect 
Jan. 1, unless California voters approve a softer ordinance put on the November 
ballot by cigarette maker Philip Morris Inc. The measure, Proposition 188, 
would allow all businesses to set their own smoking policies.

MAN SENTENCED FOR KILLING DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Lincoln man who killed his daughter by shoving her into the path of a truck 
on Interstate 80 has drawn a 25-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada County Superior Court Judge John Darlington imposed the sentence Friday 
on Mitchell Patterson, 36, who once headed the Lincoln chapter of Ross Perot's 
United We Stand organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson grabbed his 10-year-old daughter, Adrianna, from his parked vehicle 
in the eastbound lanes of I-80 and pushed her into the path of a 
tractor-trailer rig in March, 1993, near Floriston, just west of the 
California-Nevada border. She died from the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 He will have to serve two-thirds of the minimum 25-year sentence -- 16 years, 
8 months -- before being eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender David W. Humphreys sought probation for Patterson. He 
said Patterson was mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assistant Dist. Atty. Ronald Wolfson said Patterson has a history of 
violent and abusive behavior toward his wives. He used his daughter in a 
murder-suicide plan but only succeeded in killing her, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted Patterson of first-degree murder this year.

JUDGE RULES POWER TO BLOCK KILLERS' PAROLE CAN'T BE RETROACTIVE; LAW: DECISION 
CASTS DOUBT ON A KEY PROVISION OF GOV. WILSON'S ANTI-CRIME PLATFORM. THE STATE 
MAY BE FORCED TO FREE UP TO 30 MEN AND WOMEN DOING TIME FOR MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Calling into question a key component of Gov. Pete Wilson's anti-crime 
platform, a federal magistrate judge has ruled that Wilson cannot block the 
parole of convicted murderers whose crimes occurred before 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 If the magistrate's recommendation to U.S. District Judge David Levy is 
affirmed, the state could be forced into freeing up to 30 men and women serving 
time for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Magistrate Judge Gregory G. Hollows said in a ruling made public Friday that 
Wilson cannot apply a 1988 initiative granting California governors the power 
to block parole to prisoners whose crimes occurred before enactment of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 88, which went into effect in 1989, was passed by voters in the 
wake of failed efforts by then-Gov. George Deukmejian to block the parole of 
former Death Row inmate Archie Fain in a case that drew wide attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollows found that Wilson's policy of applying the initiative retroactively 
"without a doubt has actually disadvantaged . . . a class of prisoners whose 
offenses were committed prior to the effective date of Proposition 88." 
</P>
<P>
 "The court finds," Hollows wrote, "that the substance of the governor's power 
was intended to, and has worked to, retrospectively make (the prisoners' 
sentences) more burdensome. In this respect, California's law violated the ex 
post facto clause of the federal Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the governor denounced the ruling and vowed to fight it. But 
the lawyer for the prisoners hailed it as affirming a cornerstone of U.S. 
constitutional law -- that new laws cannot be applied retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here comes the federal government sticking its nose in the state's business 
again," said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Wilson. "It's an outrage. . . . We're 
talking about keeping dangerous dirt bags in prison for the life terms they 
were sentenced to." 
</P>
<P>
 The incendiary nature of parole again became apparent when, earlier this year, 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown, Wilson's Democratic challenger, attacked the 
Republican incumbent for not taking steps to block the parole of serial rapist 
Melvin Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter received a specific determinate sentence of 25 years for his crimes, 
and he was released after serving half of that term because of penitentiary 
work and good behavior. By law, Wilson says, he had no power to stop Carter's 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor contends however that he does have the power to block release of 
convicted murderers serving "indeterminate sentences" -- and he instituted a 
policy to that effect upon taking office in 1991. Most people convicted of 
murder are given such sentences that can be as long as life in prison. But 
under sentencing law, they can seek parole for the prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 People sentenced to an indeterminate life sentence appear before the Board of 
Prison Terms after serving a set number of years. The board rarely grants 
release dates. But Wilson's policy has been to review decisions in which the 
board granted parole dates, and then rescind or modify them so prisoners' 
release dates are delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, it is important," Walsh said of the governor's policy of revoking 
the parole dates of murderers serving such sentences. "Those are 30 murderers 
who could be on the street plying their trade again, and that's something the 
governor does not want. He doesn't want any murderers getting out and having 
the opportunity to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, after Wilson blocked the release of one of the prisoners, San 
Francisco attorney Dennis Riordan wrote to the governor warning that his policy 
blatantly violated the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan brought the suit challenging the policy in state court, where a state 
court of appeal affirmed Wilson's policy. The attorney turned to federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't going to lose political points for it," Riordan said. "He wanted to 
be a governor who could say, 'No one gets out on my watch.' He was clearly 
wrong. The magistrate speaks a very simple truth. This is a case that cannot be 
lost in any federal court because the Constitution could not be clearer on the 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollows' decision came in a case involving Robert Johnson, convicted of a 1977 
murder. Johnson had a parole date and was on the verge of walking out of prison 
when Wilson intervened. Riordan said the governor did the same to five other 
prisoners about to released in 1991. If the recommendation is affirmed by 
higher courts, all six would be freed, Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In more recent years, the Board of Prison Terms has granted parole dates in 
fewer instances. The governor reversed decisions twice in 1992, and three times 
in 1993.

ENERGY PANEL STUDY THROWS COLD WATER ON PROPOSED DAM; ENVIRONMENT: REPORT CITES 
IRREPARABLE HARM TO WILD CLAVEY RIVER NEAR YOSEMITE. RECOMMENDATION DOES NOT 
NECESSARILY DOOM THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Concluding that a plan to dam the wild Clavey River near Yosemite would cause 
irreparable environmental harm, a pivotal federal study recommends against 
construction of the huge hydroelectric project. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which rarely has sided 
with environmentalists on river preservation, praised the pristine river canyon 
and advised the dam's proponents to look for other power sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We conclude that the proposed project would not develop sufficient public 
benefits to compensate for the environmental impacts associated with its 
construction and operation," said the report, which was released Friday. 
"Therefore, we recommend that the proposed project not be licensed." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists fighting the plan to build the 413-foot-high dam said they 
were thrilled by the recommendation. They say one of the last free-flowing 
rivers in California deserves protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been saying all along that if ever there was a project that FERC 
would find indefensible, it would be this project," said Johanna Thomas, 
executive director of the San Francisco-based Tuolumne River Preservation 
Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation does not necessarily doom the project. The commission will 
accept public comment for 90 days, issue a final environmental report and then 
vote on whether to adopt the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turlock Irrigation District, which proposes damming the Clavey to produce 
peak summertime power for homes, farms and canneries in the Central Valley, 
acknowledged that the recommendation is a setback but said it is too early to 
say whether it will abandon the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's environmental study, while rejecting the Clavey dam, called 
for further analysis of two other alternatives, which could involve building a 
smaller diversion dam on the Clavey River. 
</P>
<P>
 Under these scenarios, water from the Clavey would be pumped to a nearby dam 
that would be built on either the North Fork of the Tuolumne River or Hunter 
Creek. Like the Clavey, they are both tributaries of the Tuolumne River. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to look at the two alternatives very closely," irrigation 
district spokesman John Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists said those proposals also are flawed and would cause 
considerable environmental damage to the Clavey and the river chosen as the new 
dam site. They called on the irrigation district to solve its long-term energy 
problems through better conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington, D.C.-based environmental group American Rivers lists the 
Clavey as one of the country's 10 most endangered rivers. That status would not 
change with either of the alternatives proposed by the commission, said Tom 
Cassidy, a vice president of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists said they will continue pushing Congress to give the Clavey 
protected status.

COLOR THEM RED: PLANTS THAT BLAZE YEAR-ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN BOLTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Bolton is a Santa Barbara free-lance 
writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a bullfighter's red cape, the color red in the landscape shouts for 
attention. Blazing fall colors or fiery summer flowers may be the first garden 
reds that come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other plants that have red leaves all year-round--or at least 
most of the year, if they're deciduous. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumped together in a group that includes red, purple, bronze and copper 
foliage, these plants make a statement. They draw the eye toward them, breaking 
up the sameness of an all-green garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Red foliage plants come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from ground-hugging 
carpet bugle to copper beech, which can overshadow a two-story house. They 
generally look best with medium-green to dark-green neighbors, although in just 
the right spot they contrast dramatically with silver or gray foliage plants. 
For most of these plants, choose a spot in full sun. Too much shade often fades 
the leaf color. 
</P>
<P>
 * Starting with trees, the dainty Japanese maple ( Acer palmatum ) changes 
color with the seasons: scarlet in spring, green in summer, then yellow, orange 
or scarlet again in fall. An exception to the full-sun rule, Japanese maple is 
happy in partial shade. A single tree at a lawn's edge or beneath an oak is a 
beautiful accent. A clustering of three or a grove of more calls for a round of 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
 * Flowering plums are also spectacular in grove plantings. Their dainty 
flowers are a spring bonus. Prunus blireiana' s new leaves emerge purplish red, 
then change to greenish bronze by fall. Purple-leaf plum ( Prunus cerasifera 
'Atropurpurea' ) produces a bumper crop of red plums. Dwarf red-leaf plum ( 
Prunus cistena ) bears dark purple fruit and is easy to grow in a large tub. 
</P>
<P>
 * Copper beech ( Fagus sylvatica 'Atropunicea' ), with dark red or purple 
foliage, and weeping copper beech ( F.s. 'Purpurea Pendula' ) are excellent 
container plants too. In the ground, they may eventually reach 60 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Smoke tree ( Cotinus coggygria 'Purpureus' or 'Royal Purple') is another 
foliage chameleon, with new, Concord-grape purple leaves turning to rose red in 
fall. A deciduous large bush or small tree, smoke tree stands up to wind, 
flourishes in poor or rocky soil and usually requires no watering after its 
second year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also look for the purple hopseed bush ( Dodonea viscosa 'Purpurea' ), which 
keeps its willow-like leaves year-round, or purple filbert ( Corylus maxima 
'Purpurea' ). 
</P>
<P>
 * On the shorter side of the garden fence are two ornamental grasses that go 
dormant in winter. Japanese blood grass ( Imperata cylindrica 'Rubra' or 'Red 
Baron') is aptly named, with blood-red blades spreading in knee-high clumps. It 
likes regular water and thrives next to lawns. Red fountain grass ( Pennisetum 
setaceum 'Rubrum' or 'Cupreum' ) is less strident. Fluffy plumes in shades of 
red, copper or purple form in late summer atop thick, waist-high clumps of 
slender stalks. It is drought tolerant and grows in just about any garden soil. 
</P>
<P>
 * The shrub heavenly bamboo ( Nandina domestica ) offers a celestial parade of 
colors. Feathery new leaves unfurl a pinkish or coppery red, then slowly change 
to medium-green. By summer, bronze, purple or red creeps from the edges toward 
the centers. In winter most of the leaves are brilliant scarlet, with 
long-lasting, shiny red berries dangling from the branches. 
</P>
<P>
 * More delicate are glossy abelia ( belia grandiflora ) and Begonia 
richmondensis . Both have bronzy foliage contrasting with white or pink 
flowers. They are generally evergreen, tolerate full sun near the coast or 
filtered shade inland and require frost protection and regular watering. 
</P>
<P>
 In water-conserving gardens, shrubby succulents offer many shades of red. 
Aeonium arboreum 'Atropurpureum' sends out burgundy rosettes about the size of 
an outstretched hand. Crassula corymbulosa is smaller, with dark red rosettes. 
Stonecrop ( Sedum ) prospers in sun or shade and includes two tough ground 
covers: Sedum spathulifolium 'Purpureum, ' with dark purple leaves, and Sedum 
spurium, with thick, evergreen, bronzy leaves and red flowers during most of 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carpet bugle ( Ajuga reptans ) grows fast into a dense mat of bronze or 
purple leaves. Spires of blue flowers cap the foliage from spring to summer. 
Half a dozen named varieties bear slightly different leaf shapes and colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the ground, pots are comfortable summer homes for a few red-leafed 
plants that should be indoors now. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fancy-leafed caladium ( Caladium bicolor), native to the tropics, provides 
color as loud as a squawking parrot on big, multicolored leaves. Kalanchoe 
laciniata has thick, succulent, red or bronze leaves. Finger-nail size flowers 
in red, orange or yellow appear in late winter and spring. However, hybridizers 
have had a field day with kalanchoe and it's often available in bloom 
year-round at garden centers, drugstores or supermarkets. RED FOLIAGE PLANTS

 Again in the same issue (July 10), the book identified in "In Brief" as 
"Tracking the Vanishing Tree Frogs" is titled simply "Tracking the Vanishing 
Frogs." The tree apparently grew up there overnight while we weren't looking.

 CLARIFICATION: The Benedict Canyon home of the late actor MacDonald Carey sold 
for $357,500, not $370,000 as sources said in the July 10 Hot Property column. 
Selling agent Ron Holliman of Jon Douglas Co.'s Sunset Strip office also notes 
that the buyer was a lawyer from England, not Ireland, as was reported.

 If you've ever spent time in the country's colder regions, you know all about 
the "wind-chill factor." More than telling the temperature, that figure tells 
how cold it feels by adding wind speed. Determined not to allow winter to 
out-classify summer, the National Weather Service has begun calculating the 
"ultraviolet index," and the "heat index," sometimes called the "agony index." 
</P>
<P>
 The "heat index," begun in 1984, is how a person feels the combination of 
temperature and humidity. For example, with an air temperature of 100 degrees 
Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 60%, the National Weather Service 
determined that it feels like 130 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Frank Lepore, National Weather Service spokesman, about 20,000 
people nationwide have died as a result of heat-related injuries over the past 
50 years. What's more, 700,000 to 1 million people each year are diagnosed with 
skin cancer -- three-quarters of which are UV related. The UV index is designed 
to measure ultraviolet light levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these are an attempt to put this very technical stuff into useful 
terms people can understand," Lepore said, "to make the public understand that 
there is an environmentally-related health hazard." UV Index 
</P>
<P>
 The "ultraviolet index," begun this June, is still in the experimental phase. 
It measeures the amount of im it would take for a fair-skinned person to get 
sunburned during the hottest part of the day, generally 11:30 to 12:30. UV 
Level: What it signifies 0-2: Minimal exposure, when it takes more than 30 
minutes to burn. 3-4: Low UVI, when it takes 15-90 minutes to burn. 5-6: 
Moderate UVI, when it takes 10-60 minutes to burn. 7-9: High UVI, 7-9, when it 
takes 7 to 35 minutes to burn. 10-plus: Very high, when a sensitive-skinned 
person could burn in fewer than five minutes. Heat-related Injuries 
</P>
<P>
 There are several signs that the heat has gotten to your body. "No one in 
their right mind is going to go out there and jog if we're having a 110-degree 
heat wave," said Manuel Rivas, a spokesman for the Los Angeles chapter of the 
American Red Cross. "But we tell people just in case, to catch those people who 
don't have common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 * Heat cramps: Often in the legs or abdomen, can signal the early stages of 
more serious heat-related injuries. Resting in a cool area, drinking cold 
fluids and massaging the cramped area are often enough to quell the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heat exhaustion: Symptoms are headaches, nausea, dizziness, weakness, 
fatigue, clamminess and normal or below normal body temperatures. Treatment is 
the same is for heat cramps and needs to be handled promptly. If allowed to 
progress, heat exhaustion can lead to mild shock or heat stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heat stroke: Among the most serious heat-related medical emergencies, 
developed when symptoms of heat exhaustion go untreated. The body, overwhelmed 
by heat, begins to stop functioning. If not treated immediately, heat stroke 
can be fatal. Symptoms include a high body temperature; red, dry skin; 
progressive loss of consciousness; rapid, weak pulse, rapid, shallow breathing; 
and vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment includes cooling the body with ice packs on wrists, ankles, armpits 
and neck; drinking four ounces of water every 15 minutes and minimizing shock. 
If a victim refuses water, vomits or is unconscious, seek immediate medical 
attention. Summer Heat Tips 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross offers the following tips to coping the effects of summer heat: 
</P>
<P>
 * Slow down and avoid strenuous outdoor activities 
</P>
<P>
 * Stay indoors as much as possible 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing 
</P>
<P>
 * Drink plenty of water 
</P>
<P>
 * Eat small meals throughout the day 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid foods high in protein, which increases metabolic heat 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid the use of salt tablets unless told to do so by a doctor 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid alcoholic and caffeinated beverages Heat and Pets 
</P>
<P>
 And don't forget dogs and cats on those sweltering, summer days. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to realize that pets suffer from the heat too, it's not just us," 
said Madeline Bernstein, the executive director of the Los Angeles Society for 
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. "The biggest problem we have this time of 
year is that pets get left in cars with the windows cracked a tad. It's usually 
fatal." 
</P>
<P>
 If a dog begins to breathe rapidly, has difficulty walking or otherwise 
exhibits signs of disorientation, it may be suffering heat stroke. In that 
case, the animal should be cooled down with lukewarm water (cold can be too 
shocking) and then taken to a veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaving a pet's fur in hopes of keeping it cool is not necessarily a good 
idea. The fur insulates against heat just as it does against cold, Bernstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it's already too late, she suggests being extra careful not to leave 
the animal in the sun; animals, like humans, are susceptible to sunburn if they 
are stripped of their protection. The Agony Index 
</P>
<P>
 High air temperature coupled with high humidity can make it feel hotter than 
it really is.
