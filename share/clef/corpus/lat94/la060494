WORLD CUP SWAMPED WITH COMPLAINTS ABOUT TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the opening game of the World Cup only two weeks away, there appear to be 
new problems with the event's most precious resource -- tickets, which were 
sent to the public this week. World Cup phone lines have been swamped with 
angry callers whose complaints range from receiving tickets to the wrong venue 
to being assigned seats other than what they paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a debacle," said one World Cup official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. "It's happening to everyone, including staff. Staff and the public 
are getting tickets for games they didn't even order and not getting tickets 
for games they did order. We're getting hate mail faxed from all over the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is difficult to gauge the number of ticket complaints, the World 
Cup office in Century City, other ticket outlets and the U.S. Soccer Federation 
have received hundreds of calls this week. The reaction has prompted World Cup 
officials to add phone lines to deal with the volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott LeTellier, managing director and chief operating officer of World Cup 
94, acknowledged that there have been calls, but characterized the response as 
well within the range expected for such a large event and noted the distinction 
between callers with questions and callers with complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's accurate to say there have been a large volume of calls," he said. "But 
when you look at the number of tickets, it's expected. This is the week things 
have been dumped. This is to be expected. I think things are going well." 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup is soccer's quadrennial world championship and is the largest 
single sporting event in the world. The matches, which run from June 17 to July 
17, are being held in nine U.S. cities, including Pasadena at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for the event's 3.6 million tickets has been high. LeTellier said 
196,000 accounts were serviced this week, which could represent as many as 3 
million tickets for the tournament's first and second rounds. All tickets will 
have been sent by overnight courier service and will have reached customers by 
Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to The Times and World Cup have been high with fans who are either irate 
or confused. Stories of snafus have abounded. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, a fan paid $250,000 for an exclusive ticket package that he 
received this week, but he is seated on one side of the stadium and his wife is 
on the other. Another case has a customer buying five tickets together and 
finding that the five seats are all in a line directly behind each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest number of complaints seems to focus on the placement of the seats, 
which were sold by categories rather than selling a specific seat. Category I 
tickets were the most expensive, and customers were told they would be seated 
between the end lines of the field. Category II tickets were to be in the 
corners of the stadium, and Category III seats were to be behind the goals in 
the end zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of a World Cup ticket is $58, and a Category I ticket for 
the final has a face value of $475. 
</P>
<P>
 But World Cup officials have liberally interpreted the Category I zones, which 
in the Rose Bowl extend into the end zones. LeTellier said this was done so 
that entire sections could be kept to a single category, although four sections 
at the Rose Bowl are split between Category I and II seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "To pay that amount of money and sit in the corner is disappointing, it's 
obscene," said Leslie Moss of Los Angeles. He said he bought his Category I 
tickets in the first hour they were made available to the public last year. He 
said he paid $724 for two tickets to each of five games at the Rose Bowl. "We 
were promised seats between the end lines. These tickets were sold under false 
pretenses." 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving his tickets this week, Moss said he spent a total of 40 hours 
trying to get through to the World Cup ticket hot line but gave up when all he 
got was a busy signal. 
</P>
<P>
 LeTellier attributed the problems to "computer glitches" and the human error 
of people taking orders over the phone. In most cases, he said, the problems 
can be rectified. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Ticketmaster, which has been selling tickets but has no role 
in assigning seats, said the week has "been hell." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a lot of calls, but I don't expect next week to be as bad," he 
said. "We have been getting scenarios of all types: wrong venue, wrong ticket, 
not all the tickets were sent. Let's put it this way, my days haven't been fun 
this week." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ticketmaster employee, who does not usually field phone calls, said he had 
been on the phone almost continually since Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it has nothing to do with World Cup ticketing, the U.S. Soccer 
Federation has not been spared the onslaught. Executive Director Hank 
Steinbrecher said many of his oldest friends have been calling him this week to 
complain about their tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got calls until 1 in the morning," Steinbrecher said. "They are even coming 
into Soccer House (USSF headquarters in Chicago) to complain. I don't know the 
magnitude of the problem, so I don't know how to judge the reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 LeTellier called a staff meeting at World Cup's Century City offices Friday 
afternoon to brief senior staff on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 In January there was a huge backlog of ticket requests for the Premier Ticket 
program, an exclusive offering of the best seats along with a package of 
amenities. Those packages sold in the tens of thousands of dollars. The backlog 
of unfilled orders for that program at one point reached more than $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup has established a hot line for ticket buyers. More lines are being 
added to handle the volume of calls. That number is (310) 277-9494. 
Ticketmaster's hot line number is (800) 937-7337. 
</P>
<P>
 On a call to the World Cup number Friday afternoon, a World Cup public 
information worker said that he, too, had bought Category I tickets and had 
been assigned seats in the corner of the Rose Bowl. Asked if the World Cup 
offered refunds, the worker replied that all sales were final but told the 
caller that he would be willing to buy any unwanted tickets.

STATE, U.S. JOBLESS RATES FALL SHARPLY; ECONOMY: NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT DROPS TO 
6% AND CALIFORNIA'S TO 8.3%. BUT THE SOUTHLAND'S RECOVERY CONTINUES TO LAG 
BEHIND THAT OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

<P>
 The unemployment rate fell sharply in both the nation and California in May as 
the economy continued to generate steady job growth, the Labor Department 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The national jobless figure fell to 6%, down from 6.4% in April. But 
government officials said that the sizable decline appears to overstate the 
actual improvement in the nation's labor market last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, unemployment dropped to 8.3%, down from 9.6%, in another large 
statistical move that masks a more moderate pickup in job creation, according 
to analysts. And Southern California, although recovering, continues to trail 
the rest of the state and the nation as a whole in the economic expansion. In 
Los Angeles County, the jobless rate edged down only slightly to 9.7% in May, 
compared with 9.9% a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Northern California is marching along to the national tune," while Southern 
California is still lagging, said Thomas Plewes, associate commissioner of 
labor statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 While the declines in the official unemployment rates were impressive, a 
separate calculation of the number of people working across the country showed 
that the economy generated fewer than 200,000 new jobs in May. The figure was 
smaller than expected, and some economists said it could signal that the pace 
of the recovery is slowing to a more moderate level. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of more restrained growth appeared to reassure the stock and bond 
markets, where investors have expressed growing concern that the robust growth 
of recent months could lead to a resurgence of inflation.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 13.23 points to close at 3,772.22, while 
the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bonds, a key indicator of long-term 
interest rates, fell to 7.26%, from 7.34% a year earlier. Lower yields suggest 
that investors are more confident that inflationary pressures remain under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials welcomed the job report, insisting that their 
policies will lead to steady growth without significant price increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is entering the summer in exceedingly good shape," Labor 
Secretary Robert B. Reich said at a White House briefing. "We are deep in a 
jobs recovery, a jobs expansion." 
</P>
<P>
 But Reich expressed concern about the widening gap between the prospects of 
skilled, high-wage Americans and those workers who lack the necessary education 
and training to fully enjoy the benefits of the economic resurgence. He noted 
that 20% of Americans currently without jobs have been unemployed for six 
months or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp drop in the national jobless rate is somewhat exaggerated because 
the government has changed the way it conducts its monthly surveys and adjusts 
the results to reflect conditions affecting the nation's total labor pool of 
more than 130 million workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such statistical changes could account for as much as half of last month's 
decline, said Katherine Abraham, Commissioner of Labor Statistics, suggesting 
that the true rate of unemployment could be closer to 6.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's separate survey of business payrolls showed a net increase of 
191,000 jobs in May, a figure that includes 71,000 people who returned to work 
after the end of the trucking industry strike. The payroll survey is considered 
a more reliable measure of employment conditions than the household poll used 
to calculate the unemployment rate. 
</P>
<P>
 While the employment figure signaled that the recovery is still on track, it 
was slightly smaller than expected and fell short of the average monthly job 
growth of 247,000 so far during 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 An increase of 191,000 jobs "is not the type of figure that should panic the 
markets," said Martin Regalia, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce. "This is a continued verification of our expectation that the economy 
is slowing somewhat from the pace at the end of last year and during the first 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, job growth was noticeably more robust in April, when the economy 
added a revised 358,000 non-farm jobs, and in March, when payrolls swelled by 
379,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, meanwhile, "we're seeing slow, steady increases in the number 
of payroll jobs, which is encouraging," said Ted Gibson, principal economist 
for the California Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 California's recovery picked up speed slightly, with 7,100 jobs added to 
employers' payrolls. The government revised upward, to 7,900, the number of 
jobs gained in April, bringing the overall increase to 15,000 over the last two 
months and 30,400 for all of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project, said that 
the May data makes him "feel more secure" that the state is in the midst of a 
genuine recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he noted, the job gains continue to be modest. And he expressed 
disappointment at the slow pace of the improvement. "I want to see 30,000 to 
40,000 jobs added a month . . . before I shout, 'Hooray! We're in a vigorous 
recovery! It's better to be getting some gains than none, but it still looks 
pretty weak."  
</P>
<P>
 In California, last month's job gains came mostly in services, particularly 
the motion picture industry and retailing. Job losses continued in 
manufacturing, especially defense and aerospace-related fields, along with 
finance, insurance and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The "hemorrhage" of defense jobs, which disappeared at a rate of 15,000 jobs a 
month last year, has slowed to about 8,000 monthly, according to Plewes of the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County recorded a net employment gain of 26,000 in May, with the 
number of jobholders rising to more than 4 million. It posted a decline of 
4,000 in the number of jobless workers, with the total dipping to 432,000. 
Unlike federal and state statistics, the county numbers are not adjusted to 
reflect seasonal trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay D. Horowitz, labor market analyst for the California Employment 
Development Department, said that he is mildly encouraged by the county totals. 
"More or less, we're going to follow in the footsteps of the nation in coming 
back, but it's a very slow process." 
</P>
<P>
 Horowitz said that employment in construction, retailing and other services 
appears to be growing in the county. While job losses continue in aerospace and 
other high-tech fields, he said the rate of shrinkage appears to be slowing.

CLINTON HONORS GIS WHO FOUGHT IN ITALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He came on a mission of remembrance, a young man paying homage to the 
sacrifice of so many young men who died to make a world free. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton arrived at the beautiful, mournful Sicily-Rome American 
cemetery here on a muggy, cloud-dappled day to give thanks to the thousands of 
GIs who survived the bloody campaign to liberate Italy -- and to the 7,862 dead 
who are buried here. 
</P>
<P>
 To the crash of cannon and the haunting strains of Chopin's "Funeral March," a 
somber Clinton saluted the more than 1,000 military veterans and guests at the 
Nettuno memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot leave memory to chance," he said. "We are the sons and daughters 
of the world they saved." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ceremony was the first of three major commemorative events to mark 
the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the end of the bloodiest conflagration 
in history. 
</P>
<P>
 At Nettuno, 40 miles south of Rome, Clinton honored the men who struggled 
their way from Sicily northward, up the mountainous spine of the Italian 
peninsula through a winter of ice and mud, hardship and death. 
</P>
<P>
 The caps of the aging veterans spelled out the names of the units that shed 
their blood so that the people of Italy might be free of the blight of fascism 
and German occupation: the 36th Infantry Division, the 45th, the 10th Mountain, 
the 14th, the 85th. Their name tags bore the names of places of horror that 
will live in history: Salerno, Anzio, Monte Cassino. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nettuno cemetery lies just inland from Anzio, the port where Allied troops 
landed in January, 1944, to stiff German resistance. They were pinned down 
under intense artillery and air bombardment until late May, when they broke 
out, eventually linking up with other troops that had pushed through the 
Germans' fortified Gustav Line and marched into Rome 50 years ago today.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton noted that his father, William Jefferson Blythe, served in Italy and 
recalled a story told to him about his father, who died in 1946, three months 
before Clinton's birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back home, his niece had heard about the beautiful Italian countryside and 
wrote him asking for a single leaf from one of the glorious trees here to take 
to school," Clinton said. "My father had only sad news to send back -- there 
were no leaves; every one had been stripped by the fury of the battle." 
</P>
<P>
 The leaves have now returned, and the Nettuno cemetery is a lush memorial 
garden of evergreen holly oak and cypress trees. Row on row of perfectly 
aligned white marble crosses and Stars of David mark the graves. Before 
Friday's ceremony, Italian schoolchildren placed Italian and American flags and 
a single red or yellow carnation upon each grave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stand today in fields forever scarred by sacrifice," Clinton said, in one 
of his most eloquent and briefest speeches as President. "But amid the horror 
of the guns, something rare was born -- a driving spirit of common cause." 
</P>
<P>
 In a gesture of conciliation, Clinton honored his chief nemesis on Capitol 
Hill, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who as a 21-year-old platoon 
leader with the 10th Mountain Division was gravely wounded in Italy. Dole was 
joined at the Nettuno ceremony by three other Senate veterans of the Italian 
campaign: Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), who lost an arm to his war wounds in 
1945; Ernest F. Hollings (D-S. C.), and Claiborne Pell (D-R. I.). 
</P>
<P>
 "We honor what they did for us here," Clinton said. He called them "each a 
young American who came of age here; each an American patriot who went home to 
build up our nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro laid a wreath at the steps 
of the U.S.-built memorial, near the base of a statue depicting an American 
soldier and sailor linked as brothers in arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why war?" Scalfaro asked in his remarks. "Why destruction and death? And the 
answer is only one: Because violence and thirst for power prevailed over 
reason; because the natural and inviolable rights of the human person were 
transgressed by dictators, with the idea of the hegemony of a 'superior race' 
that kills human brotherhood and generates extermination and genocide." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Italian history -- its embrace of fascism and its alliance with 
Nazi Germany -- cannot be rewritten. But he vowed that Italy would remain 
committed to a democratic course and alliance with the free peoples of Europe 
and America. 
</P>
<P>
 As the ceremony concluded, three waves of jet fighters roared overhead, some 
in the missing-man formation. The third group wreathed the cemetery in smoke in 
green, white and red, the Italian national colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his speech, Clinton walked among the headstones, pausing at the grave 
of Ophelia Tiley, an American Red Cross volunteer who was killed in Italy on 
March 25, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 He was greeted at the cemetery by June Wandry, 73, of Portage, Mich. She 
served as a nurse in Italy half a century ago. She saluted the President 
smartly; he answered with a tentative, unpracticed salute. During her wartime 
service, Wandry not only ministered to wounded GIs but cared for the liberated 
inmates of the Dachau concentration camp in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Clinton hosted a reception at the cemetery for several hundred 
veterans of the Italian campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Clinton spoke to embassy employees and toured ancient Roman 
ruins. The evening was spent at a formal dinner given by Scalfaro at the 
Quirinale Palace. It was closed to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 While the ceremony at Nettuno was impressive, it was a relatively brief and 
restrained bit of presidential image-polishing, a mere warm-up for the daylong 
extravaganza to be staged in Normandy on Monday, the 50th anniversary of the 
D-day landings. 
</P>
<P>
 The comparison evoked bittersweet memories in many of the veterans here, who 
believe that their suffering and their accomplishments were overshadowed by 
Supreme Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower's big show in France two days after the 
liberation of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble is, most people in America and Italy don't know anything about 
what we did here," said Norman L. Myhra of Stevens Point, Wis., an Anzio 
veteran who lost both hands later in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normandy had all the people, all the equipment, all the guns," Myhra said. 
"They got all the bread. We got the crumbs."

U.S. TO STRESS EXPORTS TO JAPAN INSTEAD OF DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House has concluded that it will be unable to reduce the growing 
trade deficit with Japan during President Clinton's first term and no longer 
considers doing so a key political objective, the Administration's chief trade 
negotiator indicated Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of aiming for a specific reduction in the U.S.-Japan trade deficit, 
now about $60 billion a year, the Administration will emphasize Clinton's 
efforts to increase exports in select industries, U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Times reporters, Kantor downplayed any assertion that the 
Administration is retreating from attempts to get tough with Japan on trade. He 
noted that talks are continuing on developing a new framework for trade 
relations between the two nations in a number of important industrial sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it appears the Administration has changed its goal of attempting to set 
specific targets to reduce the overall U.S.-Japan trade deficit. The deficit 
has become a highly visible reminder of the United States' uncertain standing 
in the competitive global marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials and many private economists agree that the level of 
U.S. exports is a more direct measure of the United States' ability to 
eliminate the barriers that make it difficult for U.S. firms to do business in 
foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because the trade deficit also reflects purchases of foreign goods by 
Americans, and the gap can widen even if U.S. exports are rising and 
contributing to job growth in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 The absolute size of the U.S.-Japan deficit "is less important . . . than the 
content of the deficit," Kantor said. "What has worried us most about the 
closed markets in Japan and what the framework talks are aimed at are those 
sectors where we have the highest potential growth: semiconductors, 
electronics, computers, supercomputers, auto and auto parts, services like 
insurance and financial services." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 election campaign, Clinton cited the growing deficit with Japan as 
evidence that the George Bush Administration had not moved aggressively enough 
to open up restricted markets. He promised to make vigorous trade policy a 
central element of his strategy for economic renewal, estimating that every $1 
billion in additional U.S. exports would create 20,000 to 30,000 new jobs in 
this country.  
</P>
<P>
 Kantor, addressing another touchy competitiveness issue, said that the U.S. 
trade gap with China ultimately could rival in size the troublesome deficit 
with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking just a week after Clinton announced renewal of Beijing's 
most-favored-nation trade status, he said that tough negotiations lie ahead to 
ensure that China complies with international trade laws as it grows into a 
trading powerhouse. Most-favored-nation status gives China the same low tariffs 
as most other U.S. trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't continue to be aggressive and work with China on a day-to-day 
basis and, in fact, insist that they adhere to the same norms as the rest of 
the major nations . . . who have access to our market, then, yes, we're going 
to create a problem for ourselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said he met with China's ambassador to the United States on Thursday 
and engaged in a "very candid discussion" of trade issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's breakfast session at The Times' Washington Bureau, Kantor 
complained about China's refusal to abide by international rules governing 
intellectual property rights. He cited in particular the rampant production of 
bootleg versions of Western music. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't protect intellectual property," Kantor said. "They have 26 plants 
in southern China which last year produced 75 million compact discs, only 2 
million of which were consumed in China -- 73 million were exported." 
</P>
<P>
 The piracy problem extends to "computer software, computer hardware, 
pharmaceuticals, you name it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor's remarks contrast with those of Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, 
who said last month that the renewal of most-favored-nation status would help 
shrink or even eliminate the United States' growing trade deficit with China. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the United States logged a $23-billion deficit with China, second 
only to the gap with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kantor said the Administration is beginning to rethink U.S. policy 
toward exports of U.S. cigarettes and other tobacco products. At a time when 
the tobacco industry is facing mounting pressure at home, it has seen 
international markets as an important source of future profits and growth.  
</P>
<P>
 But Kantor said the Administration already has reversed a Bush Administration 
policy by no longer opposing efforts by other nations to block sales of U.S. 
cigarettes because of local health and safety regulations. Before the policy 
shift, the United States objected to such obstacles on the grounds that they 
represented unfair trading rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said the Administration would not attempt to reverse such policies as 
long as U.S. brands are treated no differently from local tobacco products.

NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP SHUTS DOORS TO ALL BUT 8 STATES; ENVIRONMENT: CALIFORNIA IS 
LEFT WITH NO DISPOSAL SITE, INCREASING PRESSURE FOR APPROVAL OF WARD VALLEY 
FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of only two low-level nuclear waste dumps in the nation will close to most 
outsiders at the end of June, a move that will leave California and 30 other 
states with no sanctioned disposal site. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the South Carolina Legislature to limit access to that state's 
facility at Barnwell will mean that hospitals, biomedical companies and other 
industries -- often in heavily populated areas -- must store their own nuclear 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Being shut out of the South Carolina dump will also increase the pressure on 
California to build the proposed Ward Valley disposal facility in the eastern 
Mojave Desert, a controversial project currently tied up in litigation and the 
focus of bitter opposition for a decade by anti-nuclear and environmental 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina officials gave no reason for their decision on Thursday to 
limit access to the Barnwell dump to eight southeastern states. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides in the fight over Ward Valley reacted to the decision with alarm 
Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 "The impact of (closing) Barnwell is tremendous," said Michael Dieden, 
political director for Americans for a Safe Future, one of several groups 
opposed to Ward Valley. "It places a great need on California to come up with 
an alternative to Ward Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have been jolted out of the mind-set in California that we can 
always ship our problems elsewhere," said Alan Pasternal, technical director 
for the California Radioactive Materials Management Forum, which represents 
firms that produce or use radioactive materials. "The decision simply 
emphasizes the need to get on with the job of siting Ward Valley."  
</P>
<P>
 Closure of the South Carolina dump to all but the eight states means that "65% 
of all radioactive waste in the nation will have to be stored at the point of 
generation," said Holmes Brown, a spokesman for the Low-Level Waste Forum, an 
organization of state officials who work on nuclear waste issues. In California 
alone, about 120,000 cubic feet of contaminated waste is produced each year. 
About 30% of that had been going to South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuclear waste generators in California have been storing most of their waste 
on their own property since the closure of a Nevada waste dump in 1993. But 
many companies and hospitals working with radioactive materials have warned 
that they have limited storage capacity. If Ward Valley or an alternative site 
is not opened soon, they say, a storage crunch could lead to cutbacks in 
important research and an escalation in the cost of nuclear medicine.  
</P>
<P>
 The proximity of many of the facilities to large urban areas also is a cause 
for worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hospitals and biotech companies completely surrounded by residential 
neighborhoods certainly aren't the best places to be storing this stuff," said 
Donald Womeldorf, director of the Southwestern Low-Level Radioactive Waste 
Commission, which represents the four states -- California, Arizona, North 
Dakota and South Dakota -- that would have access to Ward Valley if the dump 
eventually is opened. 
</P>
<P>
 The perils of keeping nuclear waste on site instead of burying it in a 
licensed dump were underscored by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, which 
damaged storage facilities at three hospitals, according to Cathleen Kaufman, 
head of radiation management for the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports of contamination after the earthquake. But at 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the loss of storage space because of earthquake 
damage may put a crimp in medical research. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have put researchers on notice that after the first of the year they may 
find the use of radioactive materials restricted," said Donna Early, the 
hospital's director of radiation and environmental safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Early said that studies of drugs being developed to dissolve blood clots in 
heart patients already had been suspended because the hospital had no place to 
store contaminated tissue from laboratory animals. In the past, Early said, the 
hospital had shipped the tissue to a waste dump in Washington, which cut off 
California's access last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the South Carolina facility, the dump in Richland, Wash., is 
the only facility in the country that accepts low-level waste. The Washington 
dump, however, will only serve 11 western states.  
</P>
<P>
 The two dumps are classified as "low-level" to distinguish them from 
facilities designed to accept spent fuel rods and other debris from nuclear 
power plants contaminated with highly toxic, long-lasting substances such as 
plutonium that can remain dangerous for many thousands of years. But even 
low-level dumps can accept some long-lasting radioactive materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Ward Valley have contended that, given that longevity of some 
low-level materials and the porous nature of the underlying geology, highly 
toxic waste could leach into the Colorado River, about 20 miles away. Although 
the Ward Valley project has been licensed by the state, formidable obstacles 
remain before it can be built. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,000-acre dump site is owned by the federal government, and the Clinton 
Administration has indicated it will not transfer the land to the state until 
all safety issues have been resolved. In April, a Superior Court judge in Los 
Angeles ruled in a lawsuit brought to block the dump that state officials had 
not adequately responded to concerns about the possibility of Colorado River 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1980 law, California and other states assumed responsibility from the 
federal government for disposing of low-level nuclear waste. Regional compacts 
were formed with the idea that each would be served by existing dumps in 
Nevada, South Carolina and Washington or by one of four new ones, including 
Ward Valley, that were supposed to have been in operation by now. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the new dumps opened, the three states with existing dumps agreed to 
accept waste from states outside their compacts. Those arrangements, however, 
were not popular with public officials in the those states, who feared they 
would become permanent repositories for the nation's nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada subsequently closed its dump to all users.

HIGH-LEVEL CITY EMPLOYEE SUSPENDED IN FRAUD PROBE; WORKERS' COMP: INVESTIGATORS 
SAY MORE THAN $1 MILLION IN BENEFITS MAY HAVE BEEN PAID IMPROPERLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A high-level Los Angeles city employee has been suspended for allegedly 
defrauding the city of more than $1 million by funneling workers' compensation 
benefits to "ghost" employees and making improper payments to doctors and 
private investigators, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police this week searched the home and office of the suspect, whom authorities 
declined to identify. Sources at City Hall, however, identified her as Thelma 
Bowman, a senior supervisor in the city's Personnel Department who handled 
workers' compensation payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers found $50,000 in cash in her home safe, and she was carrying a loaded 
weapon when confronted at work by authorities, sources said. The Los Angeles 
Police Department's bunco-forgery section seized several boxes of evidence from 
Bowman's home and office, a police source said, but had not yet reviewed all 
the materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman, who has not been arrested, was put on administrative leave Thursday 
pending the completion of the investigation, officials said. She could not be 
reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are saddened at the thought that any city employee could possibly be 
involved in such an activity," said Faye Washington, the general manager of the 
Personnel Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation comes as city officials are scrutinizing the workers' 
compensation program. Payments have spiraled in recent years, reaching $71 
million in the last fiscal year. A private task force recommended major reform 
last month after finding that claims for workers' injuries often go unchecked 
before they are paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of abuse was discovered about a month ago when an internal city audit 
discovered more than 25 separate cases of fraud. The audit by the city's 
Peronnel Department was independent of the study by the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "As one suspicious payment was investigated, it led to others until we had 
amassed evidence of substantial questionable payments," Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman was monitored for a short time and then confronted with the 
information. She offered a "bumbling response," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation found that temporary disability payments were issued to 
nonexistent city employees over the past 18 months, Washington said. In 
addition, payments were made to doctors and private investigators without any 
record that they worked or that work was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly more than one individual has been involved in these questionable 
payment practices," Washington said. "Our investigation will continue into not 
only the specific actions of the one employee who has been placed on 
administrative leave, but also into the actions of any other individual who may 
be involved. We will be working closely with the Los Angeles Police Department 
to determine if there is sufficient evidence to warrant criminal prosecution 
and conviction of all participants." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington estimated the amount of fraudulent claims to be more than $1 
million. One City Hall source said the total could reach several million 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials reacted angrily to the allegations, with some demanding that 
any stolen money be returned to the city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this all is indeed true, I am outraged that anyone would take the public 
money that could be used for more police, libraries, graffiti removal and parks 
and recreation," Mayor Richard Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also praised Washington for ferreting out the alleged abuse. The mayor 
appointed her as head of the Personnel Department in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the private task force found that Los Angeles suffers a much 
higher rate of claims for workers' injuries than other cities and counties and 
does insufficient investigation before paying most of the demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by a group of attorneys, accountants, insurers and consultants was 
made at the behest of Riordan and City Atty. James K. Hahn. City policies are 
so in need of reform that some employees make more money on disability than 
they do if they work, the task force found. About $32 million could be saved on 
workers' compensation if the city's rate of claims was reduced to the national 
average, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't comment on the details of the case but I can assure the taxpayers 
that the (city) will spare no effort when it comes to uncovering and putting a 
stop to the kind of fraud that is alleged in this case," said Joe Gellman, 
president of the Civil Service Commission, the Riordan-appointed group that 
oversees the Personnel Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seriously hope that this will be a catalyst for serious workers' 
compensation reform," Gellman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last allegation of major fraud in City Hall involved a high-ranking 
official accused in 1992 of improperly authorizing as much as $88,000 in 
overtime pay for himself over a three-year period. The district attorney's 
office is deciding whether to file criminal charges.

TIMES MIRROR, COX PLAN NEW CABLE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a complex deal worth $2.3 billion, Times Mirror Co. is planning to spin off 
its cable television operations to form a new, publicly held company with 
Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of the two companies' cable units would create the nation's 
third-largest cable operator, with 3 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox would acquire the cable system by assuming about $1.4 billion worth of 
Times Mirror debt, and swapping about $900 million worth of privately held Cox 
shares, sources said. Analysts called the deal -- equivalent to about 11 1/2 
times the expected 1994 cash flow for Times Mirror's cable operations -- 
positive for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Times Mirror is getting a very good price and Cox is getting a very 
good system," said John Reidy, who follows the cable industry for Smith Barney 
Shearson in New York. "Times Mirror shareholders may well end up with (stock in 
two companies) which sell for more than today's one." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the deal could signal a new round of consolidation in the cable 
industry, driven by the massive technology investments required to compete with 
the telecommunications industry for control over the coming era of interactive 
communications. The move, analysts said, also points up the desire among cable 
operators to form regional clusters to better compete against local telephone 
companies. Tele-Communications Inc., the country's largest cable operator, and 
Viacom Inc., the 13th-largest operator, are said to be close to an agreement to 
combine their cable systems in San Francisco and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror stock closed up $4 on Friday, at $36 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. The company -- whose holdings include the Los Angeles Times and 
Newsday in New York as well as magazine and book publishing interests -- issued 
a statement confirming an "agreement in principle for the disposition of its 
cable television business to Cox Enterprises," but declined further comment on 
the continuing negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, first reported in USA Today on Friday, is expected to be finalized 
this weekend. Cox is expected to manage the company, but it was not immediately 
clear how big a stake Times Mirror shareholders would have. Sources said the 
Outdoor Channel, the first effort of Times Mirror's new cable programming 
division, would be guaranteed a spot on the new system's lineup. The cable 
programming arm will remain part of Times Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox's cable unit is the nation's sixth-largest cable company with 1.8 million 
subscribers, including systems in San Diego, southeastern Virginia and the New 
Orleans area. Times Mirror Cable is ranked 11th with 1.2 million cable 
subscribers, including systems in Phoenix, Orange County and suburban San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement also could mark the beginning of a trend in which media 
conglomerates move to separate information and entertainment divisions, such as 
those that produce newspapers and programming, from the delivery systems, at a 
time when each is taking on new roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the inverse of the Time Warner merger," said Jonathan Seybold, a 
Malibu-based new media analyst, referring to the largest media merger in 
history, in which movie, record and TV production was merged with cable and 
magazine operations. Time Warner is the nation's second-largest cable operator. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an age in which information, entertainment and advertising can be 
easily converted to digital formats and sent over delivery mechanisms ranging 
from the global computer web known as the Internet to wireless personal 
communications devices, some argue that it may make more sense for producers of 
such content to operate unfettered by the interests of any particular 
transmission system, and vice-versa.  
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror has been exploring delivery of its magazine and newspaper content 
via CD-ROM and the Prodigy on-line service, which could be viewed as 
competitive with cable delivery. Under the Cox-Times Mirror deal, Cox's cable 
systems would also apparently be spun off into the new entity. 
</P>
<P>
 Seybold added: "In the end a content company should be in the position of 
delivering its content over any and all delivery mechanisms, and a company that 
operates the pipelines and the servers should be offering the broadest possible 
content over its services." 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing consolidation of the cable industry was interrupted over the last 
year as cable and phone companies flirted with the idea of joining forces 
across industries to pay for the costly roll-out of the "information 
superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 But two such planned alliances -- Bell Atlantic's with Tele-Communications 
Inc. and Cox's with Southwestern Bell -- collapsed this year when the Federal 
Communications Commission slapped stiffer rate regulations on the cable 
industry and company stocks slipped precipitously.  
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Baby Bells appear to have decided to go it on their own, analysts 
say, consolidating resources within the cable industry is even more crucial. 
And with FCC Chairman Reed Hundt signaling at the national cable conference 
last month that the worst of his agency's actions were over, the regulatory 
environment appears more receptive to mergers of this kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the next several years the cable business is going to get more 
competitive, require bigger investments in technology, and become much more 
difficult to manage," said Melissa Cook, an analyst at Prudential Securities in 
New York. "Only the biggest companies have a chance of surviving."  
</P>
<P>
 In paying a healthy premium for Times Mirror's cable systems, Cox appears to 
be giving a vote of confidence to the industry, which has been rocked by rate 
rollbacks, climbing interest rates and the perception that the phone companies 
have the upper hand in the digital highway race. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox is not the first cable firm with which Times Mirror has explored forging 
an alliance. Last fall the firm appeared close to a deal with Boston-based 
Continental Cablevision, the third-ranked U.S. cable company. TCI, Comcast 
Cable and Century Cable have also expressed interest in partnering with Times 
Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror's cable unit accounted for 28% of the company's pretax profit 
year (after accounting for one-time charges), and 13% of its revenue. Earnings 
for the cable division came to $106.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that the managements of the two firms have several things in 
common -- each is dominated by family owners, each holds newspaper and cable 
properties and each recently sold TV stations. Cox has already launched an 
on-line version of its Atlanta Journal and Constitution on Prodigy, and Times 
Mirror executives have worked closely with their Cox counterparts to model 
their version of The Times on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 James Cox Kennedy, Cox's chairman, has been aggressively seeking opportunities 
to move the company into the interactive age. Times Mirror similarly has joined 
the multimedia fray with its recent acquisitions of software firms Allen 
Communication and Ehrlich Multimedia, and its stake in CD-ROM publisher Digital 
Pictures.

MEXICANS SCORN THEORY OF LONE COLOSIO KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lone gunman assassinated presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio in 
March, according to the special prosecutor's latest theory, which was roundly 
rejected by human rights activists, opposition politicians and ordinary 
Mexicans on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Thursday, special prosecutor Miguel Montes Garcia sharply backed away 
from the government's previously described view that a conspiracy was 
responsible for the death of Colosio, who was widely expected to be the next 
president of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recent investigations . . . strengthen the theory that the murder was 
committed by one man alone: Mario Aburto Martinez," Montes said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 It came three days after a special commission to investigate the assassination 
disbanded because the panel's five members said they could not gain access to 
needed information. A Mexican congressional committee, created to investigate 
the crime, has made similar complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 According to surveys, many Mexicans believe that the government is covering up 
a high-level conspiracy to assassinate Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Montes denied rumors that Aburto, who has been imprisoned 
while he awaits trial on charges connected with the assassination, is not the 
same suspect who was originally arrested. He also denied assertions that the 
one-inch difference in the size of the two bullet holes in Colosio's body 
indicates that the wounds were made by bullets of different calibers. 
</P>
<P>
 Montes did not say where Aburto obtained the gun he allegedly used in the 
assassination. He also did not discuss whether Aburto belonged to a political 
group, as relatives and friends have indicated. Nor did he mention a motive. 
</P>
<P>
 Montes' spokesman denied that the prosecutor's statement signaled the end of 
an investigation that has embarrassed the government and overshadowed the 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the latest development in the inquiry met with wide skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a joke," said Sergio Aguayo, chairman of the independent Mexican Human 
Rights Academy in the capital. "It is unacceptable, a public relations game. 
They play with us all the time. That's the problem with a totalitarian regime." 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Chavez, a 27-year-old news vendor, chalked up Montes' statement to 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government and the people want an answer before the (Aug. 21 
presidential) elections," he said. "Still, the majority of the public says it 
is a conspiracy, and this will make the public more demanding than ever of a 
satisfactory answer. They have to get to the bottom of this. It's not as simple 
as just going back to the original theory."  
</P>
<P>
 But Baja California Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel said the probe indeed appeared to 
have returned to square one, telling reporters Friday in Tijuana: "It seems 
that the information is concentrating on a scenario that existed in the first 
days of the investigation. The scenario is the same one that there was two 
months ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after Colosio's March 23 killing at a campaign rally in a 
working-class Tijuana neighborhood, police had portrayed the assassination as 
the act of a disturbed young man. But investigators shifted to a conspiracy 
theory after broadcasters aired a videotape that appeared to show another man 
clearing a path for Aburto toward Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely based on that tape and two other videotapes, three men have been 
imprisoned along with Aburto. They are awaiting trial as alleged accomplices in 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a lack of evidence, a judge dismissed charges against a fifth man, who 
had recruited the accused accomplices for crowd control at the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "To date, the investigation has not turned up new evidence that would 
strengthen (the material) used to jail Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas, Vicente 
Mayoral Valenzuela (and) Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer," Montes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Terrazas, the Mayorals' Tijuana lawyer, said he plans now to seek his 
clients' release. The charges against them were based on a hasty prosecution 
and thin evidence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jorge Mancillas, a UCLA professor and human rights activist who is acting 
as an adviser to the Aburto family, accused the Mexican government of trying to 
put an end to the Colosio case without a thorough investigation of the 
possibility of a high-level plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The signal from the Mexican government seems to be that they are not 
interested in shedding light on the circumstances surrounding the Colosio 
investigation," he said. "That is a slap in the face to the Mexican people. It 
is simply not credible." 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that the government was sending a broader message, "that 
political assassination is an acceptable method for dispute resolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto's strange behavior and prior contacts with suspicious people connected 
to the Colosio case, his family said, make them suspect that he was part of a 
wide-ranging plot. 
</P>
<P>
 His father has said that Aburto had spoken of attending mysterious political 
meetings in Tijuana with two of the suspects, the elder Mayoral and Sanchez, as 
well as two federal security agents who were investigated but not charged. 
Aburto's relatives believe that the guards and others were trying to draw the 
23-year-old factory worker into a plot in which he would be set up as a 
scapegoat, Mancillas said.

U.S. CONSULTS KEY ALLIES ON NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Clinton Administration began consultations Friday with key U.S. allies on 
imposing punitive sanctions against North Korea, but officials said the plan 
initially calls for only mild restrictions to avoid pushing Pyongyang into 
further isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for political-military 
affairs, met separately in Washington with South Korean and Japanese officials 
in preparation for a broader conference involving all three allies early this 
morning.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, senior Administration policy-makers traveling with President 
Clinton in Europe conferred privately with British, French and German 
counterparts. They also telephoned Chinese officials, whose support is 
considered crucial for approval of a sanctions resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton himself called South Korean President Kim Young Sam, who agreed on the 
broad U.S. strategy. The President also phoned Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin, rejecting a new Russian proposal to convene an international 
conference to discuss the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of activity marked the start of what is expected to be a complex 
effort to build a coalition in favor of some sort of sanctions -- by the middle 
of next week, officials hope, when the U.N. Security Council is scheduled to 
take up the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, briefed 
Security Council members on his agency's conclusion that Pyongyang has made it 
all but impossible for inspectors to determine whether it has diverted spent 
fuel to make nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, North Korea appealed for a new round of talks with the United 
States. But it was rebuffed by the Administration, which repeated its intention 
to pursue imposition of sanctions instead. Pyongyang also test-fired another 
anti-ship missile. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some initial signs that China might be easing its longstanding 
opposition to U.N. sanctions against North Korea -- possibly a result of 
Clinton's decision last week to continue special trade preferences for Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said China has seemed more cooperative in recent negotiations. Wire 
services said a government-controlled newspaper reported Friday that if an 
embargo were ordered, Beijing would halt food and oil supplies to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Both U.S. and foreign officials indicated that the discussions involving the 
Japanese and South Koreans were preliminary and did not result in decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really too early at this point," one insider said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Washington-based diplomats said the Administration is considering the 
possibility of pushing for relatively modest sanctions at first to avoid 
provoking Pyongyang into withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, 
which governs reactor inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pyongyang still does not yield, the allies would then press for a freeze on 
North Korea's financial transactions and, finally, for a cutoff of oil and food 
supplies -- the most drastic step in the proposed sanctions arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 One concession that Washington wants Pyongyang to make immediately is to allow 
international inspectors to take samplings and measurements at its two major 
radioactive waste sites -- an alternative to analyzing spent fuel rods in its 
reactor, which already has been emptied. 
</P>
<P>
 All sides conceded that pushing a sanctions resolution through the Security 
Council is likely to be difficult. Even Japan, which opposes North Korea's 
nuclear program, said it wants the United Nations to issue another warning 
before invoking sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Han Seung Soo, South Korea's ambassador to the United States, said in a 
telephone interview that the contents of the allies' proposed sanctions 
resolution could vary widely, "depending upon the reactions from China and 
Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 "China has repeatedly said they prefer dialogue," he said. "Unless we are 
assured that they will abstain from a Security Council resolution, it would be 
very difficult" to pass a formal proposal, even for gradual imposition of 
sanctions.

ELECTIONS; PROTESTERS TAKE AIM AT MEXICAN ROSTER; RULING PARTY'S CONGRESSIONAL 
CANDIDATES HAVE LITTLE POPULAR SUPPORT. SOME WORRY DISGRUNTLED ACTIVISTS WILL 
DEFECT IN THE AUGUST VOTE. 
</P>

 Bracing for a long throw, the young man in the print shirt drew his arm back 
and let fly an egg. The crowd behind him cheered as yolk splattered across the 
district offices of the Institutional Revolutionary Party that has ruled Mexico 
for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 No party faithful rushed out to stop the vandalism; the egg-thrower and his 
cheering section are party faithful. They were sullying their own headquarters 
to protest the selection of labor boss Carlos Aceves as candidate for federal 
deputy in their district. They supported a different local leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Mexico, grass-roots activists have blocked streets and roads, occupied 
party offices and resigned from the PRI, as the governing party is known, in 
protest over the congressional candidate roster for the Aug. 21 federal 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, party leaders pass off the protests as signs of healthy 
competition. But privately, some PRI members worry that disappointed 
rank-and-file activists may stay away from the polls in protest or even vote 
for the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Face it," one longtime party member said. "They picked some really bad 
candidates this time." In too many districts, he said, candidates have 
influence inside the PRI because of their ties to labor unions, farm groups and 
party leaders, but they have little popular recognition, much less support. 
Getting them elected will be tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the quality of the candidates, the protests reflect conflicts over the 
selection process and the PRI's identity as a party. Traditionally, the PRI is 
made up of three groups: labor unions, peasant farmers and a nebulous "popular 
sector." The party also has a parallel regional structure of municipal- and 
state-level activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate selection is a power struggle among those groups. The popular sector 
and regional groups press for a more openly democratic selection process that 
favors local leaders who will represent each district's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Unions and farmers press for their quotas of congressional seats to look after 
their interests. Those seats are usually assigned by the party leadership, 
often ignoring the wishes of grass-roots activists. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, dozens of those activists refused to be ignored. Breaking party 
discipline, those "natural leaders," as they called themselves, registered 
their candidacies at party headquarters, even though they had not received the 
nod from higher-ups. That forced a vote at their local conventions instead of 
the usual selection by unanimous acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting union and farm candidates approved by local convention delegates in 
the face of competition required fancy footwork in some cases. A lexicon of 
dirty tricks that has grown up around election fraud came into play. 
</P>
<P>
 There is "the crazy mouse," changing the location of a convention at the last 
minute without advising delegates; madruguete , changing the time; and acarreo 
, bringing in outsiders to vote as delegates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican newspapers published accusations of -- and in some cases documented -- 
the use of each of those tricks during local party conventions this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Some grass-roots activists tried preemptive strikes, such as taking over party 
offices. After the egg-throwing did not persuade party leaders that they were 
serious, members of the Independent Popular Organization invaded district 
headquarters to prevent the local convention. 
</P>
<P>
 As pressure grew, some labor candidates stepped down in favor of local 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Party leaders tried to calm protests by offering disappointed candidates 
congressional seats as party representatives -- offices that are distributed 
after the election based on the percentage of votes each party receives. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many, consolation prizes were not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Emilio Serrano, president of the Neighbors Committee of Iztacalco, a Mexico 
City borough, resigned from the PRI after losing the party nomination for city 
assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other parties have offered me a candidacy, particularly the PRD," he 
explained, referring to the Democratic Revolutionary Party, whose leadership 
includes former PRI activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano may be disappointed with that party as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us can be completely happy with the way our candidates were chosen," 
PRD Chairman Porfirio Munoz Ledo acknowledged at a swearing-in ceremony for 
those candidates. He proposed "re-founding" the party to better ensure respect 
for democratic ideals.

LABOR; ISRAELI SOCIAL WORKERS' STRIKE HAS STATE SAFETY NET IN TATTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For six weeks, Israeli women have not been able, except in a few emergencies, 
to get the official approval required for abortions. Cases of suspected child 
abuse have gone largely uninvestigated. Judges have been unable to decide child 
custody in divorces. And the elderly have not been able to get home health 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's extensive social safety net, in short, has all but disappeared with a 
strike by the country's 9,500 social workers and the government's refusal to 
pay the cost of restoring their services -- a virtual doubling of their 
poverty-line salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job is to help people at the most difficult times of their lives, and we 
are not there," said Nehama Feder, deputy director of social services at a 
Jerusalem hospital. She spoke with the clear pain of seeing the people she 
wants to help being hurt in the social workers' struggle for a decent wage. 
</P>
<P>
 "For society, the line of defense that protects abused children and battered 
wives, that rehabilitates drug addicts, that comforts the victims of terrorism 
is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 For those directly affected, the strike -- in its 45th day as negotiators on 
both sides press for a settlement this weekend -- has added greatly to their 
private traumas: 
</P>
<P>
 * A woman, 43, discovered in her 20th week of pregnancy that she was carrying 
a baby with Down's syndrome and applied for an abortion. But no social worker 
was available for the panel that, under Israeli law, had to approve the 
operation and had to have a social worker on it. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 12-year-old girl telephoned her caseworker to complain that her father was 
sexually abusing her again, but all the social worker could do was call the 
girl's school counselor. Normally, the social worker would interview the girl, 
bring in the police and obtain court orders to protect her. 
</P>
<P>
 * An elderly widower, recovering from a heart attack, has been kept in a Tel 
Aviv hospital for an additional month, not permitted by physicians to return 
home until he can have regular care there. The social workers who must 
authorize home care, and would do so routinely, are on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken cumulatively, the social workers' caseload could prove tragic if left 
unattended much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers regularly check on the well-being of about 1,600 children who 
have suffered abuse in their homes or who have been abandoned by their 
families. By law, only social workers can interview children in cases of 
domestic violence and sexual abuse. Social workers must make recommendations on 
all adoptions and child custody cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "This cries out to the heavens, (but) I have the feeling that no one cares," 
said Yitzhak Kadman, general manager of the Israel Council for Children's 
Welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Ora Namir, minister of labor and social affairs and a social worker by 
profession, ordered 70 strikers back to work to deal with urgent cases, and the 
Cabinet has authorized her to bring 710 more back under emergency regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait any longer and take responsibility for the damage being done to 
the needy," Namir said, recounting how she had intervened personally in dozens 
of cases, some of which "could have ended in murder." 
</P>
<P>
 The strikers' grievance is low pay. A starting social worker is paid $623 a 
month -- including a welfare supplement of more than $200 to bring the salary 
above Israel's minimum wage of $500 a month. After 17 years, a social worker 
gets $900 a month. Israeli professionals with similar training in psychology or 
sociology earn about $335 more a month at most levels than do social workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers fell behind in wages because of poor union leadership -- and 
the fact that 87% of social workers are women, whose salaries are regarded as 
supplemental family income. 
</P>
<P>
 The social workers, who have been without a contract for 17 months, initially 
demanded an across-the-board pay increase to $965, more than doubling most 
salaries. The current demand is for $635 a month, effective immediately. The 
government is offering a raise to $535, but spread over nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law has given us tremendous responsibility for individuals and for 
society," said Esther Sapira, chief of a social work team in Jerusalem. "To do 
that, we must be paid decently." 
</P>
<P>
 Times researcher Emily L. Hauser in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

HE STILL FEELS SUFFERING OF WWII, EMPEROR SAYS; JAPAN: BUT AKIHITO EVADES 
QUESTIONS ON RESPONSIBILITY OF HIS FATHER, HIROHITO, FOR 1941 ATTACK ON PEARL 
HARBOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Emperor Akihito evaded questions Friday about the "war responsibility" of his 
father, the late Emperor Hirohito, and whether Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor 
in 1941 was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a scripted news conference, he said that an awareness of "the lives 
that were lost, the wounds that were inflicted, the feelings of those who 
suffered anguish never disappears from my heart, however many years and months 
pass." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement referred to the war that Japan began in China in 1931, expanded 
into World War II with its attack on Pearl Harbor and ended, as the emperor put 
it, "many years and months ago" in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 He repeated the same thought in partial reply to both of the questions that 
remain sensitive in a country still divided over whether its old record of 
colonialism and invasion constitute aggression or not. Just last month, a 
Cabinet minister was ousted for disclaiming World War II aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Harbor, originally included in an itinerary for a 17-day imperial tour 
of 11 U.S. cities that will begin next Friday, was dropped from the schedule 
because of fears of stirring political controversy in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 As to whether the surprise attack was justified "considering the situation in 
1941," the emperor said that "understanding correctly historical facts is very 
important. But in my position, I would like to refrain from commenting on this 
kind of problem." 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Emperor Hirohito, he added, "treated peace more importantly than 
anything" but "acted by obeying the constitution. I imagine he endured many 
hardships." 
</P>
<P>
 Hirohito declared in 1971 that he had always acted as "a constitutional 
monarch," obeying decisions of the country's political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the name of Hirohito, who died in 1989 after a reign of 62 years, 
that Japan declared war on the United States shortly after its bombers raided 
Pearl Harbor. And it was in his name that Japan agreed to "bear the unbearable" 
in surrender four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Akihito, who was 8 years old when Pearl Harbor was attacked, will lay wreaths 
at Arlington National Cemetery in Washington and at the Punch Bowl Cemetery in 
Honolulu. He will visit Los Angeles on June 20-22. 
</P>
<P>
 The emperor, 60, said his wife, who collapsed on her 59th birthday Oct. 20 and 
lost the ability to speak, has not recovered completely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her voice is still very weak and she gets rather tired when speaking," he 
said. "I am worried about her because of the busy schedule in the United States 
and the burden it will impose upon her." 
</P>
<P>
 He indicated that she had remained stricken until about a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Empress Michiko said that "at first, it was all I could do just to accept the 
fact of losing the ability to speak. My uneasiness and sadness became bigger 
day by day until I almost lost hope for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pondering on the meaning of suffering, I realized that I had always wished to 
act gently, but my heart, weary and sad at the time I became ill, had become 
hard and brittle, for which I now blame myself," she added in apology to "the 
many people who treated me warmly." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband and her daughter, Sayako, helped "immensely" by continuing daily 
life with her as if nothing had happened, she said. She also said she underwent 
training to recover the ability to conceive thoughts, pronounce words and 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot say I have absolutely no unease in making this trip with its long 
schedule," Michiko confessed in a voice so soft it often became inaudible. "But 
I will do my best to take care of myself and perform my duties." 
</P>
<P>
 Like almost all of the imperial couple's appearances, the news conference was 
scripted from start to finish. Reporters read questions submitted earlier, and 
though neither Akihito nor Michiko held any notes, both gave what appeared to 
be memorized answers. 
</P>
<P>
 One reply did break the tone of studied tact. Asked by American reporters what 
concerns she has about her own country, Michiko appeared to criticize Japan for 
having only a passive desire for peace, for indulging in decadence and for 
losing its traditional value of courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace is not merely the passive condition of not being at war but rather an 
earnest desire and a strong will to continue the state of peace. . . . Wisdom 
and effort are necessary to realize this," she said, adding: "It would be a 
source of joy if the thinking and the culture of the people should be directed 
not toward decadence but to a higher level of strength and refinement and if we 
Japanese could always preserve a sense of modesty, respecting other people and 
other nations." 
</P>
<P>
 Michiko urged the Japanese people to "build up a national character which 
respects a code of courtesy, whether among ourselves or toward people of other 
nations."

THE WAYS AND MEANS CHIEF OF KOSTKAVILLE; POLITICS: IT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS 
THAT 'DANNY' ROSTENKOWSKI DOES FOR THE 5TH DISTRICT THAT MAKE HIS NEIGHBORHOOD 
SO LOYAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the sun-swept streets of Kostkaville, on sandlot ball fields and in the 
pews of cavernous limestone churches, there is no confusing the plight of the 
neighborhood congressman with the fate of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Named after a Polish saint, this grid of row houses is the heart of Rep. Dan 
Rostenkowski's home base, a place where the embattled House Ways and Means 
chairman matters more for the little things he does than for his legendary 
Washington clout. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the little things -- toasters and appliances for the sisters of St. 
Stanislaus Kostka, park fees for fast-pitch softball teams, a lucrative 
fund-raiser for the Polish Museum of America -- that many of Rostenkowski's 
constituents fear they will miss most if he is convicted after 17 federal 
criminal charges were leveled against him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a guy who's always giving back to the community," said Kelly Torres, 
a city supervisor at Pulaski Park, a square-block field across the street from 
Rostenkowski's home. "He helps people around here in a thousand different ways. 
Nobody wants to see him go." 
</P>
<P>
 His prominence atop the committee overseeing the nation's tax laws had helped 
Rostenkowski become Congress' leading earner of honorariums, the fees that 
legislators earn for making personal appearances before lobbyists and special 
interest groups. Last year, Rostenkowski made $80,500 in honorariums. Under 
federal law, the fees must go to charity, providing Rostenkowski with ample 
amounts to donate to pet causes ranging from orphanages to hot dog lunches for 
neighborhood children. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who rely on his speaking engagements and on excess funds from his 
campaign coffers are, predictably, among his most ardent loyalists. They talk 
protectively of his generous nature -- a side of Rostenkowski they insist the 
outside world rarely sees. And they worry that any successor might sorely lack 
his human touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "People realize that if we lose him, we lose something special," said the Rev. 
Joseph Glab, priest at St. Stanislaus Kostka, Rostenkowski's home church. "He 
has a real connection with people in this neighborhood. A city is only as 
important as its neighborhoods, and he's part of ours." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Rostenkowski who quietly wrote a check to the church's nuns after he 
learned in a conversation with Glab that the appliances in their convent had 
fallen into disrepair. And it was Rostenkowski who made the largest donation 
six years ago to a $140,000 renovation campaign to repair the church's bell 
tower, electric system and scarred interior. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski has chipped in for trophies and park fees for neighborhood Little 
League teams and bought uniforms for the Deadmen, an amateur football club. A 
contribution from his campaign funds paid for a Polish Constitution Day 
performance by the Li'l Richard Polka Band -- who thanked him by playing "The 
Danny Rostenkowski Polka." 
</P>
<P>
 When the sons and daughters of Kostkaville's Polish American and Mexican 
immigrant families crowded Pulaski Park for a cleanup campaign, "Danny even 
paid for the hots dogs and chips," Torres said. "He just did it out of the 
goodness of his heart." 
</P>
<P>
 There are times when goodness has little to do with altruism and much to do 
with the unspoken quid pro quo of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Janowski, the curator of the Polish Museum of America, is grateful for 
Rostenkowski's occasional contributions. But she appreciates even more the 
donations that have come in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rostenkowski was awarded the Polish Spirit Award at the museum's annual 
Summer Ball in June, 1992, his presence brought the museum $85,000 in donations 
-- more than four times what it normally brings in for the event, Janowski 
said. Among the contributors were lobbying and commercial giants, such as the 
Philip Morris Co. ($5,000), the Sara Lee Corp. ($5,000) and the National Food 
Processors Assn. ($2,000). 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Rostenkowski was described by a federal indictment as a politician who 
lined his pockets with money siphoned from the paychecks of ghost employees, 
many of his beneficiaries in the 5th Congressional District said it is his 
reluctance to ask for favors that made him a beloved figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not flamboyant about helping," Glab said. "He just asks if you need 
anything, and if you mention it, he does what he can. He gives again and again, 
and never with any ulterior motive." 
</P>
<P>
 But others in his district concede that Rostenkowski calls in old favors from 
those he has helped with his charity. In the furious final days of March's 
Democratic primary, Rostenkowski's aides boasted that his extensive network of 
prominent friends helped dispel the stigma of corruption that hampered his 
reelection bid against two Democratic Party challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski was praised in letters written on behalf of his campaign by the 
Rev. James Close, director of the the Mercy Home for Boys and Girls, a 
well-known local orphanage; and by the Rev. John Smyth, head of the Maryville 
City of Youth, a Catholic academy. Rostenkowski had aided both organizations in 
the past.

U.S. CONSULTS KEY ALLIES ON NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS

 The Clinton Administration began consultations Friday with key U.S. allies on 
imposing punitive sanctions against North Korea, but officials said the plan 
initially calls for only mild restrictions to avoid pushing Pyongyang into 
further isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for political-military 
affairs, met separately in Washington with South Korean and Japanese officials 
in preparation for a broader conference involving all three allies early this 
morning.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, senior Administration policy-makers traveling with President 
Clinton in Europe conferred privately with British, French and German 
counterparts. They also telephoned Chinese officials, whose support is 
considered crucial for approval of a sanctions resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton himself called South Korean President Kim Young Sam, who agreed on the 
broad U.S. strategy. The President also phoned Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin, rejecting a new Russian proposal to convene an international 
conference to discuss the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of activity marked the start of what is expected to be a complex 
effort to build a coalition in favor of some sort of sanctions -- by the middle 
of next week, officials hope, when the U.N. Security Council is scheduled to 
take up the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, briefed 
Security Council members on his agency's conclusion that Pyongyang has made it 
all but impossible for inspectors to determine whether it has diverted spent 
fuel to make nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, North Korea appealed for a new round of talks with the United 
States. But it was rebuffed by the Administration, which repeated its intention 
to pursue imposition of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some initial signs that China might be easing its longstanding 
opposition to U.N. sanctions against North Korea -- possibly a result of 
Clinton's decision last week to continue special trade preferences for Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said China has seemed more cooperative in recent negotiations. Wire 
services said a government-controlled newspaper reported Friday that if an 
embargo were ordered, Beijing would halt food and oil supplies to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 But Washington-based diplomats said the Administration is considering the 
possibility of pushing for relatively modest sanctions at first to avoid 
provoking Pyongyang into withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, 
which governs reactor inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pyongyang still does not yield, the allies would then press for a freeze on 
North Korea's financial transactions and, finally, for a cutoff of oil and food 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 One concession that Washington wants Pyongyang to make immediately is to allow 
international inspectors to take samplings and measurements at its two major 
radioactive waste sites -- an alternative to analyzing spent fuel rods in its 
reactor, which already has been emptied. 
</P>
<P>
 All sides conceded that pushing a sanctions resolution through the Security 
Council is likely to be difficult. Even Japan, which opposes North Korea's 
nuclear program, said it wants the United Nations to issue another warning 
before invoking sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallucci told reporters that the United States would "not be intimidated" by 
Pyongyang's warnings that it would regard any imposition of sanctions as an act 
of war.

KOREAN NUCLEAR INSPECTIONS: ELEMENTS OF CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea has vaulted onto front pages as Pyongyang and Washington argue 
about a difficult issue -- nuclear proliferation. In brief, does the North have 
nuclear weapons or doesn't it? And if it has, what dangers does that pose to 
South Korea, the region and the world? Here are the key elements in this 
controversy: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Why are the United States and North Korea at odds? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The United States suspects that North Korea has acquired nuclear 
weapons. But Pyongyang won't allow international inspectors to test its reactor 
and other nuclear plants so they can tell for sure. Under the international 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Pyongyang is obliged to allow inspectors to 
do their work. It hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Does North Korea actually have nuclear weapons now? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No one really knows. The CIA believes that Pyongyang probably has processed 
enough plutonium to manufacture at least one nuclear bomb and may well have one 
or two more such weapons in its arsenal. North Korea denies having any nuclear 
weapons and has not tested any. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why should anyone care whether Pyongyang has a nuclear arsenal? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Two reasons: First, North Korea would be able to use its nuclear weapons to 
threaten South Korea, Taiwan and Japan -- intensifying pressures in the entire 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Pyongyang could also sell nuclear bombs to other countries, such as 
Iraq, Iran, Libya and Syria -- as it has in the case of missiles and other 
weapons. And if North Korea had a bomb, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan would 
probably push to acquire their own nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What is the International Atomic Energy Agency and why does it have any 
business in North Korea? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The IAEA is a U.N.-related organization set up to serve as a clearinghouse 
and inspection agency to help administer the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
Based in Vienna, it has a staff of about 100 bureaucrats and nuclear scientists 
to help carry out this task. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are nuclear fuel rods and why are they so important? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Fuel for a nuclear reactor is shaped into thousands of rods, which are 
inserted into the reactor's core. In North Korea's case, the fuel is unenriched 
uranium -- a cheap material from its own mines. The problem is that it is easy 
to turn unenriched uranium into weapons-grade plutonium-239 -- the material 
needed for nuclear weapons. This is done by removing used fuel rods from a 
reactor and extracting the plutonium during reprocessing. The reactor core at 
Yongbyon holds seven to 10 tons of fuel -- enough to provide plutonium for four 
or five nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How can IAEA inspectors use the used fuel rods to determine whether a 
country such as North Korea is diverting its spent fuel to make nuclear bombs? 
</P>
<P>
 A. They analyze the fuel to see how much radioactive waste and contamination 
they contain, which tells them how old the fuel is and, therefore, how recently 
the North Koreans replaced their spent fuel. That, in turn, can help them tell 
whether fuel has been reprocessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What brought on the current crisis? 
</P>
<P>
 A. North Korea decided abruptly two weeks ago to shut down its reactor and 
begin removing fuel rods -- leaving IAEA inspectors high and dry. IAEA 
officials believed that they had a few more months to negotiate over inspection 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The shutdown meant they had to act quickly or they would lose the chance to 
analyze the spent rods completely and tell for sure whether Pyongyang has been 
making nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 IAEA inspectors visited the Yongbyon reactor, but were denied access to the 
materials and records they needed. To compound the problem, the North Koreans 
removed the spent fuel rods so rapidly that the IAEA inspectors were unable to 
complete their work in time. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, while the IAEA has confirmed that North Korea is not diverting 
spent fuel now for use in nuclear weapons, it could not tell whether the 
Koreans did so in 1989 -- the last time the reactor was shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the key point in determining whether Pyongyang actually has nuclear 
weapons. Since the United States had warned repeatedly that that would be the 
crunch-point in its dealings with North Korea, the Administration has begun a 
push to get the U.N. Security Council to impose punitive economic sanctions 
against Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How likely is it that the Administration will succeed in persuading the 
Security Council to impose sanctions? 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's unclear. Although the Western allies generally agree that it is time 
to crack down on North Korea, China and Russia -- two of five permanent members 
of the Security Council that have power to veto a sanctions resolution -- say 
they still are not ready to support sanctions. The Administration is trying to 
work out a compromise. But it may have to settle for gradual imposition of 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington also faces resistance from South Korea and Japan, both of which 
fear that imposing sanctions on North Korea might spur Pyongyang into military 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What impact would imposing sanctions have? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Proponents say that imposing sanctions would squeeze North Korea 
economically and might force the regime of longtime leader Kim Il Sung to halt 
its nuclear program. The North Korean economy already is in dire straits. Food 
is at a premium. And fuel supplies are short. 
</P>
<P>
 Others -- mainly the Russians and Chinese -- argue that tightening the noose 
now will only make the regime more desperate and force it to become even more 
recalcitrant. There also is some question -- even among Western economists -- 
about how effective sanctions would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Would the United States be ready to intervene militarily if the situation 
got worse? And who would be the winner of such a conflict? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Presumably it would. The Clinton Administration has pledged to protect 
South Korea. The United States has 37,000 troops in the country. But the United 
States would only act in defense -- that is, North Korea would have to be 
preparing to launch an attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and South Korea have the firepower and troops ultimately to 
win a war with the North. But the allies would suffer heavy casualties. And 
North Korea is capable of doing extensive damage to Seoul, which is only a few 
miles from the border.

REGIME CLAMPS LID ON BEIJING ON ANNIVERSARY

<TEXT>
<P>
 China's Communist leaders, aided by a convenient state visit by Cambodia's 
King Norodom Sihanouk, slammed a tight lid on Beijing on Friday's fifth 
anniversary of the 1989 Tian An Men Square crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The capital's campus district, birthplace of the 1989 pro-democracy movement 
that sent millions into the streets of Beijing and other cities, was under a 
major security lock-down to keep fading memories from spilling into renewed 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Tian An Men Square, where tanks and troops killed unarmed demonstrators five 
years ago, was awash with flags and security personnel to mark Sihanouk's visit 
and snuff out any possible foolhardy attempts at commemoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Honor guard guns boomed over the vast concrete expanse at the heart of Beijing 
as Sihanouk, who visits the city so often he has a residence here, laid a 
wreath at the Monument to the People's Heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 The square remained open after nightfall, but crowds were thin and there was 
no sign of unusual activity.

WAVES SPAWNED BY QUAKE KILL 171 INDONESIA VILLAGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty- foot waves caused by a strong earthquake crashed ashore on sleeping 
coastal villages on Indonesia's main island of Java early Friday. At least 171 
people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 people were injured and 43 were reported missing, said a 
meteorological official, Johannes Tasar. At least 413 houses and 245 fishing 
boats were swallowed by the raging waters in eastern Java, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-dawn quake caused no casualties or heavy damage. But the seismic sea 
waves that followed about an hour later roared a third of a mile inland, 
sweeping away homes and the people sleeping inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Pesanngerahan, a poor fishing community, was hit hardest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all started with the rising high tide -- this is normal," said Slamet, a 
fisherman who, like most Indonesians, uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the waters began to reach their homes, and before they could realize 
something was wrong, the looming, rising waters swept them away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joko, a teen-ager from the same village who managed to escape to high ground, 
said he watched the waters wash away his home and his neighbors' homes. His 
baby sister was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was calling for help," he said. "Then I realized something was 
wrong. My father and mother did not have time to save my baby sister because 
the waters were suddenly rising very fast in our home." 
</P>
<P>
 The tidal waves struck a scenically beautiful corner of Java, separated by a 
strait from the resort island of Bali. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of foreign tourists visiting from Bali for surfing and water-skiing 
narrowly escaped as a tidal wave missed their beach huts at Plengkung, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear whether the waves also hit the west coast of 
Bali. Most of the tourist resorts are in the south and north of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Java is located in the center of the Indonesian archipelago, an area that has 
been hit repeatedly by earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, a quake on Sumatra, a major island northwest of Java, killed at 
least 217 people. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1992, an earthquake with a surface-wave magnitude of 7.5 killed 
at least 2,500 people and destroyed thousands of buildings on Flores island, 
950 miles southeast of Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's quake had a surface-wave magnitude of 7.2, according to the U.S. 
Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. Surface-wave magnitude is based on an 
analysis of seismic waves that travel along the Earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake was centered 18 miles beneath the Indian Ocean, 140 miles south of 
the eastern Java city of Malang and 577 miles southeast of Jakarta, officials 
said.

LATEST TAIWAN BRAWL GETS FEMALE TOUCH

<TEXT>
<P>
 Female lawmakers went after each other in Parliament Friday in a 
face-slapping, hair-pulling free-for-all. 
</P>
<P>
 The brawl was just the latest in a National Assembly known for its raucous 
sessions. Friday's tussle was provoked when two members of the ruling 
Nationalist Party poked fun at opposition lawmaker Su Chih-yang for propping up 
her legs on a desk and letting her underwear show. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a woman you should also watch your own behavior," Nationalist 
Assemblywoman Kuo Su-chun berated Su. 
</P>
<P>
 Su then walked to the podium and slapped Kuo in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other women then began pulling and pushing each other. A fifth collapsed 
and was hospitalized with high blood pressure after she tried to stop the 
fight.

NEWS ANALYSIS; RWANDA REFLECTS CHANGES IN AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAMB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For two months, the world has looked on with horror at the genocidal killing 
in Rwanda. But, in testimony to the limits of outsiders' power, no 
international effort has been able to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enough of this blood," pleaded Pope John Paul II, and from Washington and 
London to the capitals of Africa, similar calls have echoed across the bloodied 
Rwandan countryside. But they have stopped not a bullet nor saved a life. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the Rwandan Patriotic Front closing in Friday on Gitarama -- seat of 
the interim government -- and battling a defiant but crumbling army in the 
capital, Kigali, a rebel victory seems increasingly likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Most human rights groups -- even those with no particular affinity for the 
rebels -- would welcome such a victory as the fastest way to stop the appalling 
massacre of civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kigali falls, it will join Kampala, Uganda, in 1978, and Addis Ababa, 
Ethiopia, and Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1991, as the only African capitals in 
recent times to succumb to a rebel army. 
</P>
<P>
 Kigali's collapse will be a reminder of how much has changed in Africa since 
the not-so-distant days when European powers were willing to rush in troops to 
prop up their former colonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain always stood ready to guarantee the stability of Kenya and still 
conducts military exercises here. France used troops at least a dozen times to 
stave off coups in its former African colonies; a decade ago, Paris might well 
have sent combatants into French-speaking Rwanda, whose military France armed 
and advised. 
</P>
<P>
 As often as not, the mere landing of European troops in Africa was sufficient 
to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Rwanda the world has done little more than shed a tear and shrug 
helplessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda's two former colonial masters, Germany and Belgium, have declined a 
U.N. request for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three African nations -- Ethiopia, Senegal and Ghana -- have agreed to 
participate in an African peacekeeping force for Rwanda. But their offer of 
2,100 troops fell far short of the 5,500 soldiers that the United Nations 
requested, and it was never clear who would pay for the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 What is apparent from the world's reluctance to enter Rwanda, Western 
diplomats say, is that governments realize that there is little they can do 
militarily to pacify dedicated, warring factions unless they are willing to 
bring to bear the full power of their guns. In Somalia, they weren't; the 
lesson was a painful one. 
</P>
<P>
 Somalia started as a humanitarian mission, just as any effort in Rwanda would. 
But when, inch by inch, the peacekeepers' military resolve was tested -- as it 
surely would be in Rwanda -- the U.N. response was at first confused and timid. 
</P>
<P>
 The more undefined the response became, the bolder the belligerents grew, 
until, in the end, they came to understand that none of the governments in the 
peacekeeping force had national interests they were willing to stand and fight 
for in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 The same scenario could be repeated in Rwanda, the most destitute of African 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the world will remain morally haunted by its passivity, the fact is 
that politically, economically and militarily, Rwanda is a country that holds 
importance for not a single nation, except perhaps for neighboring Burundi. 
</P>
<P>
 With peace talks between the rebels and the army having broken off in Kigali 
on Thursday and no future sessions planned, that leaves the international 
community to hope that one side or the other will achieve military dominance, 
thus ending the slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the predominantly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front defeats the 
Hutu-controlled army, African observers are less than confident that Rwanda's 
troubles will be over. 
</P>
<P>
 These observers debate whether 63 years of peaceful colonialism created 
Rwanda's problems or merely contained longstanding animosities. But they agree 
that, since independence in 1962, neither group has shown itself willing to 
accept anything less than domination over the other.

BURUNDI TEETERS BETWEEN PEACE, RENEWED KILLING; AFRICA: UNLIKE IN NEARBY 
RWANDA, THE TUTSI MINORITY CONTROLS THE ARMY. PEOPLE SAY THAT IS WHAT HAS SAVED 
THEM FROM A NEW ROUND OF SLAUGHTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All but forgotten by the world, this nation hangs in nerve-racking suspension, 
balanced between forces that dare pray for conciliation and those who would 
turn this troubled land into another Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 The slightest misstep could tip the balance. And after a year in which Burundi 
witnessed its first free elections, the murder of two of its presidents and a 
massacre that claimed as many as 100,000 lives, the specter of uncontrolled 
slaughter in a neighboring land is very real, very chilling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rwanda is terrifying and terrible," said Venerand Bakevyumusaya, Burundi's 
minister of labor. "One would think it would have taught us to avoid that kind 
of madness, but there is a very real danger that what happened there could 
happen here. The calm you see here now is not a reassuring calm." 
</P>
<P>
 In colonial times, the two countries were governed first by Germany, then 
Belgium, as part of a single territory known as Ruanda-Urundi. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Rwanda, the Tutsis here are a minority, making up 15% of Burundi's 6 
million people. But unlike in Rwanda, the Tutsis still control the army, and 
that, people here say, is what has spared them from genocide. 
</P>
<P>
 The deep mistrust between the Tutsis and Hutus in Burundi, combined with fears 
that chaos in Rwanda could inflame extremists on both sides here, has filled 
this ramshackle capital with anxiety and a well-founded xenophobia. 
</P>
<P>
 The countdown is under way, but no one knows if it is toward war or peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Expatriates have started talking in code -- using the word trees for the tall 
Tutsis and bushes for the shorter Hutus -- to protect conversations from 
eavesdroppers. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Embassy, like other foreign missions, has sent dependents home and 
cut back to a skeleton staff of six officers. Business has slowed. For months, 
there have been no tourists heading for the game parks or the source of the 
Nile River. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhoods where Tutsis and Hutus once lived side by side and often 
intermarried have become largely segregated -- voluntarily -- after violent 
clashes in Bujumbura over the winter and into the spring. Victims hacked to 
death were almost always Tutsis; those killed by bullets were Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very uneasy feeling," said a Tutsi businessman, "because you pass 
someone on the street and he smiles at you. But you wonder if, in his heart, he 
has thoughts of killing you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, only last June, Burundi was being hailed as a model of democratic 
reform in Africa. Its president, Col. Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi, was soundly 
defeated by the civilian Hutu candidate, Melchior Ndadaye, in the country's 
first free elections. And, much to everyone's surprise, Buyoya agreed to honor 
the results. Ndadaye pledged a new era in human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, in October, Ndadaye was spirited away one night to an army 
camp where he was beaten, stabbed and strangled. The vice president and several 
other senior government officials were also killed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a response that drew little attention in the world, Hutu mobs throughout 
the countryside hunted down and killed as many as 100,000 Tutsis. The Hutus 
called the massacre a preemptive strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after the assassination, Foreign Minister Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, 
a Hutu and the de facto head of government, summoned Bujumbura's tiny 
diplomatic corps, which includes North Korea and Russia as a holdover from Cold 
War days. 
</P>
<P>
 The diplomats pleaded with Ntibantunganya -- whose wife had been killed in the 
blood-letting and who himself had barely managed to escape with his life -- to 
denounce the killings and to act to end the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ntibantunganya was unmoved," said an envoy at the meeting. He told the 
diplomats that they were asking for something he could not do. 
</P>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II's representative at the meeting wept. 
</P>
<P>
 The assassination apparently convinced Hutu extremists that even though they 
had won political power via elections -- including 80% of the seats in 
Parliament and 60% of the Cabinet posts -- real power would not be theirs until 
they controlled the guns. 
</P>
<P>
 In clandestine fashion, they began arming civilians with South African weapons 
slipped into the country from Rwanda via Zaire. The shipments gave rise to a 
rebel army, created, ironically enough, by a government wanting to protect 
itself from its own institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Tutsis took to the streets in Bujumbura on April 6 to dance and 
march in celebration when the Hutu presidents of Burundi and Rwanda -- Cyprian 
Ntaryamira and Juvenal Habyarimana, respectively -- were killed in Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash of their plane, which had been hit by a rocket, unleashed an orgy of 
massacres in Rwanda. To date, aid workers estimate the blood-letting has 
claimed 200,000 to 500,000 lives. 
</P>

AN ARISTIDE REDUX SPARKS FEAR IN HAITI; CARIBBEAN: EXPERTS SEE DUPLICITY BY 
OUSTED LEADER. 'IT'S THE SAME OLD THING,' A DIPLOMATIC OBSERVER SAYS. 
</P>

 The generals still give the orders, and their gunmen still rule the streets. 
But as diplomats and Haitians look to scenarios for the future, the vision 
isn't pretty -- especially, they say, if the United States succeeds in 
restoring President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every Haitian expert and most foreign sources interviewed over a week's 
time agreed that, as one leading businessman put it, "there is no other option 
to the (U.S.) military option" to put Aristide back in office more than 32 
months after he was driven into exile by the Haitian army. 
</P>
<P>
 This conviction has been strengthened by Aristide's statements this week 
giving qualified approval to a limited U.S. military strike to remove Haiti's 
ruling army officers. 
</P>
<P>
 With the prospect that the deposed leader might somehow be back, sources -- 
all of whom opposed the September, 1991, coup and have worked to end military 
rule -- are showing signs of great caution, if not outright fear, of an 
Aristide government. 
</P>
<P>
 This concern is based on what they say have been shortsighted U.S. policies 
and the uncompromising opposition by the ousted president to broadening his 
government to include differing political and economic views from his populist 
and partisan approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same old thing," said a Haitian diplomatic expert who said he voted 
for Aristide and wants him restored "as a matter of democratic principle." 
</P>
<P>
 "Aristide and his advisers in Washington (where the ousted president lives) 
think they can rule alone, that anyone who opposes a policy is an enemy," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His view, shared by many of those interviewed, is rooted in what is seen as 
duplicitous Aristide actions over the last year, particularly in insisting that 
he has accepted the need for a broader government. 
</P>
<P>
 He did this, a political analyst said, "only under American pressure and to 
keep American support. Now that it seems certain that he will come back, he's 
the same old Aristide." 
</P>
<P>
 The expert's main example is Aristide's failure to nominate a new prime 
minister to replace Robert Malval, the moderate who resigned over Aristide's 
refusal to accept a broadened government. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Aristide had learned anything or was sincere in seeking reconciliation, he 
would certainly have named a prime minister acceptable to more people," he 
said. "I know his advisers are telling him there's no need now, that he will 
come back and do whatever he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 This source, contacted after word of Aristide's acceptance of possible U.S. 
military action here, said even the limited endorsement was a sign of 
Aristide's ambiguous attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "You note he called for a surgical strike, for the American forces to come in 
and get out and only to remove the military," the analyst said. Aristide "said 
nothing about the structural changes we need and can only be accomplished if 
there is stability imposed from the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what is going to happen?" he asked. "Right after he gets back and 
Cedras, Biamby and Francois are forced out, Aristide is going to condemn 
'American intervention' and demand the U.S. forces leave." 
</P>
<P>
 The source was referring to Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the military coup leader; 
army chief of staff Gen. Philippe Biamby, and police commander Michel-Joseph 
Francois. The three are seen as architects of the coup and the brutal policies 
that have followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other concerns, which appear to reflect class and economic distinctions as 
well as differing political views, are based on a belief that in the seven 
months of Aristide's government, he was violently anti-business and instigated 
the nation's poor -- the overwhelming majority here -- against Haiti's middle 
and upper classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, said a onetime Aristide associate who now has doubts, "that is an 
erroneous judgment of the past. There are plenty of reasons to worry about 
Haiti under Aristide when he comes back, but not because he was advocating 
violence or class warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was less human rights abuse (under Aristide) than at any time in 
Haitian history," the source said. "Economic measures were improving. The 
problem was his lack of a political vision, his lack of understanding of the 
political process and his inability to realize he was a politician and needed 
more than a vision from God to govern." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the source said, "Aristide believes that his only problem -- the 
(Haitian) military -- will be removed. He doesn't understand that Haiti's 
problems are far deeper than a corrupt and abusive army." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said that misunderstanding goes beyond Aristide to include the Clinton 
Administration, which, one source said, "is now driven entirely by domestic 
political concerns and seems based on the idea that if the military is driven 
out, the United States can forget Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Of possible U.S. military action, a political expert, once favored to be a 
senior Aristide Cabinet official, observed: "It is all well and good. But the 
Americans are totally crazy if they don't look at the day after" the U.S. 
troops arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 A businessman, who once led an effort to reconcile Aristide with Haiti's 
wealthy private sector, said, "As things stand, I don't think his new 
government will be any different from his first one." 
</P>
<P>
 If that assessment is correct, or even if only the anti-military sectors 
believe it, one diplomat said, "then Haiti is in real trouble and the Americans 
will only have cut off the top of the problem and not ripped out the roots." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the best of circumstances, Aristide's return will present huge 
challenges not only to him but to long-range U.S. interests here -- the 
creation of a stable economic and political climate to finally remove the 
threat of massive Haitian migration to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 While Aristide is still judged to hold the support of most of the 70% who made 
him Haiti's first democratically elected president, his enemies will remain 
powerful and determined to protect their economic and social advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 He has no political party, and what little support he had in the Parliament is 
dissipated, one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source, who seemed to voice the prevailing mood, said that "if nothing 
is done beyond disbanding the military and there are no serious efforts to 
dismantle the old institutions, then Haiti will remain the same. In 10 years 
we'll still be the mess we are."

PLO SAYS FOES REJECT UNREST IN SELF-RULE ZONES 
</P>

<P>
 The Palestine Liberation Organization has conducted two rounds of meetings 
with the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas and has received assurances from a 
range of opposition groups that they will not create clashes in the new 
autonomy zones, PLO leadership sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas leaders, who met with an envoy of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat last week 
in Jordan, had appeared close to an agreement on accepting seats on the new 
25-member Palestinian Authority before the talks were derailed by leaks in 
Tunis and Amman, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Abbas Zaki, a leader of Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction, said he won 
assurances from radical groups such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command -- which had called for the streets to be washed in 
Arafat's blood in the wake of his accord with Israel -- that opponents will 
mount no attacks against the PLO leader or members of the new Palestinian 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will not join," he said in an interview after meeting with opposition 
leaders such as Nayef Hawatmeh of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine and Abu Ali Mustafa of the Popular Front. "But they let me know that 
if we deal with them in goodwill, and allow everybody to have his own opinion, 
we can prevent any clashes." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat so far has packed the governing authority with his supporters, most 
from his Fatah organization and the tiny Palestinian Democratic Union, which 
also backs the peace plan with Israel. With 20 seats filled so far, the PLO 
chairman has left open the last bloc of seats in the hope of attracting the 
opposition into the peace fold. 
</P>
<P>
 Key among those groups is Hamas, whose threat to continue a violent campaign 
against the Israeli occupation could derail the fledgling autonomy effort in 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaki said he met with a Hamas delegation May 25 in Amman to try to learn the 
organization's conditions for backing the peace effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, another delegation led by purported Hamas leader Sheik Said Bilal 
headed to Tunis for direct talks with Arafat; Zaki proceeded to Syria for 
meetings with left-wing opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat advisers said after the Hamas meetings in Tunis that they believe there 
are factions within Hamas that are leaning toward cooperating with the peace 
agreement. They said part of the talks with Hamas focused on an attempt to win 
a pledge that there would be no more attacks against Palestinians accused of 
collaborating with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO pressed Hamas leaders for information on the perpetrators of the 
recent attack against two alleged collaborators, as well as the Hamas-claimed 
attack on two Israeli soldiers near the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 But PLO officials admitted that there are few immediate hopes of persuading 
any opponents to join the authority early on.

ISRAEL DISPATCHES LEBANON BORDER REINFORCEMENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel sent reinforcements to the Lebanese border Friday in the wake of its 
raid on a Hezbollah training camp. Leaders of the Shiite Muslim group vowed 
revenge, and thousands of Lebanese fled northward to avoid further hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah fighters rained Katyusha rockets into Israel late Thursday night in 
retaliation for the attack earlier in the day, but there were no casualties. 
Thousands of Israelis were ordered to sleep in bomb shelters, and northern 
Israeli resorts reported a wave of cancellations as tourists fled. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lebanon, shops, banks and schools were closed for a day of national 
mourning as the victims were buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah said 26 fighters were killed when Israeli helicopter gunships and 
warplanes attacked the training camp in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, near the border 
with Syria. Others said the death toll could be as high as 45. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's general secretary, delivered a defiant 
address to more than 15,000 mourners who marched in Beirut's suburbs. Nasrallah 
declared that Hezbollah will avenge the deaths with suicide bombers.

STUDY LINKS SMOKING, BREAST CANCER DEATHS

<P>
 Smoking escalates a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer by at least 25%, 
according to a study that also says women can eliminate that increased risk by 
quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Smokers were 25% more likely than nonsmokers and ex-smokers to die of breast 
cancer, according to a recent American Cancer Society survey of 604,412 women 
who were initially free of cancer.After six years, 880 had died of the disease, 
which strikes one in eight U.S. women. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk grew with the number of cigarettes a woman smoked, culminating in a 
75% greater risk among women who smoked two packs a day or more. Quitting would 
return a former smoker's risk to that of a lifelong nonsmoker, researchers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugenia Calle, an epidemiologist who directed the study published in the 
American Journal of Epidemiology, said it does not suggest that smoking causes 
breast cancer. Instead, she said the increased risk may result from "poorer 
survival or delayed diagnosis." 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, smokers may have impaired immune systems, they may not obtain 
routine (mammograms) or smoking may cause a direct deleterious effect on 
survival," Calle said.

 Motorists who fail to produce a valid driver's license when stopped for a 
traffic violation would have their cars impounded if a bill narrowly approved 
by the Assembly becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
 A 41-24 vote, the exact majority needed for approval, sent the bill (AB 3148) 
by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) to the Senate.

 Impounded vehicles would be returned within 72 hours if a valid driver's 
license is acquired. After that time, vehicles would be sold at public auction 
with proceeds divided between local and state police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 A Department of Motor Vehicles study estimates that 75% of motorists whose 
licenses are suspended for drunk driving continue to drive and are involved in 
15% of all fatal car accidents, according to Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Innocent people are being killed at the hands of unlicensed drivers," he 
said, "and it has got to stop."

 More than 20 people were treated for stings after two yellow jacket attacks 
Friday in Berkeley's Tilden Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The first attack about 10 a.m. involved 12 schoolchildren and an adult on a 
hiking trail near Lake Anza, said Deputy Fire Chief Gary Bard.About Two hours 
later, wasps attacked nine people about a quarter-mile away. Injuries were 
considered minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Bard said all of the sting victims -- including several students from Sheldon 
Elementary School in El Sobrante and Downer School in San Pablo -- were in good 
condition. But they were sent to a hospital as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're dealing with 10- and 11-year-old children on a school outing . .

 Nation of Islam preacher Khallid Abdul Muhammad left the hospital in a 
wheelchair Friday, six days after being wounded in an ambush. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad, 46, former spokesman for the black Muslim group, was shot in the 
legs Sunday after giving a speech at UC Riverside.Four bodyguards and a 
bystander also were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 James Edward Bess, 49, a defrocked minister of the Nation of Islam, pleaded 
not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault. Police believe he acted 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad left Riverside Community Hospital without speaking to reporters, 
spirited out through a garage entrance in a van, its windows covered. Three or 
four security guards accompanied him, a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Krull, the hospital's vice president for administration, told reporters 
he did not know where Muhammad was going. 
</P>
<P>
 Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan canceled a news conference scheduled 
for Friday morning in Las Vegas. Farrakhan suspended Muhammad as his senior 
aide after a November speech in which Muhammad called Jews "the bloodsuckers" 
of the black community, criticized the Pope and urged the killing of South 
African whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors removed two 9-millimeter pistol bullet fragments from just below 
Muhammad's left knee in a two-hour operation. A wound to his right leg did not 
require surgery.

BOOK DEPICTS CHAOTIC WHITE HOUSE; PRESIDENCY: INTIMATE LOOK AT CLINTON'S FIRST 
YEAR PAINTS SCENES OF INDECISION, RELUCTANCE TO DELEGATE. ROLE OF FED CHAIRMAN, 
FIRST LADY AMONG FOCUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Insistent advice from Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan to 
President Clinton during the presidential transition and early in the new 
Administration led Clinton to pursue lower federal budget deficits at the 
expense of the economic populism of his campaign, according to a new book. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, "The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House" by Washington Post 
Assistant Managing Editor Bob Woodward, is an intimate look at how the new 
Democratic President and his stumbling, feuding team of advisers struggled to 
formulate and adopt an economic program during Clinton's first year in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan is described as a central player, albeit once removed from the inner 
circle. The book recounts what Woodward calls a crucial meeting between Clinton 
and Greenspan in Little Rock, Ark., in December, 1992, the month before 
Clinton's inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 2 1/2-hour session, the Fed chairman told the President-elect that 
reducing the long-term federal budget deficit was "essential" and that the 
economic recovery could fall on its face if policies credible to Wall Street, 
particularly to bond traders, were not advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 It is customary for the President and the Fed chairman to hold periodic 
meetings. But in Woodward's recounting of their relationship, Greenspan, a 
Republican appointed by President Ronald Reagan and reappointed by President 
George Bush, comes across as a senior adviser, almost a teacher to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan outlined to Clinton an economic approach Woodward calls the 
"financial markets strategy," in which policy was to be designed to send a 
message to Wall Street and ultimately drive down interest rates. According to 
the theory, the economy would improve as a result, and Clinton would have more 
tax revenue to spend on favored domestic programs, boosting his reelection 
chances in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory, and the policy that Clinton adopted, bore little resemblance to 
the economic program on which Clinton had campaigned. Clinton's "putting people 
first" campaign banner stressed government "investment" in programs that would 
improve the lives of middle-class Americans, such as job training, early 
education and government promotion of cutting-edge technology. 
</P>
<P>
 A middle-class tax cut and health care for all Americans were additional 
sweeteners. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan's advice to Clinton that a long-term deficit-reduction program was 
of paramount importance was backed not only by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
but also by Budget Director Leon E. Panetta and his deputy, Alice Rivlin, 
according to the book. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's economic advisers, with his assent, quickly jettisoned the tax 
cut, delayed health care reform, and then added an energy tax and spending 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's political team -- campaign advisers James Carville and Paul Begala, 
media adviser Mandy Grunwald and pollster Stanley B. Greenberg -- are portrayed 
as horrified and disgusted with this effort to please the financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The four seem to have spent much of last year decrying what they saw as 
mismanagement at the White House and firing off memos arguing that the 
President and some of his aides had lost their souls to the deficit-cutters. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Clinton, while intellectually acquiescing in the devastation of his 
investment programs, raged nonetheless at how it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 While the book depicts him as highly intelligent and energetic, it recounts 
several Clinton temper tantrums, quoting senior aide George Stephanopoulos as 
calling them "the wave" -- overpowering, prolonged rages that shocked outsiders 
and often seemed far out of proportion to their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Recurring themes in the book are Clinton's inability to terminate debate and 
make a decision, and his reluctance to delegate. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the internal debate over the budget, Clinton is portrayed as holding 
repeated, seemingly endless meetings at which issues rarely were decided and 
during which he frequently changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the budget was passed -- by one vote in the House and a tie-breaking 
Senate vote by Vice President Al Gore -- Bentsen is said to have taken Clinton 
aside and warned him he was mismanaging the presidency by trying to make every 
small decision and refusing to delegate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those concerns appeared to grow out of a White House with little 
management structure, in which the four political aides had unusual status. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the normal avenues, they sent anguished, internal memos to the White 
House warning of the near-collapse of the Clinton presidency and demanding 
meetings with the President and senior advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the memos, written in July as the White House headed into the crucial 
month leading up to the budget vote, warned apocalyptically that the "current 
course, advanced by our economic team and congressional leaders, threatens to 
sink your popularity further and weaken your presidency." 
</P>
<P>
 The memo prompted First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to go to White House Chief 
of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty and insist it was "panic time," with no plan to 
sell the program they were about to send to Congress, no strategy and no 
decisions made on key elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours of debate, presided over by Clinton, ensued among the political team and 
policy advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 At one crucial meeting last July attended by the President and the First Lady, 
Hillary Clinton chastised both the economic and political teams for poorly 
serving Clinton, for lacking organization and planning, and for creating a 
"dysfunctional" White House. 
</P>
<P>
 She complained they had allowed Clinton to appear to be a "mechanic in chief," 
erased his "moral voice" and changed his economic program from a "values 
document" to a bunch of numbers. "I want to see a plan" for selling the 
program, she demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Most saw Hillary Clinton's denunciations in that meeting, which were followed 
by a burst of anger from Clinton at his staff, as an indictment of McLarty, 
whom the book portrays as an ineffective, sometimes bumbling character with no 
feel for politics and a fundamental misunderstanding of congressional 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton's July critique, Woodward writes, amounted to a "scalding 
indictment of McLarty. At crucial moments like this, Hillary was often de facto 
chief of staff."CLINTON, HILLARY

PROPOSITIONS; RENTERS CREDIT AND OTHER TAX BREAKS AT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE and CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the tax-related and bond-related ballot measures involving billions and 
millions that face voters Tuesday, the most intense pocketbook issue is the one 
that means a difference, at most, of $120 a year per family. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a political deal reached in the Capitol, Proposition 175 asks 
voters to decide whether a renters tax credit should be made part of the state 
Constitution, meaning that legislators could not willy-nilly suspend the 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach a compromise last summer on the state budget, then-Senate President 
Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) agreed to a proposal to suspend the 
renters credit for two years, provided that voters would have the chance to 
reinstate it permanently thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is Tuesday's ballot measure, which sets the credit at $60 for 
single renters and $120 for married couples and single heads of households. The 
Legislature could still adjust the amount or decide at what income level a 
renter would qualify for the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Proposition 175 is no shoo-in. In a recent Los Angeles Times poll, the 
renters credit was failing by a 48%-41% margin among likely voters. 
</P>
<P>
 John Brennan, director of the poll, said the more downscale voters -- having 
an income of less than $20,000 -- are in favor of the measure, by a 48%-35% 
margin, while those earning more than $60,000 are against it by a wide margin, 
61% to 30%.  
</P>
<P>
 Backers say the proposal holds great importance for the 4.5 million California 
households occupied by renters. They cite the homeowners deduction and argue 
that there should be a corresponding benefit for renters. Supporters also say 
Proposition 175 would fulfill the pledge of rent relief promised in 1978 by the 
backers of Proposition 13, which cut property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say that Proposition 13 did benefit renters because landlords would 
charge more if they were forced to pay higher property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Proposition 175 fails, the credit will be reinstated in 1995, 
although, without constitutional protection, it would again be at the mercy of 
the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other measures on Tuesday's ballot would amend the Constitution to 
provide marginal tax relief or, in the case of Proposition 176, head off a 
possible tax. 
</P>
<P>
 That measure would specifically forbid cities and counties to levy business 
license taxes or fees based on the income or gross receipts of nonprofit 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 No city or county in California imposes such a levy, officials say, but 
supporters say that some cities could do so if they wished. 
</P>
<P>
 Churches and other nonprofit organizations long have been exempt from federal 
and state income taxes because they typically provide a charitable, 
educational, scientific or other service deemed valuable to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponent Gary B. Wesley, a San Jose attorney, contends that not all 
"nonprofits are as charitable" as supporters would have voters believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mere fact that no 'profit' is left over for any shareholders or other 
owners does not make an organization charitable or worthy of outright exemption 
of local business license fees," Wesley said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Propositions 177 and 178, voters will decide, respectively, whether to 
grant a property tax break for businesses that alter premises to assist 
disabled people and for farmers who install water conservation systems. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, Propositions 177 and 178 would exempt properties from being 
automatically reassessed at higher rates as a result of making those kinds of 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 177 backers note that private businesses would have an incentive 
to better serve people with disabilities, including installation of wider 
doorways, reconfigured restrooms and ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents call the measure a piecemeal approach to fixing the flaws in 
Proposition 13 and say that what is needed instead is a comprehensive overhaul 
of the 1978 law. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Proposition 178 argue the measure would provide an incentive for 
farmers to replace outdated irrigation methods with new conservation 
techniques, including drip irrigation -- an improvement that would cut water 
use in drought-prone California. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents contend that farmers already get a major price break on water 
purchases at the expense of city dwellers. They argue that farmers will install 
the conservation equipment anyway to reduce water bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The state legislative analyst estimates that loss of property tax revenues 
caused by the measures would be relatively minor at first, but could reach 
about $10 million annually as more farmers and businesses qualified for the 
exemption.

CAMPAIGN JOURNAL; MORALE BOOSTER; FOR JOHN GARAMENDI, THE DAYS BEFORE THE 
PRIMARY HAVE BEEN MARKED BY UPS AND DOWNS. A PAT ON THE BACK FOR HIS HANDLING 
OF THE EXECUTIVE LIFE CRISIS IS A WELCOME COUNTERPOINT TO KATHLEEN BROWN ADS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The candidate had come to the headquarters of a citizens patrol group to talk 
about crime. But Colleen Luinenburg had something else in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have money with Executive Life," she told Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi, grabbing the hand of the startled would-be governor and shaking it 
warmly. "And I didn't lose a dime." 
</P>
<P>
 By invoking the failed insurance company's name, Luinenburg gave Garamendi a 
scare. All day, his campaign staff had been responding to a TV ad aired by 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown -- his main rival for the Democratic 
gubernatorial nomination. The ad featured another woman who had had money with 
the Executive Life Insurance Co. and had nothing good to say about Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 In 41-year-old Luinenburg, however, Garamendi found a soft-spoken but effusive 
woman who praised Garamendi for saving her $11,000 annuity. Gratitude was what 
made her seek out Garamendi, she said. That made the campaign-weary candidate 
pretty grateful himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed you tonight," he told her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Garamendi, the final week before the primary election has been a time of 
ups and downs. His broken right leg has healed a bit, allowing him to discard 
the crutches he's relied on for the last month. Physically at least, the burly 
rancher is more agile. 
</P>
<P>
 His campaign, in contrast, has seemed sluggish at times. Ever since Tuesday, 
when Garamendi blasted Brown in two TV ads that focus on her personal 
opposition to the death penalty, he has been the target of relentless 
counterattacks. First, Brown unveiled the Executive Life ad. Then, in another 
ad, Brown accused Garamendi of flip-flopping on the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, labels Brown's ads misleading -- 
though he admits that it's nice to be noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen's finally admitted that there's a race," Sragow said, noting that 
until this week, Brown has focused her attacks on Gov. Pete Wilson. "Who likes 
being ignored?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Garamendi has not taken advantage of that attention as much as he might 
have. Considering how few days remain before Tuesday's primary, his campaign 
schedule has been light, with just one or two public events each day. Brown, by 
contrast, has been riding her cushy campaign bus up and down the state all 
week, meeting voters (and television camera crews) at nearly every stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Elena Stern, Garamendi's press secretary, said that as well as campaigning, 
Garamendi has been busy with several "private meetings" -- some of them fund 
raising. Because his public events have been in key media markets that afford 
widespread news coverage, she said, it has not been necessary to keep Garamendi 
stumping all day long just to get his message out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not hopping on a bus and hitting 10 cities a day," she said. "We're 
trying to send quality messages on the issues we think the voters care about." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's what brought Garamendi to Normal Heights, a middle-class San Diego 
neighborhood. The organizers of Beat 311 Citizen's Patrol, a volunteer group 
that aids police by canvassing neighborhoods looking for suspicious activity, 
had invited Garamendi on a ride-along. And on Thursday night, he accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfitted with a flashlight, a clipboard and a walkie-talkie radio, Garamendi 
rode along as Sharon Wilson, a volunteer, steered her four-wheel-drive truck 
through the darkened streets. Wilson told her guest to keep an eye out for 
older, middle-aged people riding bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a large population of parolees," she explained. "They don't have 
driver's licenses, so they prowl on bicycles." 
</P>
<P>
 In an hour of patrolling, Garamendi spotted one cyclist (seemingly innocent), 
a group of loitering teen-agers (who, on closer inspection, turned out to be 
adults) and a broken sprinkler main at a local elementary school. Mostly, he 
listened to Wilson's concerns -- about the lack of after-school programs for 
youngsters, about the rise in prostitution, about the importance of getting 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Election Day came up only once, when Wilson stopped for coffee at a 
convenience store. When the cashier told Garamendi it was his second day on the 
job, the candidate was reminded of one of the jobs he held while fulfilling his 
pledge to work in each of California's 58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "One night, I was a cashier in a restaurant. Boy, did I screw up," Garamendi 
said, laughing as he extended his hand for a quick shake. "When you go to vote 
next Tuesday, think about me."

GOVERNOR; HAYDEN SEES TURNING TIDE OF VICTORY; THE UNDERDOG IN THE RACE FOR THE 
DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL NOMINATION SAYS LOW TURNOUT COULD BE A FACTOR. 
UNWORRIED, BROWN AND GARAMENDI CAMPAIGNS PRESS ON. 
</P>

<P>
 As state election officials forecast a record low voter turnout, the 
self-described "un-candidate" for governor, state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica), said Friday that he now has a fighting chance to win the Democratic 
nomination over Kathleen Brown and John Garamendi in Tuesday's primary 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 No experts could be found to readily agree with Hayden, however, and state 
Treasurer Brown continued to campaign Friday as the self-assumed nominee by 
hammering away at Republican Gov. Pete Wilson on the California economy and 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's aides have described the primary campaign as a "dry run" for the 
general election against Wilson, who was leading in the polls over his one 
surprise challenger, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron Unz. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner, stuck to his theme of crime and 
the death penalty, visiting the site in Manhattan Beach where a police officer 
was shot and killed last December. His campaign manager said he remained 
hopeful of a victory on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how the votes break out will depend on how many of California's 14.2 
million registered voters actually go to the polls and what motivates them to 
cast their ballots the way they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller on Friday issued a gloomy official 
forecast of the turnout: 39.8%, the lowest since the state began keeping 
records in 1916, a full 16 points below the average. Miller said he based the 
forecast on information supplied by county election officials, historic data, 
the slow pace of voter registration this year and a perception of "widespread 
indifference to the primary this year." 
</P>
<P>
 "Contrary to reality, people just don't seem to think it matters who is 
elected, or how a ballot measure might impact their lives," said Miller, who is 
a candidate for the secretary of state post, vacant since Democrat March Fong 
Eu resigned earlier this year to become U.S. ambassador to Micronesia. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, the onetime student radical leader, said he has a shot at overcoming 
Brown and Garamendi if he can win away 5% of each candidate's current support 
and pull half the undecided vote. Hayden said such movement would depend on 
Democrats being disillusioned by the Brown and Garamendi campaign efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two other candidates are now engaged in a death lock of discussion about 
the death penalty, which can only be disappointing to most Democrats," Hayden 
said as he unveiled a second 13-minute campaign commercial. Most political 
advertising runs 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Hayden ad, to be shown on both cable outlets and regular broadcast 
television stations, consists primarily of his analysis of the three debates 
conducted by Brown, Garamendi and Hayden -- debates in which Hayden's 
performance won high marks. 
</P>
<P>
 The film opens with a sport-shirted Hayden speaking casually from a chair in 
his living room, saying that his campaign for reform of the election and 
lobbying processes already has been a success, but will have even more impact 
the more votes he gets. 
</P>
<P>
 He uses the debates to portray Brown and Garamendi as elaborately packaged 
candidates, programmed to give a narrow message that reinforces their own 
campaign themes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Kathleen Brown . . . (but) I feel that something has happened in the 
last year that she's being squeezed in some kind of vice of management and is 
losing or is in danger of losing her own voice and her own sensitivity," Hayden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Garamendi, he said, "John, I think, has approached the campaign as a 
battle. . . . He's so frustrated at what he perceives as Kathleen's 
indifference. . . . I felt he was all negative and was prepared to be negative, 
so you had merchandised negativity." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Brown took her bus tour to South Los Angeles, where she won the 
endorsement of the Rev. Joseph Hardwick of Praises of Zion Baptist Church. This 
week's tour has focused on areas and people who have been affected by the 
recession and Brown noted that Los Angeles County has lost more than 413,000 
jobs since Wilson took office in January 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardwick praised Brown by saying, "She will work to make sure that no one is 
left behind on the road to economic recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was some good news on the job front Friday for the target of Brown's 
jobs rhetoric: Wilson. The state's unemployment rate, which had shot up to 9.6% 
in April, fell 1.3 points during May, state officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wilson acknowledged that unemployment figures have been volatile, he 
said, "This improvement yet again demonstrates that our economy is moving in 
the right direction. So I will keep cutting job-killing red tape and enacting 
business incentives to bring new jobs to California." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said that the number of jobs in California in May was 14.2 million, an 
increase of 159,000 over the April level. 
</P>
<P>
 In Manhattan Beach, Garamendi joined police supporters in a parking lot where 
police Officer Martin Ganz was slain last December. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must put an end to these and other coldblooded killings that are 
terrorizing our communities today. We must win this urban war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has proposed to save $5.5 billion a year through reform of 
California's insurance structure and to use part of that money to put more 
police on the streets.

NEWS ANALYSIS; FEINSTEIN-HUFFINGTON SENATE BATTLE FLARES WITH ATTACK ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finally this week came the multimillion-dollar video collision that the two 
leading U.S. Senate campaigns had predicted, marking the effective starting 
point in what is expected to be a race that could set new highs in political 
spending and lows in negative advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the year, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and her campaign have sometimes 
seemed like Chicken Little when they warned that they were in a serious race. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) sounded pretty 
cocky when he told Republicans that he was going to zoom from obscurity to 
defeat one of the state's most formidable politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, when the two campaigns exchanged a statewide barrage of attack 
television commercials, the reality of a major Senate battle sunk in. The clash 
became imminent after a series of recent polls found Huffington's springtime 
television campaign had cut Feinstein's lead by half in a hypothetical November 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Feinstein campaign has decided to begin the fight," said Darry Sragow, 
who managed Feinstein's 1990 campaign for governor and now heads John 
Garamendi's gubernatorial effort. ". . . Fundamentally, if you are an incumbent 
who all of a sudden finds yourself in a fairly close race, you have to 
respond." 
</P>
<P>
 At GOP headquarters in Washington, Republicans were gleeful. Finally, they 
could talk about a new front in the national battle for control of the Senate. 
And they could prod the White House that its 1996 hopes for success in 
California were on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "This race has certainly caught the eye for a lot of people who didn't view it 
as an opportunity a year ago," said Gary Koops, spokesman for the National 
Republican Senatorial Committee. "This is going to be one of the most closely 
watched races in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign observers describe the recent clash as the starting gun of a race 
that still has a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has to win the GOP primary on Tuesday, where he is favored. And 
Feinstein still comes into her reelection campaign with all of the assets and 
resources that make her a formidable candidate for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week was a benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
 * The conventional wisdom about money and campaigns was right this time. 
</P>
<P>
 When Huffington entered the GOP contest last fall with his vast personal 
fortune, he cleared the field of top-shelf Republicans and was expected to 
sweep through the primary. He still has to win his first statewide ballot test 
Tuesday. But his nearest GOP rival is former Orange County Rep. William E. 
Dannemeyer, whose standing in the polls has not exceeded the level he had when 
he lost the 1992 GOP Senate primary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recent developments resolved the question of whether a wealthy but unknown 
Republican can pose a serious threat to Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic senator seemed well prepared for a traditional campaign, with a 
veteran strategy team, polls showing her to be the state's most popular 
legislator and praises coming in about her accomplishments since her 1992 
election. But with his personal fortune from the sale of his family's oil and 
gas company in Texas, Huffington has spent more than $6 million so far largely 
for attack television commercials that drove Feinstein's support in polls down. 
</P>
<P>
 * The television exchange was a good snapshot of what experts think voters 
will see a lot of in this race -- an enormously expensive slugfest waged 
largely through commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of barnstorming the state in the few days left before the Tuesday 
primary, both leading candidates have planned a low-profile schedule similar to 
their activities thus far in the campaign. At the same time, they are spending 
thousands of dollars a day beating each other up on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's commercial, her first of the campaign which started airing 
Tuesday, suggested that Huffington dodged his state taxes, prompting the 
Republican campaign to respond a day later with a commercial raising questions 
about whether Feinstein paid enough federal taxes. Neither campaign has any 
evidence of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Perhaps the most disturbing aspect for Democrats, however, is that 
Huffington's major criticism of Feinstein, on television and in speeches, was 
her decisive vote to support Clinton's 1993 economic package. That caught the 
attention of the White House because Republicans around the country might pick 
up the same issue if it proves effective against one of the Democrats' 
strongest incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bit unsettling to see how many (polling) points she can be hurt with 
just a few weeks of ads and particularly, for us in the White House, it was 
unsettling to see that tax message have an effect," an Administration source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats have portrayed the 1993 economic package as a deficit reduction and 
job stimulus plan that has helped turn around a sagging national economy. They 
also argue that more people saw a tax cut than an increase. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington's gains have come while he describes the vote as a simple tax 
increase and a typical liberal Democratic solution to economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the budget vote becomes a big issue and we can convince people that the 
Clinton economic plan was good for the country, then we're in good shape for 
1996," the Administration source said. "This race, as much as any in the 
country, is going to be about that. If she loses based on the economic plan, we 
could be in real trouble. Feinstein is not considered one of the most 
vulnerable members of the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 The six months remaining until the November election can be an eternity in 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to read anything of great significance in this because 
Feinstein hasn't needed to establish aggressive advertising against 
Huffington," said Bruce Cain, political science professor at UC Berkeley. "The 
context of the campaign will shift when we start getting more of a comparison 
between the two of them." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington this year, both legislators will have to make decisions on 
several watershed issues on which they are likely to disagree, such as health 
care, welfare reform and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, although recent polls have shown the margin between the two candidates 
has tightened, they also indicate most voters still don't know much about 
Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 As more detailed comparisons are made between the two, Democrats are confident 
that Feinstein's record of accomplishment will prove attractive. Republicans 
believe her record as a longtime politician will put off voters unhappy with 
government's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect it will be a close race," said Republican political consultant Ron 
Smith. "And clearly it's going to be a very ugly year. Every time Huffington 
does something positive he's going to find his numbers don't move and when he 
does negative they move. And she is going to find the same."

2 WOMEN, FRIENDS WHO SHARED A GOAL, NOW SHARE POLITICAL SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a decade ago they called themselves the "dynamic duo," two 
thirtysomething women with New York power addresses who shared a dream about 
having it all -- husband, kids and a successful career. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of five yearned for a profession; the international bestselling 
author wanted a husband and family. Together, they joined forces and turned 
their similar hopes and contrasting experiences into a lecture tour about the 
different routes women might follow to reach the same life goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, they both have it all -- the careers and families. But it must rank as 
one of the oddest coincidences in this election year that their separate 
courses led them both to California's two biggest political campaigns of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of five who once thought she might never have a career is Kathleen 
Brown, California's state treasurer and the leading Democrat for governor. And 
her New York friend, the author who dreamed about motherhood, is Arianna 
Stassinopoulos, now a mother and married to the Republican front-runner in 
California's U.S. Senate race, Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is funny sometimes," Arianna Huffington said recently as she flew home 
from a Central Valley campaign speech for her husband. "It is an amazing 
coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said they had no idea where they would end up when they lectured in New 
York and Illinois. "I regard it as just serendipity," Brown said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Her contrarian brother, former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., offers 
another interpretation. It may be surprising, he said, but it shouldn't be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics is a very small world, more so than you folks in the media ever 
think," he said. "This political class is more tightly integrated than the 
two-party system would like to admit." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Brown himself is part of that small world. In this story, he played the 
role of facilitator between Huffington and his sister. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women met in 1981 when Huffington was assigned to write a free-lance 
story for People magazine about California's governor. At the time, Gov. Brown 
was running for the same U.S. Senate seat that Huffington's husband is after 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's November, 1981, article, headlined "California's Jerry Brown Runs 
for the Senate -- and Away From His Flaky Image," was an intimate sketch of a 
week in the candidate's life that included a peek inside his barely stocked 
bachelor refrigerator and a nod to the books about poetry, economic theory and 
philosophy strewn about his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also noted the role of art and religion in Brown's life. She has 
written biographies of Pablo Picasso and Maria Callas and a new book that 
reviews her own unconventional search for spiritual meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown's contribution to the magazine story was a single quote about 
her brother: "He's a larger-than-life presence in our family." But she and 
Huffington, both fresh, popular arrivals in New York society, hit it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was someone who could chitchat, talk about life, talk about men," 
Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 The friendship came during a three-year period that Brown has called a private 
part of her often public life. 
</P>
<P>
 She had just arrived in New York City, newly married to the president of CBS 
Sports and later CBS News, Van Gordon Sauter. Brown had three children from a 
previous marriage and Sauter had two when the family moved into a Park Avenue 
apartment. They lived downstairs from NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw and his wife, 
Meredith, who became a close friend of Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1983, Brown decided to seek the career she had talked about, enrolling in 
law school at Fordham University. She graduated at age 40 as a corporate bond 
lawyer and soon returned to California after Sauter was fired by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington arrived in New York in 1981. Born in Greece and educated at 
Cambridge University in England, she came to the United States to promote her 
third book, the biography of Callas, which became an international bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first book, "The Female Woman," written when she was 22, championed 
working roles for women, but it was attacked as anti-feminist for its 
suggestion that women should not suppress their desires to be mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I met Kathleen and the two of them together, that's how I got the idea" 
for the speaking tour, said Nancy Nelson, the lecture agent who booked their 
appearances. "The first time that Arianna and Kathleen spoke together . . . 
they were absolutely thrilled to death. Here they were, these two young, 
articulate, beautiful women." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said she no longer has records of their speaking events, but recalls at 
least three speeches. Brown said she could only recall two, one to a women's 
group in New York's art community and another at the University of Illinois 
Women's Day in May, 1983. Nelson said there was at least one more speech, to 
the University of Pennsylvania Alumni Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech was called "Working It Out" and it began with one of the two 
speaking about her life experiences, followed by the other offering a contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just the personal stories of two women . . . approaching life, career 
and marriage from the opposite direction," Brown said. "And the message, 
basically, was that there is no right way or wrong way. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I think at the beginning, both of us probably imagined we would not 
have the other's life," she said. "I thought, starting my family so young, that 
having a professional career was foreclosed. And I think that she thought, as a 
professional writer and intellectual, she would not ever have a family. And 
there was a crossing at which point both of us moved into different phases." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who lectured frequently in those days on topics related to her 
books, said their hope was to show that there are different routes to the same 
end: family and career. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message was one of empowering working women," she said. "If you are a 
wife and a mother, it's never too late to integrate (a career) into your life 
-- that was Kathleen's message. If you are a career woman, don't lose hope, 
don't pretend you don't want those things." 
</P>
<P>
 They were presented as models for women considering career and family. But 
their lives were certainly not common, because their social status spared them 
much of the normal worry about climbing a corporate ladder as well as some of 
the compromises forced by day-care choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said they did not try to imply that their experience was universal. 
Instead, she said their hope was to highlight an option available to women: 
starting a career or a family later in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point was you could do both," Brown said. "But my line has always been to 
women that you can have it all, but you can't have it all at once." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington agreed, saying the speech was intended to debunk the 1970s "myth of 
the super woman. . . . She was 5 feet, 8 inches tall, 115 pounds, perfectly 
organized, has a wonderfully glamorized career and comes home and waits for her 
husband with a chilled wine." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the candidate and surrogate candidate from California's two biggest 
campaigns of the 1994 season said they have not talked about their shared irony 
since they entered the political field. They last saw each other briefly in 
1992 when Huffington's husband was campaigning for Congress and Brown was 
visiting Santa Barbara one afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they are still friends, but don't confuse that with politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said she will vote against Brown for governor because the Democrat 
supports too much government. After recalling the days in New York, Brown also 
ended an interview by saying: "Let me make one thing clear. With all respect to 
Michael and Arianna, I am wholeheartedly supporting Dianne Feinstein."

NEW HIGH COURT JUSTICE SWORN IN; LAW: STATE COMMISSION UNANIMOUSLY CONFIRMS 
KATHRYN WERDEGAR, WHO DECLINES TO STATE HER VIEWS ON THE DEATH PENALTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathryn M. Werdegar, an independent conservative and an old friend of Gov. 
Pete Wilson, was sworn in Friday as a member of the California Supreme Court 
after a state commission unanimously confirmed her. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment of Werdegar, 58, gives the court two female justices for the 
first time. A state Court of Appeal justice for three years, Werdegar is viewed 
as generally conservative but likely to take more moderate positions on 
occasion than the other four conservatives on the seven-member high court. 
</P>
<P>
 She declined to state her views on the death penalty during the one-hour 
hearing, even after a commissioner pressed her to say she would uphold the 
capital punishment law despite any personal opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't anticipate any difficulty" in abiding by the law, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former research attorney to retired conservative Justice Edward Panelli, 
whom she is replacing, Werdegar helped write opinions upholding death 
sentences.  
</P>
<P>
 But Sacramento Court of Appeal Justice Robert Puglia, one of the three members 
of the Commission on Judicial Appointments, asked her repeatedly if she would 
continue to support capital punishment even if she had a "personal epiphany." 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that the Constitution has been clearly interpreted, she replied, she 
could not envision such a scenario because "our role and duty is to follow the 
Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson swore her in, recalling their days as classmates at UC Berkeley's Boalt 
Hall law school, where Werdegar was one of four women in a class of 350. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wanted to carry Kay's books," Wilson remembered, until they saw her 
scores and decided instead to try "to look at her notes." 
</P>
<P>
 Six witnesses, all of them supportive, testified about her nomination in the 
formal hearing room in San Francisco where the California Supreme Court meets 
for oral arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Berkeley professor Jesse Choper argued that Werdegar's lack of trial 
experience would not be a handicap on the high court. He noted that former U.S. 
Supreme Court Chief Justices John Marshall and Earl Warren were never trial 
judges, nor were some of the California court's leading jurists.  
</P>
<P>
 Other witnesses described Werdegar as "disarmingly modest," thoughtful, 
quietly confident and a devoted mother and wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Werdegar also worked for civil rights as a Justice Department attorney after 
graduating from George Washington University law school, to which she 
transferred from Boalt. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Thelton E. Henderson, chief judge of the U.S. District Court for 
Northern California, testified that she helped formulate the government 
position to get the late Martin Luther King Jr. freed from a Birmingham, Ala., 
jail and advocated equal accommodations and equal voting rights for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of only two African Americans in his law school class, Henderson said, 
he and Werdegar shared many similar perceptions of the law school experience. 
Even though she graduated first in her class, law firms would not give her a 
job because she was a woman, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 A California bar commission rated Werdegar "well-qualified" for the high 
court, the middle of three ratings given to qualified candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The only opposition Werdegar faced came in a letter to the appointments 
commission by a California association of criminal defense lawyers. The group 
said Werdegar's appointment will perpetuate "single-mindedness on the court" 
because she probably will go along with its four conservative members who are 
"often referred to as clones." 
</P>
<P>
 James S. Thomson, president of the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, 
also said the group felt "great alarm" that Werdegar had drafted many of 
Panelli's opinions upholding death sentences despite courtroom errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson chose Werdegar in the face of strong pressure to name a minority or a 
woman to the high court in this election year. Justice Joyce Kennard, who is 
part Indonesian, is the only woman and minority now on the court. Wilson's only 
other high court appointment, Justice Ronald George, a white man, replaced 
Justice Allen Broussard, who is African American. Key Upcoming Cases 
</P>
<P>
 Here are several key cases that Kathryn Werdegar, the newest member of the 
California Supreme Court, is expected to participate in. Werdegar is considered 
more moderate than the court's four other conservatives -- Chief Justice 
Malcolm Lucas and Justices Ronald George, Armand Arabian and Marvin Baxter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gays: Can cities pass ordinances to prohibit job discrimination against 
gays? Reviewing a San Francisco case, the court will decide whether such 
ordinances are preempted by state law. Supporters of the ordinances say they 
are necessary to ensure that victims can sue for harassment and recover 
attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bias: Can private clubs in California discriminate? The case was brought by 
a woman who sued a San Mateo County country club that prohibits women and 
children from becoming full voting members. "Business establishments" in 
California are not allowed to discriminate, but a lower court ruled that the 
country club was "extremely private" and the woman had no grounds for a legal 
challenge. The state Supreme Court's decision in this case could determine 
whether Boy Scouts of America can bar gays and atheists from membership. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hate: Are California's hate-crime laws constitutional? The laws allow for 
stiffer punishment if attacks are motivated by bigotry against a victim's race, 
color, ancestry, national origin, religion, disability or sexual orientation. 
The two cases before the court involve attacks on gay men in San Francisco and 
on Latinos in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 * Smoking: Can the use of the "Old Joe Camel" cigarette mascot in advertising 
be banned as an unfair business practice on the ground that it encourages 
minors to smoke? The plaintiffs allege that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is trying 
to target minors with the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insurance: Are state rules aimed at giving rebates to insurance customers 
constitutional? The case is a challenge to Proposition 103, the insurance 
reform initiative passed by voters in 1988. The court's decision will help 
determine the authority of the state's insurance commissioner to regulate 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Homeless: How far can cities go in regulating the homeless? The court is 
reviewing the constitutionality of a Santa Ana ordinance that prohibits camping 
on public property. 
</P>
<P>
 * Affirmative action: Are local ordinances that require contractors to try to 
hire minority- and women-owned subcontractors constitutional? At issue is a Los 
Angeles law that a lower court held violated the equal protection clause of the 
Constitution.

OFFICIALS HUNT FOR CLUES IN DEADLY BAY AREA BLAST; SAN FRANCISCO: EXPLOSION 
KILLED THREE PEOPLE AND DEMOLISHED A THREE-STORY BUILDING. 'THE FORCE WAS . . . 
100 TIMES WORSE THAN AN EARTHQUAKE,' ONE OF THE INJURED SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal agents on Friday sifted through smoking rubble in a search for clues 
to a massive explosion that killed three people, demolished an unoccupied 
three-story building and sparked a fire in a neighborhood near Union Square. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast, which occurred shortly before 10 p.m. Thursday, shattered windows 
for several blocks and hurled boulder-sized debris hundreds of yards. One brick 
shot through the window of a passing car, leaving the driver with severe facial 
injuries. Four other people were injured, none critically. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the mysterious explosion packed the force of a bomb and gave 
the intersection of Post and Hyde streets below Nob Hill the look and feel of a 
war zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The force was incredible -- 100 times worse than an earthquake," said Elisa 
Magidoff, who was standing outside a grocery store and was badly cut by flying 
glass. "It came up from the ground, lifted my body and knocked me right over. 
Then there was screaming, smoke and chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Demitro, a palm reader, was closing her shop when the explosion blew out 
her front windows, shattered her crystal ball and knocked her sideways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got jolted, and suddenly the street was filled with a big orange ball of 
fire," Demitro said. "Then that building just disintegrated. Big pieces of it 
came flying down the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten structures were damaged by the explosion, and 11 cars were battered by 
falling rubble. Fractured window frames, glass and mattress stuffing littered 
the pavement, and bedsheets hung from lampposts and overhead wires. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 people were evacuated from nearby apartments; 34 spent Thursday night 
on cots in the ballroom of the St. Francis Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion obliterated the 1907 apartment building, leaving only a 
blackened hole. The structure was owned by Margarita Delpeck, who was its sole 
occupant and lived there part time. She was elsewhere at the time of the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Friday, investigators with the San Francisco Fire Department and the 
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms had not pinpointed the source 
of the blast. Their hunt for clues in the rubble was slowed when the one wall 
left standing had to be demolished for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Several neighbors reported smelling gas in recent weeks, and noted that 
utility crews had done some work on their street last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pacific Gas & Electric officials said a survey turned up no leaks or other 
evidence suggesting that natural gas was to blame. The meter to the building 
was intact, as were pipes leading inside. And a check of the street work, 
concluded in early May, showed nothing was amiss, PG & E spokesman Paul Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation also centered on the possibility that a methamphetamine lab had 
operated clandestinely in the basement of the building. Neighbors wondered 
whether there was a connection with the building owner's long-running feud with 
drug dealers and prostitutes who work the neighborhood. Delpeck's brother was 
assaulted after an argument with the loiterers more than a year ago, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it was a revenge thing," said Kent Marone, who manages an apartment 
building across the street and has worked with Delpeck to fight crime in the 
neighborhood. "There are some tough crankster gangsters around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the three victims, all males, apparently were pedestrians crushed 
when the building collapsed. The coroner could not immediately identify the 
dead, but Marone said one victim was a transvestite prostitute well-known in 
the neighborhood.

CITYSCAPES / EDWARD J. BOYER: RESCUE PLAN GIVES COFFEEHOUSE'S FANS GROUNDS FOR 
HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness . . .  
</P>
<P>
 who wandered around and around at midnight in the railroad yard  
</P>
<P>
 wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts . . .  
</P>
<P>
 -- Allen Ginsberg, "Howl" 
</P>
<P>
 The Espresso Bar is a funky holdover from Old Town Pasadena's pre-scrubbed 
days, a 1950s-style coffeehouse caught in a time warp and surrounded by 
carefully planned, upscale nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Its scene is now dominated by teen-agers who go there to sip caffe latte, 
cappuccino, Jolt -- a cola with double the caffeine and sugar -- Brain Wash 
herbal sodas, Love Potion No. 69, Black Lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
 But it still draws students from the nearby Art Center College of Design, 
Pasadena City College and Caltech. And it attracts a few of what the staff 
calls "O.G.s" -- the "original gangsters" who go back to the coffee bar's 
earliest days. 
</P>
<P>
 It can only be entered from an alley off South Raymond Avenue, just south of 
Colorado Boulevard, where it settled in 1978 when Old Town was a slum with 
dirt-cheap rents making it attractive to artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Called simply the E Bar by regulars, it had been a place where counterculture 
parents brought their children, and some customers now only in their 20s have 
been hanging out there for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have glass tables, and the furniture doesn't match," said Damon 
Fleischman, 25, whose parents first brought him to the coffeehouse when he was 
9. "It doesn't aspire to any particular bourgeois fantasy of what a coffeehouse 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
 An antique, broken jukebox that serves only as decoration sits against one 
wall, a few paces from a battered upright piano that is kept in tune. A 
6-by-6-foot painting of a scene from "Frankenstein" glowers darkly from one 
wall, but across the wooden floor a working fireplace glows on chilly nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The bar's logo is a cracked, steaming coffee cup with wings, and the tips jar 
has a small sign reading: "Build Up Valuable Karma Points." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleischman said the coffeehouse was the first place that let him play his 
acoustic guitar -- that "let me get up and sing bad songs. There were a lot of 
artists around this whole area, and no one cared about it then. Suddenly it's 
become an eyesore." 
</P>
<P>
 The development of Old Town has left the E Bar at war with its gentrified 
neighbors over noise and the crowd it attracts -- and with the city over 
entertainment permits and smoking regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking is no longer allowed inside, a restriction that moved one 16-year-old 
patron to complain that "coffee without cigarettes is like peanut butter 
without jelly." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby businesses are appalled by the "scruffy" teen-agers who hang around a 
wall leading into the E Bar's alley -- smoking, perhaps throwing up or showing 
more affection in public than Colorado Boulevard would like to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Old Town," said manager Erica Rawlings, 20, referring to the 
coffeehouse. "That's New Town out there. People come here to avoid that scene 
out there. People who come here don't have gold cards." 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is that not enough people have been coming. 
</P>
<P>
 The E Bar celebrated its 16th anniversary on Raymond on April 1. Last week, 
owner Gordon Beam told the staff he was closing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the young people who consider the E Bar their second home wouldn't let 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we closed, who knows what kind of hideous place could be here," said 
employee Dave Melrose. "Maybe there would be a valet parking attendant standing 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1976 when the E Bar began, it wasn't even a business. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Thornberry picked up an espresso machine for the friends who hung out 
with him all night while he made cheesecakes in the rented kitchen of a closed 
motel on Arroyo Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his living as a baker and chef, but Thornberry's real passions were 
playing the ponies, hanging around the Mt. Wilson and Mt. Palomar observatories 
and good conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 He collected an intriguing circle whose hearts were still trapped in the 1950s 
of Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Neal Cassady and Ken Kesey. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were lots of places to crash around Colorado Boulevard back then," said 
Beam. "It was sort of an arts scene -- avant-garde filmmakers, painters, 
writers, jazz musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't call themselves beats, Beam said, but they subscribed to Kerouac's 
belief in turning the big wheel -- traveling the circuit from Portland to New 
York to Mexico City and back. Sometimes they made it to Europe or North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 When Thornberry could no longer resist the call of the observatories, he went 
off to live in their shadows before moving on to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 He sold out to another regular, Margaret Schermerhorn, who moved the 
coffeehouse to South Raymond Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Margaret was excited by the scene, and she had a lot of primitive business 
appetite," said Beam. But she found that Thornberry had only made a down 
payment on the espresso machine, and no payments after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "She bought the business to learn she had nothing at all," Beam said. "She 
gets an espresso machine about to be repossessed and the collection of people." 
</P>
<P>
 When Schermerhorn -- "a rural hippie at heart" -- moved to Washington state 
about six years ago, Beam bought the coffee bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Beam, 56, had been living in the Pygmy Forest near Mendocino in the mid-1970s 
when his wife left and he "got burned on the rural scene." He came back to 
Pasadena and studied accounting. Schermerhorn was his first client. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to get a job in the '70s," he said. "I had grown up enough so I 
could sit through a class." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he bought the E Bar, the teen-agers had taken over, "and my 
neighbors just hated me. They hated Margaret. I just inherited the hate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to close was simply a case of expenses being greater than 
revenues. Manager Rawlings said Beam has run up thousands of dollars in debt on 
his credit cards to keep the coffeehouse afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter regulars Jim Gunther and Dave Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 And Beam said he brought in Bad Trip Harry, a third-generation communist from 
Eureka whom Beam describes as "a master of the manifesto." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was on the phone calling CNN," said Beam. "I told him we'd have to shoot a 
helicopter to get on CNN." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunther, Wolf and the coffeehouse's employees quickly pulled together a 
benefit for Memorial Day. Even Thornberry came down from Oregon, telling Beam 
he had retired from cooking because he "couldn't see anybody eating another 
omelet." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven bands played, they sold food and T-shirts, attracted more than 300 
people and netted $3,000. It kept the landlord at bay for another month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bad Trip Harry was fuming that the coffee bar didn't close, Beam said. "He 
wanted to do an article for the L.A. Weekly on its death," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Now nine staff members are working for a share of the business, rather than a 
salary, and they're planning another benefit for July 4. They're also talking 
about advertising -- something they've never done before -- and optimism is 
growing that they may be able to keep the place going as a co-op. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really not thinking about anyone else when I decided to close," said 
Beam. "I got stuck in this capitalist, elitist, sole proprietor accounting 
jive. I had forgotten all about co-ops and communes. I've been down here too 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 But not too long for the people who have worked for him, or who hang out at 
the E Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming here since '79," said Alex Westfall, who works at a nearby 
shop. "Most people don't realize that this place has character. To get rid of 
it is stupid. There's nothing like it in Old Town Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Sarkisian, 17, and Zha Zha Aghili, 16, sat sipping root beer and latte at 
an outdoor table, discussing an upcoming production of a theater group they 
belong to. They began coming to the coffeehouse when they were junior high 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're cool with the staff, they're cool with you," said Zha Zha. "But I 
hate using the word cool. It's so '80s." 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of the E Bar being on the ropes when coffee bars are booming all 
over the Los Angeles area is not lost on the customers and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wanted to exploit itself, it could make a lot of money," said 
Fleischman. "But it would lose the soul that makes it interesting."

MARCH JUST A FIRST STEP, LATINO LEADERS SAY; RIGHTS: NEW STATEWIDE COALITION 
VOWS TO GO ON OFFENSIVE AGAINST WHAT MANY SAY IS A RISING TIDE OF 
IMMIGRANT-BASHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was an impressive, well-organized show of force, the kind of watershed 
event that immigrant advocates had long hoped to mobilize. Thousand of Latinos 
marched along Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles last Saturday in repudiation of 
what many call a rising tide of immigrant-bashing and xenophobia. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the demonstration was a newly formed statewide coalition and a corps of 
young Latino leaders -- typically immigrants or the working-class offspring of 
immigrant parents -- who are far removed from Los Angeles' traditional Eastside 
Latino leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the next several months, you're going to see us on the offensive," said 
Roberto Lovato, executive director of the Central American Resource Center, a 
social service and advocacy organization based in the Pico-Union district west 
of Downtown. "The debate has been one-sided, but not any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovato, a 30-year-old native of San Francisco's Mission District and the son 
of Salvadoran immigrants ("My father was a janitor and my mother was a maid," 
he says) was one of five principal Los Angeles-based march organizers. All of 
them are in their 30s or early 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 The five have long histories with immigrant causes. And all call the march and 
coordinated actions throughout the state a turning point in a debate that, they 
acknowledge, has left them on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This movement is taking off," said Juan Jose Gutierrez, another organizer, 
who came to Los Angeles from Mexico with his family when he was 11 and now 
heads One Stop Immigration, an Eastside center that works primarily with a 
Mexican population. 
</P>
<P>
 The other principal Los Angeles-based organizers were Susan Alva, staff 
attorney with the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles; Arturo 
Vargas, vice president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund, and Jose de Paz, who heads the California Immigrant Workers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of new Latino leaders statewide is part of a strategy designed 
to counter what many in the community view as an anti-immigrant backlash -- 
particularly in California, the nation's battleground on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want new leadership to come along, so we'll hopefully have a long-lasting 
network," said Mario Salgado, a Colombian-born Oakland attorney who heads the 
statewide California Latino Civil Rights Network, the umbrella group formed in 
February that sponsored the march and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 All five Los Angeles-based organizers emphasize the need to galvanize Latinos 
and build bridges to other immigrant groups and non-Latinos. "We want to bring 
people together," Gutierrez said, "re-creating the social quilt that L.A. is 
all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the difficult logistic task of pulling off a large-scale march, 
organizers counted on volunteer help and heavy promotion by neighborhood 
organizations, Roman Catholic parishes and the Spanish-language media. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the event's architects also had to cut through divisions that have 
long fragmented the Latino community. Some differences stem from the Latino 
population's greatly varied nature -- a fact that belies the occasional outside 
perception of a monolithic bloc. In fact, opinion polls show that many Latinos 
condemn unlawful immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Central American expatriates have fought for political asylum 
rights and just conclusions of civil conflict in El Salvador and Guatemala. 
Those often-dramatic battles sometimes overshadowed the plight of the much 
larger Mexican immigrant population, which has generally lacked the focus of 
their Central American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 It was significant, then, that Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan flags were 
hoisted in tandem Saturday, and shouts of "Viva Mexico!" were followed by 
rhythmic exhortations saluting the nations of Central and South America and the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 While stressing links with other communities, organizers leave no doubt that 
this is foremost a Latino movement -- one designed to embrace both new 
immigrants and multi-generational U.S. residents, the undocumented and those 
with legal status. The many attacks on illegal immigrants, they say, are to be 
viewed as assaults on all people of Latin American ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The immigration issue, particularly in California, has very much turned into 
a Latino issue," said Alva, a New York native of Mexican and Dominican descent 
who previously worked with the United Farm Workers union. "We're feeling the 
brunt of it." 
</P>
<P>
 After Saturday's march, jubilant organizers were talking about a broad-based 
movement, a late-century version of the 1960s black civil rights struggle. An 
even larger statewide mass mobilization is planned for Los Angeles in October, 
just weeks before California elections that some view as a referendum on 
immigration issues.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have some tremendous momentum now," said Vargas of MALDEF. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, a 31-year-old native of Los Angeles' Pico-Union district who has a 
master's degree in education from Stanford University, has been with the Los 
Angeles-based fund since 1988. A onetime student body president at Belmont High 
School, he worked for three years in Washington with the National Council of La 
Raza. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the current movement, Vargas said: "We want to demonstrate that there is 
broad opposition to what we consider hate talk." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's immediate targets include Gov. Pete Wilson's reelection campaign 
and the "save our state" initiative, which has been submitted for possible 
inclusion on the November ballot -- and supported by Wilson. The sweeping 
initiative -- which opponents call the most drastic anti-immigrant proposal in 
recent U.S. history -- would, among other things, make illegal immigrants 
ineligible for all but emergency health services, mandate the expulsion of 
undocumented youths from public schools and require police to report illegal 
immigrants to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative opponents are seeking allies among health professionals, educators, 
law enforcement officials, women's groups and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key objective is increasing U.S. citizenship sign-ups among Latino 
immigrants, particularly Mexican nationals -- the largest single group -- who 
have traditionally had lower citizenship naturalization rates than most other 
immigrants. Simultaneously, organizers hope to bolster Latino voter 
registration and turnout among existing citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marching and sloganeering is fine," said Gutierrez of One Stop Immigration, 
"but what ultimately counts is the ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
 Although march organizers are optimistic, they acknowledge that they have a 
long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to lead ourselves," said De Paz, a former Chicano studies teacher who 
heads the California Immigrant Workers Assn., a group affiliated with the 
AFL-CIO, and is spearheading the the Fight Back! campaign. "We're not 
apologizing anymore for being immigrants."

UCLA PAID $1 MILLION IN CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENTS; DOCUMENTS: THE FOUR CASES 
INVOLVED WOMEN WHO WERE RAPED, HARASSED OR FACED DISCRIMINATION. COURT ORDERS 
SCHOOL TO RELEASE DETAILS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 UCLA has paid out more than $1 million in confidential settlements over four 
years to women who were raped, sexually harassed or faced gender discrimination 
at the Westwood school, documents released Friday show. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, the school paid $300,000 to a female student who was raped by two 
men at Reiber Hall, a student dormitory, and in another it paid $330,000 to an 
employee who was allegedly raped, molested and subjected to sexual abuse by a 
supervisor described by the employee's attorney as a figure of "power and 
prestige within the university." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,600 pages of documents from four secret settlements were released 
this week under a recent court order obtained by the Daily Bruin, the UCLA 
student newspaper. The Bruin filed its lawsuit after Chancellor Charles E. 
Young mentioned the settlements in a 1992 news conference but refused to 
provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Mandel, UCLA's vice chancellor for legal affairs, said Friday that 
university officials consider any case of sexual misconduct or discrimination 
regrettable, but he said the number and amounts of the confidential settlements 
were modest for a campus with 20,000 employees, 33,000 students and an annual 
budget of $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandel said the confidential settlements were intended to do the right thing 
for the victims while saving taxpayers money by avoiding the potential expense 
of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for one of the victims, however, said UCLA's response to her 
client's sexual harassment allegations were pitiful and excruciatingly slow. 
Lisa Bloom, the attorney, also said it was the university, not her client, who 
insisted the final 1993 settlement be confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents show that UCLA agreed to pay more than $163,000 to Bloom's 
client, a former manager in the school's Department of Business Enterprises who 
supervised a crew of 40 to 60 student employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman complained that on her first day of work in 1988, her boss came into 
the room and unzipped his pants to tuck his shirt in. She also complained that 
he made profane and sexual remarks, discussed his vasectomy and its subsequent 
reversal, and once declared that he was going home to have "industrial sex" 
with his wife to conceive a child. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal university fact-finding report, dated July, 1992, upheld the 
woman's complaints and confirmed that her supervisor's behavior contributed to 
a department "filled with sexual language, gestures, racial jokes, stories of 
rape and even an alleged suicide attempt." Mandel said the supervisor was 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, UCLA agreed in May, 1990, to pay $330,000 to a woman who 
accused a married faculty member of coercing her into having sexual contact as 
a condition of her employment. She said the faculty member raped her twice one 
evening in his home, then continued to harass her on campus by groping her, 
making sexual remarks and locking her in his office to watch him masturbate. 
The woman eventually suffered an emotional breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the faculty member maintained that the sexual relationship was 
consensual, the university concluded that the woman was a victim of sexual 
harassment. Mandel said Friday that the faculty member was suspended without 
pay in the wake of the allegations but gave no other details. 
</P>
<P>
 In a third case, UCLA paid $300,000 in 1990 to a female student who was raped 
by two intruders in January, 1987, in Reiber Hall. Her attorney, Daniel C. 
Cathcart, said Friday that the university agreed to the settlement after a 
civil court jury deadlocked over charges that UCLA was negligent because it 
failed to provide security in the dorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathcart said security at the dorm was like "Swiss cheese" although officials 
had plenty of warning about potential problems, including complaints about 
Peeping Toms looking into the women's showers. The attorney said his client 
took the settlement because she didn't want to "go through the trauma of a 
second trial." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth case, UCLA paid $255,000 in 1992 to a woman who said she was 
discriminated against on the job because of medical leave she took in the early 
1980s due to complications from a pregnancy. The woman said she was harassed 
because she wanted to work a four-day schedule.

OFFICER'S WIFE SUES SHERIFF FOR BIAS; LAWSUIT: COUPLE ALLEGE THAT THE 
DEPARTMENT'S PRACTICE OF HAVING SPOUSES AT SUBSTATIONS WORK FOR FREE IS 
DISCRIMINATORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 During her tenure at the Los Angeles County sheriff's tiny substation in 
Gorman, Caryn Suhr answered telephones, staffed the front desk, dispatched 
radio calls and cleaned jail cells -- all for free. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because of a longstanding department practice that has the wives of 
deputies who live at the Gorman station perform those duties without pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Suhr, who lived at the station off the Golden State Freeway north of Magic 
Mountain two years ago with her husband, Mark, tried to persuade the department 
to pay her and another deputy's wife at least minimum wage. But the department 
rejected her proposal, saying that the deputies and their wives were adequately 
compensated by getting to live rent-free in a residential compound at the 
station that the county rents for $450 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials also noted that deputies stationed at the remote outpost 
receive a 5.5% bonus annually, which in Mark Suhr's case amounted to about 
$2,000 above his regular pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The department transferred Mark Suhr in late 1992, and, according to the 
couple, mounted a retaliatory campaign against him because of his wife's 
outspokenness, including an internal investigation that was later dropped for 
lack of evidence. The Suhrs also allege that someone from the department 
planted drugs in Mark Suhr's patrol car and harassed his family with obscene 
and threatening phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to win direct compensation for the wives, the couple have filed a 
lawsuit against the county, the Sheriff's Department and Sheriff Sherman Block, 
alleging sex and marital status discrimination and various violations of labor 
law. In addition to seeking millions of dollars in monetary damages for back 
wages and emotional distress, the Suhrs want the Sheriff's Department to pledge 
that it will pay wages to spouses who live and work at the Gorman substation, 
and to encourage female deputies to apply for the two Gorman posts. 
</P>
<P>
 The department would not comment on the case, but in court papers disputes the 
Suhrs' allegations. Capt. Mike Quinn, who is in charge of the Gorman station, 
said the department does not require the wives of Gorman deputies to work, 
although he acknowledged that they often perform duties at the station, such as 
dispatching and answering phones. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the Suhrs) knew ahead of time what they were getting into. It's not as 
though the county increased its demands. The only change was in their demands," 
said Dennis Gonzales, a principal county counsel supervising the case. "This is 
a very popular position -- people are lining up to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Two deputies and their wives now live at the station and one has signed a 
waiver agreeing to volunteer her services to the department for free, 
department officials said. The women could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suhrs' case astounds and outrages women's groups, who consider the 
department's policy archaic and unjust. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Neanderthal," said Carol Sobel, senior staff counsel for the American 
Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. "Even though they get free living 
space . . . she misses out on Social Security and pension benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 The International Assn. of Women Police, a group not usually known for liberal 
positions, also sides with the Suhrs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shame on the department," said Gale Buckner, special agent in charge of the 
Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the association's president. "It's a sad 
commentary that to get this choice assignment an officer has to bring along as 
chattel a spouse to do menial labor without compensation." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the sheriff said Friday that Block declined to comment on the 
matter because of the pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to court documents, Block wrote Caryn Suhr a sympathetic letter 
about 2 1/2 years ago in response to her pay request. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though funding and finances are always a problem, I have directed our 
Personnel Services staff to expedite a classification study of the work you 
consistently perform," Block said in the letter dated Nov. 8, 1991. "It is my 
hope that we can identify an appropriate job classification and then obtain the 
requisite funding." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Suhrs, the department's study showed that the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department pays the wives of deputies who live at a remote 
substation, even though the families live there rent-free. The wives are 
classified as communications operators and are paid for 30 hours a month at a 
starting salary of $9.30 an hour, Chief Ken Kipp said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite people's perception of the clear blue sky and all of these rural 
places, living there is a major inconvenience," Kipp said. "It uproots you from 
your local school or church, and the couples work hard." 
</P>
<P>
 But after reviewing the study, Los Angeles County officials rejected Caryn 
Suhr's request. Her husband was later transferred to the Santa Clarita station. 
</P>
<P>
 Caryn Suhr, 39, said Thursday that she expressed a desire to be paid in 1990, 
when Sheriff's Department officials interviewed her and her husband for the 
job. Caryn Suhr, who quit a $12-an-hour job as a grocery clerk to move up to 
Gorman, said she was told the department was looking into paying the wives 
sometime in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was interviewed by sheriff's officials, she said, she and the other 
wives were asked whether they would be willing to search female inmates and if 
they knew how to operate guns. "At times I felt as if I was an officer myself," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an example of what spouses at the remote station might be expected to face, 
the wives were told that in 1978 a deputy assigned to the Gorman station was 
killed by a North Hollywood man, who was then disarmed by the deputy's wife. 
But for the most part, their duties involved answering phones, dispatching 
radio calls and occasionally administering first aid to travelers through the 
mountain town 60 miles north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for the wives on the radio, we could be killed and no one would 
even know for days," Mark Suhr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caryn Suhr said that pursuing the wage issue was difficult because she was 
torn between helping her husband's career and "doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the worst dilemma of my life," she said, adding that she was 
hospitalized for stress and depression shortly before her husband was ordered 
to leave Gorman. "But I saw it was wrong immediately, and I'm not a person who 
sits in a corner and lets things go by."

 He's no Maury Wills when it comes to stealing second: A neighbor of ours, who 
was attending a Dodger game on Beach Towel Night, set out for the concession 
stand after he was handed his souvenir. Then it occurred to him that a friend 
who lives in the East might also like one. So he stashed his Dodger towel with 
a companion and went back to get another. (What would be the harm?) 
</P>
<P>
 "I circled around near the turnstiles and walked back," he related. "As soon 
as I got the second towel, I heard a voice on a walkie-talkie say, 'We have a 
two-time toweler here -- he went back through the line.' I don't know if the 
guy was watching from somewhere above or what. But he must have had his eye on 
me the whole time. Then I felt a hand on my shoulder and a guard grabbed the 
towel."

 What was that old Ogden Nash ditty about a one-L lama being a priest, a two-L

 "This area used to double for desert prairies in many of the old Hollywood

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; GTE LINEMAN 
HELPS CATCH PURSE-SNATCHING SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A GTE employee was hailed as a hero Friday for helping police catch a man who 
allegedly snatched a purse from a 98-year-old Long Beach woman on her way to 
deposit money she had received for her birthday.  
</P>
<P>
 "She was heading to the bank when the guy just came up and grabbed it from 
her," said Long Beach Police Sgt. Chuck Higley.She was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman turned 98 on Sunday and had about $100 in cash in the purse, Higley 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 After being accosted about 4 p.m. Thursday in the 200 block of Long Beach 
Boulevard, the woman flagged down a police officer, who broadcast a description 
of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Scott Jeffers was working on a telephone pole when he saw a man run 
past with a purse under his arm, Higley said. Jeffers came down the pole, 
learned of the robbery and told police where he had seen the man run.  
</P>
<P>
 Two Long Beach police bicycle patrol officers soon found Patrick Walker, 36, 
in a nearby alley in the 400 block of East 3rd Street and arrested him, Higley 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is through cooperative efforts such as this that we can make an impact on 
crime in our city," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAN 
ACQUITTED OF MURDER IN FATAL AMBUSH CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Von Raymond Pledger, charged with murder after a man involved in the ambushing 
of two anti-gang police officers was killed, was acquitted Friday after four 
days of jury deliberations. He had spent 10 months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was innocent from the beginning. It was a waste of taxpayers money," said 
Allena Pledger, the acquitted man's mother. "He was in jail 10 months for 
something he did not do." 
</P>
<P>
 Pledger, 27, and another man, suspected of ambushing two officers in 
South-Central Los Angeles, were charged with murder because another alleged 
attacker was killed when police returned fire. Pledger was visiting from 
Minnesota at the time of his arrest last year, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the trial, Pledger's attorney presented his client's alibi, derailing the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have reasonable doubt, you can't return a guilty verdict," said Sandi 
Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. "The identification 
issue was the key issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Terrance Thomas, the other man charged with murder in the incident, was killed 
in a gang shooting shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
 Pledger had been charged with murder, attempted murder, assault with a firearm 
on a police officer, and various other charges. He was acquitted of all 
charges.

<P>
 Two dozen Spanish-language radio stations in Southern California, including 
nine in Los Angeles, will join forces today in a 12-hour radio marathon to 
benefit the Leukemia Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a drive not just to raise money for leukemia research, but also to 
encourage Latinos -- who make up 75% of all leukemia patients in Southern 
California -- to donate bone marrow for transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need Hispanic donors," said Sam Thomas, senior executive director 
of the Leukemia Society. Only 5% of all donors nationwide are Latinos.

PENSION STUDY COULD DERAIL COUNTY BUDGET PLAN; GOVERNMENT: RETIREMENT FUND'S 
DEFICIT HAS GROWN BY $362 MILLION, REPORT FINDS. A PROPOSAL TO SHIFT UP TO $150 
MILLION TO PAY FOR OTHER PROGRAMS MAY BE JEOPARDIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A key source of funds for the precariously balanced Los Angeles County budget 
is now in jeopardy, as the result of a new study that shows a surprise 
weakening in the finances of the county's giant retirement fund. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a financial study obtained by The Times, the deficit at the 
pension fund grew by $362 million during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 That finding, scheduled to be presented to the Los Angeles County Retirement 
Assn. next week, could dash plans to siphon as much as $150 million from the 
pension fund to pay for other county programs and bring the budget into 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials had hoped the report by an independent consultant would show 
that the pension fund's finances had improved enough during the year to provide 
excess earnings that could be used for other purposes. Without those funds, the 
budget writers could be forced to slash programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the (deficit) would have come down," said County Chief 
Administrative Officer Sally Reed. "This is not what I had hoped for." 
</P>
<P>
 The pension fund did earn about $150 million more on its investments in the 
past year than had been expected, the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to the report, the county is still paying a high price for 
controversial changes to the pension system that spiked the retirement pay for 
the highest-ranking county officials by 20%. The maneuver cost the pension fund 
$500 million. That was part of the reason the pension fund's finances declined 
in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Board of Supervisors took steps to pare back the unusually generous 
pension benefits, but it was unable to undo most of the damage, the report 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said that the disappointing figures do not eliminate the possibility of 
the county getting all or part of the $150 million it was counting on, but they 
will certainly make it much more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha D. Richter, chief executive of the retirement system, was out of town 
Friday and could not be reached for comment on the report. The Board of 
Retirement and the Board of Investment, which govern the retirement system and 
which will make the decision to release or withhold the $150 million, are 
scheduled to hear a presentation on the report on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirement system officials stated earlier that they are opposed to pumping 
$150 million into the county budget, and the findings of the actuary are 
expected to harden their position.

RITCHIE VALENS PARK NEARER REALITY; RECREATION: COUNCIL VOTES TO RENAME A 
PACOIMA SITE FOR THE LATE SINGER. COMMISSION MUST APPROVE THE ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A small park in the heart of the working-class Pacoima neighborhood where he 
grew up may soon be renamed Ritchie Valens Park to honor the late rock 'n' roll 
legend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Friday to rename Paxton Park, 
drawing applause from half a dozen of Valens' family members and friends who 
carried a banner and photo of the teen-age rock star. The name change must be 
approved by the city's Recreation and Parks Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Richard Valenzuela in Pacoima, Valens gained fame in the 1950s before 
dying at 17 in a 1959 plane crash that also claimed the lives of singers Buddy 
Holly and B.P. (the Big Bopper) Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 Valens received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1990 after the movie 
"La Bamba" recounted his life and sparked a resurgence of interest in the 
musician. The U.S. Postal Service later issued a 29-cent stamp bearing his 
likeness. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents Pacoima, said he proposed the name 
change so that children in the northeastern San Fernando Valley neighborhood 
can remember Valens' humble background and emulate his accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ritchie Valens was someone I admired while growing up," Alarcon said. "He 
came up against all the odds." 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Flores, a community activist and friend of Valens' family, echoed 
those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 The park should be renamed "so children can have a role model and shoot for 
the stars, just like Ritchie did," he told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Valens rose from obscurity as a teen-age guitar player in Pacoima to gain 
international attention for such hits as "Come On, Let's Go" and "Donna," a 
love song about his high school sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
 But he will probably be best remembered for "La Bamba," a rock rendition of a 
Latino folk dance tune that was on the flip side of "Donna." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Recreation and Parks Commission votes on the name change, a public 
hearing on the proposal will be held in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 Paxton Park, 24 acres in the shadow of the Simi Valley and Golden State 
freeways, was named for the street that borders it on the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 The street was named in 1888 for Catherine Paxton Maclay, daughter of Charles 
Maclay, one of the founders of the city of San Fernando and developer of the 
Maclay Rancho.

AL MARTINEZ: LIFE ON THE STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a little over three years ago that we rode these streets, the day after 
the Rodney King beating, and now we were riding them again, the day after what 
most of us hope will be the last Rodney King verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the first ride was an accident. Undercover narcotics cop Daniel 
Armand had written me about the cost of a policeman's life in a city growing 
meaner by the minute. 
</P>
<P>
 He was working out of the Rampart Division then, just west of Downtown in a 
dangerous part of L.A. A woman under the influence of drugs had attacked him 
with a knife and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. She was out in 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she'd sold me a joint that day, she'd have done three months," Armand 
wrote. "But she only tried to kill a cop. Ten days." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a compelling letter and I asked to ride his beat with him and talk more 
about the perils that hide in the shadows of the alleys he patrolled. We set a 
date: March 4, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But events the night before -- the videotaped beating of Rodney King -- 
intervened. A column of modest praise for a cop doing a tough job became 
instead a monologue of regret. 
</P>
<P>
 Armand was embarrassed by what he saw on the videotape. He called the beaters 
thugs and said angrily, "Now everyone's thinking we're all like that. Who's 
going to believe we're not the same kind of cop?" 
</P>
<P>
 His attitude has changed since then. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After four trials and a devastating riot, two policemen are in prison and King 
is $3.8 million richer. And Armand's anger has been redirected. 
</P>
<P>
 He's 40 now and on patrol in the Hollywood Division, but I took him back to 
Rampart to re-create our conversation. We cruised the area around MacArthur 
Park, down Alvarado and across Wilshire, over Bonnie Brae and up Burlington. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw what he called business as usual: a dealer operating at a busy street 
corner on Westlake. He shook his head. "They're not even in alleys anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But they were there too, buying and selling like traders in an open-air 
market, gathered in clusters, grouped in pairs or leaning against 
graffiti-scrawled walls, lost in half-lit worlds of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing ever changes," Armand said, bringing his 9-millimeter Beretta up from 
under the car seat to put next to him. 
</P>
<P>
 But things do change. The anger he once felt toward the cops who beat Rodney 
King isn't there anymore. He says almost reluctantly that maybe Laurence Powell 
was excessive in his treatment of King, but mostly he feels sorry for the 
officers involved. Now he calls King a thug. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first saw the video I thought it was terrible," he said as we drove. 
"But I didn't know then there'd been a pursuit or that there were two others in 
the car. It was just an incident that made the whole department look bad. I 
hope it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Other problems occupy his mind now, including a sense of isolation in the 
LAPD. "If I've learned anything in the past three years," he said, "it's that 
you can't trust anyone in the upper echelon of either the department or the 
city. We're alone out here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They were strange words from a man who says he loves police work and the 
department he works for. Even patrolling the worst parts of town, he finds good 
people, and he was touched by the residents of South-Central who brought food 
and encouragement to cops trying to quell the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 But Armand feels betrayed by a city that won't honor the risks its police 
officers take by giving them a decent raise. He has marched twice in 
demonstrations for a new contract and, were he not already scheduled to have 
the days off, would have come down with a migraine during the course of the 
"blue flu." 
</P>
<P>
 "Riordan says he wants to turn this city around," he said, circling MacArthur 
Park. "He'd damned well better remember that he can't do it without us." 
</P>
<P>
 The cop I rode with the other day isn't the same man I rode with three years 
ago. He's uneasy in the work he does, less aggressive on the street for fear of 
reprimand, burdened by new departmental rules that have turned gender respect 
into gender enmity, and envious of fellow officers leaving L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been a tumultuous three years. Armand is caught up in a vortex of 
change that has created distrust and confusion. It was almost a plea when he 
said, "All I want to be able to do is go out there and catch bad guys." After a 
moment he added, "I'm not sure that's possible anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 We rode in silence out of Rampart, slowing briefly by an alley. He squinted 
into the sun at a group of men in silhouette at the far end. They were dealing. 
Armand drove off and said nothing.

CLEARED IN TRIALS, BRISENO SEEKS TO RETURN TO LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Officer Theodore J. Briseno bitterly accused the Los Angeles Police Department 
on Friday of wasting taxpayers money -- and possibly breaking the law -- by 
refusing to reinstate him after three juries said he did not use excessive 
force in the beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno, one of six officers who escaped punitive damages this week in King's 
civil case, has been on unpaid leave since eight days after the March 3, 1991, 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno said he could not understand the department's refusal to put him back 
on the force, despite the outcome of King's recent lawsuit and acquittals in 
two trials. He vowed to sue if he was denied a position on the force. 
"Everything I did I felt was the right thing to have done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno, 41, blamed the continued grudges of LAPD's middle management, in 
particular ranking officers in the Internal Affairs Department, for keeping him 
out of uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spoke the truth and it hurt some people," Briseno said at a news conference 
outside attorney Gregory Petersen's Orange County office. "It hurt and they 
didn't like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno, who lives in Los Angeles, lost his countersuit against King this 
week, in which he alleged that King had struck him while he tried to handcuff 
the motorist. The jury found that Briseno had been hit but refused to award him 
any punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen said he sent a letter to LAPD Chief Willie L. Williams on Thursday 
demanding Briseno's reinstatement. Williams could not be reached for comment 
Friday night. Petersen said William's office told him that internal Board of 
Rights hearings on Briseno's conduct will continue. The next hearing is set for 
June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen maintained that the Board of Rights "is not entitled to come to a 
decision different from the court. If they decide anything different from this 
they would be unlawful." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, the decision of a federal jury takes precedent over the 
findings of the police board, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno promised to head back to court if the department does not reinstate 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to stand here and tell you I'm not tired of courts," he said. 
"(But) I'm a Los Angeles police officer. I'm not going away. I'm staying right 
here. If the department wants to continue to do this, I have no problem with 
(going back to court)." 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno said he continues to be hounded by people who recognize him in public, 
but he said that has not dissuaded him from rejoining the force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still a Los Angeles police officer. You can get lost out there," he said. 
"There are plenty of jobs out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to be with my family and to go somewhere and wake up and not have 
the King incident on my mind," he said. "I'm very confident that I'm going to 
continue to be a Los Angeles police officer."

 Officer Theodore J. Briseno, one of six officers who escaped punitive damages 
in Rodney G. King's lawsuit this week, alleged Friday that the Los Angeles

 Petersen said he sent a letter to Police Chief Willie L. Williams on Thursday 
demanding Briseno's reinstatement. He said William's office told him they would 
continue internal Board of Rights hearings into Briseno's conduct. The next 
hearing is set for June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 But Petersen maintained that the LAPD Board of Rights "is not entitled to come 
to a decision different from the court. If they decide anything different from 
this they would be unlawful." 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno said he will return to court if the department does not reinstate him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to stand here and tell you I'm not tired of courts," he said. 
"(But) I'm a Los Angeles police officer. I'm not going away. I'm staying right 
here. If the department wants to continue to do this, I have no problem with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno said life has not gotten any easier since the verdicts. People 
recognize him when he's pumping gas or going to the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to be with my family and to go somewhere and wake up and not have 
the King incident on my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno said he believes that he will ultimately triumph in his campaign to 
regain his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very confident that I'm going to continue to be a Los Angeles police 
officer."

SEMINARY PRESIDENT CALLS FOR CIVILITY IN DEBATING FIERY ISSUES; CONTROVERSY: 
FULLER PRESIDENT SAYS ARROGANCE CAN HAMPER THE ARGUMENTS OF THOSE WHO TAKE 
HARSH STANDS ON MATTERS SUCH AS ABORTION AND HOMOSEXUALITY.

<P>
 When angry Christians shout "Murderers!" at abortion rights advocates, or 
taunt gays and lesbians by chanting, "God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and 
Steve," the president of the Fuller Theological Seminary winces. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many times, "our fundamental posture is chip-on-our-shoulder, we're right 
and everybody else is wrong, triumphalist and arrogant," said Richard J. Mouw, 
president of the Pasadena school, the nation's largest nondenominational 
seminary. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Mouw tends to take conservative views on abortion and homosexuality, he 
is seeking to convince fellow believers that they should show a lot more 
"Christian civility" in addressing moral issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Mouw said that legislation signed into law last week that bars abortion clinic 
blockades and harassment was not necessarily a bad thing for the anti-abortion 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is obvious that the more violent and coercive protests at clinics have 
done nothing to change the climate of opinion on abortion," he said. "What we 
need is a dialogue in which we listen to one another and find other ways to 
state our convictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Mouw first outlined his call for Christian civility in "Uncommon Decency," a 
book published by InterVarsity Press in 1992, and last fall it found an 
interested reader at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 When President Clinton invited a dozen evangelical leaders, including Mouw, to 
a White House breakfast in November, the president asked for a copy of the 
book. Clinton wrote a note to Mouw shortly thereafter, saying he found his 
ideas helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has expressed frustration over a barrage of attacks on him and his 
Administration in recent months. In a speech at UCLA, for example, he bemoaned 
"the destructive tone of public discourse in America today." 
</P>
<P>
 The President's troubles notwithstanding, many commentators have decried in 
general the heated tone of public debate today. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the sharpest words have emanated from Christian conservatives, 
prompting alarmed responses from Mouw and other influential evangelicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Jack Hayford of Church on the Way in Van Nuys, one of those invited to 
the November briefing at the White House, "delivered an eloquent apology for 
the un-Christlike way in which many Christians had treated the President," 
according to another participant, Philip Yancey, an editor at Christianity 
Today magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayford has also lamented what he calls "friendly fire," casualties inflicted 
by churches on fellow Christians. Writing in his church newsletter in April, 
Hayford cited "carping criticism, the self-righteous salvos and the tireless 
nit-picking" that arise over differences in doctrine and styles of ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Colson, an influential evangelical writer and commentator, recently 
wrote in Christianity Today: "How can Christians encourage fellow citizens to 
respect authority if we ourselves do not show the utmost civility?" 
</P>
<P>
 Colson pointed to Mother Teresa's remarks against abortion early this year at 
the National Prayer Breakfast with Clinton present. "Mother Teresa was 
invariably polite and respectful," Colson wrote. "Yet she did not flinch in 
speaking the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Mouw said that evangelicals should at times take uncompromising 
stands and issue stern calls for morality, but that Christians should display a 
politeness and consideration of others. "When George Bush spoke of a kinder and 
gentler nation a few years back, I said, 'Amen,' " said Mouw. 
</P>
<P>
 Mouw taught philosophy at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., before 
joining the Fuller faculty in 1985. He succeeded David Hubbard as president in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mouw was among younger evangelicals 
calling for their churches to become more socially and politically active. His 
first book was titled "Political Evangelism." Evangelicals became more visible 
on national issues in the late 1970s and the Christian right gained prominence 
in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1990s, when I looked back on it," Mouw said in an interview, "I 
thought maybe it was time to call the whole thing off. Those pleas for 
evangelicals to get involved have been too successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evangelicals have entered into the public arena with the same kind of 
oversimplification, the same cliches and sloganeering kind of mentality that 
had characterized our dealing with other kinds of issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incivility is by no means the exclusive property of the (religious) right," 
he added. "Liberation theologians on the left speak in very uncivil terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Mouw said that he urges a new period of "Christian gentleness" as something 
that is in keeping with biblical advice -- not as something that might be good 
political strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it may very well be that people will hear us better if we speak out of 
our own pilgrimage with a kind and self-critical spirit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But ultimately we do it because that's the kind of people God wants us to 
be," Mouw said. In his book and in seminars he led on the topic at the 
Evangelical Press Assn. convention last month in Costa Mesa, Mouw uses 
Scripture to illustrate his claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer of the Letter to the Hebrews (12:14) urges Christians to "pursue 
peace with everyone." In the 12th chapter of Romans, the Apostle Paul advises 
love, patience and humility in relations with others. Titus (3:2) urges 
Christians "to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle and to 
show every courtesy to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 In Peter, Mouw said, one sees what civility is about for the committed 
Christian: "Always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you 
an accounting for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and 
reverence." (1 Peter 3:15-16) 
</P>
<P>
 Mouw said that sometimes Christian activists and preachers employ a crusading 
spirit in which anything goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get anywhere by misrepresenting another person's position," said 
Mouw. Labeling abortion-rights advocates murderers is misrepresentation because 
"they are not really excited about murdering babies," Mouw said. "There are 
other (motivations) there." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the biblical commandment not to kill is invoked, Mouw said, "one of 
the other Ten Commandments is, 'Thou shall not bear false witness.' "

POPE'S LETTER MAY CHILL ECUMENICAL RELATIONS; CATHOLICISM: PAPAL STATEMENT 
AGAINST WOMEN AS PRIESTS MAY IMPAIR DEALINGS WITH ANGLICAN COMMUNION, SOME 
FEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II's apostolic letter reaffirming church doctrine that women 
cannot become priests continues to reverberate around the globe, with some 
observers worried that relations between Catholics and non-Catholics will 
suffer as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a moment of sharply diminished ecumenical expectations," said Father 
Richard John Neuhaus, the Catholic priest who heads the New York-based 
Institute on Religion and Public Life. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the surprise of nearly everyone, this (issue of ordaining women) has been 
a big question ecumenically," said Neuhaus, who believes the Catholic Church is 
still committed to ecumenical dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, people didn't think women's ordination would be such a 
divisive issue on ecclesial reconciliation," said Neuhaus, who converted to 
Catholicism from Lutheranism three years ago. "This shows that none of us 
controls history, including Rome." 
</P>
<P>
 Public concern has been particularly pronounced among those of the worldwide 
Anglican Communion, which for years has engaged in highly publicized church 
unity discussions with the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Church of England -- the mother church of the Anglican Communion 
-- began ordaining women as priests in March, and speculation by church and 
ecumenical observers has been rife that the Pope's letter, dated May 22 and 
released May 30, was a signal that he is deeply unhappy with that development. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, including Neuhaus, have speculated that the Pope was trying to settle 
any confusion over the Vatican's announcement earlier this spring that Catholic 
girls could assist priests during Mass, serving as equals with boys at the 
altar. Some saw that announcement as a signal that the Vatican might reconsider 
the long-held doctrine that women cannot be ordained as priests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anglican Communion's spiritual leader, Archbishop of Canterbury George 
Carey, said Wednesday that although dialogue between the two churches has 
resulted in "substantial agreement on a number of matters which previously 
divided us," the Pope's letter calls into question continuing dialogue between 
the two churches on the issue of ordaining women as priests. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, the Pope said that in order that "all doubt may be removed" 
regarding the issue of ordaining women, he was declaring that the church "has 
no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this 
judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful." 
</P>
<P>
 Carey, who tartly assailed the Pope's letter for advancing theological 
arguments that other churches, including his own, have not found convincing, 
also said that "some clarification is required of the Roman Catholic Church as 
to how it sees the future of the ecumenical endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
 In a June 1 statement, Gunnar Staalsett, the general secretary of the Lutheran 
World Federation, expressed surprise at the tone, though not the content, of 
the Pope's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Staalsett, who heads a federation of 114 Lutheran churches representing about 
54 million Lutherans worldwide, joined Carey in discounting the theological 
arguments for not ordaining women -- including the fact that Jesus did not have 
female disciples -- saying that Catholic and Lutheran theologians have found 
them wanting. 
</P>
<P>
 He also echoed his Anglican colleague in wondering whether the pontiff's 
letter "will undermine the ecumenical dialogue by its rigid claim regarding 
truth and by what seems to be an attempt to remove the question of ordaining 
women as priests from the ecumenical agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our conviction that it is precisely in ecumenical discussion that the 
Holy Spirit can lead us to new insights into the Holy Scriptures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brother Jeffrey Gros, associate director of the Secretariat for Ecumenical and 
Interreligious Affairs of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the 
intensity of reaction to the Pope's statement among Protestants caught him by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have known this for 30 years," Gros said of Protestant churches 
entering into dialogue with the Catholic Church, knowing all the while that 
women's ordination would be an issue of disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect this will be throwing cold water onto this process. If there 
are problems, it will say more about those making the criticism than about the 
Catholic Church," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the matter a "tempest in a teapot," Gros added that the tempest began 
in the Reformation four centuries ago, and that ecumenical dialogue has to be 
seen over a large span of history. 
</P>
<P>
 While not minimizing the differences between the churches on the issue of 
women's ordination, he said Pope John Paul II is not signaling a cooling off of 
dialogue between the churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talks of unity will continue at a steady pace. We're still at an early stage, 
and we move in increments," said Gros, who previously served as director of the 
Faith and Order unit of the National Council of Churches. 
</P>
<P>
 But J. Robert Wright, a professor of church history at the General Theological 
Seminary, an Episcopal school in New York City that has participated in 
international Anglican-Catholic dialogues, said the effect of the Pope's letter 
on ecumenical relations cannot be minimized. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pope has upped the ante," he said. "He has made the dialogue hinge on 
this issue in a way that it didn't before. Never before has the Roman church 
said it couldn't even discuss this matter. That presents a real ecumenical 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Although John Paul's statement fell just short of being a matter of papal 
infallibility, Wright said, it is likely to have the effect of ending debate on 
the issue within the highest level of the church for decades at least. 
</P>
<P>
 History, Wright added, provides some clue about where this might lead. At the 
time of Council of Trent, held between 1545-63, Pope Pius V issued the Roman 
Missal, or book of prayers for Mass, which was declared to be authoritative for 
all time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the missal was eventually changed, during the Second Vatican Council of 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolute papal statements sound very absolute at the time they are 
delivered," Wright said. "But over the centuries, they change."

 If 10 years experience has taught him anything, says Paul Crissey of the 
California Consortium to Prevent Child Abuse, it is that faith communities and 
the clergy have a tremendous role to play in the prevention and treatment of a 
rampant problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The consortium, a statewide nonprofit organization, is holding a conference 
titled "In the Name of the Children" in Burbank on Thursday for members of the 
clergy, representatives of religious organizations and advocates for abused 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 About 92,000 children are in foster care homes in California -- most of them 
removed from their parents or guardians because of abuse or endangerment, said 
Crissey, who directs training for the Sacramento-based group. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people under stress and prone to abusive behavior see clergy 
regularly," he said. "Religious communities are in a good position to get 
involved -- especially if they learn to recognize the symptoms of abuse in 
families, get training in prevention and understand the reporting laws." 
</P>
<P>
 That is why the consortium -- a chapter of the National Committee to Prevent 
Child Abuse -- has established an active, 12-member clergy advisory board, 
which it plans to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Crissey said many therapists have told him that they believed in "a spiritual 
component to the healing process," but that almost none of them felt 
comfortable discussing that aspect of the process with their clients. At the 
same time, he said, most members of the clergy feel inadequately skilled to 
deal with abuse problems, which crop up frequently in pastoral counseling, but 
have no network of qualified lay counselors to turn to. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving the wedge deeper between religion and therapy, Crissey said, is the 
perception of some caseworkers and therapists that strong religious beliefs are 
a symptom of pathology -- and the suspicion among some clergy members that 
caseworkers are secularists who think nothing of breaking up churchgoing 
families by using the state's power to remove children from families when abuse 
has been alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bridges must be built between clergy and therapists," he said. "We need to 
talk to each other. We do not see involvement of the clergy as a one-way street 
where we have an agenda and tell them what we want them to do. We want to open 
dialogue, to talk about what programs are working in religious communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Two successful programs in Southern California, he said, are the 
Adopt-a-Child-Abuse-Caseworker program sponsored by the San Fernando Valley 
Interfaith Council and the One Church, One Child adoption program that the Los 
Angeles County Department of Children's Services operates in conjunction with 
churches in the African American community. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference will be held from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Hilton Hotel in 
Burbank. Three plenary sessions and six workshops will be conducted on such 
topics as ministering to abusers, ethics and liability in child-abuse reporting 
by the clergy, and replicating successful programs. Keynote speeches will be 
delivered by cultural anthropologist Erlyene Piper Mandy and author Little 
Crow, co-founder of the American Indian Unity Church. Admission is $25, 
including lunch. Reservations are recommended. For information, contact Paul 
Crissey by phone (916) 648-8010 or fax (916) 648-8007.

CONSUMER WATCH; ATM TUNEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Automated teller machines have been a boon to consumer convenience, no doubt 
about that. But ATMs have been an equal boon for U.S. banks, saving them $2.34 
billion a year that otherwise would be paid to human tellers, in addition to 
bringing in $2.9 billion a year in transaction fees, a study by the Consumer 
Federation of America has found. 
</P>
<P>
 The fees are incurred by customers when they use an ATM that's not part of the 
banking chain in which they have an account; the charges typically run from 
$1.50 to $3 per transaction and cost the average cardholder a hefty $37 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least the fees ought to be disclosed on the ATM screen at the time 
of the transaction, not buried in a monthly statement. Bankers respond that to 
do so would be inconvenient, though not technologically impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe that if consumers were reminded each time, banks might feel a 
little competitive heat to lower fees. And isn't that what the magic of the 
marketplace is about?

BLOW AWAY ALL THE SMOKE; WERE SIGNERS MISLED ON PHILIP MORRIS-BACKED PETITION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no doubt that a lot of voters who signed petitions to qualify a 
smoking initiative for the November ballot in California thought they were 
supporting a tough anti-smoking plan. In fact, the measure's aim is to weaken 
existing local restrictions on smoking in public places. The reasonable 
question is whether the signers were deliberately misled. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller is one of those who believes they were. 
He wants permission from a Sacramento court to ask 400 or more randomly chosen 
signers what they were told by signature gatherers. Miller says documents 
indicate the petition circulators were told not to reveal that the initiative 
would wipe out strong local anti-smoking laws. Nor was the sponsor of the 
initiative to be identified as Philip Morris, the nation's largest tobacco 
company, which has spent just under $500,000 to qualify it. Had that been 
known, many might have had second thoughts about signing the petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris denies any wrongdoing, and there apparently is no precedent of a 
court allowing the kind of questioning of petition signers that Miller has 
requested. Certainly, too, this is not the first initiative to be signed by 
voters who were unclear or in the dark about what they were lending their names

 Noting all that, health-conscious Californians are still left with the 
dismaying prospect of finding a regressive and deceptive so-called anti-smoking 
initiative on their November ballot. That measure would wipe out many of the 
gains made at the local level to ban smoking in public places, allowing instead 
a statewide easing of rules on smoking in restaurants that -- no surprise -- 
would benefit the initiative's sponsor. What the court will do with Miller's 
request is uncertain. What the voters should do if this duplicitous initiative 
reaches the ballot is as clear as can be.

A FOOT IN THE LOCAL DOOR; IN MISSION VIEJO, U.S. SOCCER TEAM ALREADY IS A 
WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the rest of the world works itself into a fever over professional soccer's 
World Cup, the United States seems successfully inoculated. Even the sport's 
name is different here: It's called football everywhere else.But sometimes the 
low-key atmosphere is not such a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year, the U.S. soccer team has had its training center in 
Mission Viejo. Local residents helped candidates for the team learn the 
neighborhood, find good restaurants, pick motels and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The players reciprocated, happily signing autographs for youngsters, standing 
still for photographs, behaving like nice guys instead of spoiled brats. It 
proved a refreshing change from millionaires in American baseball, basketball 
and football occasionally insulting fans and even charging for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although youth soccer has long been popular here, American professional 
players run no risk of being mobbed while walking down the street. There is a 
faint chance that could change in less than two weeks, when World Cup play 
begins in the United States for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The quadrennial event will obviously stir passions among the sizable number of 
Americans born in countries where soccer is the dominant sport; scalpers are 
already bidding up tickets for the championship match at the Rose Bowl July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, many Southern California fans have enjoyed seeing the practices 
from front-row seats in a casual atmosphere, much as baseball fans could during 
spring training decades ago. The team, which in past World Cup years lived out 
of suitcases while moving from town to town, got a sense of stability, thanks 
to Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been fun having the players train locally, and they will break camp in a 
week with the paradox intact: A country that makes heroes of athletes largely 
ignores sportsmen who would be lionized abroad.

KIDNAP RUMORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Opinion article by Victor Perera, "Behind the Kidnaping of Children for 
Their Organs" (May 1), gives credence to the totally false rumor that Latin 
American children are being kidnaped for organ transplants. Perera cites Eric 
Sottas, head of the Geneva-based World Organization Against Torture, who 
supposedly lists six "confirmed" cases. The facts tell a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Sottas cites the claim that 3,000 Brazilian children adopted by 
Italians are missing -- allegedly for the organ trade. If Sottas had checked 
with Italian officials, he would have found that Brazilian emigration and 
Italian immigration statistics match perfectly -- there are no missing 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Sottas cites a patient from an Argentine insane asylum who said his 
corneas were forcibly removed. In April, Madrid's ABC newspaper revealed this 
story was a fabrication. The patient had lost eyesight from a "viral 
infection." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding Peru, Sottas repeats claims made by the International Assn. of 
Democratic Lawyers, a former Soviet front group that repeated Soviet 
disinformation for decades. They have never provided any evidence to 
substantiate "baby parts" claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding Colombia, Sottas repeats charges by French communist Maite Pinero, 
another "baby parts" partisan. Pinero's supposed witnesses have conveniently 
disappeared, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding Mexico, Sottas ominously states that clinics offer organ transplants 
in a province where many children disappear. But innuendo is not evidence.  
</P>
<P>
 In Honduras, Sottas repeats year-old allegations that created a media uproar 
but were never substantiated by any evidence -- the perpetual pattern of the 
"baby parts" myth. 
</P>
<P>
 Sottas reveals his appalling ignorance of organ transplant procedures, 
claiming that only one-fifth of U.S. transplants are centrally monitored, and 
worrying that numerous surgeons accept the idea of purchasing organs. All U.S. 
organ transplants are closely monitored by the United Network for Organ 
Sharing, and the sale of organs for transplant in the U.S. has been outlawed 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 One American, June Weinstock, remains in a coma after being savagely attacked 
in March by Guatemalans who believed the "baby parts" rumor. Others, including 
a Philadelphia woman adopting a Guatemalan child, have nearly been lynched. 
Commentators like Sottas and Perera need to do a more responsible job of 
checking their facts.

CLINTON POLICY ON TRADE WITH CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton renewed the most-favored-nation trade status for China, as 
expected (May 27). I think he did make the right decision. Americans always say 
"business is business." Tying MFN to human rights was wrong. According to 
American standards, there are a lot of things happening in the world that are 
not up to our level. But there are a lot of things happening here that are not 
up to other countries' levels, such as the crime rate and our wastefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind about the inconsistency between candidate Clinton and President 
Clinton. History will only judge on what the President did, not what the 
candidate said.

 In response to "Clinton Caves In on Trade vs. Human Rights," news analysis, 
May 27: 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it that when Clinton's noble ideals founder because of harsh 
geopolitical realities over which he has no control reporters attack him for 
"caving in," whereas when George Bush and Ronald Reagan promoted their 
visionless, opportunistic policies without the least concern for human rights 
the press lauded them as "pragmatic"? Could The Times be using some sort of 
double standard to judge American presidents? Naaah.

 Regarding MFN status for China: Criticize President Clinton all you want, 
renewing these trade privileges was the correct thing to do. He made the 
mistake to tie these benefits to human rights issues and that's all he did 
wrong. Clinton had the guts to change his mind and not let pride stand in his 
way. This renewal is in the best interest of both countries. Through economic 
strategies we can achieve our human rights goals, not by threats against a 
major political and economic country. The future of the Pacific Rim as well as 
the world is linked to strong relationships between these two superpowers.

<P>
 It comes as no surprise that President Clinton uncoupled human rights from 
trade with China. After all, we have been doing business with Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and dozens of other countries with 
equal or worse human rights than China. 
</P>
<P>
 Get real. Business is business. 
</P>
<P>
 Now let us see if the new Clinton foreign policy will finally end the embargo 
of Cuba. The embargo imposed 30 years ago during the Cold War is obsolete and 
is no longer being respected by practically every country in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the United States seems hellbent on continuing to starve the men, women 
and children of Cuba. It is heartless and mean-spirited. Now, in the light of 
the new China policy, it is also hypocritical. Certainly the time has come to 
end the embargo on Cuba.

 Why doesn't the rest of the world listen when we preach about human rights? 
When we were young and ambitious (much like China today, economically), we grew 
by enslaving blacks and slaughtering Native Americans. Today, homeless roam our 
streets. Violent crime and drugs threaten us all. We glorify guns. Many of our 
poor lead hopeless lives. Listen up, world! Can't you see we're the experts?

REPRESSED MEMORY THERAPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an attorney involved in representing victims of childhood sexual abuse in 
civil cases for money damages against the offender, I was very interested in 
the outcome of the case in Napa concerning alleged false memories of childhood 
sexual abuse. False allegation of childhood abuse is something I take very 
seriously in my practice. The Times editorialized that perhaps new laws need to 
be enacted to ensure allegations of childhood sexual abuse are based on true 
events rather than implanted memories (May 22). Your readers may be interested 
in learning there is already a bill introduced in the state Legislature which 
would help a lot in reducing the number of repressed memory cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a recent court decision, if one is over the age of 21, absent 
certain exceptions, the only way one can bring an action based on alleged 
childhood sexual abuse is to allege he or she totally repressed the memories of 
the abuse until now. AB 2846, introduced by Assembly Member Jackie Speier 
(D-Burlingame), would declare that a party up to the age of 26 may sue for 
childhood sexual abuse without alleging delayed discovery of the abuse. After 
the age of 26, a party has three years from the time he or she discovers that 
the injury or damages he or she sustained were caused by the abuse. The bill 
also contains requirements that before the action is commenced, a judge must 
review declarations from an attorney and a mental health practitioner stating 
the action has merit. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of false memories of childhood sexual abuse deserves attention. AB 
2846, while not the answer to all of the concerns, is a step in the right 
direction and deserves everybody's support.

 * Your editorial "Fictitious Memories?" clearly overstates the "message" sent 
by the jury in the Ramona vs. Isabella lawsuit in the Napa Superior Court. As 
one of the trial lawyers in that matter, I can assure you that ambiguous 
instructions, and general confusion by the jurors, resulted in a compromise 
verdict that warrants no hysterical calls for "tighter regulation in the 
psychotherapy community." The jury clearly did not determine that the memories 
of the young woman involved were false. Furthermore, they did not determine 
that any of the memories were implanted by the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 What they did determine was that there was negligence in reinforcing memories 
and that the psychiatric professionals involved were too ready to accept these 
assertions by their patient without doing additional work to confirm or to deny 
those memories. What in essence they bought into was the proposition that a 
clinician must act in a forensic manner in treating a patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep that in mind the next time you see a psychological professional 
complaining of depression and that individual responds that he or she does not 
believe you, or "prove it." How easy it is to criticize a profession for 
showing compassion to patients. How dangerous it is to empower a non-patient to 
attack psychological professionals for the propriety of the treatment rendered 
to their patients. 
</P>
<P>
 I would caution against giving too much credence to the decision in the Ramona 
matter. The brave new world envisioned by those who would overly emphasize the 
decision by 12 jurors in Napa may be one populated solely by forensic 
psychologists and by individuals who are dangerously ill, with no one who will 
listen to them.

LOCAL ELECTIONS SHERIFF; BLOCK OPPONENT BUYS CABLE TV ADVERTISING IN BID TO 
FORCE RUNOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another opponent of Sheriff Sherman Block's bid for reelection to a fourth 
term, Sheriff's Sgt. John R. Stites II, has purchased cable television 
advertising in an attempt to keep Block from amassing a majority of votes in 
Tuesday's election and avoiding a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Stites said the purchase totals about $35,000. Earlier in the 
week, it was reported that Block opponent Robert Irmas, a reserve sheriff's 
captain and businessman, had purchased $200,000 in television and radio time, 
including $55,000 on cable. There are six candidates in the race, most of them 
poorly funded political unknowns.

KNICKS WIN AS MILLER RUNS OUT OF MIRACLES; NBA PLAYOFFS: NEW YORK'S PRIDE TAKES 
OVER, 98-91, AND SERIES IS TIED, 3-3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Onto the shoulders of Reggie Miller went the Indiana Pacers again Friday 
night, hoping for a repeat ride, this time to Houston. And step on it. 
</P>
<P>
 He had gotten them here, in position to put away the New York Knicks at home 
for the NBA Eastern Conference title, with an amazing fourth-quarter 
performance two nights earlier in Madison Square Garden. Then, even with every 
defender keying on him, he scored 12 of his team's 18 points in the final 
period at Market Square Arena, which proved enough to scare the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 But not to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller finished with 27 points and turned an 11-point deficit at the start of 
the fourth quarter into a tie game, but the Knicks wound up with a 98-91 
victory before 16,529 to even the Eastern Conference final series, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear the Knicks, they earned more than a decisive Game 7 Sunday back in New 
York. They got redemption for losing at home for the first time in the 
playoffs, as well as a chance to answer the doubters who thought this 
three-year buildup of players such as Charles Smith and Derek Harper would 
evaporate in Indiana, where the Pacers had not lost in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight was all about pride," center Patrick Ewing said after getting 17 
points and 10 rebounds. "It was funny because everyone was jumping off the 
bandwagon. All of our fans and media back in New York had given up hope on us. 
But we hadn't. We knew we were going to be playing on Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Did he mean those headlines that cried, "CHOKERS," in the form of the team 
logo and "GAG CITY," in two-inch type? Those little references to abandoning 
ship? 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a massive, massive thud the other night with everyone jumping off 
the bandwagon," Knick Coach Pat Riley said. "Now, I'm sure there will be a 
massive thud with everyone jumping back on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may not be the prettiest team and we may not be the most skilled team at 
times. But I don't see how anyone can question our heart. This team is all 
about heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, they were about gut checks, too, when the fourth quarter could have 
been their last. 
</P>
<P>
 It started, fittingly, with Miller hitting a three-pointer on the Pacers' 
first possession, cutting the deficit to 80-72. This was not a good omen. 
</P>
<P>
 About five minutes later, with Miller again trying to run defenders ragged 
around screens, he caught the ball, dribbled up for a leaner from the 
free-throw line and moved Indiana within 88-86. With 3:03 left, he drove the 
baseline, was fouled and made both free throws, trimming the Knick lead to 
91-90. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was getting kind of scary down there," Knick guard John Starks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The break New York needed came, strangely, with Miller at the line again, 
having already tied the score, 91-91, when he made the first attempt with 2:06 
left. Then he missed the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that when he missed that free throw," Starks said, "we were going to 
win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the miss from one of the game's surest free-throw shooters was such a 
letdown for the Pacers, or maybe it was the only opportunity the Knicks needed, 
but Starks was right. Derek Harper's jump shot opened some breathing room, 
93-91, then Starks made one of two from the line. With 25 seconds to go, Harper 
made one of his free throws, New York had a four-point cushion and, it turned 
out, the game was under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller finished eight for 21 from the field, including two for seven on 
three-pointers, and nine of 12 from the line. But that last free throw before 
the miss turned out to be Indiana's final point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers can only hope it won't be a missed opportunity that lives all 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give them credit," Indiana Coach Larry Brown said of the Knicks. "They came 
in very assertive and aggressive. The bench was terrific, and I thought Starks 
had an incredible game (with 26 points), especially after what Reggie did to 
him the last game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll be all right. Heck, we knew we didn't have the home-court 
advantage to begin with. I look forward to (Sunday). This is how you build a 
team." 
</P>

A BAD NIGHT IN GEORGIA FOR DODGERS; BASEBALL: ASTACIO FALTERS AGAIN, BUTLER 
MAKES AN ERROR IN 8-5 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is how bad it was for Pedro Astacio on Friday night: With two out in the 
third inning, he was pitching so poorly against Atlanta that he was yanked when 
pitcher Tom Glavine came to the plate.  
</P>
<P>
 And this is how bad it was for the Dodger offense on a night they lost, 8-5: 
In the first four innings, nine baserunners were stranded. Twice during that 
span, the Dodgers left runners on third base and once they left the bases 
loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone for the night was set in the first inning when Brett Butler, 
errorless in 307 consecutive games, slipped and bobbled a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are going to make an error, make an error -- don't fall down and make 
one," Butler said. "I didn't even do it right." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers are 0-4 in 1994 against the Braves, who blew Astacio out of the 
game with a five-run third inning that put them ahead, 8-1, before a sellout 
crowd of 49,010 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the second consecutive early shower for Astacio (3-5), and it is 
bewildering to Manager Tom Lasorda, inasmuch as Astacio had pitched four 
consecutive solid outings before that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I knew when he was going to be bad, because I wouldn't start him," 
Lasorda said. "All you have to do is hope the next time he goes out he will be 
all right." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers rallied in the sixth inning, scoring four runs to narrow the gap 
to 8-5 and knock out Glavine (6-5), who gave up 11 hits but was able to pitch 
out of several other jams. "I think Glavine pitched fine tonight. (The Dodgers) 
got a ton of klunkers on him," Brave Manager Bobby Cox said.  
</P>
<P>
 Garey Ingram scored the Dodgers' first run on a sacrifice fly by Eric Karros, 
who had two. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram, who was two for three, scored twice and worked Glavine for a key walk 
in the sixth inning, had his own cheering section. About 30 friends and family 
members drove from Columbus, Ga., about 90 miles away, to see him play, and 
their voices could be heard whenever Ingram was at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "My second at-bat I heard them, and then Tommy (Lasorda) said, 'Look, there's 
Garey's mom,' " said Ingram, who is batting .379 since being called up on May 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were holding up a sign that said, 'Your mom's right here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Pye, making his major league debut, started the Dodgers' sixth-inning 
rally with a leadoff checked-swing single in his first at-bat. He played 
flawlessly at second base after taking over for Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous when I went out in the field, but as we were going out, Eric 
Karros got me laughing," Pye said. "Eric said, 'This is just like (the Dodger 
rookie team at Great Falls).' I looked around, and there's Offy (Jose Offerman) 
and Karros, and I played three years in the minors with both of them. So I 
relaxed, because it wasn't like I had never played with them before." 
</P>
<P>
 Glavine has allowed more than three earned runs only three times in his last 
20 starts. His 6-5 record might be better, but the Braves scored only nine runs 
in his five losses. In this game, against the wild Astacio, scoring was no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Astacio, who didn't get past the fourth inning in his last start, struggled 
from the beginning. Of the Braves' six hits off him, four were for extra bases 
-- a three-run home run by Ryan Klesko and doubles by Jeff Blauser, David 
Justice and Terry Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Astacio faced eight batters in the first inning and the first three scored -- 
Roberto Kelly drawing a leadoff walk in his first home at-bat as a Brave, 
Blauser doubling and Klesko following with his homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad day . . . again," Astacio said. "My arm's fine. Everything happened 
today, but I will be ready for the next time."

ANGELS GOOD FOR WHAT AILS; BASEBALL: MILWAUKEE BREAKS EIGHT-GAME ROAD LOSING 
STREAK, 4-3. SNOW RECALLED FROM VANCOUVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Milwaukee Brewers were supposed to cure whatever ailed the Angels, and it 
was a lengthy list. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't work that way in the Angels' 4-3 loss before 21,331 Friday at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee reliever Mike Fetters got pinch-hitter Bo Jackson to ground into a 
fielder's choice to end the game and give the Angels' their fifth consecutive 
loss. It was the fourth save for Fetters, a former Angel who had only two the 
last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, the Angels recalled first baseman J.T. Snow and sent Eduardo 
Perez to triple-A Vancouver, where they will play him at third base. Snow 
batted .296 with eight home runs and 43 RBIs in 53 games at Vancouver. Perez is 
batting .209 with five homers and 16 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow is expected to be in uniform for tonight's game. Perez was not 
immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get him a position that we're committed to and that he's 
committed to," Manager Marcel Lachemann said of Perez. "We feel this is the 
best thing for the organization, and unless I misread him (Perez), I think he's 
very excited about that." 
</P>
<P>
 There is one more potentially troubling item to the list of Angel woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Mark Langston left the game after giving up four runs and four hits in 
four innings, a dubious beginning to a three-game series against the Central 
Division's last-place team. It was announced that Langston suffered from 
muscle-related elbow stiffness, but it wasn't related to the arthroscopic 
surgery performed April 12. Still, the stiffness was in the same elbow, his 
left, that had been operated on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tight when I warmed up," Langston said. "But sometimes that happens 
and it loosens up during the game. This time, it just got tighter as the game 
went on. The doctor explained (after the surgery) that there would be times 
when it just wouldn't be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston couldn't get loose and couldn't keep the Brewers under wraps after 
the second inning. His fourth consecutive disappointing performance ended after 
only 64 pitches, dropping his record to 2-4 and swelling his earned-run average 
to 6.12. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last four starts, he is 0-4 with an 8.70 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 By the fifth inning, Langston was gone, replaced by Mark Leiter, who faced a 
4-2 deficit. Milwaukee's lead was cut to 4-3 in the fifth inning when Jim 
Edmonds singled home Chad Curtis from second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston had breezed through the first six batters with ease, striking out 
three and getting three to fly out weakly. Then he ran into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 B.J. Surhoff led off the third inning by slamming a 1-and-0 pitch over the 
right-field wall for his second homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 After a walk to Jody Reed, a strikeout and a fly out, John Jaha homered to 
left field for a 3-0 Brewer lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston has given up two homers in an inning in three of his last four 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Valentin's run-scoring single in the fourth inning pushed Milwaukee's 
lead to 4-0. It might have been 5-0, but left fielder Edmonds threw out Surhoff 
at home plate on Valentin's single. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Chris Turner withstood a jarring collision on the play, holding onto 
the ball for the inning's final out. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first victory on the road in eight games for the Brewers. But 
Milwaukee Manager Phil Garner hasn't given up on the season, despite the 
Brewers' 4-16 record over the past 20 games, a rash of injuries and the 
retirement of Robin Yount after 20 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not over," Garner said. "There's a good chance we can get back into the 
thick of things. It's not hopeless."

GALARRAGA'S ENCORE IS FULL OF POWER; BASEBALL: SLUGGER FOR THE ROCKIES IS OUT 
TO PROVE THAT LAST SEASON WAS NOT A FLUKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The door to the visitors' clubhouse at Shea Stadium swung open at 5:10 p.m. 
and in walked Colorado Rockies first baseman Andres Galarraga. The entrance did 
not go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the room were audible murmurs. "Gato." "Gato." "El gato." 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Cat was in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great hitter," Rockies right fielder Dante Bichette said. "He's got to 
be one of the top two or three hitters in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga's climb to the top -- he led the majors in batting last season with 
a .370 average -- has been long and slow. He didn't get there until he had been 
discarded by two teams and salvaged by an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still some skepticism. He's doing it with an expansion team. He's 
capitalizing on the thin air in Denver. He'll eventually revert to pre-Rockies 
form (.267 average). 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga seemed to sense the lingering doubt after hitting his second grand 
slam of the season Monday in a 12-2 victory over the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to prove last year was not a fluke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is mounting evidence it was not. Galarraga is batting .324, ninth in the 
National League. He's second in home runs with 18 (one behind the San Francisco 
Giants' Matt Williams before Friday's games) and first in RBI with 49. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers should be stimulating talk about a possible Triple Crown, not 
whether Galarraga, 6-foot-3, 245 pounds, is simply experiencing a hot streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what a lot of people are thinking, that it's a lucky streak or 
something," said Galarraga. "I don't think some people think I'm a good 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga, who willturn 33 June 18, has always been good. He just wasn't as 
good as some people thought he could be, including himself. 
</P>
<P>
 It began in Montreal, where Galarraga was hailed as a future superstar. He 
twice hit better than .300 and had four seasons where he drove in 85 runs or 
more. He also won Gold Gloves in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But injuries and strikeouts -- Galarraga led the National League in strikeouts 
in 1988, 1989 and 1990 -- also marked his seven seasons in Montreal. After 
hitting .219 in 1991 and missing 36 games because of left knee surgery, the 
Expos traded Galarraga to the St. Louis Cardinals in November 1991 for pitcher 
Ken Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade was a shock to Galarraga, a Venezuelan who knew only one major 
league organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I could hit," Galarraga said. "I knew I could play first base. I knew 
I could play still play this game. When I got traded to St. Louis it kind of 
frustrated me a little. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're losing things happen -- they look for excuses. They wanted to 
platoon me at first base. I said, 'No way, you better trade me."' 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga's problems followed him to St. Louis. The second day of the 1992 
season, he was hit by a pitch and broke his right wrist. He spent the next 44 
games on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 He wound up hitting .243 with 10 home runs and 39 RBI. The Cardinals declined 
to renew Galarraga's contract, allowing him to sign with the Rockies as a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Baylor, the Rockies' second-year manager, had served as the Cardinals 
hitting instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called me right away to play in Colorado," Galarraga said. "He has helped 
me a lot to come back and put everything together." 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga had a phenomenal first season with the Rockies: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He was the first expansion player to lead the league in hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His .370 average tied Tony Gwynn's 1987 mark as the highest in the National 
League since 1948, when Stan Musial batted .376 for the Cardinals. It also was 
the highest by a right-handed hitter since 1939, when Joe DiMaggio hit .381, 
and the highest in the National League by a righty since Joe "Ducky" Medwick 
(.374 in 1937). 
</P>
<P>
 -- He led the league in multihit games (56) despite missing 41 games with 
hamstring and knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He was batting .400 as late as July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Galarraga picked up where he left off. He drove in a National 
League-record 30 runs in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga has been aided this season by hitting between Ellis Burks (out with 
a wrist injury) and Bichette. But mostly it is rekindled self-confidence, 
triggered by Baylor's belief in him, that's helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so comfortable at home plate," he said. "Every time I go to home 
plate, I feel I can do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga recognizes home runs are easier to come by at Mile High Stadium 
(National League-high 184 last season). 
</P>
<P>
 "The air probably helps a little bit," he said. "A lot of people think you're 
hitting fly balls to second base and it's gone. It's not like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga said he is inspired by the Rockies fans, who have turned out in 
record numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people don't care about the score (or) if we're losing or winning," he 
said. "That helps me play 100 percent every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga's statistics are fairly consistent home and away. Through Tuesday, 
he was hitting .350 at home, .301 away; he has eight home runs at home, 10 
away; he has 25 RBI at home, 24 away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just amazing," Bichette said. "It's some kind of consistency with power. 
He's the total package, there's no doubt about it."

COURIER SENT PACKING AS SPANIARDS RULE DAY; FRENCH OPEN: BRUGUERA AND 
BERASATEGUI WIN THEIR MATCHES TO REACH SUNDAY'S FINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The French Open went south Friday as Spain's Sergi Bruguera and Alberto 
Berasategui advanced to the men's final in a dazzling display of clay-court 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruguera overwhelmed two-time champion Jim Courier, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3, 6-3, in one 
semifinal, and No. 24 Berasategui kept his record spotless with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-1 
victory over No. 46 Magnus Larsson of Sweden in the other. Berasategui, 20, has 
yet to lose a set in his third French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 So, two good friends will become foes Sunday on Center Court in the first 
all-Spanish final of any Grand Slam tournament. They will follow another 
Spanish finalist, Aranxta Sanchez Vicario, who plays Mary Pierce today for the 
women's title. 
</P>
<P>
 Which of the men will the Spanish favor? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Bruguera said. "Call and ask." 
</P>
<P>
 Although not the biggest names in tennis, Bruguera and Berasategui have a lot 
to offer to all those weekend hackers. Like junkball pitchers, the Spaniards 
have won with guile, happily frustrating big servers with spinning forehands 
that lope to the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
 On a blustery spring day in Paris, No. 6 Bruguera and No. 7 Courier met in a 
repeat of last year's final, won by the Spaniard in a dramatic five-setter. 
Yet, when the match began at noon Friday, Center Court was less than half full. 
</P>
<P>
 When Courier lost his serve in the third game, Bruguera, who played only one 
Grand Slam match between the 1993 and '94 French Opens, was in fine form. And 
it seemed he would win his sixth consecutive straight-set match after taking a 
5-2 lead in the second set. Courier had lost his serve and his nerve in the 
fourth game when he was given a warning for uttering an obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier's outburst resulted from a foot-fault. In the next game, he directed 
his anger inward, screaming at himself to swing at Bruguera's deep volleys 
after he had let one drop that he thought was long. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not until the ninth game, when the two had a rally befitting a 
Grand Slam semifinal, that Courier quickened the pace. He became more 
aggressive and dictated Bruguera's movement. Taking five consecutive games, 
Courier won the set and tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Bruguera said he was satisfied by his son's reaction to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a player who goes down easily," the elder Bruguera said. "He had no 
fear at that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Bruguera said Sergi's fighting spirit is his finest quality. Courier 
knows something about perseverance, too. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of finding his rhythm, Courier made some crucial mental mistakes 
in the third set, and the chance to reach his fourth consecutive final in Paris 
slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was feeling that I had more power than him, that I can move him around and 
he cannot attack as well as last year," Bruguera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier was disappointed with his play. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I lacked a little bit (at) the defining moments of the match was 
aggression," he said. "I only seemed to find my aggression when I was down." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it worked for him in the second set, once Courier fell behind in the 
third and fourth sets Bruguera increased the pressure. He sent arching 
forehands into the deep recesses of the court, and Courier returned many into 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the swirling gusts that kicked up dust devils on the red clay, 
Bruguera had an outstanding service game. He had seven aces, only one double 
fault. Courier, who made 64 unforced errors, had eight double faults. 
</P>
<P>
 "To beat Jim here is not easy," said Manuel Santana, Spain's two-time French 
Open champion from the 1960s. "On clay, (Sergi) is the best player in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 That might be true, but anyone who has watched Berasategui's clever game is 
expecting Sunday's final to be the kind of match that strains necks. Yet 
Berasategui, who grew up in a Basque village near Bilbao, Spain, is not sure 
what to make of his run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really believe it," he said. "Someone has to come up to me and wake 
me up." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in a French Open final against Bruguera is not something he thought 
possible. Berasategui grew up playing soccer and surfing the rugged coast of 
northwest Spain. But when his father, owner of an industrial construction firm, 
built a tennis court near his office, Berasategui took up the sport. He 
developed as a junior player, but nothing suggested such a rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I simply can't imagine this situation," said Imanol Bollegui, Berasategui's 
youth coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsson, Berasategui's semifinal opponent, could. 
</P>
<P>
 With the wind playing havoc with his serve, Larsson was powerless. The lanky 
Swede needed to serve and volley effectively to stop Berasategui from running 
him off the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Berasategui's forehand is so fast and so quick it is really hard to read 
where the ball goes," Larsson said. 
</P>
<P>
 It goes to the French Open final, where Berasategui becomes the first unseeded 
player to reach the championship match since Mikael Pernfors in 1986. Tennis 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay Davenport and Lisa Raymond advanced to the women's doubles final with 
a 7-6 (7-2), 6-7 (8-6), 6-4 victory over Amanda Coetzer of South Africa and 
Ines Gorrochategui of Argentina. They will face Gigi Fernandez and Natalia 
Zvereva of Belarus, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 winners over France's Julie Halard and 
Nathalie Tauziat. . . . Bryon Black, a former USC star, and Jonathan Stark, 
formerly of Stanford, will play Sweden's Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman in the 
men's doubles final. 
</P>
<P>
 Larisa Neiland of Ukraine and Andrei Olhovskiy of Russia will play Kristie 
Boogert and Menno Oosting of the Netherlands in the mixed doubles final. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: Steffi Graf lost to Monica Seles in the 1993 Australian Open 
final. Graf's recent performance in Grand Slam events was incorrect in a story 
in The Times on Friday.

FANS' RANCOR TOWARD STRAWBERRY UNABATED AFTER HIS DEPARTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How nice. Fred Claire would have us believe that after the Dodgers dumped 
millions of dollars on Darryl Strawberry over the last four years and received 
exactly one-half a season of productive service, he is only concerned about 
this player's well-being. That's great, Fred, but how would you feel if the 
money was coming out of your own pocket? 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl is humiliated about letting the Dodgers and their fans down? I tend to 
doubt it. What he ought to be embarrassed about is his behavior as an employee 
of this ballclub, with an attitude that reeks of selfishness and a performance 
level over the past three years that would have had less-expensive ballplayers 
released outright. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry's tenure with the Dodgers is an embarrassing chapter in this 
club's history. I hope he gets his life straightened out, but I feel the same 
as most other Dodger fans: Good riddance.

 What a great blessing it was for the Dodgers and baseball in general that

 If XYZ Corp. were hiring an executive for a couple of million dollars a year, 
there would be a resume, background checks, interviews -- you know the story. 
</P>
<P>
 And with Darryl Strawberry, everyone (at least the fans) knew the guy was 
trouble, had a bad reputation and dirty laundry. What in the world did we want 
with a guy like this to begin with? 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he's gone and the Dodgers will continue in their never-ending role as the 
league's farm team. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind who's on first -- just fire the guy who made the call to sign 
Strawberry to begin with.

 I only wish Fred Claire would have the same empathy for the people who paid

 What is the message we are sending to our children when we pay someone $8 
million to do absolutely nothing after two stays in a rehabilitation clinic for 
substance abuse? 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it about time baseball and other sports get tough and put into these 
outrageous contracts a clause that would deny these so-called role models any 
compensation after they've blown one chance? It's tough enough teaching kids to 
do the right thing, especially when they see these phony heroes being rewarded 
for despicable behavior instead of suffering consequences.

 Bravo. Your soccer coverage on Tuesday, "Ruud Gullit Quits" by Grahame L. 
Jones was exactly what I and many others I know have been hoping to see in your 
paper: well-researched and informative coverage of the major participants on 
the world scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The up close and personal daily articles are a pleasant frosting to the cake 
of solid game and performance information. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope you can even keep a little of this world and local soccer coverage 
after the World Cup '94 is over.

SEEING IS BELIEVING: KISS IS JUST A KISS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read the "Indianapolis 500 Daily Report" by Shav Glick in which Mario 
Andretti discusses Andy Granatelli's kissing him at the end of the race."If you 
look at the picture real close, you can see that he is whispering something in 
my ear, not kissing me (after the 1969 race)," Andretti says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I was not as close to Granatelli as was Andretti when I was 
photographing the event, I beg to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious that Andretti's memory has faded, unlike the image captured in a 
black-and-white negative so many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought you would enjoy the photo.

THANKS FOR KEEPING EVERYBODY IN THE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a lifelong baseball fan, I cannot begin to thank major league baseball for 
its decision to create the new six-division format. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of the game appears to have improved for the simple reason that 
just about every team still has a chance to play in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the so-called purists gripe about sub-.500 division leaders, this in 
time will balance itself out. 
</P>
<P>
 And selfishly, as a Dodger fan, I am more than happy to hear what the San 
Francisco Giants are doing.

WHAT KIND OF RACE CAN THE DODGERS WIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The media have to stop "hyping" the public into believing the Dodgers are 
anything more than a very mediocre team. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is that the Dodgers are in first place for only one reason -- 
they're in a division that is an embarrassment to baseball.

TIME TO WAKE UP TO STOCK CAR RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to protest the lack of coverage of Winston Cup stock car 
racing.Recently, when more than 90,000 attended the Sears Point race, even 
though a California driver, Ernie Irvan, won, The Times gave only several lines 
to the story. 
</P>
<P>
 In the L.A. area, we have such uninteresting teams in football, basketball, 
etc., that it is refreshing to watch a sport such as stock car racing. It is 
growing in television coverage and fan interest, and the L.A. Times just 
doesn't seem to understand what is happening.

 Steve Nedeau's leadoff triple ignited a six-run sixth inning Friday night that 
led Florida State to a 6-3 victory over defending champion Louisiana State in 
the first round of the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The triple was only the second hit of the game off Tiger starter Scott 
Schultz, who retired the first 13 hitters he faced until Randy Hodges doubled 
in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 The wheels then came off for Schultz (12-2) in the sixth as sixth-seeded 
Florida State (53-20) advanced to Sunday's winners' bracket game against No. 2 
Georgia Tech.

 LSU (46-19) will play Fullerton.

 Florida State starter Paul Wilson (13-5), selected No. 1 overall by the New 
York Mets in Thursday's major league draft, settled down after a bumpy start. 
He scattered seven hits, struck out seven and walked one in the complete game.

GOLF ROUNDUP; THOUGH BROOKS STAGGERS, HE HOLDS 2-SHOT LEAD 
</P>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Brooks hit the ball well all day in the second round of the Kemper Open, 
but occasionally with the wrong club. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks had four bogeys over the final seven holes Friday, finishing with a 68 
for a nine-under-par 133 total and a two-stroke lead over Bobby Wadkins. Mark 
O'Meara was at 137, and four golfers reached the halfway point at 138 over the 
TPC at Avenal course in Potomac, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Mickelson used a six-iron for a hole in one on the 177-yard 11th and 
finished with a 69 for a 139, tied with four others. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks held a six-stroke lead through the 10th hole before his troubles began. 
</P>
<P>
 He pulled out a six-iron on the 11th tee and put his shot on the edge of the 
bunker. That led to his first bogey of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have used a seven-iron," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His five-iron came up shorter than desired on the next hole, another bogey. 
His tee shot went in the water on No. 17 and he also bogeyed No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just played a horrible back nine," Brooks said. "I hit the wrong club two 
or three times and it was costly as far as momentum was concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Daniel bogeyed her final hole and still shot a tournament-record 
nine-under-par 63 to take a four-stroke lead after two rounds of the LPGA 
Oldsmobile Classic at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels has a 36-hole total of 14-under 130 -- also a tournament record and 
four strokes ahead of Meg Mallon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never got a feel today that this was going to be my day or that I was in a 
zone," said Daniel, currently second to Laura Davies on the LPGA money list. "I 
just kept grinding and things were happening. In this game, you can never get 
content and think, 'This is my day,' because as soon as you think that, 
disaster strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel has only two players within six strokes. Amy Benz finished the second 
round at nine under. Nancy Ramsbottom is another stroke back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Albus shot a season-best eight-under 64 for a two-stroke lead over Bob 
Charles and Jim Dent after the first round of the Bruno's Memorial Classic over 
the Greystone Golf Club course in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Leonard of Texas took advantage of ideal scoring conditions and 
hometown support to shoot a 63, best of his career, and take a one-shot lead in 
the NCAA golf championships at the Stonebridge Country Club in McKinney, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard has a 54-hole total of 202. Oklahoma State's Alan Bratton is second at 
203. 
</P>
<P>
 In the team competition, six schools are within six strokes of the lead, with 
Stanford and Georgia Tech tied at the top at 847, two shots better than three 
teams.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CANSECO CONNECTS TWICE IN 13-2 ROMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Canseco hit a pair of two-run home runs and Bruce Hurst made a victorious 
return to Fenway Park Friday night as the Texas Rangers routed the Boston Red 
Sox, 13-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco had been in a 1-for-17 slump before his fly ball barely cleared the 
left-field wall in the fifth inning to give the Rangers a 5-2 lead. In the 
seventh, he hit his 13th homer well above the screen on the Green Monster. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco added a run-scoring double off the left-field wall in the ninth as the 
Rangers scored six runs, including Dean Palmer's fourth career grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurst, who won 88 games for the Red Sox in 1980-88, made his first appearance 
in Boston since leaving as a free agent. He allowed two runs in five-plus 
innings, then left to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurst (1-1) got his first major league win since Sept. 2, 1992, when he was 
with the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 4, Baltimore 2 -- Frank Thomas and Robin Ventura hit homers in the 
fourth inning at Baltimore, and Jason Bere won his fifth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bere (7-1) scattered five hits in seven innings for Chicago's 10th victory in 
their last 13 games. Roberto Hernandez pitched the ninth for his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' homer, which broke a 1-1 tie, was his 21st this season and his 13th in 
27 games. He is second in the American League in home runs, behind Seattle's 
Ken Griffey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Both blasts came off Sid Fernandez (3-3), who pitched his first complete game 
in the AL, allowing seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 7, New York 4 -- Gary Gaetti hit a two-run homer off Paul Gibson 
(1-1) to break an eighth-inning tie at New York, after pinch-hitter Dave 
Henderson's two-out single. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Brewer (3-0) relieved Royal starter Bob Milacki in the seventh and 
retired Don Mattingly on a line drive to first with two on. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul O'Neill snapped an 0-for-14 slump with an eighth-inning single, but went 
one for four to lower his major league-leading average to .420. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 9, Minnesota 8 -- Cecil Fielder's second homer of the game won for the 
Tigers in the 13th inning at Detroit. With one out, Fielder hit the first pitch 
by Dave Stevens (0-1) into the second deck in center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielder's blast ended a 4-hour 32-minute game and made a winner of Joe Boever 
(3-0), who pitched four scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 9, Seattle 6 -- The Blue Jays broke a nine-game road losing streak as 
Paul Molitor doubled twice and drove in three runs at Seattle and Juan Guzman 
won his second consecutive start. The Blue Jays' last victory on the road was 
on April 29 in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman (6-5) went seven innings and allowed six earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 9, Oakland 5 -- The Indians scored all of their runs with two outs 
at Oakland as Jim Thome drove in three runs. Mark Clark (6-1) allowed two runs 
and six hits in 5 1/3 innings to help the Indians win their sixth game in a 
row. He defeated Bobby Witt (4-6) for the second time in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, a major league-best 14-4 since May 13, scored two runs in the 
sixth and added three more in the seventh for an 8-2 lead.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; SABERHAGEN'S ARM, BAT DEFEAT REELING REDS, 4-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bret Saberhagen showed he has recovered from back spasms by pitching eight 
strong innings Friday night as the New York Mets scored a 4-3 victory over the 
struggling Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberhagen also doubled and scored the winning run on Jose Vizcaino's 
seventh-inning single to break the Mets' three-game losing streak. Cincinnati, 
which fell out of first place in the National League's Central Division, has 
lost 10 of its last 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberhagen (6-2) had to leave a game on May 25 because of spasms in his lower 
back and missed his next turn in the rotation. Friday, he gave up seven hits, 
including solo home runs to Kevin Mitchell and Hal Morris, and struck out nine. 
</P>
<P>
 John Franco pitched the ninth for his 13th save. 
</P>
<P>
 John Smiley (4-7) lost his fifth straight start by yielding a go-ahead run 
three times in the back-and-forth game. The left-hander allowed eight hits and 
two walks in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberhagen hit his ground-rule double with two out in the seventh, and he came 
home on Vizcaino's single up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 5, San Diego 1 -- Pat Rapp allowed only five hits in 8 1/3 innings and 
Jeff Conine drove in three runs at Miami to snap the Padres' winning streak at 
a season-high six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapp (4-1) lost a bid for his first career shutout and second complete game in 
the ninth. Craig Shipley reached base on an error, stole second, took third on 
a grounder and scored on Phil Plantier's single. Robb Nen finished for the 
Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 4, Philadelphia 2 -- Ken Caminiti had a pair of run-scoring singles, 
Jeff Bagwell homered and Brian Williams pitched seven innings at Houston as the 
Astros moved into first place in the Central Division by a full game over the 
Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams (2-2) improved to 4-0 in his career against the Phillies, giving up 
two runs on six hits while striking out six and walking one. John Hudek worked 
the ninth for his seventh save. 
</P>
<P>
 David West (1-5) lasted five innings for the Phillies, yielding three runs on 
three hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, Chicago 1 -- Randy Milligan hasn't second-guessed Montreal Manager 
Felipe Alou's limited role for him so far this season. His latest performance, 
however, might cause Alou to re-think the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Milligan, primarily used as a pinch-hitter against left-handed pitchers, faced 
right-hander Chuck Crim in the eighth inning and came through with a 
first-pitch home run that beat the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing I could see and hit I would swing at," Milligan said after 
his first homer of the season also scored Larry Walker to give the Expos a 2-1 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker had drawn a walk from Dan Plesac. After the second out, Milligan batted 
for Cliff Floyd, bringing Crim (2-1) on to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 3, San Francisco 1 -- Ozzie Smith hit a home run and drove in two 
runs, and Allen Watson worked 6 1/3 innings at St. Louis to win for the first 
time since April 19 as the Giants lost their fourth straight game and 11th in 
their last 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith went three for four, including a run-scoring single in the third and his 
third homer in the seventh off Bryan Hickerson (2-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Watson (3-3), who had been threatened with demotion to the bullpen, allowed 
only four hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 6, Pittsburgh 4 -- Dante Bichette had a two-run homer and a pair of 
doubles, and Marvin Freeman pitched seven shutout innings at Denver as the 
Rockies won their fourth straight game. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the fifth in a row for the Pirates.

TRACK AND FIELD / NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS; UCLA'S HECOX RUNS 'PERFECT RACE' IN 3,000

<P>
 UCLA junior Karen Hecox pulled away on the final lap to win the women's 
3,000-meter title at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecox followed a prerace strategy to keep pace with favorite Kay Gooch of 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gooch left most of the field behind at the 400-meter mark, Hecox went 
with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the races I've seen (Gooch) in, she's left the field early and no one 
would go with her," Hecox said, who won with a time of 9 minutes 22.63 seconds. 
"Our strategy was to stay with her until about 400 meters were left then try to 
pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the perfect race, although the time was not that fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Gooch finished second, five seconds behind Hecox. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Tansley of Cal State Fullerton finished sixth in the 3,000-meter 
steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
 Tansley, formerly of San Clemente High, finished the race in 8 minutes 51.48 
seconds, which qualified him for All-American honors. With the honor, the 
senior becomes the first Cal State Fullerton track athlete to become 
All-American in Division I since reinstatement of the award in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third straight year, Louisiana State's men's and women's teams won the 
400-meter relays. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's foursome of Eddie Kennison, Bryant Williams, Derrick Thymes and 
Fabian Muyaba blazed around Boise State's Bronco Stadium track in 38.91 
seconds, the fastest time by a collegiate team this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's relay, LSU's team of Debbie Ann Parris, D'Andre Hill, Zundra 
Feagin and Cheryl Taplin romped to victory in 43.26, only 0.01 seconds off the 
season's collegiate best they set at the Texas Relays in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is the last three years we have dominated the relays," Muyaba said. 
"Mainly, it's because we focus on the exchanges. That's where we gain ground. 
We have a lot of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty minutes after running the leadoff leg on the relay, Parris came back 
and won the 400 hurdles for the second year in a row, in 55.54

ENDEAVOR WINS WHITBREAD; TOKIO SETS MARK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pushed by gusts of 48 knots, Chris Dickson's Tokio held off the fast-finishing 
American yacht Winston to win the sixth and final leg of the Whitbread 
round-the-world race Friday in record-shattering time. 
</P>
<P>
 A maxi yacht, New Zealand Endeavor, was the overall winner of the nine-month 
race.It led the fleet by 45 miles on Wednesday, but as the strong winds filled 
in from behind, the Whitbread 60s flew past and Grant Dalton's boat finished 
the leg fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Endeavor's overall time of 120 days, 5 hours 9 minutes 23 seconds beat 
Steinlager's record by eight days and five hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Whitbread 60 yachts put on the closest finish in race history. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokio broke the mark for the 3,818-mile leg set by Steinlager 2 in 1989-90 by 
more than four days, finishing in 12 days, 19 hours 36 minutes 27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Winston, skippered by New Zealander Brad Butterworth, made up more than 16 
miles in half a day to finish in 12 days, 20 hours 27 minutes, with another 
Winston 60, Yamaha, third.

SOUTHERN SECTION CHAMPIONSHIPS; MARINA DISPLAYS ITS CHAMPIONSHIP FORM; DIVISION 
I SOFTBALL: MARCY CROUCH PITCHES ONE-HITTER AND VIKINGS BEAT FOOTHILL, 2-0, FOR 
THE TITLE.

<P>
 It was as much a contrast in journeys as it was a contrast in styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina, the top-seeded team in Division I, with the easiest path to Friday's 
Southern Section championship game, played Foothill, a league champion given 
the worst draw of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 And when they met at Mayfair Park, 1 1/2 months after a scheduled doubleheader 
had been rained out, the favorite was left standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina, the good-hitting, good-pitching team with the suspect defense, was 
flawless, and Marcy Crouch pitched a one-hitter in a 2-0 victory. The Vikings 
finish 26-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill (25-7), a team without seniors but loaded with speed and great 
defenders, committed one gaffe that led to the winning run, and managed only 
one legitimate baserunner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights' only scoring threat came in the sixth inning. Lauren Bauer 
singled with two outs and stole second, but was nailed at third by catcher 
Heather Williams on ball four to Michelle Churnock, Foothill's best hitter. 
Churnock didn't even have time to get out of the batter's box before the inning 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The game never developed as anticipated as Crouch and Marie Gieron squared off 
in a pitcher's duel. Marina had the only hit through 4 1/2 innings but broke 
through in the bottom of the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was safe when first baseman Robin Tessman dropped Churnock's throw 
from shortstop. Pinch-runner Megan Orach took second on Faith Fuata's sacrifice 
bunt, third on Staci Byers' grounder to Tessman, and scored on Heather Hibben's 
line single to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Hibben's second consecutive game-winning hit; she drove in Angela 
Alvarez with the only run in the 10th inning of a semifinal victory over 
Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fastball, inside," Hibben said. "I think." 
</P>
<P>
 Was it meat? 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Flowers followed with a single before Gieron (12-5) ended the inning 
with her only strikeout of the night, but Marina had clearly solved the 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch led off the sixth inning with a ground-rule double, and after Becky 
Thompson's sacrifice, Lynette Velazquez doubled. The Vikings finished with six 
hits -- five in the last two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch (22-2) struck out 10 and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the best I've seen her throw," Marina Coach Shelly Luth said. "She had 
absolute control." 
</P>
<P>
 And she was in absolute control, especially with the play of her defense. It 
set the tone from the beginning, when shortstop Rainey Keiter -- one of only 
two Marina seniors -- threw out Churnock on a bunt that opened the game. The 
play was close, but Marina had delivered its message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared (about the matchup)," Luth said. "I knew we had made mistakes 
and everyone bagged on our defense, but we don't panic when we make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As teams got better in the playoffs and our defense became an issue, they 
focused more." 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch ended Foothill's winning streak at 12 and extended Marina's to 16. The 
Knights had beaten pitchers with a combined record of 58-7 in their four 
playoff victories. But Crouch was too much. And so was the defense.

SOUTHERN SECTION CHAMPIONSHIPS; FIRST TIME IS CHARM FOR VIKINGS' ORACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON CLIFFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She had never played a full season of softball, but Marina freshman Megan 
Orach was standing on first base in the fifth inning of a scoreless Southern 
Section Division I championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-running for catcher Heather Williams with nobody out, Orach moved to 
second on a sacrifice bunt, advanced to third on Staci Byers' ground out to 
first and scored what proved to be the winning run on a single by Heather 
Hibben. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty confident once I scored that we were going to win," the backup 
center fielder said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (26-2) went on to beat Foothill, 2-0, giving Marina its first 
softball title since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Orach, it was her first title since March of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Orach, then a forward for the Marina soccer team, helped the Vikings to a 
28-0-1 record, and a Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one was much more exciting for me," Orach said. "You get to cheer more 
and you get pumped up during the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Orach, who had won tournaments and other honors in club soccer, had never 
played softball until after beating Palos Verdes Peninsula in soccer, 3-0, in 
the finals this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought her up (from the junior varsity team) halfway through the season 
because of her speed," Marina Coach Shelly Luth said. "She had never played 
softball before in her life." 
</P>
<P>
 "She is the first (pinch-runner) off our bench because she is so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 She showed that speed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never played before, and I really wanted to try it," Orach said. "I 
think I played enough to earn my letter." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning two championships in her first year of high school was something Orach 
never dreamed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't expecting to win any championships when I came to Marina," Orach 
said. "I don't think anything can top this, unless we do it again next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Marcy Crouch, who also was a member of the championship soccer team, 
enjoyed this victory more than the one in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one was so much more unexpected," Crouch said. "This one is a little 
better because I was a little more a part of this team." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot more -- she pitched a one-hitter.

TUIMOLOAU PUTS COMPETITION AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dolores Tuimoloau of Channel Islands High had had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 After going more than a month without breaking the 47-foot barrier in the 
girls' shotput, the Raider senior unloaded a toss of 49 feet 1/2 inch Friday in 
the qualifying round of the state track and field championships before 6,567 at 
Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau, the state's leading shotputter all season, nailed a personal best 
of 49-2 in the Ventura County championships April 29, but her winning marks had 
ranged between 45-1 3/4 and 46-7 1/2 in four meets since. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked as if the trend might continue Friday. Her first two throws measured 
43-5 1/2 and 43-1 1/2, but on her third -- and final -- attempt she unleashed a 
put that "felt like it was about 47 feet," but measured two feet further. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just said to myself, 'It's time to get out of this rut. Let's put one out 
there,' " said Tuimoloau, who had a cushion of nearly five feet over No. 2 
qualifier Soozie Shanley (44-1) of Tulare. 
</P>
<P>
 With the shotput qualifying over, Tuimoloau proceeded to the discus 
competition, and grabbed the ninth -- and last -- qualifying spot for the 
finals with a throw of 131-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The discus) is not really my event," she said. "It's just something to keep 
me busy between the shotput." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tuimoloau did not want to make any predictions about today's shotput 
finals, she hinted that a bigger effort was possible. "I've just got this 
feeling about a 50-footer," she said. "Something tells me that that could 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau was one of four athletes from the region who qualified for the 
finals in two events. 
</P>
<P>
 The others were Jason Medearis of Hart, Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill and Danny 
Haag of Granada Hills. Medearis won his heats of the 110 high hurdles and the 
300 intermediates in 14.23 seconds and 38.26. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase qualified second in the triple jump with a personal best of 49 feet 4 
3/4 inches and was third in the long jump at 22-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Haag was the No. 2 qualifier in the long jump at 22-11 3/4 and ran a personal 
best of 14.62 to finish third in the second heat of the high hurdles behind 
Medearis and Gerimi Burleigh (14.26) of Upland. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo, Esa Sallinen of Burroughs and Brett Strahan of 
Hart easily qualified for the finals of their respective events. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, the national high school outdoor leader in the high jump at 7-4, was 
one of four jumpers to clear 6-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallinen, second on the state list at 16-4 3/4 in the pole vault, was one of 
four athletes to clear 15-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan, who ranks third on the state list in the 1,600 at 4 minutes 9.71 
seconds, finished third in his heat with a time of 4:16.63. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsey Jay of Ventura and Andre DeSaussure of Taft qualified for the finals of 
the boys' 400 by finishing second and third in their heat with times of 47.62 
and 47.70. 
</P>
<P>
 Other region-leading efforts went to Canyon's Mike Wenz, who timed 1:53.22 to 
finish third in his heat of the 800, and Andrea Wasden of Rio Mesa, who ran 
14.37 to finish second in her heat of the girls' 100 hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Prater of Agoura and Stacy Hebert of Buena each qualified for the finals 
of the girls' 300 low hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Prater, third in last year's state championships, looked ragged for the first 
half of her race -- hitting the fourth hurdle so hard that she almost fell down 
-- but finished strong to place third in 44.47. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert, a sophomore, ran the second-best time of her career (44.56) to finish 
third in Heat 3. 
</P>
<P>
 James Lincoln of Birmingham was a notable non-qualifier as he finished 15th in 
the high jump at 6-4, 19th in the triple jump at 44-2, and 23rd in the long 
jump at 21-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln, fifth in the high jump in last year's state meet, cleared 6-8 to win 
the City Section title last week and came close to clearing 7-0 on two efforts, 
but his legs lacked zip Friday.

CITY SECTION 4-A DIVISION BASEBALL SEMIFINALS; WOLF SNUFFS RALLY WITH DOUBLE 
PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Playoff semifinal. Bases loaded, nobody out. Who you gonna call? 
</P>
<P>
 Who do you think? 
</P>
<P>
 To no one's surprise, El Camino Real High pitcher Randy Wolf, the prince of 
the postseason, trotted in from right field toward a fifth-inning brush fire to 
protect a two-run lead Friday at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 A trip to the City Section 4-A final for defending champion El Camino Real 
hung in the balance, and the scales were tipping toward its opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-hitting Golden Cougars of Kennedy had scored 30 runs in their 
previous two games, and Wolf had pitched seven innings only two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 A little unsettling? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shaking like a leaf," Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
 He walked the first batter to force in a run, and the Conquistadores' lead was 
cut to one. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, Wolf got by with a little help from some of his friends in the 
Conquistadores' 6-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 He struck out the next batter, then induced George Kassis to hit a slow 
grounder to second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Maiden fielded it cleanly and made a long throw to shortstop Matt Tays, 
who avoided the runner and threw out Kassis at first by the slimmest of margins 
to complete the double play. 
</P>
<P>
 Conquistadore players streamed joyously out of the dugout, sensing that the 
crisis was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have exploded that inning," Kennedy's Kevin Serr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opportunity did not even walk up the porch steps after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf will start Monday against Chatsworth at Dodger Stadium in a rematch of 
last season's championship. Fittingly, as it turns out, the senior left-hander 
was drafted Friday morning by the Dodgers in the 25th round of the major league 
baseball amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the victory hinted at destiny, fate intervened in the guise of the 
sterling 4-6-3 double play. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the game right there," Wolf said of the play. "I was thinking, 
'Okay, one out,' then Matt made the throw to first. I was like, 'Oh, man!' Not 
only did it get us out of that important inning, it fired up the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Said first baseman Craig Carlton: "What a play! To tell you truth, I thought 
it was hit too slowly but Joey made a great throw and Matt's toss was right 
there. It's the greatest play we've made all season." 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real (22-7) scored two runs in the bottom of the inning on a single 
by Billy Burnette to give Wolf a three-run cushion, which was more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
 He scattered three hits in the final two innings to earn the save, to go along 
with victories the Conquistadores' first two playoff games. He is 11-3 with a 
1.09 earned-run average in 103 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was not a game won solely because of Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior right-hander Tony Kyber (8-2) pitched the first four innings and held 
Kennedy (17-11) at bay. Kyber got out of a two-out, bases-loaded jam in the 
second inning and stranded six runners in the initial three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were one hit or one break away each of the first three innings," Coach 
Manny Alvarado said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real made the most of its opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton lined a two-out, two-run double in the third inning to give the 
Conquistadores a 3-1 lead, and Burnette's hit in the fifth put the game out of 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnette later scored on a double by Tays. 
</P>
<P>
 David Soto (3-3) took the loss for Kennedy, which had won 10 of its previous 
11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, the Golden Cougars became the latest in a long line of 
opponents to be shut down by El Camino Real's familiar No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does that, doesn't he?" Alvarado said.

CITY SECTION 4-A DIVISION BASEBALL SEMIFINALS; CHATSWORTH BACK AGAIN FOR BIG 
SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 And the Oscar goes to . . . Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 And so does the rest of the Chatsworth High baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Again. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Oscar Bocanegra gave an in-command performance Friday, pitching a 
four-hitter in the heat to lead Chatsworth to a 5-0 victory over Taft in a City 
Section 4-A Division semifinal at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up for top-seeded Chatsworth (28-4) is the big show Monday night at 
Chavez Ravine, where the Chancellors will play El Camino Real for the City 
championship in a rematch of last season's final, won by El Camino Real, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 It marks the third time in the past five years that El Camino Real and 
Chatsworth will play for the championship. Each year, Chatsworth has defeated 
Taft in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing to Chatsworth," a dejected Taft Coach Rich McKeon said, "is getting 
really old." 
</P>
<P>
 At least this time it was over quickly. Bocanegra (5-1), a 6-foot, 160-pound 
junior, made short work of Taft (16-16), throwing only 64 pitches in a game 
that lasted less than two hours. Seven batters reached base, but Taft never had 
more than one baserunner at a time. Bocanegra did not allow a runner past 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as quickly, Bocanegra summed up his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was throwing strikes," he said. "That's my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth scored twice in the second inning on a two-run infield single by 
Rod Daryabigi, whose slow roller crept under the glove of charging third 
baseman Mike Andrisano, allowing Tony Montiel and Mike Amado to score. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth, the Chancellors struck again off junior right-hander Justin 
Collins (5-4) with a double by pinch-hitter Fred Farzeneh that drove in Dan 
Phillips and Amado. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, it was simply a matter of how long it would take Bocanegra to 
record the necessary number of outs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Felt really good today," Bocanegra said. "The heat didn't bother me at all." 
</P>
<P>
 "Geez, he did a terrific job," Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn said. "He really 
took charge of things. It doesn't get much better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of Chatsworth's effort wasn't much worse. The Chancellors did not 
commit an error, and Montiel snared hard-hit grounders at third in the second 
and fourth innings to short-circuit potential rallies. And while Chatsworth 
tallied only six hits, two accounted for four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty indicative of a successful season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some terrific hitting and solid pitching," Meusborn said. "All 
year, we've been steady." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Chancellors, the only acceptable encore is a City championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to get back (to the City final)," senior catcher Brandon Murphy 
said. "That's what this whole season was for. We got there last year and lost, 
so winning it was all there is to play for this year."

LA QUINTA, LINCK GET THEIR SECOND CHANCE; BASEBALL: CATCHER HAS STEPPED IN FOR 
GRADUATED ALL-LEAGUE PLAYER GRANGER TO LEAD AZTECS BACK TO DIVISION III TITLE 
GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Joe Linck stood motionless on the field at Anaheim Stadium last June as he 
watched the pile of exuberant players grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin's baseball team had just defeated La Quinta, 3-2, in the Southern 
Section Division III championship game and Linck, La Quinta's junior designated 
hitter, was in denial. Emotions swirled within him while Tustin's celebration 
on the field continued. 
</P>
<P>
 His pain and disappointment turned quickly to anger as Tustin's players smiled 
and embraced; moments, he thought, that belonged to La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
 And although he could do nothing else about the outcome of that title game, 
Linck promised himself there would be a next time -- and things would be 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 His chance comes tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Aztecs' starting catcher, Linck has helped lead La Quinta to its 
second consecutive championship game. The senior and his teammates play West 
Torrance for the Division III title at 7:30 tonight at Cal State Fullerton. 
Linck's solid work behind the plate is a big reason the Aztecs are back in the 
game despite losing their team leader of three seasons to graduation, catcher 
Kenny Granger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting back to the final game has been on everyone's mind," Linck said. "I'm 
not saying that's all we thought about all the time, but it was always there in 
the back of our minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a new experience for us last season. Now we know what it's like and 
we're ready." 
</P>
<P>
 No Aztec is more prepared than Linck. 
</P>
<P>
 An understudy to Granger -- a three-time All-Garden Grove League selection -- 
the last two seasons, Linck has excelled in the leading role. On offense and 
defense, Linck has been a steadying force for La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
 Linck, 18, enters the championship game batting .305 with three home runs and 
26 runs batted in. While starting at designated hitter and receiving spot duty 
at catcher last season, Linck batted .303 with one homer and 22 RBIs. Linck's 
offensive numbers this season are especially impressive because opponents have 
walked him a team-leading 34 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Linck's work with his gear on has been even better, La Quinta Coach 
Dave Demarest said. Linck provides a good target for the Aztecs' pitching staff 
and has prevented more than a few runners from scoring by blocking would-be 
wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Blocking the plate is another of his skills. At 6 feet 2 and 195 pounds, Linck 
usually provides the bulk of punishment in collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nailing would-be base stealers is Linck's favorite part of the job, although 
he doesn't get many chances to test his arm because opponents seldom test him. 
Demarest does not keep stats on stolen bases by the opposition, but he'll bet 
his catcher has caught more than he has missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing the job Joe has done," Demarest said. "The two things you need 
to win in high school baseball are pitching and catching, and Joe gives us a 
guy behind the plate who our pitchers are comfortable throwing to." 
</P>
<P>
 A key to Linck's performance, Demarest said, is his understanding that he 
cannot be the type of catcher Granger was for La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't tried to do things that he's physically not capable of doing," the 
Aztec coach said. "He's learned to anticipate things really well and that's 
helped him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows he doesn't have the great arm like Kenny, but he gets rid of the 
ball real quick. He knows what he can do." 
</P>
<P>
 He was selected all-league in the coaches' voting, receiving one of the 
highest vote counts of all players picked, Demarest said. What's more, Linck 
has been chosen to play for the South squad in the Kiwanis Orange County high 
school all-star game Tuesday at Glover Stadium in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Kenny being so good, I just wanted to kind of try and fill in as best as 
I could," Linck said. "I never expected anything like this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Linck credits Granger with much of his success. Instead of brooding about 
being a backup last season, Linck used the time to watch Granger's every move 
-- and learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been a catcher since Little League, and I was anxious to get in there 
last season, but I knew I wouldn't with Kenny being here," Linck said. "But 
looking at what Kenny did really helped me. 
</P>
<P>
 "He helped me with my mental approach to the game and with technique, things 
like moving my feet and getting rid of the ball quicker. That meant a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Granger is glad he could lend a hand. A freshman catcher for State community 
college champion Cypress, Granger said he expected nothing less from Linck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy for him," Granger said. "Joe and I did drills together my 
senior year and I saw the potential he had. I knew he had the tools to get it 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 As great as the accolades are, Linck longs for one thing only. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've met my personal goals and then some," Linck said. "But my biggest goal 
is a team goal and we still have to get that." WEST TORRANCE VS. LA QUINTA 
</P>
<P>
 Division III 
</P>
<P>
 When: 7:30 tonight 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Titan Field, Cal State Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Records: West Torrance (25-6); 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta (27-3) 
</P>
<P>
 Starting pitchers: Kirk Bolling (10-2); Jim Livernois (14-3) 
</P>
<P>
 Noteworthy: La Quinta lost last season's title game to Tustin, 3-2. Livernois' 
availability at the plate is uncertain. The right-hander injured his left wrist 
while stealing second base in the semifinals. Joe Garcia (7-0) and Steve Combs 
(4-0, two saves) give the Aztecs the edge in pitching. West Torrance has a 
deep, powerful lineup led by Jim Yates (.506, seven homers, 41 runs batted in, 
41 runs) and Bolling (.478, seven homers, 37 RBIs).

HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; FOUNTAIN VALLEY HOLDS TIGHT FOR TITLE

<P>
 Fountain Valley High catcher Dan Hoppie ran in circles, still clutching the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 A moment earlier, he had been bulled over by Lakewood's Matt Demspey, who was 
trying to score from second on a two-out, seventh-inning single. Hoppie held on 
and so did the Barons. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley came away with a 3-2 victory to win the Southern Section 
Division I championship before 3,400 at Blair Field in Long Beach. The Barons 
are the first top-seeded team to win this division title since Lakewood in 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood (24-7), the second-seeded team, had runners on first and second when 
Art Martinez lined a 1-2 pitch into center field. Dempsey hit third as Matt 
Roman fielded the ball on one hop. 
</P>
<P>
 The throw was up the third-base line, and Dempsey arrived at the same moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hoppie: "I knew the guy was going to try to get a piece of me. I just had 
to hang on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons (27-3-1) scratched for everything they got. Lakewood pitcher Luke 
Fitzpatrick (11-2) gave up only four hits against a team that had scored 38 
runs in its first four playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Baron runs came without the benefit of hits. In the fourth, Geoff Wilson 
walked and later scored on a wild pitch. In the sixth, Wilson reached base on 
an error and later scored the game winner on a double-steal, as Hoppie got into 
a rundown. 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school baseball, you can't always wait for the base hit," Fountain 
Valley Coach Ron LaRuffa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers had runners on base in every inning, but stranded 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley starter Luke Hudson wobbled through three innings, giving up 
only a run-scoring single by Dempsey in the third. Jason Liuzzi (8-0) relieved 
in the fourth and went 3 2/3 innings, giving up only an unearned run. CHRIS

 CITY SECTION SEMIFINALS 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth 5, Taft 0 -- Right-hander Oscar Bocanegra (5-1) hurled a 
four-hitter to lead Chatsworth (28-4) to a victory over Taft (16-16) in a City 
Section 4-A Division semifinal at Pierce College. Top-seeded Chatsworth will 
play El Camino Real for the 4-A championship Monday at Dodger Stadium in a 
rematch of last season's final, won by El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real 6, Kennedy 2 -- Randy Wolf, who was drafted Friday by the 
Dodgers in the 25th round of the major league amateur draft, scattered three 
hits in the final two innings to earn the save for El Camino Real (22-7) in a 
4-A Division semifinal victory over Kennedy (17-11) at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park 2, Lincoln 1 -- Sergio Nolasco hit a double in the top of the 
third inning, advanced to third on a ground out to second by Mario Arambula and 
scored the winning run on an error by third baseman Lico Erami in a Division 
3-A semifinal game at Crystal Springs Park. Huntington Park improved to 12-7. 
Lincoln finished 19-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin 7, South Gate 3 -- Franklin outfielder Roberto Miranda had two hits

<TEXT>
<P>
 The ground around home plate appeared steady, but pitcher Marcy Crouch kept 
Foothill off-balance throughout. The right-handed junior struck out 10 and 
allowed one hit, a single, to lead Huntington Beach Marina to a 2-0 victory in 
the Southern Section Division I softball championship Friday night at Lakewood 
Mayfair Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (26-2) finish the season on a 16-game winning streak and allowed 
one run in their five playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Hibben's single to left field with two out in the bottom of the fifth 
scored pinch runner Megan Orach from third base for what proved to be the 
winning run. Lynette Velazquez added a sixth-inning RBI double scoring Crouch. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch (22-2) had 156 strikeouts this season and seven walks Santa Maria St. 
Joseph pitcher Kerri Duncan scattered seven hits and allowed one run to propel 
the Knights (24-6) to a 4-1 victory over La Canada (24-3) in the Division IV 
championship game. BARRY BAUM

STATE TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS; BOYKIN, PUGMIRE, CAULKINS LEAD COUNTY 
STAMPEDE INTO FINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The run for survival proved prosperous for Laguna Hills junior Tiffany Boykin. 
</P>
<P>
 The State preliminaries present a do-or-die situation for every athlete; only 
the top nine finishers from Friday's competition advance to today's finals, 
which start at 4 p.m. at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Running with Fresno Central's Kristie Johnson, who has the state's fastest 
time in the 800, Boykin, the Pacific Coast League champion, positioned herself 
comfortably behind and ran a personal best for the second consecutive week. 
</P>
<P>
 Boykin ran 2:12.90, taking almost a full second off her previous best from 
last week's Masters Meet of 2:13.83. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like running with Kristie," Boykin said. "She makes me faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching the halfway mark in 65.8, Johnson and Boykin, both juniors, pulled 
away from the field, with Johnson eventually posting the fastest qualifying 
time of 2:11.06. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am just going to run my hardest tomorrow and no matter what place that gets 
me, I'll be happy," Boykin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boykin's time established a county-best by 0.09 seconds, narrowly edging 
Edison senior Julie Koudelka. Koudelka also qualified for the final, running 
2:13.85 for second place in the third heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza's Courtney Pugmire and Carrie Caulkins continued to roll; both 
qualified for the finals in the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Running in separate heats, Caulkins finished fourth in the first, at a 
season-best 5:00.21; Pugmire finished fourth in the second heat at 4:59.59. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I expected to have at the start of the year was one girl in the State 
finals in the 800 and the other in the mile," Aztec distance coach Rich 
Medellin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caulkins finished third last season in the 1,600, and Pugmire finished sixth 
in the 800 at the Masters Meet, missing a chance to continue her season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Courtney was bound to make it in something," added Medellin about 
Pugmire, who posted the county's first sub-five minute race of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Tift, the Sea View League, county and Masters Meet champion this season, 
threw 57-8, the top qualifying mark in the shot put. 
</P>
<P>
 Although well off his personal best of 61-6 at the league finals, Tift's 
motive was just to get through the prelims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a good day, but that doesn't really matter today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill junior Tara Oettinger continued her consistency in the long jump, 
despite shifting winds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind was at my back on my first jump, then it switched for the other 
two," said Oettinger, the second-leading qualifier for the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 She opened the competition with her best effort of the afternoon, jumping 
18-11 3/4. Jernae Wright of Union City James Logan posted the day's top mark, 
jumping 19-8 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor senior Gina Heads returned to familiar surroundings, advancing 
to the finals in the shot put and discus. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads, the reigning county champion, finished fourth in the shot put (43-3 
1/2) and seventh in the discus (135-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Heads was fourth as a junior and sixth in the discus in the same meet as a 
junior last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge senior Gary Young was one of the county's major casualties, missing 
a qualifying spot in the 100 after pulling up in the final five meters of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a tear that he can't run (on it) . . . He feels it when he warms 
up," Warrior Coach George Varvas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who was diagnosed with a mild strain of the hamstring after a Wednesday 
practice session, ran 10.99 for seventh in his heat and was unable to contest 
the 200 later in the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Lete of Saddleback made his return to the meet count, running 38.54 for 
second in his heat of the 300 intermediate hurdles to advance to the final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't go out that hard at the start of the race, so my steps were a little 
off," said Lete, who ran in last season's preliminaries but did not qualify for 
the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar senior Jason Boyce continued his first full track season with a 
22-7 1/2qualifying leap in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-county soccer selection advanced in the sixth, despite being unable to 
find his regular jersey and resorting to a spare girl's uniform Coach Erich 
Moreno found in his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened to it," Boyce said. "My room looks like a cyclone 
hit it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Foothill boys' 1,600 relay team of Dan Foote, Don Oliver, Mike Boyes and 
Ethan Taub shaved over three seconds off their county-best time this season, 
advancing to the final in 3:15.79. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison sophomore Kerry O'Bric advanced as the sixth qualifier in the triple 
jump (37-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine senior Jeff Bodholdt qualified by taking the ninth and final spot with 
his first throw in the discus (168-1).

ORANGE COUNTY ALL-STAR VOLLEYBALL; ONE OF SMALLEST PLAYERS COMES UP BIG FOR 
NORTH SQUAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Estancia's Mike Truong was one of the smallest all-stars, but he came up with 
the biggest plays and the big award at the annual Orange County All-Star 
volleyball match. 
</P>
<P>
 Truong, a 5-foot-10 outside hitter, had a match-high 10 kills and earned MVP 
honors in leading the North to a 34-32, 33-31, 23-31 victory over the South 
Friday night at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous feeling being named MVP," Truong said. "I was intimidated 
at first with these guys because they're all so big and so good." 
</P>
<P>
 But Truong helped the North win the second game to clinch the match, making 
the third game in the rally-scoring exhibition match moot. 
</P>
<P>
 Said North Coach Rocky Ciarelli of Huntington Beach: "After I saw him at 
practice I knew he was a good player. He plays good defense, has a nice serve 
and he can really get up in the air and spike it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another under-publicized, undersized player, Kiet Tran of Los Amigos, provided 
a spark for the North, tallying seven kills, five in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we showed that although we're small, it's not just our jumping 
ability, but we're good players too," Truong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Truong and Tran benefited from the setting of Craig LeSueur of Foothill, who 
had 18 assists in Game 2. Ryan Allen of Edison, who also started for the North 
in Game 2, had nine kills and Mitch McCoy of Newport Harbor had six. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hefty of Dana Hills had seven kills and three blocks and Chris Jacobson of 
El Toro had six kills and two blocks to lead the South. 
</P>
<P>
 The South girls' fared better and won behind MVP Nina Foster's 15 kills, 
31-23, 28-31, 31-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster and Mission Viejo teammate setter Analisa Saylor gave the North fits. 
While Foster, who also had two blocks, blasted away in the middle, Jeanne 
Vetter of Dana Hills, who had 12 kills, and Hilary Kyle of Laguna Beach, who 
had eight kills, pounded from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The North made it interesting in Game 2, rallying from a 19-14 deficit to win, 
31-28.

<P>
 Cal State Northridge's Kristin Dunn finished third in the women's javelin 
Friday with a distance of 167 feet 1 inch at the NCAA track and field

KMART GETS RED LIGHT ON SPECIALTY STOCK PLAN; RETAILING: SHAREHOLDERS REBUKE 
MANAGEMENT'S PROPOSAL TO RAISE $600 MILLION BY SELLING SHARES IN OTHER UNITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kmart management was dealt a major defeat Friday when it failed to win 
shareholder approval for its controversial plan to sell stock in its specialty 
retail units. 
</P>
<P>
 The setback signals the growing clout of shareholders and is seen by some 
analysts as a stinging rebuke to the leadership of Kmart Chairman Joseph 
Antonini. The vote came one day after Kmart reported that May sales dropped 
2.5% in stores open at least one year. Kmart lost $974 million for the 12-month 
period ended Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., wanted to sell 20% to 30% of its equity in 
Builders Square, OfficeMax, Borders-Waldenbooks and Sports Authority chains. 
The proposal was a bid to raise $600 million to $900 million to bolster its 
slumping discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan drew fire from several powerful pension funds, including the 
California Public Employees Retirement System, which wanted Kmart to sell 100% 
of the units. Critics said the Kmart proposal would not have raised enough 
money to help the discount stores and would not give shareholders an adequate 
return.  
</P>
<P>
 According to a preliminary count, the proposal received 184.7 million votes, 
or 61% of the shares voted, but it needed an absolute majority of the company's 
416 million shares outstanding to pass. About 27.8% of the company's 
outstanding shares failed to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are obviously disappointed that our specialty retail stock proposal failed 
to get the affirmative vote of the majority of our outstanding shares," 
Antonini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say the vote was a stinging message to Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shareholders sent a message of no confidence in management," said Kurt 
Barnard, a New York-based retail economist. "Kmart's board of directors are on 
the spot because they have to find a way to raise capital to make Kmart more 
competitive. Wal-Mart is eating Kmart's breakfast, lunch, dinner and midnight 
snack."  
</P>
<P>
 Barnard said Antonini's future as Kmart's chief may now be in jeopardy. 
Antonini, 52, became chief executive and chairman in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extraordinary slap to the face of Kmart's management," Barnard 
said. " . . . It's a new chapter in shareholder relations." 
</P>
<P>
 Activist investors are becoming more critical of compensation systems that 
reward top managers even when their companies are faring poorly. One investor 
at Friday's meeting drew cheers when he suggested that Kmart executives cut 
their pay and benefits to reflect the drop in earnings. Antonini responded that 
executive compensation was already linked to the company's performance.  
</P>
<P>
 Kmart said it will consider new options for raising money for its discount 
chain in the wake Friday's developments. The board is scheduled to hold its 
next meeting June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart shares rose 50 cents to $16 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. 
The stock has plunged from $22 earlier this year.

CHANGING BLOOMIE'S; POSH RETAILER SAYS ITS SNOOTY DAYS ARE OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For two generations of upscale New Yorkers, the elegant Art Deco department 
store at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue was much more than a place to shop. 
It was a place to see the new and glamorous, a place to get a date, a place to 
experience retailing as theater. 
</P>
<P>
 It was . . . Bloomie's, the second-biggest tourist attraction in the Big 
Apple, a hotbed of high fashion. Sure, Bloomingdale's was expensive, but then 
Manhattan was never a place to save money. You find the service a bit brusque? 
Well wake up, honey, this is New York! 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the legendary institution plans to open four stores in Southern 
California, reportedly including one on Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills. The 
first store could open by spring of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is coming as a much-changed operation, with a chairman well-schooled in 
the ways of Southland retailing. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Bloomingdale's has tracked and defined many of the central currents 
of post-World War II consumerism, right up to a near-fatal leveraged buyout in 
the 1980s and a new, service-oriented approach for the 1990s. In its newest 
incarnation, the store is a little less glamorous and a little less New York, 
but that just might make it play better west of the Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been changing dramatically for the past 2 1/2 years," says Michael 
Gould, Bloomingdale's chairman, who once headed the Robinson's department store 
chain and Giorgio of Beverly Hills. Under Gould's predecessor, Marvin Traub, 
Bloomingdale's became famous for just about everything except customer service. 
Founded by two brothers in 1872, the store was long a successful but 
undistinguished competitor on the New York retailing scene, until Traub turned 
it into a phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 He supported young, unknown designers, and played a key role in popularizing 
the likes of Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Donna Karan. He created the 
shopping bag as artwork and developed spectacular themed promotions featuring 
the art and culture of countries and regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Its 1980 China festival, for example, cost $2.5 million and attracted 11 
million visitors and generated 415 pages of media coverage, according to 
Traub's recently published memoir, "Like No Other Store." 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to merchandising and visual display, when it comes to 
generating traffic, no one could outdo us," Traub boasts in the book. Through 
much of the 1970s and 1980s, Bloomingdale's was the place to shop, for society 
matrons, celebrities and the merely upper-middle-class. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1988, Canadian developer Robert Campeau acquired Bloomingdale's parent 
company Federated Department Stores, in what proved to be a disastrous 
leveraged buyout. By 1990 the company was in bankruptcy -- and the glitzy, 
consumption-crazed 1980s, which played perfectly with Traub's exuberant style, 
were very much over. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the financial crisis, Bloomingdale's had weaknesses. The 14 
stores outside of Manhattan were never able to match the cachet of the 
flagship, which accounted for nearly half the chain's sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "The snap, crackle and pop works best on Lexington Avenue," says Alan 
Millstein, editor of the Fashion Network Report. "Many of the branches look 
pale compared to the mother store." 
</P>
<P>
 And the high prices and inattentive service hurt, especially outside New York. 
Gould, who took over after Traub was forced out in 1991, is squarely focused on 
these issues, which will undoubtedly be critical to success in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't pay enough attention to the (non-Manhattan) stores," he says. "We 
didn't look at the nuances of the locales, didn't have the right specialty 
merchandise. . . . There was a fixation on 59th Street at the expense of the 
other stores." 
</P>
<P>
 Gould acknowledges that shifting too much attention to the branches and giving 
up theater in favor of service could undermine what made Bloomingdale's 
special. But he's confident that Californians, 60,000 of whom already shop at 
Bloomingdale's by catalogue or when traveling, will be sufficiently impressed.  
</P>
<P>
 And at least some visitors don't think Bloomingdale's has lost any of its 
verve, at least not in Manhattan.  
</P>
<P>
 "I very much like the style of the building and the atmosphere," said 
Jacqueline Kessler, a resident of St. Gallen, Switzerland, who was shopping 
there Friday. "Every time I come to New York, I have to come to 
Bloomingdale's." Bloomingdale's at a Glance

IDB'S SUDIKOFF CONFIRMS SEC PROBE OF FIRM; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE CALLS THE INVESTIGATION INTO RESIGNATION OF AUDITORS AN 'INFORMAL 
INQUIRY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 IDB Communications Group confirmed Friday that the Securities and Exchange 
Commission is looking into the resignation of the firm's auditors last week 
following an apparent dispute over IDB's accounting practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Chief Executive Jeffrey P. Sudikoff described the SEC probe 
as "an informal inquiry" following the Culver City-based telecommunications 
company's announcement earlier this week that the accounting firm Deloitte & 
Touche dropped IDB's account. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a local guy. He said, 'Tell me what everybody said to everybody.' He 
called as a result of what he read in the newspaper," Sudikoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC declined to comment. The agency typically does not discuss its 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sources said IDB had been close to a deal to sell its broadcast 
division -- the original IDB business -- until the Deloitte flap. 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcast unit, which transmits TV and radio programming for the three 
major networks and numerous other clients, brought in $73 million in sales last 
year, or 24% of IDB's total revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But broadcast revenue has been flat for several years, and because of the 
relatively low margins in the business, analysts have expected IDB to jettison 
it and focus instead on its faster-growing international long-distance phone 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential buyer for the broadcast unit is believed to be a U.S. company 
with some foreign backing. If IDB can salvage the deal, it should help the 
company's financial credibility because the buyer would be expected to review 
IDB's books on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 IDB's stock tumbled Wednesday by more than 50%, from $14.50 a share to $7.125, 
in the wake of Deloitte's resignation. In Nasdaq trading Friday, IDB shares 
jumped as high as $9.05 before pulling back to close at $8, off 31 cents from 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deloitte's resignation has raised questions about IDB's financial statements 
and whether the firm's accounting practices have overstated its growth, 
especially in its global long-distance business. IDB says its accounting 
disagreements with Deloitte were minor, but Deloitte has yet to provide its 
side of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, IDB is now the target of shareholder lawsuits claiming the company 
misled investors with its financial reports, news releases and interviews. IDB 
said it has not seen any of the suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff recently made news when he and Joseph Cohen, an IDB director, bought 
72% of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team for $60 million from financially 
ailing sports mogul Bruce McNall. On Friday, Sudikoff reiterated that the 
plunge in IDB's stock will not affect his Kings investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings sale was financed largely by a $50-million loan from Bank of 
America, with the franchise itself serving as collateral.

 U.S. toy maker Mattel Inc. on Friday announced a $78.32-million offer for 
British games maker J.W. Spear & Sons, a last-minute bid to spoil the party for 
main competitor Hasbro Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Spear is best known for holding the rights outside the United States to the 
popular word game Scrabble. 
</P>
<P>
 The move again pits Mattel against archrival Hasbro. Mattel last year dropped 
a multimillion-dollar lawsuit after Hasbro agreed to make its best-selling 
doll, Sindy, look less like Mattel's Barbie. Hasbro is the largest American toy 
company and owns the U.S. rights to Scrabble. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattel's cash offer values each Spear share at $15, trumping the $13.50 on the 
table from Hasbro. Spear's board immediately backed the higher offer.

PRICE / COSTCO'S BULLISH RUN HEADS FOR TIJUANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When U.S. retailers took the discount membership warehouse concept to Mexico, 
few envisioned that the giant stores would be so successful in such a 
relatively short time. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego-based Price/Costco, which opened its first Price Club in Mexico City 
in 1992 and now has six outlets, says business has been so good that it plans 
to build six more in Mexico by the end of the year in partnership with Mexican 
retailer Comercial Mexicana. 
</P>
<P>
 The company confirmed Friday that it closed a land deal this week for its 
first location in Tijuana. Price/Costco officials said the company expects to 
open the store by December under the Price Club de Mexico banner. Other stores 
are planned for Acapulco and Hermosillo, as well as a second store in Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart's Sam's Club unit is also expanding rapidly in Mexico via joint 
ventures with Mexican partners. Sam's Club has opened 13 outlets called Club 
Aurrera in partnership with the Grupo Cifra retailing giant. More are on the 
way, including at least one in Tijuana, but Wal-Mart won't say how many or how 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Price/Costco co-Chairman Robert Price said the clubs are succeeding because 
they offer dramatically lower prices -- the same reason the membership 
warehouse concept swept the U.S. retail market in the early 1980s. Price Co., 
the pioneering company founded by Sol Price in 1976, merged with Costco 
Wholesale of Seattle last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The warehouses have become a principal outlet for Mexican consumers hungry for 
U.S.-made goods, demand for which is expected to keep growing now that the 
North American Free Trade Agreement is in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The chains have been pleasantly surprised at the large average purchases made 
by consumers, many of whom make the shopping trips a kind of extended family 
outing. In fact, the average total purchases made by Mexican customers per 
visit exceeds that of U.S. members, said John Skousen, president of Price Club 
de Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Average per-store sales volume at Mexican sites is "at the upper end" of the 
chain's overall average of between $80 million and $100 million per location 
per year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The warehouse clubs also serve a wholesale distribution function for Mexican 
businesses in that they are channels for U.S. products that are either 
unavailable or priced much higher elsewhere in Mexico, said Laura Forte, a 
Smith Barney retail analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican businesses send trucks from hundreds of miles away to fetch goods for 
resale in Mexico's interior, said Sean Doyle, a Cushman Realty agent in San 
Diego who brokered the Tijuana land deal for Price/Costco. 
</P>
<P>
 Although analysts say the Mexican market is too small to significantly affect 
the overall sales of Price/Costco or Wal-Mart, the success of both chains has 
proven the appeal of U.S. exports and NAFTA's stimulative effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exactly what we said the free-trade agreement would do for U.S. 
retailers, that they could go set up in Mexico and sell products because now 
they have lower costs," said Rudy Fernandez, director of Mexico Affairs in 
California's Trade and Commerce Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion of the warehouse clubs in Mexico also shows how U.S. 
merchandisers are turning away from the "over-retailed" U.S. market for greener 
international pastures, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price insisted that the new Tijuana store will not "cannibalize" sales from 
Price/Costco's nearby Chula Vista store, which counts on Mexican shoppers for 
much of its business. Mexican shoppers who now cross the border to shop will 
continue to do so, he said, while the new site will serve Tijuanans who don't 
have crossing privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, analysts say, Mexico has been a boon for a range of U.S. retailers 
and service firms and many are looking to expand their presence. Doyle cited 
recent leases and land sales with Kmart, paint supplier Sherwin-Williams and 
theater chains Cinemark and AMC.

FORD GROUNDS ELECTRIC VANS AFTER 2ND FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co. grounded its fleet of electric vans Friday following an 
early-morning fire that erupted in a vehicle battery as it was being charged at 
a California Air Resources Board facility in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire is the second to occur in the last month in a Ford Ecostar, the 
company's electric-powered test vehicle. On May 2, a Ford electric vehicle was 
damaged by a similar battery fire in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in either incident. In Friday's fire, damage was mostly 
confined to the batteries, which are at the rear of the vehicle under the van 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicles are powered by sodium-sulfur batteries made by ABB, a Swedish 
electrical engineering firm with battery operations in Canada and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Sodium-sulfur batteries provide good range and acceleration. But safety has 
been a concern throughout their development, because the batteries must be kept 
at a constant temperature of 600 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford has 34 electric vehicles being tested nationwide by 12 customers, mostly 
utilities. In the wake of Friday's incident, it has asked the customers not to 
use the vehicles and to park them outside until the cause of the fires can be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first fire, Ford said the problem had been traced to faulty welds in 
the battery cells. But the second fire is forcing Ford and ABB to re-evaluate. 
"We thought the first fire was an isolated incident," Ford spokeswoman Pam 
Keuber said. "We want to proceed very cautiously." 
</P>
<P>
 Other batteries built using the same procedure have not been placed in 
service.  
</P>
<P>
 ARB spokesman Bill Sessa said the agency -- the driving force behind 
California's requirement that auto makers sell zero-emission vehicles in the 
state by 1998 -- had been testing the Ecostar for a couple of weeks. An 
employee discovered the fire upon arriving at work about 6:40 a.m. The local 
fire department extinguished the fire.

 Auto Makers Report Moderate Sales Gains: Domestic sales of cars and light 
trucks slowed slightly in May but still grew, as auto makers benefited from 
continuing consumer confidence and an aging auto fleet on the nation's 
highways. Figures released by auto makers show that total sales by foreign and 
U.S. manufacturers were up about 3% from a year ago, with light trucks 
accounting for nearly all the growth.Ford Motor Co. said car sales were up 
1.5%, while truck sales increased nearly 6%. Chrysler Corp.'s car sales were 
down 5%, but the company had the best May in its history for trucks. General 
Motors Corp.'s report was similar: Car sales were down slightly, but truck 
buyers pushed total vehicle deliveries up more than 1%. GM's Saturn subsidiary 
reported earlier in the week that sales rose 14% from a year earlier.

ACCOUNTING FIRMS MUST WATCH THEIR PS AND QS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Accounting firms are finding the going tricky in a business landscape heavily 
pocked with liability land mines, as separate incidents this week show. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court jury this week ordered Ernst & Young and two 
former accountants to pay $14.2 million to a Paramount-based aircraft parts 
manufacturer in a fraud and malpractice suit dating to 1989. The punitive 
damages portion of the trial is scheduled to begin June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, experts say it is still too early to determine whether another Big 
Six accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche, is vulnerable in lawsuits being filed 
by irate shareholders against IDB Communications Group, a high-flying Culver 
City company that Deloitte recently dumped as a client. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the savings and loan industry debacle, accountants and 
other professionals have become frequent -- and sometimes lucrative -- targets 
in liability cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Big Six firms -- which also include Arthur Andersen, Coopers & 
Lybrand, KPMG Peat Marwick and Price Waterhouse -- said Friday they spent more 
than $1 billion on legal bills in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The accounting firms contend they have been unfairly targeted by plaintiffs 
who bring frivolous or weak suits against auditors, hoping that the threat of 
protracted litigation will prompt an offer of settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Their advisers, meanwhile, have put them on notice to exercise extreme caution 
in accepting clients and their potentially questionable practices. 
</P>
<P>
 But accounting firms are just beginning to heed that advice, said Arthur 
Bowman, publisher of Bowman's Accounting Report. "As short as a year or so 
ago," he said, "I thought they were just giving it lip service. But some of the 
recent activity appears to show that accounting firms are investigating 
(clients) more closely." 
</P>
<P>
 Deloitte dropped IDB, apparently over disagreements involving revenue and 
income statements -- one of a handful of instances in recent months in which 
accounting firms have pulled away from clients over what appear to be 
relatively moderate disputes. Other companies from which outside auditors have 
resigned include FastComm Communications Corp. of Sterling, Va., and Cambridge 
Biotech Corp. of Worcester, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's risk management," Bowman said. "These firms have really got to take a 
good look at these clients, to decide if it's worth the $100,000 to $500,000" 
they may earn in an audit to "risk maybe a $2-million exposure from irate 
shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 The $14.2-million jury award came Thursday. Mattco Forge of Paramount alleged 
that malpractice by the Arthur Young accounting firm led to the dismissal of an 
earlier lawsuit it had brought against General Electric. Ernst & Young 
inherited the dispute when it was formed in the 1989 merger of Arthur Young and 
Ernst & Whinney. In March, the same jury found that the accounting firm had 
committed fraud and malpractice in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Ernst & Young said the firm will have no comment until the 
punitive damages portion of the case has been resolved. Attorneys for Mattco 
expect an appeal; Ernst & Young has brought four of the five appeals that have 
already marked the lawsuit's journey through the courts.

 Japan's Current Account Surplus Rises Again: Japan's April current account 
balance, the measure of the flow of goods and services in and out of the 
country, rose 22.6% from a year earlier to a surplus of $13.977 billion, the 
Ministry of Finance said. The number was higher than economists had expected. 
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News predicted April's current 
account surplus would be $12.3 billion.

 Milken Distances Himself From Lawsuit: Junk bond felon Michael Milken sought 
to distance himself from an investment firm he founded that is suing the 
nation's largest black-owned business, TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. 
The Carlton Investments partnership filed suit Wednesday in Chancery Court in 
Delaware, where TLC Beatrice is incorporated, seeking access to TLC Beatrice's 
books to determine the value of its 26% stake. The suit also claimed TLC 
Beatrice's management is wasting its resources. Milken said in a statement that 
he is playing no role in the lawsuit, doesn't exercise control over Carlton and 
has been trying for several weeks to divest his interest in the group.

STOCKS, BONDS REBOUND AFTER JOBS REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks and bonds staged strong rallies Friday after the May employment report 
showed a healthy economy free of major inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 A surging dollar and falling commodity prices also gave the markets a lift. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates initially soared and equities fell in early trading after the 
Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate plunged to 6% in 
May, from 6.4% in April. The rise was triggered by anxiety that the lower 
jobless rate was a signal of stronger economic growth, which can create 
inflationary pressures. Bolstering that view, the report also said that average 
hourly wages rose to $11.11 from $11.05, a sizable increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation can diminish the value of bonds, which pay a fixed rate of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it began recovering as investors took a closer look at the data. The 
report showed a smaller-than-expected increase in the number of workers added 
to non-farm payrolls, with only 191,000 new hires last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond yield ended the week at 7.27%, down from 
7.35% at Thursday's close. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, 
rose 25/32, or $7.813 per $1,000 of face value. 
</P>
<P>
 With Treasury prices rising for the third consecutive day, strategists said 
investors were taking a break from the bear market that has hammered bond 
prices in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average followed the bond market higher, ending 13.23 
points higher at 3,772.22. The blue chip indicator finished the week with a 
gain of 15.08 points. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 12 to 7 
on the New York Stock Exchange, where 270.38 million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes also moved higher. The NYSE's composite index rose 1.26 
to 254.34. The Nasdaq index of mostly smaller firms rose 2.70 to 742.20. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency market, the dollar advanced against other major currencies, 
rising to a two-week high against the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was quoted at 1.670 marks and 105.30 Japanese yen in late New York 
trading, up from 1.654 marks and 104.85 yen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said a decline in commodities prices, seen in a 1% drop in the 
Commodities Research Bureau's futures index, helped buoy bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRB index of 21 futures closed at 232.05, down 2.30 points for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said lower soybean and crude oil prices pressured the index, which is 
a closely watched inflation barometer. But the pressure was probably temporary 
because it was a technical correction, they said. Gold lost $3.50 an ounce to 
close at $380.70 on the Comex. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Retailers stumbled for the second day after reporting lackluster May sales 
Thursday. The Gap lost 2 1/8 to 39 7/8. J.C. Penney fell 1 1/2 to 48 1/4. But 
Sears bucked the trend, rising 1 to 51. 
</P>
<P>
 * Food stocks rose on analysts' upgrades and takeover speculation. Kellogg 
rose 2 3/8 to 55 5/8 after CS First Boston upgraded the stock to "buy" from 
"hold," saying the company should benefit from an improved domestic cereal 
business. Analyst Michael Mauboussin also set a share price target of 66 to 67. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kellogg pushed other food stocks higher. General Mills rose 1 1/8 to 56 3/8; 
Quaker Oats advanced 2 1/2 to 70 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sara Lee rose 1/2 to 22 3/4 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to "buy" 
from "hold," saying earnings should improve gradually in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks fell after General Motors Corp. announced it would convert some 
cumulative stock into common shares. GM lost 1 1/2 to 52; Chrysler fell 1 1/4 
to 47 1/2; Ford declined 5/8 to 56 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * IDB Communications led in volume in Nasdaq trading, falling 5/16 to 8. The 
company said it is confident of its 1994 first-quarter results as reported to 
the SEC, and said it will cooperate with an SEC investigation of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas markets, Germany's 30-share DAX average ended 18.69 points higher 
at 2,148.39, while London's Financial Times 100-share average ended up 17 
points at 2,997.8.  
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average fell 54.81 points to 20,954.19 and Mexico 
City's Bolsa index ended 18.92 points higher at 2,464.98.

 Wal-Mart Predicts $84 Billion in Sales: Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the retailing 
company started by Sam Walton just over two decades ago in rural Arkansas, is 
poised to top $100 billion in sales next year and become the world's largest 
company not too long after. Already the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart told 
shareholders at its annual meeting in Fayetteville, Ark., that its sales this 
year will soar to $84 billion."At the current rate of growth of 25%, Wal-Mart 
sales will hit $100 billion by 1995," said John Eade, retail analyst at Argus 
Research. That will put it in an elite club of giant oil and auto companies 
that have reached that lofty sales level. And if it maintains its longstanding 
growth rate of roughly 20% a year, it will challenge General Motors Corp. as 
the world leader in sales just two years after. GM's sales are about $135 
million, and it has a much slower growth rate.

 GE Jet Engines Focus of Probe: The government is investigating allegations 
that 7,000 military and commercial jet aircraft engines, including the ones 
that power President Clinton's plane, may be defective, the Justice Department 
said. The manufacturer, General Electric Co., denied the allegations, saying 
the engines have flown for more than 200 million hours without an electrical 
problem such as the one in question.The Federal Aviation Administration said it 
is investigating charges of flawed electrical bonding on GE aircraft engines 
but had found no indications of a safety problem. The Cleveland Plain-Dealer 
first reported the investigation. It quoted a civil damage suit filed by a 
whistle-blowing GE employee as saying the engines "unnecessarily endanger the 
health and well-being of pilots, maintenance service personnel and passengers, 
including the very real likelihood of loss of life."

RTC SAYS IT WON'T NEED ALL FUNDS ALLOCATED

<P>
 Jack Ryan, the Resolution Trust Corp.'s acting chief executive, is telling 
lawmakers that his agency may need only $5 billion of the $18.3 billion that 
the Clinton Administration fought for much of its first year. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC will still spend about $10 billion on resolutions before closing shop, 
Ryan has said.But about half that will come from money provided before last 
year's legislation, leaving only another $5 billion to be funded from the 1993 
RTC Completion Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Katsansos, a spokesman for the agency, confirmed the figures but said 
the estimates are subject to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We view that as an extremely soft number," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the forecast holds up, the remaining money may never be drawn from the 
Treasury. But under provisions of the 1993 funding bill, it could be funneled 
into the fledgling Savings Assn. Insurance Fund if conditions are met. 
</P>
<P>
 The surplus funds could help resolve a sticky political problem. The Bank 
Insurance Fund is expected to recapitalize within the next two years. Once that 
happens, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is expected to lower bank premiums 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 But thrifts are expected to continue paying higher premiums for years to come, 
creating a competitive disadvantage for the industry. Some thrift 
representatives are pressing Congress to consider merging the two insurance 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, there are murmurs on Capitol Hill about the possibility of using the 
leftover funds as a "sweetener" to encourage banks to support legislation 
merging the savings industry fund with the bank fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking industry representatives add that thrift lobbyists are beginning to 
talk up the idea of giving leftover RTC funds to a merged agency.

POP REVIEW / MIKE BOEHM; POSSUM DIXON: A METHOD TO THEIR MAYHEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Possum Dixon named itself after a fugitive wanted for murder. Playing Thursday 
night at the Coach House, the Los Angeles band lived up to that self-billing in 
method, if not in madness. 
</P>
<P>
 The four members slashed and bashed for 47 non-fastidious minutes, but they 
committed their flavorfully poppy mayhem with a collective grin rather than a 
malicious fury. 
</P>
<P>
 There is frustration enough in the songs that chief writers Rob Zabrecky and 
Robert O'Sullivan churned out for the band's 1993 debut album -- most of them 
take on the old "can't get no satisfaction" theme, with dull, dead-end jobs and 
inaccessible objects of lust the chief sources of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 On stage, Possum Dixon just mowed down those troubles and turned its songs 
into springboards for old-fashioned rock 'n' roll exuberance, applied with 
plenty of bouncing around and shaking all over. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Zabrecky, pianist-guitarist O'Sullivan and guitarist Celso Chavez were 
all from the bowling-pin school of rock stagecraft, repeatedly flopping to the 
floor and rolling about while attempting to extract something more or less 
(usually less) coherent from their instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 What held it together was the band's knack for the catchy, sing-along hook. 
</P>
<P>
 Sameness would threaten to set in as one fast-paced song barreled into the 
next, with Zabrecky's ordinary sing-speak vocals out front. But then a crisp 
pop morsel would appear and lend the material as much liveliness as the 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Invisible," with its canned techno-pop pulse, served as a slower, more 
detached and off-kilter change of pace from the evening's prevailing frenzy. 
The jaunty "Watch the Girl Destroy Me" was another helpful departure, sounding 
a bit like a '90s updating of the Small Faces' '60s chestnut, "Itchycoo Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Without blatantly copying, Possum Dixon mainly recalled such garage-y, 
late-'70s-vintage New Wave bands as Talking Heads and the B-52's, or perhaps 
Elvis Costello & the Attractions at their most careless. But Possum Dixon 
lacked the art-kitsch trappings of the first two, or the howling chagrin of 
Costello. 
</P>
<P>
 With his perpetual look of boyish mischief, Zabrecky was not trying to purge 
anger or pose ironies. His agenda as lead singer and primary human jumping bean 
and St. Vitus dancer was simple fun. The band seemed not the least daunted by a 
sparse turnout of perhaps 100 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides running through 10 songs from its album and a small handful of 
originals not on it, Possum Dixon offered a couple of little-altered, if 
rough-hewn, covers: "For Your Love" by the Yardbirds and the stormy, 
set-closing "Days of Wine and Roses," by the '80s Los Angeles band Dream 
Syndicate. Zabrecky also inserted a couple of mocking, lounge-singer snippets 
of Madonna tunes during the Possum number "Executive Slacks." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Possum Dixon is a friendly diversion of a band. It won't haunt 
or rivet an audience, but it does a good job of representing the 
just-messing-around school of rock 'n' roll fun in a way that's sufficiently 
attentive to pop craft and brisk concert pacing not to let just-messing spill 
over into an aimless mess. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicianship could stand some tightening, but not so much that the band 
would lose its likable rawness. Possum Dixon's challenge is to develop the 
offhanded expertise of a band like Cracker and the muscular drive of the 
Smithereens, without reining in any of its gleeful exuberance and freewheeling 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-billed Trouble Dolls have added a solid bassist in Dan Elliott but 
remain a band in transition. Michael Bay, the guitarist who quit the band last 
year along with its bassist, Mark Soden, was back as a favor to his old 
buddies. Founders John Surge and Ron Cambra are still looking for a new lead 
guitarist to complete the band. 
</P>
<P>
 The set hit an early peak with the Who-ish "I Know," from the band's 1993 
debut album, "Cement." But it failed to build from there, and two new songs 
were not striking on first hearing. The band's recasting of the old 
Bachman-Turner Overdrive barn-burner, "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet," as a slow, 
nervous-sounding plaint was more interesting in concept than in execution.

CABLE GIVES THE NETWORKS A LITTLE LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "fX Affects C-SPAN's Viewership" (May 30), Jane Hall quotes C-SPAN's Brian 
Lamb as saying: "I have nothing against fX, but the government has given the 
broadcast networks a powerful jump-start with their new cable networks, an 
advantage that no one else has." In reality, this advantage was given to the 
networks not by the government but by the cable industry itself. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, cable TV systems have been profiting from the resale of network 
affiliate and local over-the-air signals. The retransmission consent rules 
issued by the Federal Communications Commission as the result of the Cable TV 
Act gave cable operators a choice in how to deal with stations that now had the 
right to be compensated for the sale of their signal. Cable operators could 
either negotiate fair compensation for the retransmission of these signals or 
not carry them. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable industry unilaterally refused cash payments. The uniformity of these 
refusals was sufficient to gain the attention of Sen. Daniel K. Inouye 
(D-Hawaii), who asked the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission 
to look into possible collusion. Cable operators insisted that their decisions 
were reached independently, without consulting or contacting other operators. 
</P>
<P>
 They now had a dilemma. They had refused to negotiate a cash payment but could 
not afford to simply drop the signal. Offering guaranteed coverage of the 
networks' new cable channels was now the only option remaining to the cable 
industry. Deals were soon completed for fX (Fox), ESPN-2 (ABC/Hearst) and 
America's Talking (NBC). At the same time, a public relations campaign was 
started to inform consumers of the great job their local cable company had done 
in protecting them from network greed. Everyone was a winner; no one was a 
loser. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the other shoe has dropped. The cable operators knew a year ago that 
sooner or later they would have to honor their agreements and add these new 
channels, with, in many cases, higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the cable industry chooses to blame the government for their 
dilemma does not alter the fact that they had an alternative open to them a 
year ago. Instead, they chose to commit to new channels at a time when channel 
space was at a premium. Brian Lamb and his viewers are now suffering the 
consequences of that decision.

RAVI SHANKAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On May 22, one of the world's most acclaimed classical musicians presented two 
full-length concerts on a single day to sold-out audiences of more than 4,000 
appreciative Angelenos. Each program was composed of different works from the 
classical repertoire, featured more than two hours of nonstop virtuoso solo and 
ensemble playing and offered sublime cadenzas that took the full measure of a 
master's half-century musical career. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps in the best of all possible multicultural worlds, the fact that the 
musical traditions of the performers were not European, but Indian, and the 
fact that the renowned soloist was not Yehudi Menuhin or Alfred Brendel, but 
Ravi Shankar, would not have made a difference in quality of the event's 
coverage by the local paper of record ("Shankar Brings East to West in 
Pasadena," May 24). 
</P>
<P>
 But The Times reviewer could only characterize this profound musical 
experience as a "jam session" and belittled part of the audience, dismissing 
them as "old, ex- and current hippies." The particulars of the review are only 
important in that they betray a writer unfamiliar with a complex and immensely 
rich body of music that is part of the cultural heritage of hundreds of 
millions of people. It seems odd that in such a culturally diverse metropolitan 
area its leading paper is not equipped to review non-European classical music.

'LOVELINE' DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Jon Matsumoto's "Rachtman Tunes In With 'Loveline' " (May 23) 
on the show "Loveline" on KROQ-FM -- which continues on the air despite 
disputed ownership: Since I (the Poorman) was removed from KROQ in August, 
1993, the overall show ratings have dropped from a 12.2 to an 8.9 share in the 
10 p.m. hour and from a 13.9 to a 9.3 in the 11 p.m. hour, according to the 
latest Arbitron ratings.  
</P>
<P>
 If co-host Dr. Drew Pinsky really feels the show is better without the 
Poorman, then I am shocked.How can he be satisfied at losing a third of his 
audience? It's further disappointing to hear this when I discovered and first 
placed him on the program and never heard a word of his unhappiness during our 
entire 10 years together. 
</P>
<P>
 After being thrown off the air for what was merely returning a similar prank 
by another KROQ deejay, I begged management for four months to work this thing 
out. They did not want to, and, due to my contract, Infinity Broadcasting not 
only won't allow me back on KROQ but also is preventing me from working at any 
radio station until my contract runs out this November (14 months off the air). 
Regrettably, I was left no choice but to file a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsumoto should have contacted me (the show's creator) to get the other side 
of the story: I started this show 11 years ago, took it to No. 1 and now 
witness its sad downward spiral.

JOE PASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My heart is at half staff because of the death of guitarist Joe Pass ("Joe 
Pass, the Giant of Jazz Guitarists," May 25).His virtuosity brought so much 
pleasure through the years. I recall in particular his improvisational musical 
conversations with Ella Fitzgerald. They faced one another, looked into each 
other's eyes and, just like a longtime happily married couple who can complete 
each other's sentences, or need no words at all, they brought pure joy to the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz fans all over the world will miss Joe Pass. VALERIE FIELDS

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; BRYAN ADAMS STILL ROCKS WITH CHARISMATIC FERVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mention Bryan Adams to someone who likes hip, edgy rock and they're likely to 
respond with a resounding "Yuk!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian singer-songwriter, who performed the first of two dates at the 
Greek Theatre on Thursday, had some credibility back in the '80s but lost it in 
the '90s -- largely because he's been busy beefing up his bank account by 
recording sappy, chart-topping movie soundtrack ballads like "(Everything I Do) 
I Do It for You" and "All for Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Is he hopelessly stranded on the wrong side of middle-of-the-road rock? 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from his lively show, not really. At least he hasn't gone soft in 
concert -- which you might expect from hearing those two banal movie-theme 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' strength, along with his endearingly raspy voice, has always been his 
ability to put on a high-powered show. Material that seems like gutless, 
woefully derivative, lite rock on records is charged with energy when he 
performs it live. For more than two hours Thursday, Adams, with the capable 
support of his four-piece band, was at his charismatic, hard-rocking best. 
</P>
<P>
 His concert had the giddy feel of a classic-rock oldies show because Adams, 
though only 34, has been cranking out hits since the early '80s, including "Run 
to You," "Summer of '69," "Cuts Like a Knife," "Can't Stop This Thing We 
Started" and "It's Only Love." Though hardly high art, the material is 
effective on a certain level, touching those who don't like their rock music 
riddled with complexities and deep insights. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever the crafty showman, Adams and the band set up on a secondary stage near 
the back of the theater late in the show, thrilling fans stuck in the cheap 
seats. There they played mostly oldies, including Sam Cooke's "Shake" and Eddie 
Cochran's "C'mon Everybody," before racing back to the main stage for the 
crowd-pleasing finale.DENNIS HUNT

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; VIGOROUS CS&N SPICE UP THE OLDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "We have all been here before . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a dangerous line for Crosby, Still & Nash -- an act whose stock in 
trade for years has been living in the past -- to sing these days. But on 
Thursday at the House of Blues, in a rare intimate show kicking off the trio's 
25th anniversary tour (which includes a return to Woodstock for the 25th 
anniversary of that landmark festival), it was much more than mere "Deja Vu" 
all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the show was dominated by oldies, including "Marrakesh Express," 
"Helplessly Hoping" and "Wooden Ships," but CS&N and their four-man backing 
band played and sang with new vigor. The famed harmonies weren't as tight as in 
the old days, but these guys were rocking perhaps harder and rawer than ever, 
from the opening "Love the One You're With" to the encore duo of "Woodstock" 
(of course) and "Carry On," with Steve Stills' blues-rock guitar leads 
especially energized. 
</P>
<P>
 Also encouraging was a handful of new songs, scheduled for an upcoming album. 
None are up to the level of the old favorites, but there was also a sense of 
energy and purpose here far above most anything CS&N have done (together or 
separately) since the glory days.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's the prospect of being one of the few veteran acts that will be on 
the otherwise youthful Woodstock lineup, but whatever the reason, this was a 
spirited, nostalgia-transcending return to relevance. Welcome back, guys. STEVE

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; POSSUM DIXON BASHES, SLASHES WITH A GRIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM

<TEXT>
<P>
 Possum Dixon named itself after a fugitive wanted for murder. Playing Thursday 
at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, the Los Angeles band lived up to 
that self-billing in method, if not in madness. 
</P>
<P>
 The four members slashed and bashed for 47 non-fastidious minutes, but they 
committed their flavorfully poppy mayhem with a collective grin rather than a 
malicious fury. There is frustration enough in the songs that chief writers Rob 
Zabrecky and Robert O'Sullivan churned out for the band's 1993 debut album -- 
most of them '70s New Wave-inspired takes on the old "can't get no 
satisfaction" theme, with dull, dead-end jobs and inaccessible objects of lust 
the chief sources of discontent.  
</P>
<P>
 On stage, Possum Dixon just mowed down those troubles and turned its songs 
into springboards for old-fashioned rock 'n' roll exuberance, applied with 
plenty of bouncing around and shaking all over. The musicianship could stand 
some tightening, but not so much that the band would lose its rawness.  
</P>
<P>
 Possum Dixon's challenge is to develop the offhanded expertise of a band like 
Cracker and the muscular drive of the Smithereens, without reining in its 
gleeful rambunctiousness.MIKE BOEHM

YARDS; TURF BATTLES; HOW DO YOU KEEP A YARD IN THE CONDITION THAT MAKES IT 
ENJOYABLE? BY GIVING IT EVERYTHING IT WANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Keeping a lawn alive and well can be a frustrating experience -- even for a 
determined yard owner. 
</P>
<P>
 It always seems to need something: water, sunshine, mowing, thatching, 
debugging, fertilizing. Why bother with a lawn? you may ask. Because, despite 
the attention it needs, it does several things very well -- like provide a 
soft, comfortable area for play or relaxation, and, on the practical side, 
reduce dust and help prevent soil erosion.  
</P>
<P>
 There's no other plant quite like grass, says turf grass expert Michael Henry, 
environmental horticulture adviser for Orange, Riverside and Los Angeles 
counties with the UC Cooperative Extension. "It's hard to match the color, 
texture and density of lawns with any other kind of plant material. 
Aesthetically, lawns also provide a nice contrast to ground cover, shrubs, 
trees and flower beds in the garden." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite how common lawns are, they are probably the most misunderstood and 
poorly treated of plants, says Steve Hollister, a California-certified 
nurseryman and manager of Armstrong Garden Center in Irvine. By keeping grass 
short and growing it close together, people force it to grow against its 
nature.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most people wouldn't recognize their lawns if they saw them growing naturally 
in an unmowed state," says Hollister. "It's like growing a rosebush and not 
letting it get more than six inches high."  
</P>
<P>
 If your more immediate concern is keeping the lawn alive this summer, don't 
despair. Armed with the right information and a willingness to give your lawn 
the attention it wants, you too can have a healthy crop of grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tactics for keeping your lawn at its best: WATERING 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that most people fail their lawns when it comes to watering. 
"Typically people water lawns too often with an insufficient amount of water," 
says Hollister. When you water once a day for just a few minutes at a time, 
water doesn't penetrate the ground more than two to three inches. Such shallow 
watering prevents grass from developing a deep, healthy root system, which 
makes it vulnerable on hot summer days. Because they've been watering every 
day, though, many people don't know that water stress is the problem.  
</P>
<P>
 Stress from lack of water is often hard to detect until the lawn begins to 
yellow, and by that time things are really bad. "When a lawn undergoes drought 
stress, it doesn't immediately turn yellow but from a distance will look a 
dark, dull green, as opposed to vibrant, shiny and healthy," says Hollister.  
</P>
<P>
 "Another indication of stressed grass is if your footprints remain on the 
grass after walking over it. This means that the lawn's water pressure is low," 
he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Each time you water, give your lawn a deep, thorough drink, and you'll be 
rewarded with deep-rooted grass strong enough to fight scorching summer days 
and drying Santa Ana winds.  
</P>
<P>
 Although watering requirements vary for different grass types, in general, 
lawns should be watered one to three times a week, depending on the weather. 
During periods of rain you may not need to water at all, says Hollister.  
</P>
<P>
 You should apply about half an inch of water to the ground each time you 
water. All sprinkler systems are different, however. To evaluate your system, 
see how long it takes for half an inch of water to collect in cups or cans set 
around the lawn. By checking different locations, you also get a better picture 
of dry and wet spots. 
</P>
<P>
 You may find, for instance, that it takes your sprinklers about 15 minutes to 
deliver half an inch of water. However, unless you have a perfectly level lawn 
with excellent drainage, you're likely to get pooling and runoff if you douse a 
lawn with 15 minutes of water all at once. To ensure absorption, water for 
three to five minutes at a time at one-hour intervals until you reach the 
optimum watering time for your lawn. CHECKING MOISTURE 
</P>
<P>
 To see if your lawn has been getting enough water, you can perform one of 
several tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stick a screwdriver into the ground," suggests turf expert Henry. "The 
screwdriver should easily penetrate four to six inches for warm-season grasses 
and six to 12 inches for cool-season grasses. If the screwdriver gets stuck 
indry soil before reaching these depths, the lawn isn't getting enough water."  
</P>
<P>
 You can also use a moisture meter inserted to the same levels or simply take a 
mound of soil and try to form a ball with it. If the ball crumbles, the soil 
isn't wet enough. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're having trouble getting water into your soil, try a soil wetting 
agent, which will help water penetrate reluctant lawns. This can be found at 
nurseries and only needs to be applied a couple times a year. CORING 
</P>
<P>
 You can also get water to penetrate the ground by coring your lawn. This 
refers to extracting deep, skinny cores of soil with a manual or mechanical sod 
coring tool that looks like a long, skinny cookie cutter. This coring not only 
allows water penetration, it also loosens and aerates the soil, which is very 
good for the lawn.  
</P>
<P>
 When coring your grass, it's also a good time to apply a mulch, which will 
fall into the holes. This mulch will cool the grass roots and break down, 
creating a healthier soil. For mulch, use planter mix or lawn seed covers. In 
general you want 1 1/2 to two cubic feet of mulch for every 100 square feet, 
says Hollister. Such a concentration will disappear after a couple of 
waterings.  
</P>
<P>
 Experts don't recommend spiked "aeration" shoes. These shoes don't aerate the 
soil, but actually compress it. MOWING 
</P>
<P>
 Many mistakes in lawn care are made in mowing, says Henry. He notes that 
contrary to popular opinion, grass clippings should be left on the lawn. 
"Leaving grass clippings on doesn't harm the grass at all," he says. The grass 
decomposes and returns nitrogen to the lawn, and this practice reduces the 
materials sent to landfills. There are mulching mowers on the market that 
automatically return grass clippings to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people wait too long between mowings. "You don't want to cut off more 
than one-third of the grass at any one mowing because mowing too much can send 
the grass into shock," says California-certified nurseryman Gary Matsuoka of 
Laguna Hills Nursery Inc. in Lake Forest. Many grasses need to be mowed once a 
week, and some fast-growing types -- such as hybrid Bermuda -- twice a week 
during warm weather.  
</P>
<P>
 How close to cut your grass depends on the type. In general, most cool season 
grasses like fescue should be cut no lower than three inches in the summer and 
a little lower in winter. Bluegrass and rye grass combination lawns should be 
cut about two inches, hybrid Bermuda much shorter at about three-quarters of an 
inch, and St. Augustine anywhere from one-half to two inches.  
</P>
<P>
 Also make sure that your lawn mower blade is sharp. Dull blades will tear 
grass edges, which gives a lawn a brown or yellow cast from a distance. 
DETHATCHING 
</P>
<P>
 Dethatching is another important maintenance task that leads to a healthy 
lawn, says Matsuoka. Thatch is a harmful buildup of plant material that impedes 
air and water movement to the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 To dethatch, you need to rent a machine that will remove dead plant material 
from the lawn. Dethatching should be done about once a year, depending on your 
lawn type. When thatch isn't taken care of, lawns tend to die out in areas, 
leaving bare spots. PESTS 
</P>
<P>
 Pests and disease aren't too much of a problem for mixed lawns that have more 
than one grass type. If you have a pure lawn, however, there is a chance you 
could have some trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Most single grasses are vulnerable to certain insect problems such as cut 
worms, web worms and grubs. Such problems respond to herbicide treatment. There 
are also biological controls on the market, but they haven't been thoroughly 
tested, says Matsuoka.  
</P>
<P>
 Take a look at many well-established lawns in Orange County and you're bound 
to see grass mixtures. Not only are such mixes more resistant to pests and 
diseases, if you have a cool season and warm season combination, the lawn can 
look green all year.  
</P>
<P>
 Another way to have green grass all year is to have a warm season grass like 
hybrid Bermuda and seed annual rye grass every fall. The rye grass will remain 
green all winter while the Bermuda becomes dormant and yellow. FERTILIZING 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, to be its best, a lawn should be fertilized on a regular basis. What 
it really needs is nitrogen, because it is constantly regrowing the leaves that 
have been cut in mowing. 
</P>
<P>
 A fertilizer is identified by three numbers, such as 10-6-4, the first being 
nitrogen content, followed by phosphorus. Although how much fertilizer you use 
will vary according to your grass type, in general you should fertilize a lawn 
with about four pounds of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet each year, says Henry. 
This typically means fertilizing three or four times per year. 
</P>
<P>
 All fertilizers, whether organic or not, should be used according to 
instructions. Watering Lawns Correctly 
</P>
<P>
 Watering roots properly allows roots to grow deep into soil. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days surface dries but with deep root system lawn stays nourished. 
</P>
<P>
 In one week, soil becomes very dry, leaving roots stressed. Shallow-rooted 
turf grass wilts.

YOUNG HMONG DROP STITCHES OF CENTURIES-OLD FAMILY TRADITION

 When Pang Wang first learned to stitch, she was just 7 years old and living in 
the mountains of Laos. Like the others girls in her community, her work was 
clumsy at first, but she gradually mastered the painstaking art of Hmong 
needlework. 
</P>
<P>
 Now living in Fountain Valley, worlds away from the one in which she learned 
to stitch, Pang Wang keeps up the tradition of this centuries-old, intricate 
craft. In her hands, the smallest piece of cloth becomes part of a multicolored 
canvas, a rainbow of impossibly tiny stitches. Her stitches are so small that 
three small appliqued triangles will easily fit in a space no longer than that 
of a fingernail, each triangle held in place with at least a dozen stitches. 
Pieces are completed in strips and then sewn together. 
</P>
<P>
 It is so time consuming to create these needlework pieces that they are 
usually kept within a family -- they are part of its history. Occasionally, 
pieces will be displayed at fairs, special exhibits and museum craft shows.  
</P>
<P>
 Pang Wang, 47, and others in her generation continue to create new pieces, but 
their American-born children are not following suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Pang Wang and her husband, Chang Nhaku Chue, have seven children, the youngest 
still at home. Like most of their peers, though, none have learned Hmong-style 
stitching. It is a break in a very long tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of years, Hmong women have stitched intricate patterns and 
designs on to pieces of homespun linen while tending to their families, working 
on their farms and attending to household chores.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hmong, originally from China, are an ancient tribe. A nomadic people, they 
settled over the years in a number of different areas, including Laos, Myanmar 
(formerly Burma) and China. They found that in remote hills and mountains they 
could preserve their traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Vietnam War, Hmong soldiers fought alongside American troops in 
Laos and, because of their knowledge of the jungle, provided invaluable 
assistance to U.S. soldiers. Today, according to the U.N. Office of Refugee 
Resettlement, about 2,500 Hmong refugees call Orange County their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet because the Hmong tended to remain cut off from society -- they only 
recently adopted a written language -- little outside attention was paid to 
them, let alone to their handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the handiwork, though, that important events, maps and other 
cultural information were recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hmong didn't know about technology. We were farmers," said Chang, who, 
with his family, arrived in the United States in 1978 after spending three 
years in a Thai resettlement camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Hmong settled in Burma, Laos and North Vietnam," Chang said. "I was born 
in Laos. My father was born in Burma and my grandfather in China. Our clans 
tend to move every 30 to 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
 But for all the upheavals in their lives, the Hmong women continued their 
practice of creating intricate and colorful fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Pantau, as it is called in the Hmong language, consists of a variety of 
stitches including embroidery, cross-stitch, applique and other decorative 
handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
 When a girl reached the age of 5 to 7, her mother would begin teaching her the 
intricate stitchery -- and how to weave the cloth on which to stitch. The boys 
were taught by their fathers to create bamboo flutes, which they played while 
the women sewed. (The flutes are also used to communicate through special codes 
across long distances.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The sewing is very difficult to learn," Chang said. "Often you see the little 
girls crying because they want to play. The mothers will be saying to their 
daughters: 'What's wrong with you? You're so lazy. And these stitches are no 
good. Too big and sloppy. Do it over.' The mothers are angry with the 
daughters, and the daughters are angry with the mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the little girls do learn." 
</P>
<P>
 The women would grow cotton, wash and dry it, dye the fibers (usually black) 
and then spin it into thread to be woven into fabric. Just creating the fabric 
on which to display their elaborate needlework could easily take a year. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fabric was ready, the women could take their coveted and carefully 
guarded needles out and begin the laborious process of creating the tapestry. 
Most of this work took place as they were walking -- either out to the fields 
or back to their homes after a day of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women carry their sewing in little baskets tied around their waists, and 
they pull it out and work on it as they walk," Chang says. "In fact, if you sit 
and sew, the others will make fun of you and say things like, 'You must be a 
rich lady to have so much time to sit and sew.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the sewing went into creating elaborate skirts meant to be worn on 
special occasions such as the Hmong New Year. "Each woman needed to complete at 
least one skirt a year or people would talk and say she was lazy," Chang said.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the skirts, the women would often also create quilted jackets. 
Many were made with a little flap at the back of the neck that, when turned 
over, revealed perhaps the most elaborately embroidered piece on the jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Others in the village or from neighboring clans would walk up to the women 
and turn over the little flap to see her finest work," Chang said. "The young 
men would often tease the girls and look at it to see if she'd make a good 
wife. The other girls would be very anxious to see how their stitching matched 
up to the others." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, these adorned fabrics are prized as pieces of art and used as pillows, 
quilts and wall hangings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people who see Hmong embroidery think it is created on a machine because 
it is so even and precise," Chang said. "But it is all done by hand." 
</P>
<P>
 For many Hmong immigrating to the United States and its urban ways, the 
needlework is one of the traditions falling by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the villages, there were no distractions," Chang said. "There were no 
bills to pay or appointments to keep. There was no television or books to 
study. You worked on your farm, tended to your family, and the women sewed. 
That was the focus of their free time. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can still find some of the women sewing in Thailand or Laos, but for 
Hmong women in the United States, there are many more things to do and 
opportunities. The younger women aren't interested in spending so much time 
doing needlework."

HOW TO KEEP MOWER ON THE CUTTING-EDGE OF LAWN CARE; YARDS 
</P>

 A rotary mower needs a full checkup at least once a year. Here are some 
suggestions for giving it a going-over: Cleaning * Clean the exterior with 
dishwashing detergent and a soft rag. Remove caked grass under the deck with a 
scraping tool. Clean cooling fins with a kerosene-soaked rag wrapped around a 
screwdriver. A New Spark Plug 
</P>
<P>
 * Buy a new spark plug that is an exact replacement of the old. A new spark 
plug is inexpensive and helps ensure a quick-starting and smooth-running 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Following the owner's manual specifications, set the gap between the two 
metal electrodes at the threaded end. Use a gap gauge, available at hardware or 
auto stores. Adjust the gap by bending the side electrode to the proper 
distance from the center electrode. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check that the spark-plug wire terminal fits tightly on the plug. If it's 
loose, push back the rubber nipple that covers the terminal and crimp the 
terminal with pliers. Crankcase, Pull Cord, Air Filter 
</P>
<P>
 * Before every mowing, check to see that the crankcase in a four-cycle engine 
is filled to the mark with oil specified in the owner's manual. In a two-cycle 
engine, oil is mixed with the gasoline and poured into the fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the starter has a cord, inspect it; if it is frayed, replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove the air-filter cover and inspect the filter element. Replace a 
pleated paper filter once a year and vacuum it occasionally. Wash a plastic 
foam filter in hot soapy water, rinse, and gently squeeze the rinse water out. 
Allow it to air-dry. Following the owner's manual instructions, re-oil the 
filter, gently squeezing it to spread the oil evenly and reinstall it. Belt 
Drive 
</P>
<P>
 * Check the belt drive for looseness. Press down on the belt with a finger. If 
it deflects more than three-quarters of an inch, readjust it. With most belt 
drives you can loosen the engine-to-mower bolts, which pass through elongated 
holes, and move the engine forward or back as necessary. A cracked belt, or one 
that can't be properly tensioned, must be replaced. Loosen the device that 
applies tension to the belt. Then loosen the motor bolts and push the motor 
forward toward the pulley it drives. Remove the belt and take it to a hardware 
store or lawn-mower dealer so that you can get an exact duplicate. Install the 
new belt and adjust the tension until the belt deflects less than three-fourths 
of an inch. Gas the Tank, Prime the Engine 
</P>
<P>
 * If gasoline was left in the tank during the off-season (it shouldn't have 
been), it may have formed a gum that fouls the fuel line and carburetor. To 
clean out the gum, pour a little carburetor solvent into the tank, slosh it 
around and then drain the tank. Fill with fresh gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 * To prime the engine, remove the air filter and pour two to three tablespoons 
of clean, fresh gasoline into the bottom of the filter housing. Reinstall the 
filter and crank the engine until it starts. For two-cycle engines, mix oil and 
gasoline in correct proportions in a separate container, then pour the mixture 
into the fuel tank. Never use the mower's fuel tank as the mixing receptacle; 
poorly mixed fuel will quickly clog a fuel line. Inspect Blade, Apply Oil 
</P>
<P>
 * A sharp blade not only cuts easier, it reduces damage to the grass. If the 
blade is badly nicked, replace it or have it sharpened by a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't try to file away anything other than minor nicks; you'll unbalance the 
blade. That will put an uneven load on the engine and may cause damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spray the carburetor linkage with penetrating oil. Also spray penetrating 
oil on the axles. Ignition 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have an older mower with ignition points instead of an electronic 
ignition, inspect the points and adjust the gap between the contacts according 
to the engine manufacturer's specifications. The points are under the flywheel, 
and to remove the flywheel you need special tools. 
</P>
<P>
 You can avoid buying such tools by installing an electronic ignition (a 
conversion kit is less costly than the tools you need to service points).

CUT DOWN ON RUNAROUND: LEAVE THE CLIPPINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN McGRATH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in the old days -- when the Earth was young and fresh and there were 
infinite numbers of places to site new landfills when the old ones filled up -- 
grass clippings got bagged up and set out with the garbage. The garbage 
collector would scoop them up and tip them into the landfill, where they are 
probably still perfectly preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Then along came NIMBY-ism, environmental awareness and the garbage barge. 
Landfill fees became prohibitively expensive once no one would allow new 
landfills to be built. Municipalities found it less expensive to collect 
people's grass clippings separately from regular garbage, compost them and then 
use the compost or sell it around town. And that's what many places do these 
days. It's called municipal composting. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal composting is an improvement over treating grass clippings as 
garbage. But it isn't exactly resource-efficient.  
</P>
<P>
 Think about it for a moment: You bag it all up and haul it out to the curb. 
Brawny workers employed by the city drive expensive, gas-guzzling, 
air-polluting trucks to carry your grass clippings to a large field on the edge 
of town where other brawny workers rake and toss and screen them for a few 
weeks. Then the brawny workers bag them, drive them back around town to various 
garden centers. Meanwhile, other city employees, not necessarily brawny, rack 
their brains trying to think up ways to entice you to buy the bags of your 
composted grass clippings, drive them home in your car, haul them back into the 
yard and spread them on your garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Some conscientious people compost clippings at home in a compost bin, which 
saves city employees, brawny and otherwise, all that trouble. But home 
composting is not for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Could there be a better way? Yes, say lawn care professionals, energy experts, 
and city managers. They offer you this valuable tip for dealing with grass 
clippings: 
</P>
<P>
 Leave 'em on the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it is rather shocking. You see, it turns out that grass clippings are 
good for your lawn. They do not contribute to thatch, as once thought. In fact, 
grass clippings, it seems, are nature's lawn fertilizer.  
</P>
<P>
 Here is what experts recommend: 
</P>
<P>
 Mow your lawn when it is dry, and set your mower blades so that they cut no 
more than one-third of the grass blade. If the resulting grass clippings are 
more than one inch long, mow over them again. Or, if you have a power mower, 
buy a mulching blade for it. This will chop the clippings up finely the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 When you cut the lawn, cross-cut it. That is, mow back and forth north to 
south, then go over it again east to west. This will chop the grass finely and 
disperse it more or less evenly. 
</P>
<P>
 These fine clippings -- 85% water themselves -- do two good things for your 
lawn. They keep it moist, which means you need to water less often. 
</P>
<P>
 And they fertilize the lawn, which means you need to fertilize less 
frequently. The clippings won't burn the grass, the way many chemical 
fertilizers can, and they won't run off and contribute to water pollution, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an environmentally sensitive recommendation that is not uncomfortable, 
laborious or expensive. It is easy and free.

 When you're done painting, wipe off excess paint from can and lid and apply 
vegetable shortening around rims. This provides an airtight seal but allows 
easy opening next time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Welcome spring by filling an empty fireplace with houseplants or a bouquet 
of baby's breath. 
</P>
<P>
 * A flexible, cloth measuring tape will easily measure irregularly shaped 
objects for workshop projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seal small holes in window screens with clear cement glue. The repair will 
be almost invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Store children's outdoor toys in 30-gallon garbage containers. Label 
contents on top of each lid, and keep container close to the play area in your 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Update your front door with a fresh coat of paint and new hardware; the 
change looks as good as a new door and is much less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outdoors, determine the pH level of your soil by purchasing a soil testing 
kit or calling your local extension agency. An abundance of mushrooms, moss or 
fungi in the lawn is indicative of an imbalance, and lime may need to be 
applied to the soil.

A HELPING HAND / JOHN MORRELL: INSIDE & OUT; PREPARE WOOD FOR PAINT WITH LIQUID 
SANDPAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORRELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I have some dining room chairs that are stained a pecan color, and I'd like 
to paint them green. Is there a product that can be applied onto stained, 
varnished wood without sanding it that will prepare it for painting? 
</P>
<P>
 P.H. Laguna Hills A. There's really a two-step process you'll have to take, 
says Joe Ragsdale of Color Center in La Mirada. Using rags and Liquid 
Sandpaper, rub away the finish and wax buildup that you'll probably find on 
your chairs. Afterward, you should probably use an oil-based primer on the 
chairs, which will give you more penetration than a water-based primer. After 
giving them at least 24 hours to dry, apply the paint finish you want. The key 
to doing a good job is removing the gloss and wax from the chairs when you 
start. That gives the paint good adhesion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I've been told that the worst thing I can do to my plumbing is to flush 
dental floss down the toilet. Is there any truth to that? 
</P>
<P>
 E.C. Brea A. There may be worse things to do to your plumbing, but flushing 
your floss can cause problems, says Ted Blanke of Central Plumbing & Heating in 
La Habra. Your sewage system is not designed to handle inorganic material. Over 
time, the floss can collect and cause flow problems. This is especially true if 
you have any root in-growth into your system, which creates more opportunities 
for hang-ups. Even if it gets through your system, it becomes a community 
problem since sewage treatment plants have to filter out the garbage people 
throw out in their toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I replaced the old beige electrical outlets and switches in two of my 
bedrooms recently, but something is wrong. Before, the switches operated the 
top receptacle in each outlet, and now all receptacles work regardless of 
whether the switch is up or down. Did I get the wrong kind of outlets or 
switches? 
</P>
<P>
 S.S. Tustin A. You probably got the right equipment, but it may not have been 
prepared properly before you installed it, says Mike McCoy of Current Supply in 
Westminster. There's a thin copper tab on each side of your outlets that joins 
the top and bottom receptacle. With a pair of needle-nose pliers, you can pop 
the tabs, then you put the hot wire and switch wire in the top receptacle, the 
bottom receptacle is usually controlled by a hot wire from another circuit and 
is on all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We put light oak plank flooring down in our den, but it's made our old 
walnut-finished wet bar that sits in the corner look run down. We'd like to 
refinish the wet bar to match the flooring. What's involved in the job? 
</P>
<P>
 G.K. Seal Beach A. How you approach the job is going to depend on what the bar 
is made of, says Jim Craig of Decratrend Paints in Anaheim. If it's wood, it 
will have to be stripped down to its natural color, which may mean stripping it 
down with solvents, then bleaching it. If it's wood veneer, you may have to 
cover the bar with some type of primer and paint or antique over it to 
complement the floor. Make sure you do a good masking job on the new flooring 
to prevent damaging it during the refinishing process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I'd like to remove some wood paneling from one room and use it again in 
another. Are there any tricks to getting the panels out intact? 
</P>
<P>
 B.K. Orange A. First, remove any molding that may be holding it in place, says 
contractor Manny Alvarez of Anaheim. With a good, stiff putty knife, get the 
edge underneath the paneling and slowly pry it up. Once you get it pulled up a 
bit, push it back and you should be able to get a grip on the paneling nail 
heads that have been pulled out. Once you get the first panel out, the others 
should come up easier since you'll have more of an area to work with.

 If you have a craving for creepy crawlers or things that go bump in the night, 
drawer pulls, wall hooks and door knockers by the Gardener should satisfy your 
urges. 
</P>
<P>
 The lizard drawer pull ($46), wall hook ($20) and door knocker ($50), all of 
wrought iron from Iron Forge in Arizona, are especially well-suited to 
cabinets, walls and doors in homes with a rustic motif. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally created for a client who has an adobe house, the lizard pull is 7 
inches long and 1 1/2 inches at its widest point. 
</P>
<P>
 To order or obtain more information, call the Gardener, based in Berkeley, at 
(510) 548-4545. Switching Places 
</P>
<P>
 One quick way to refresh a room inexpensively, decorating experts say, is to 
change the switch plates and cabinet and drawer pulls. There are no fresher 
plates and knobs than those in the Trout Studios line, designed by Sallie Trout 
of Trout Rozenberg Inc., which is based in Venice, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Trout, who along with partner Desiree Rozenberg began the product line about a 
year ago, uses coffee cups, palm trees, stars, fish bones, squiggles and swirls 
for switch plates (about $30 each). Larger than the standard fare (they average 
12 inches in height), they are available in six styles -- aluminum toggle, gold 
toggle, aluminum pushplate, gold pushplate, aluminum outlet and gold outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Zany knobs and drawer pulls ($9 to $17 a piece in either aluminum or gold) 
feature a menagerie of objects -- lips, eyes, numbers, letters and exclamation 
points -- that can spice up kitchen cabinets, keep a watchful eye out in the 
bathroom or add sock to your bedroom drawers. 
</P>
<P>
 For a catalogue of Trout Studios' home accessories, call (800) 851-6231 or 
(310) 574-1574. Trout has recently opened a showroom at 308 Venice Way. No 
Moss, No Moss 
</P>
<P>
 E-Z Liner, developed by Ted and Rick Mayeda of M&M Nursery in Orange, is an 
inexpensive, easy alternative to using moss for lining wire baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mayeda brothers, who took over the family business in 1975, say their 
liners work just as well or better than moss and are a lot less trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The liners, which are fitted pouches that have a synthetic outside covering 
with plastic inside, act as moisture barriers and won't deteriorate. Holes in 
the bottom allow water to drain after the soil has been thoroughly saturated. 
</P>
<P>
 To use, simply drop the liners into a basket, and you're ready to plant 
fuchsias, impatiens, begonias, strawberries, herbs -- anything that grows in a 
container.  
</P>
<P>
 E-Z Liners are available in three colors -- white, brown and green -- and 
sizes from 10 inches ($4) to 24 inches ($13) at M&M Nursery, 380 N. Tustin 
Ave., Orange. The Mayedas also take custom orders and will ship. For more 
information, call (714) 538-8042.

TILE SURFACES AS PATIO ALTERNATIVE; DO -- IT -- YOURSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tile lends an aura of richness, refinement and grace to outdoor living areas. 
It also creates a link between house and garden and evokes the feel of times 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceramic tile can convert a basic back-yard patio into a charming terrace 
reminiscent of those found in the English countryside. Resurfacing an already 
finished concrete patio or walkway is a project many people can accomplish 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Before taking trowel in hand, research the various styles of tile and their 
qualities. Look for tiles that appeal to you, keeping in mind how they will 
blend with your house and yard. Because a patio connects areas of your 
property, also consider putting in steps and garden paths in materials that 
match the tile. 
</P>
<P>
 Most tiles sold for outdoor use are the unglazed varieties, and many of them 
contain additives that create a textured, non-slip surface, making them much 
less treacherous when wet. The smooth, glazed tiles may look great, but they 
can become slippery in the morning dew or after a rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Although ceramic tile is known for its durability, all tiles are not created 
equal. You can't tell by looking which are suitable for outdoor use and which 
aren't, so ask the salesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to color selection, pick a scheme that not only fits your 
individual taste but also complements your home and its surroundings. 
Generally, natural tones are most compatible with greenery and flowers. Use 
contrasting hues to create overall patterns or focal points. 
</P>
<P>
 Pattern possibilities seem endless. You can choose simple square tiles in one 
or two colors or go with complex multicolored diagonals, basket weaves, 
interlocking spirals or herringbones to make your own design. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapes are another consideration. If you haven't had much experience cutting 
tiles, you may want to select rectangular or square tiles because they are 
easier to work with, particularly when finishing the edges. 
</P>
<P>
 After you've selected your tile and designed a pattern, you're ready to 
implement your plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips that will simplify the work: 
</P>
<P>
 * You need a smooth, level surface on which to lay down the tile. This may 
require patching cement to fill cracks and low spots. To check for low spots, 
roll a length of pipe across the concrete, and mark spots where you can see 
light under the pipe. Fill with patching cement and level with a straightedge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ensure proper adhesion for the mortar by first scrubbing the patio with a 5% 
solution of muriatic acid. Rinse surface well before applying the mortar. 
</P>
<P>
 * To improve adhesion, mix latex bonding cement into the mortar, or brush 
bonding cement onto the patio. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret to successfully working with mortar is to keep everything wet. Slow 
evaporation during the curing process gives mortar its strength. Spray the 
patio well before applying mortar, and soak tiles before setting them. 
Periodically sprinkle water over everything as you work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cutting thick, curved tiles can be frustrating. It also can be wasteful, 
even if you're using a good tile cutter. For help, mark cuts with a pencil and 
take the tiles to a stonemason. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid scuffing unglazed tile during installation and be careful when using 
colored grout or any staining agent. After you have laid the tiles, use sealers 
to make them stain resistant and help preserve what you've created.

O.C. TEACHER ACCUSED OF SHOOTING EX-LOVER, ANOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A former "teacher of the year" at Sunny Hills High School was behind bars 
Friday, charged with shooting her former lover and another woman in what police 
called the violent end to a stormy, seven-year relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Ruth Greene, a 51-year-old physical education teacher at the Fullerton 
school whose colleagues had chosen her for the teaching honor in 1988, was 
charged with two counts of attempted murder in the Wednesday night fracas that 
may have left her ex-lover, 62-year-old Loretta Coller, paralyzed from the 
waist down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a very unfortunate situation," said Gregory Bice, assistant 
superintendent at the Fullerton Union High School District. "There's nothing 
that we know of at the district that could explain why this happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene was being held at the Sybil Brand Institute for Women in Los Angeles. 
Bail was set at $300,000. Her arraignment, scheduled for Friday, was postponed 
until June 13 to give her lawyer more time to prepare her defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendora Police Sgt. Tim Pfeiffer said Greene had been distraught for months 
over her breakup with Coller last September, refusing to accept the fact that 
the relationship was over. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 7 p.m., after drinking heavily, Greene allegedly called the home that 
she and Coller had shared until last year, according to court records. The 
records indicate that Greene was intoxicated at the time of the incident. She 
asked Coller whether her current companion, Martha Pereida, 49, of Alhambra was 
there. Upon learning that she was, Greene then allegedly threatened to kill 
Pereida and Coller. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than an hour later, Pfeiffer said, Greene drove to Coller's home 
on East Canterbury Lane in Glendora and allegedly sneaked in through a sliding 
glass door. Undetected, she armed herself with the .38-caliber revolver that 
Coller kept in her bedroom, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her intention, Greene later told police, was to persuade Coller to resume 
their relationship and to discuss property the two still owned jointly, 
Pfeiffer said. But when she walked into the den and discovered Coller and 
Pereida sitting on bar stools, the three women began arguing and Greene fired a 
shot into the couch, Pfeiffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pereida then charged Greene and attempted to take the weapon away, Pfeiffer 
said. Three more shots went off, wounding both Coller and Pereida. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived, they found Greene attempting to administer first aid to 
Coller. She told police the gun had gone off accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
 Coller's spinal cord was severed by one of the bullets, according to police. 
She was in serious condition Friday and her doctors have told police that she 
may be permanently paralyzed below the waist. Pereida, who was shot in the leg, 
was treated for her wound and released. 
</P>
<P>
 The news that one of their teachers had been charged with attempted murder 
came as a shock to students at Sunny Hills High School, where five students 
were arrested for the brutal slaying of Foothill High honor student Stuart A. 
Tay on Dec. 31, 1992. Three of the five students have been convicted or pleaded 
guilty to murder charges. Two others have yet to be tried. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you wonder who else is going to get killed," one 16-year-old 
sophomore said Friday upon learning the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who took physical education and health courses from Greene, who 
taught at Sunny Hills since 1982, described her as a woman of few words. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not the kind of person to shoot someone. She pretty much kept to 
herself," said a 16-year-old sophomore who took Greene's physical education 
class last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene has taught in the district since 1969 and had no record of disciplinary 
problems, said Bice, the assistant superintendent.  
</P>
<P>
 Others however, described her as short-tempered and said they feared her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'd get mad easily," said another sophomore, also 16. ". . . I was afraid 
of her." In Glendora, Coller's neighbors along the quiet cul-de-sac of 
single-family homes near the Glendora Country Club also remembered Greene as 
reserved, describing Coller as more outgoing. During happier times, they said, 
the two took frequent camping trips together. 
</P>
<P>
 But some neighbors said the couple's relationship was often stormy, especially 
after the breakup. Some said Greene, who is 5-2 tall and weighs 115 pounds, had 
lost perhaps 30 pounds in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Janet moved in and out a couple of times," said Harold Zink, Coller's 
next-door neighbor. "She wanted to get back together, but Loretta didn't want 
her back." 
</P>
<P>
 Pending the outcome of her case, Greene has been placed on paid administrative 
leave from her $50,000-a-year job, according to officials at the Fullerton 
Union High School District.

TIMES MIRROR, COX PLAN NEW CABLE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a complex deal worth $2.3 billion, Times Mirror Co. is planning to spin off 
its cable television operations to form a new, publicly held company with 
Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of the two companies' cable units would create the nation's 
third-largest cable operator, with 3 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox would acquire the cable system by assuming about $1.4 billion worth of 
Times Mirror debt, and swapping about $900 million worth of privately held Cox 
shares, sources said. Analysts called the deal -- equivalent to about 11 1/2 
times the expected 1994 cash flow for Times Mirror's cable operations -- 
positive for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Times Mirror is getting a very good price and Cox is getting a very 
good system," said John Reidy, who follows the cable industry for Smith Barney 
Shearson in New York. "Times Mirror shareholders may well end up with (stock in 
two companies) which sell for more than today's one." 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror's cable operation is headquartered in Irvine and provides service 
under the name Dimension Cable. Dimension is Orange County's largest cable 
system with more than 180,000 subscribers. Times Mirror and Dimension employ 
about 585 people locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the deal could signal a new round of consolidation in the cable 
industry, driven by the massive technology investments required to compete with 
the telecommunications industry for control over the coming era of interactive 
communications. The move, analysts said, also points up the desire among cable 
operators to form regional clusters to better compete against local telephone 
companies. Tele-Communications Inc., the country's largest cable operator, and 
Viacom Inc., the 13th-largest operator, are said to be close to an agreement to 
combine their cable systems in San Francisco and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror stock closed up $4 on Friday, at $36 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. The company -- whose holdings include the Los Angeles Times and 
Newsday in New York as well as magazine and book publishing interests -- issued 
a statement confirming an "agreement in principle for the disposition of its 
cable television business to Cox Enterprises," but declined further comment on 
the continuing negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, first reported in USA Today on Friday, is expected to be finalized 
this weekend. Cox is expected to manage the company, but it was not immediately 
clear how big a stake Times Mirror shareholders would have. Sources said the 
Outdoor Channel, the first effort of Times Mirror's new cable programming 
division, would be guaranteed a spot on the new system's lineup. The cable 
programming arm will remain part of Times Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox's cable unit is the nation's sixth-largest cable company with 1.8 million 
subscribers, including systems in San Diego, southeastern Virginia and the New 
Orleans area. Times Mirror Cable is ranked 11th with 1.2 million cable 
subscribers, including systems in Phoenix, Orange County and suburban San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement also could mark the beginning of a trend in which media 
conglomerates move to separate information and entertainment divisions, such as 
those that produce newspapers and programming, from the delivery systems, at a 
time when each is taking on new roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the inverse of the Time Warner merger," said Jonathan Seybold, a 
Malibu-based new media analyst, referring to the largest media merger in 
history, in which movie, record and TV production was merged with cable and 
magazine operations. Time Warner is the nation's second-largest cable operator. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an age in which information, entertainment and advertising can be 
easily converted to digital formats and sent over delivery mechanisms ranging 
from the global computer web known as the Internet to wireless personal 
communications devices, some argue that it may make more sense for producers of 
such content to operate unfettered by the interests of any particular 
transmission system, and vice-versa.  
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror has been exploring delivery of its magazine and newspaper content 
via CD-ROM and the Prodigy on-line service, which could be viewed as 
competitive with cable delivery. Under the Cox-Times Mirror deal, Cox's cable 
systems would also apparently be spun off into the new entity. 
</P>
<P>
 Seybold added: "In the end a content company should be in the position of 
delivering its content over any and all delivery mechanisms, and a company that 
operates the pipelines and the servers should be offering the broadest possible 
content over its services." 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing consolidation of the cable industry was interrupted over the last 
year as cable and phone companies flirted with the idea of joining forces 
across industries to pay for the costly roll-out of the "information 
superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 But two such planned alliances -- Bell Atlantic's with Tele-Communications 
Inc. and Cox's with Southwestern Bell -- collapsed this year when the Federal 
Communications Commission slapped stiffer rate regulations on the cable 
industry and company stocks slipped precipitously.  
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Baby Bells appear to have decided to go it on their own, analysts 
say, consolidating resources within the cable industry is even more crucial. 
And with FCC Chairman Reed Hundt signaling at the national cable conference 
last month that the worst of his agency's actions were over, the regulatory 
environment appears more receptive to mergers of this kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the next several years the cable business is going to get more 
competitive, require bigger investments in technology, and become much more 
difficult to manage," said Melissa Cook, an analyst at Prudential Securities in 
New York. "Only the biggest companies have a chance of surviving."  
</P>
<P>
 In paying a healthy premium for Times Mirror's cable systems, Cox appears to 
be giving a vote of confidence to the industry, which has been rocked by rate 
rollbacks, climbing interest rates and the perception that the phone companies 
have the upper hand in the digital highway race. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox is not the first cable firm with which Times Mirror has explored forging 
an alliance. Last fall the firm appeared close to a deal with Boston-based 
Continental Cablevision, the third-ranked U.S. cable company. TCI, Comcast 
Cable and Century Cable have also expressed interest in partnering with Times 
Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror's cable unit accounted for 28% of the company's pretax profit 
year (after accounting for one-time charges), and 13% of its revenue. Earnings 
for the cable division came to $106.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that the managements of the two firms have several things in 
common -- each is dominated by family owners, each holds newspaper and cable 
properties and each recently sold TV stations. Cox has already launched an 
on-line version of its Atlanta Journal and Constitution on Prodigy, and Times 
Mirror executives have worked closely with their Cox counterparts to model 
their version of The Times on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 James Cox Kennedy, Cox's chairman, has been aggressively seeking opportunities 
to move the company into the interactive age. Times Mirror similarly has joined 
the multimedia fray with its recent acquisitions of software firms Allen 
Communication and Ehrlich Multimedia, and its stake in CD-ROM publisher Digital 
Pictures. 
</P>

UCI PROFESSOR HAS OWN LINES ON ACTING; PERFORMING ARTS: ROBERT COHEN'S BOOKS 
ARE USED IN DRAMA PROGRAMS AT MANY UNIVERSITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 "Can acting be taught?" asks UC Irvine drama professor Robert E. Cohen, posing 
a question he has answered with distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a question Cohen asks on the first page of his 216-page book, "Acting 
One," and answers with lessons on diction, body language, stage fright, 
approach, memorization methods, cues, techniques and liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a question, asked and answered, in his three other books on acting and 
in 25 years at UC Irvine, where he is the founder and former chairman of the 
widely respected theater department and where he continues to teach. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall Cohen was awarded the UCI Medal, the university's highest honor. 
This summer his influence in academia will be highlighted again by a study to 
be presented at a national educators' conference showing that "Acting One" is 
used on more campuses to teach undergraduate performers than any other text. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the book is even more popular as a teaching tool than the 
celebrated "An Actor Prepares" by legendary Russian actor-director Konstantin 
Stanislavsky, who has long been one of the most pervasive influences in 
20th-Century theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cohen's book replaced everything we had here," David Knight, chairman of the 
theater department and the head of acting at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign, said by telephone. "He has made quite an impact. Acting books 
come and go. There are a lot of them. But his has lasted because people find it 
useful." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Joyce Aldridge, who conducted a nationwide survey for a 1992 
doctoral dissertation at the University of Colorado, "Acting One," which was 
written in 1984, tops the list of all instructional acting books. It is 
required reading in 113 university drama programs. 
</P>
<P>
 By her count, which she says still holds, Cohen's other books also are used 
extensively. "Acting Power," his theoretical manifesto, is required in 54 
programs, mostly at the graduate level; "Acting Professionally," a journalistic 
analysis of the industry, is used in 61 programs, and "Acting in Shakespeare" 
in five. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanislavsky's ideas, which gave rise to so-called method acting, gained their 
greatest fame in this country through such adherents as Marlon Brando and James 
Dean. But if the Russian master is "the intellectual ancestor" of all modern 
American acting, to quote Cohen, it is the 55-year-old professor's own 
post-Stanislavsky teachings that have invited comparison with Stanislavsky's 
and created a new, very different mantle of authority. This, despite the fact 
that Cohen is not himself a performer, world-renowned or otherwise, and has no 
famous students crediting him for their success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cohen has codified a system that engages the student very quickly in action 
with partners," Aldridge said from Castleton State College in Vermont, where 
she is an assistant professor of theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "He involves the student in what he calls 'interactive dynamics.' Stanislavsky 
asks the actor to think about his past and what has led him to the moment being 
presented on stage. Cohen asks him to think about the future." 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent interview at his UCI office, a cozy den lined with books and 
filled with theatrical memorabilia, Cohen said he is not "anti-Stanislavsky" 
but nonetheless reeled off a litany of differences between their views. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stanislavsky is all about the actor getting in touch with his feelings. He 
thinks the source of a character resides in the actor's personality. I think it 
resides much more in the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more optimistic. He's more pessimistic. I'm more future-oriented. He's 
more past-oriented. I'm more cybernetic. He's more deterministic. I deal with 
tactics. He didn't deal very much with tactics, and he never dealt with the 
audience. It was an embarrassment to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, who came to UCI in 1965 by way of Dartmouth and Yale, speaks in such 
speedy rhythms that he sounds streetwise rather than Ivy League. He also does 
not look even remotely tweedy. Dressed in a habitual outfit of drab work shirt 
and jeans, he gives the casual appearance of someone who has wandered onto the 
campus perhaps by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no mistaking the chord he has struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley Carr, head of acting at Cal State Long Beach, says Cohen "distills 
Stanislavsky down to essentials as a starting point," then shows young actors 
how to avoid "the sort of self-conscious, self-obsessed performances" commonly 
associated with method acting. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Cohen believes his ideas are popular because he emphasizes 
"non-gloomy, totally goal-oriented acting." That means "capturing and embodying 
the character's hope for victory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of having the actor plumb his own history to identify with the 
character by applying "emotional memory" -- one of the chief legacies of 
Stanislavsky's early teachings -- Cohen asks the actor to apply "positive 
energy and optimism" toward the character's goals. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that perhaps the easiest way to illustrate the difference in their 
approaches is to imagine a bear, a man and a cabin. The bear is chasing the 
man. The man is running toward the cabin.  
</P>
<P>
 A method actor playing the man concentrates on what is behind him: the bear, 
which he understands as the "cause" of the situation. The bear is a metaphor 
for the past, in other words, a summation of all the circumstances that brought 
him to that moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, by contrast, would have the actor concentrate on what is in front of 
him: the cabin, which provides a potential haven and is a metaphor for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody in that situation would be looking ahead, not behind," he explained. 
"He'd be thinking of how to get to the cabin as fast as possible. He'd be 
thinking of contingency plans. 'If the door is locked, I'll climb on the roof.' 
The character is pulled by the future, not pushed by the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen says he derives his views on acting in large measure from concepts 
pioneered by post-Freudian psychiatry and modern communications theory. He 
mentions such influences as Erving Goffman ("The Presentation of Self in 
Everyday Life"), Eric Berne ("Transactional Analysis in Psychotherapy"), Paul 
Watzlawick ("Pragmatics of Human Communication") and Gregory Bateson ("Steps to 
an Ecology of Mind").  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in where performance and behavior intersect," he said. "We're 
giving performances all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his pedagogical clout on American campuses, Cohen is making 
inroads in Eastern Europe, where Stanislavsky has held sway since Stalinist 
times. "Acting Power" has been published in Hungary, Estonia and Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he has updated Stanislavsky," Cohen's Finnish translator Maija-Liisa 
Marton said from Helsinki. "He brings to acting what modern science and 
technology have brought to our lives. Stanislavsky is outdated. Cohen speaks a 
language young people understand nowadays." 
</P>
<P>
 Marton notes that Cohen gives actors "more tools" for absurdist works. 
Characters in a Samuel Beckett play, for example, tend to be less susceptible 
to psychological parsing a la Stanislavsky, she says, and more amenable to 
Cohen's goal-oriented approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eastern Europe is in an acting crisis," said Cohen, who went to Budapest in 
March to give master classes at Hungary's National Theatre Academy. "They're 
looking for optimism. They're looking to escape from solipsistic acting. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the demise of the Soviet empire they don't want to go back to the 
tea-and-saucer drama that existed before Stanislavsky, you know -- kneel on 
your left leg and kiss with your upstage lip. This is true of everyone from the 
Hungarians to the Estonians, and even to a certain extent the Finns, who were 
not under Soviet domination."

 PRO-BARBRA: Barbra Streisand found out at her opening concert at The Pond of 
Anaheim Thursday night (F1) that Orange County folks love her. But not 
necessarily all her causes. . . . The audience applauded her mention of South 
Africa's recent elections and wildly cheered scenes of marchers with pro-choice 
on abortion placards shown during a video montage. But Bill Clinton's picture 
did little for the crowd, even though Streisand hailed the President for having 
"an exciting and productive year.". . . . Streisand returns to The Pond

 BARRED AGAIN: For 10 years, Thomas F. Maniscalco dutifully paid his State Bar 
of California dues with the hopes of resuming his law career if ever released 
from jail. But now that Maniscalco, 49, has been convicted of second-degree 
murder March 15 for a Westminster triple slaying, he can stop paying those 
dues. . . . The State Bar Court this week suspended him. Maniscalco, scheduled 
for a June 24 sentencing, can be reinstated only if he is successful on his 
appeal.

 PRESSING ON: Liberal radio-TV commentator Bill Press will do a little 
political one-on-one with shoppers when he takes his KFI 640 AM radio talk show

 POLITICAL SPLIT: It's official: Longtime local political consultant Harvey 
Englander will split from partners Dan Wooldridge and Jerry Pierson over "a 
difference in philosophy." Their firm has a hand in the county campaigns of 
supervisor candidate Haydee V. Tillotson and 70th Assembly District contender 
Marilyn C. Brewer. . . . Wooldridge, an ex-aide to two former county 
supervisors, will stay with Pierson. Englander says he will merge with a 
Washington-based political firm.

 JUDGMENT VALIDATED: The Dodgers on Friday drafted pitcher Randy Wolf of El 
Camino Real High School, and he celebrated by saving a 6-2 victory over Kennedy 
High (C12) in the semi-final round of competition for the City Section baseball 
crown. That set up a rematch for the championship with Chatsworth, which 
defeated Taft, 5-0.

 STRUGGLING STREET: It was one of those good news/bad news days for merchants 
hoping the strip of Ventura Boulevard just west of Van Nuys Boulevard will 
spring back from quake damage to reclaim its reputation as the hippest shopping 
street in the Valley. Good news: The Gap and Banana Republic will reopen (B1). 
"A morale booster," a merchant called it.. . . . The bad news: Adios Johnny 
Rockets and The Sharper Image.

 BAT MEN: The College World Series doesn't include any Valley teams, but one 
Valley business wins no matter who plays . . . Six of the eight competing 
schools use bats (above) made by Jas. D. Easton Inc. of Van Nuys. Easton's 
business makes up half of the aluminum bat market worldwide.

 SANTA CLARITA: Harold and Kathy Wiener were the toast of their Santa Clarita

 LEUKEMIA AID: Nine Los Angeles Spanish-language radio stations are promoting a 
12-hour radiothon today to benefit the Leukemia Society of America (B17) . . . 
Humberto Hernandez, vice president and station manager for KMQA, La Maquina, 
says the Valley is an important target because it makes up about 50% of his 
station's audience. "If one quarter of our people in the Valley -- 25% of our 
audience -- makes pledges for this event, it would be a successful event," 
Hernandez said.

ROLLS-ROYCE LOSES TO SEDAN CHAIR IN RACE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Rolls-Royce raced a hand-carried sedan chair through Hong Kong on Friday to 
test traffic congestion.The result: confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The sedan chair was declared the victor, but the Rolls driver, Ted Thomas, 
claimed he would have won if he had found the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said the race grew out of an argument with fellow businessman Raymond 
Bera about Hong Kong traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
 Bera reckoned that one could get around the British colony better in chairs 
carried by teams of porters. Thomas said his Rolls could beat anything on 
wheels -- or feet.

<P>
 Tens of thousands of seals along Namibia's desert coastline have died in the 
worst disaster on record to hit the country's Cape Fur seal colonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams of workers Friday started clearing away rotting carcasses of seal pups, 
which apparently starved to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The fisheries ministry said that "unusual oceanographic conditions" had 
profoundly affected the fish on which the 750,000 Cape Fur seals feed along the 
southwest coast of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Ministry scientists estimated that more than 70,000 pups died in Wolf and 
Atlas bays near the diamond center of Luderitz, where 70% of Namibia's seals 
breed.

<P>
 Nonprofit organizations are being sought to operate food and game booths at 
the fifth annual Community Fireworks Show and Festival July 4 at Fullerton High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30,000 people are expected to attend the event, which will feature a 
25-minute aerial fireworks show at about 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the past, only nonprofit organizations will be allowed to sell goods 
including food, balloons and other novelty items and charge a fee for games, 
festival officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the city banned fireworks five years ago, the festival was 
especially created so nonprofit groups could raise money, said Ann Mottola, 
festival coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are available in the Community Services Department at City Hall, 
303 W. Commonwealth Ave. MIMI KO

Mexican dances, and Bruce Gifford & the Jazz Generation also will perform. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour features a display of vintage automobiles and two vintage postcard 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the neighborhood's homes date to 1912 and feature molded ceilings, 
elaborate fireplaces and curved archways. The group uses proceeds for 
neighborhood improvement and the association newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the tour are $9.50 the day of the event, to be purchased at 1142 
S. Ross St., and $7 in advance. For more information, call (714) 553-3744.

PLATINUM SUIT ALLEGES FUNDS SENT OVERSEAS; COURTS: INVESTORS' LAWYERS SAY 
FORMER CEO OF IRVINE SOFTWARE FIRM MOVED $500,000 TO A FOREIGN BANK THE DAY 
AFTER HE RESIGNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gerald R. Blackie, former chief executive of Platinum Software Corp. of 
Irvine, moved money to an overseas bank account the day after he resigned from 
the company, lawyers for shareholders who are suing Blackie said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 William Lerach, attorney for a group of Platinum investors suing Blackie and 
four other former top executives of the accounting software company, alleged 
that Blackie shifted $500,000 to a Swiss bank account to hide it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marvin Morgenstein, lawyer for Blackie, argued that Blackie simply chose 
to shift money overseas because his investments in the United States were 
faring poorly. He said that Blackie, who has since taken a job as a consultant, 
willingly disclosed the location of all his assets, including the money in the 
overseas bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 The arguments were made Friday during a hearing in U.S. District Court in 
Santa Ana on whether to freeze $24 million in assets held by Blackie and the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit filed in January, the investor group alleged that Platinum and 
its officers defrauded them and violated various securities regulations by 
misleading them about the accounting software firm's prospects. The suit 
prompted an internal accounting review at Platinum. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the company acknowledged that it had overstated its revenue for the 
past 18 months, prompting four top executives, including founder Blackie, to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignations and a subsequent restatement that knocked down previously 
reported revenue by $18.2 million threw the company into a financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Platinum settled its portion of the lawsuit by agreeing to pay 
$17 million in cash and corporate IOUs to shareholders who bought stock between 
Oct. 22, 1992, and April 18 of this year. Friday's hearing focused on the 
portion of the lawsuit naming the individual officers of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Alicemarie Stotler made no ruling Friday on whether to 
freeze the assets of the former officers, including Blackie; Jon Erickson, 
former chief financial officer; Mark Tague, former treasurer; and Timothy 
McMullen and Kevin Riegelsberger, who gave up their titles as executive vice 
presidents but remain employed by the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Stotler said she may announce a decision as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for each defendant argued against the freeze, saying it would impose 
undue financial hardships on the former officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lerach, the investors' lawyer, said his clients fear that Blackie might 
flee, making impossible the recovery of any money due shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Blackie also established a residence in Florida and refused to 
sign a settlement with the plaintiffs because it would have prohibited him from 
sending money to his parents in New Zealand.

 Electric Vans Grounded: Ford Motor Co. grounded its fleet of electric vans 
Friday following an early-morning fire that erupted in a vehicle battery as it 
was being charged at a California Air Resources Board facility in El Monte. The 
fire is the second to occur in the last month in a Ford Ecostar, the company's 
electric-powered test vehicle.On May 2, a Ford electric vehicle was damaged by 
a similar battery fire in Palo Alto. No one was hurt in either incident. In 
Friday's fire, damage was mostly confined to the batteries, which are under the 
van bed. The vehicles are powered by sodium-sulfur batteries made by the 
Swedish electrical engineering firm ABB. Ford has 34 electric vehicles being 
tested nationwide by 12 customers, mostly utilities.

PROPPING UP LOCAL BRIDGES; TRANSPORTATION: CALTRANS IS BANKING ON $950 MILLION 
IN PROP. 1A BONDS TO RETROFIT HIGHWAY STRUCTURES HERE AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE 
VULNERABLE TO QUAKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of public bridges in Orange County are being retrofitted and 
strengthened to keep them from collapsing during an earthquake, and Caltrans 
officials hope voters will approve a $950-million bond issue next week to allow 
the strengthening of several hundred additional highway structures here and 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Drago, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation in 
Sacramento, said 53 bridges, many of them freeway overpasses, either have been 
or are in the process of being retrofitted in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The local bridges are among the 1,039 structures in California that Caltrans 
plans to retrofit by 1995 at a cost of $750 million, Drago said. The 
construction is financed through the state's gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said it costs an average of $500,000 to retrofit each 
bridge, and requires about a year of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the process involves jacketing the existing columns in steel casing 
or steel-reinforced concrete to prevent them from cracking or disintegrating 
during earthquakes. Most bridge failures occur when short columns break or 
crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that during a quake, the tall columns under a bridge bend a bit, 
causing most of the force to be transferred to the shorter columns, which are 
not designed to absorb the added stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Encasing the shorter columns in steel or steel-reinforced concrete makes them 
more flexible, allowing them to bend as much as five inches, compared to one 
inch for columns not retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to make these bridges earthquake-resistant and keep them intact," 
said Drago. "Nothing is earthquake proof. We accept the fact that there will be 
damage in any earthquake, but if we keep them intact they won't collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting began after the 1971 Sylmar quake. Since then, about 122 Southern 
California bridges have been fixed. All of the strengthened bridges in Los 
Angeles County survived the magnitude 6.6 Northridge quake in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Drago said that Caltrans hopes voters on Tuesday approve Proposition 1A, which 
authorizes the state to sell $950 million in bonds to pay for retrofitting of 
an additional 1,600 highway bridges and overpasses, including seven toll 
bridges, that are being studied statewide as candidates for retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the bridges . . . are in Orange County, but we don't know how many 
will actually need retrofitting. We will produce a list of the new bridges that 
need to be strengthened by the end of the month," Drago said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, highway overpasses have already been fixed at the 
interchange of the San Diego and San Gabriel River freeways. The 7th Street 
overpass at the Garden Grove Freeway in Seal Beach has also been retrofitted. 
Caltrans officials said the 7th Street overpass is less than three miles from 
the Newport-Inglewood Fault, which is considered more dangerous to urban areas 
than the San Andreas Fault. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, there are 46 structures at eight other locations throughout Orange 
County that still need to be strengthened. One of the biggest retrofit projects 
in the county is at the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways interchange in Costa 
Mesa.

PENSION SPIKING IN HUNTINGTON TO COST $13 MILLION; FINANCE: THE CITY WILL HAVE 
TO PAY MOST -- BUT NOT ALL -- OF THE SHORTFALL CAUSED BY LEGAL BUT HIGHLY 
CONTROVERSIAL PRACTICE. THE STATE WILL PICK UP THE REST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pension spiking by some city employees is costing taxpayers a total of $13 
million, city officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 That amount includes about $3 million in unfunded pensions for 39 city 
employees who have already retired and $10 million more for 153 employees who 
have said they plan to retire with spiked pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking is the term given to pensions artificially inflated by adding such 
things as unused vacation days and car allowances, as if they were part of a 
final year's salary. (The amount of the final year's salary determines the 
pension.) Normal pensions are financed through periodic contributions to a 
pension fund. But when pensions are inflated through spiking, the increased 
amount has not been financed. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice has been legal but highly controversial. A new state law, 
effective July 1, will clamp down on most aspects of spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Huntington Beach city officials are struggling to find ways 
to pay for spiking that already has been allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special City Council subcommittee meeting Friday morning, specific fiscal 
details of spiking were released, but not the names of those who stand to 
benefit from artificially inflated pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Gail C. Hutton has said that no names of pension-spiking employees 
can be publicly disclosed because it would violate their right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although names were deleted, city officials on Friday released documents that 
showed the individual cost of 39 retired city employees who spiked their 
pensions. One retired city employee escalated his or her pension by $10,343 a 
year through spiking, the documents disclosed. The documents also showed that 
the average unfunded cost for a spiked pension for a retired safety employee, 
such as a police officer or firefighter, was $104,939. For an employee in other 
departments, the average spiked pension cost was $45,093. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach will have to pay most -- but not all -- of the $13-million 
shortfall caused by city employees' pension spiking. The state will pick up the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan, chairman of a City Council subcommittee that is 
investigating spiking, on Friday repeatedly denounced the practice. He said 
past city councils probably allowed pension spiking simply because they were 
never adequately briefed on its fiscal consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spiking is morally wrong because it is an unfunded liability," Sullivan said. 
"The money it will cost the city to pay for spiked pensions could have been 
used for such things as hiring more police officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Administrator Robert Franz told the council subcommittee that the 
state's Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) several months ago increased 
its rates to help compensate for spiking by Huntington Beach and other cities. 
Huntington Beach thus only owes about $750,000 of the unfunded $3 million for 
39 already retired employees, Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Franz also estimated that Huntington Beach will only have to pay about half of 
the total $10 million in unfunded spiked pensions for 153 city employees still 
scheduled to retire. Franz said a variety of factors, such as employees' 
quitting Huntington Beach and going to work for other governmental agencies, 
could reduce the city's cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan, however, responded that no matter which way the unfunded pensions 
are paid for, the money ultimately comes from taxpayers in the state. He said 
that predictions that Huntington Beach may only have to pay half of the 
unfunded cost are "of very little comfort to me."

COMMON CAUSE CHIEF CRITICIZES COUNTY RECORDER

 General voter disinterest in the county's more obscure political offices could 
produce "tragic" results in Tuesday's election of a county clerk-recorder, the 
head of a local government watchdog agency said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Common Cause Director William Mitchell said he was shocked by a 
recent Times Orange County Poll showing Recorder Lee A. Branch leading in the 
race, despite the recorder's censure earlier this year for misconduct in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public needs to know what a terrible public servant this guy is," 
Mitchell said, in an unusual attack against a local officeholder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you have someone who has done a horrible job, but there is obviously 
such indifference out there that he could be rewarded for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times poll showed Branch holding a six-percentage point lead over County 
Clerk Gary L. Granville, whose office will be merged with the recorder's. The 
same poll, however, reported that nearly half of the respondents did not know 
who they would support in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch, who has held the office since 1978, said Friday he was not familiar 
with Mitchell nor did he know what prompted him to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't know where he's coming from," Branch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Common Cause does not endorse political candidates, Mitchell did 
refer to Granville as an alternative candidate in the race. Also running for 
the office are Assistant Recorder Ella M. Murphy and attorney Christopher J. 
Leanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a general disenchantment with the political process," 
Mitchell said. "People tend to feel comfortable with names who are familiar to 
them and that's it. But here you have a public official (Branch) whose 
performance in office has been documented to be below par." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing gross mismanagement and personnel problems within the recorder's 
office, the county Board of Supervisors issued its unprecedented censure of 
Branch earlier this year. Last month, the Orange County Grand Jury reiterated 
those mismanagement concerns in a review of office operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch has described the board's action as a politically motivated attempt to 
drive him from office so that supervisors could replace him with Granville, 
their favored candidate.

POLICE TAPING AGAIN SUBJECT OF INVESTIGATION; PRIVACY: SUPERVISORS IN LAGUNA 
BEACH SAY RECORDING OF PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS WAS INADVERTENT, BUT SEVEN 
EMPLOYEES CONTINUE TO PRESS CLAIMS AND GRAND JURY SEEKS SECOND INQUEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office, which has already conducted one 
investigation into allegations that the personal conversations of Laguna Beach 
Police Department employees had been improperly tape-recorded, has been asked 
to re-investigate the issue, the police chief said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was requested by the Orange County Grand Jury on behalf of 
seven Police Department employees, who say their privacy and civil rights were 
violated when their personal conversations at work were taped without their 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees -- three police officers, two dispatchers and two records clerks 
-- have also filed a $10,000 claim against Laguna Beach, which the City Council 
is expected to reject Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The taping issue first surfaced in January, when workers learned that their 
idle conversations -- including comments about their superiors -- had been 
recorded and some began to fear that their words would be used against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials have blamed the tapings on faulty telephone equipment, which 
has since been replaced. They say none of the employees whose conversations 
were taped were disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 Police supervisors say the faulty equipment was in place for about seven 
months before being discovered and replaced. Calls to the Police Department are 
routinely recorded, but the equipment continued to record the conversations of 
the employees after the telephone calls had been terminated, police explained. 
</P>
<P>
 But Don Barney, president of the Laguna Beach Police Employees Assn., said 
Friday that their attorney has evidence "there has been an ongoing 
eavesdropping of private conversations of employees for years." Barney, a 
retired Laguna Beach police sergeant, declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. said the employees' determination to press the case 
has created tensions between the seven claimants and the three supervisors 
whose actions are being investigated -- himself, Sgt. Danell Adams and Lt. Paul 
Workman. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a place this small, you can't be having employees asking for a criminal 
investigation and a grand jury investigation and now a claim -- which is a 
prelude to a lawsuit down the line -- without creating unwanted and unwarranted 
tension and disruption within the department," Purcell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind it appears the motivation behind it is to try to harass the 
supervisors and command staff involved," the chief added. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials maintain the problem began late last June when four new 
telephones were installed in the department, three near the front counter in 
the records office and one nearby in the dispatch center. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of what Purcell describes as "a glitch" in the system, when employees 
pressed the release button to end a conversation, a microphone in the handset 
continued recording office sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Some department telephones -- including the four in question -- are wired to 
record telephone conversations to ensure that employees respond appropriately 
to the public, and to document conversations that could be used in court, 
Purcell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Workman said that two days before the firestorm that swept through this 
city in October, Sgt. Adams asked him to look into what appeared to be a 
problem with the telephones. But Workman said he was sidetracked by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In early January, Workman said he sent a memo to workers telling them to 
"please consider yourself recorded at all times." Five days later, after the 
faulty telephones were identified, Workman said he wrote another memo saying, 
"as it turns out, you were being bugged." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Workman and Purcell acknowledged in January that the situation should 
have handled differently, and Purcell said Workman was disciplined as a result 
of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Purcell, who said he has repeatedly apologized to the affected employees, said 
he felt the matter should have been put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 But a letter dated April 25 to the city from James E. Trott, the claimants' 
attorney, says "the acts giving rise to this claim have been ongoing for many 
years" and that Purcell, Adams and Workman knew about it, did nothing to stop 
it and "allowed or participated in its continuance." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter says that, because their private conversations were listened to, 
the employees suffered "emotional and physical distress." It also says the 
department has "undertaken a course of retaliation and began to discipline 
those who initially filed the complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 Purcell called the charge that the department had been taping conversations 
for years "baloney." He also said it was "absolutely ludicrous" to say 
supervisors would "eavesdrop" on the private conversations of department 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the second time that the district attorney's office has been 
asked to look into the taping. In February, six of the seven claimants filed a 
complaint asking that an outside agency investigate possible criminal or civil 
violations on the part of Purcell, Workman and Adams, Purcell said, adding that 
he forwarded the complaint to the district attorney's office a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter from the district attorney's office dated April 11 says that office 
found insufficient evidence of criminal conduct on the part of department 
personnel to file charges. It also says that "further investigation by this 
office is not warranted." 
</P>
<P>
 Purcell and Barney said this second investigation was prompted by a request 
from the claimants' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Barney said the police association did not believe the first investigation was 
sufficiently thorough, because the taped employees were not interviewed. "So if 
they didn't interview the victims, where did they get the information from, the 
suspects?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Trott nor officials from the district attorney's office or the grand 
jury could be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ann Christoph, however, came to the department's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating, because it was an unintentional, mechanical problem," she 
said. "As far as I understand, the supervisors did everything they could to 
rectify the situation. I think it's unfortunate that people continue to imply 
that this was an intentional thing, which it wasn't."

D.A.'S OFFICE WON'T CHARGE BUS DRIVER IN DEATH OF BOY, 7; JURISPRUDENCE: A 
PROSECUTOR SAID THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO FOR FILING AN INFRACTION. IT 
WAS THE CHILD'S FIRST DAY ON THE SCHOOL BUS.

 Prosecutors said Friday they will not file charges against a Capistrano 
Unified School District bus driver whose 7-year-old passenger was run down and 
killed after stepping off the school bus at the wrong stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marc Kelly said there was insufficient evidence to file a 
traffic infraction against Jack Randall Rueweler, 38, who was driving the 
school bus when Tommy Lanni of Laguna Niguel was hit by a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've determined this is not an appropriate case for the criminal arena," 
Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tommy's mother, Barbara Lanni, said Friday she feels the bus driver was 
"grossly negligent" by not caring for her son, who had recently moved from New 
York to Orange County and was riding the school bus for the first time when he 
was killed on April 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got on the bus myself that morning and told the driver Tommy was new and 
(the driver) agreed to take care of him," she said. "It's a bus driver's 
responsibility to know where the children get off. If he was doing his job, 
Tommy would be alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lannis have filed a claim against the school district, alleging that the 
driver acted improperly by neither flashing his lights nor escorting the 
first-grader across Aliso Niguel Road and Camino Baga in Laguna Niguel. Barbara 
Lanni said the bus driver also erred in allowing her son to exit at the wrong 
stop. The family is seeking $10 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the couple said bus drivers on the same route continued for 
several days after the accident to allow children to get off the bus without 
flashing their lights or stopping traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a widespread problem," said attorney Roland J. Amundsen. "The 
decision by prosecutors should not be seen as a vindication." 
</P>
<P>
 A school bus driver is required by state law to activate flashing red lights 
when children will be crossing the street. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said Rueweler did not know Tommy Lanni was crossing the 
street, since the youngster lived on the same side of the street as the bus 
stop. Officials say the boy may have been disoriented when he started to cross 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to find the bus driver guilty of that violation, we must show he had 
actual knowledge that children were crossing the street," Kelly said. "We 
interviewed a number of people and found that was not the case.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tragedy. I tell you, your heart just goes out to the family at a 
time like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the pickup truck also has been cleared of any criminal 
wrongdoing, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lannis say they are determined to make sure a similar tragedy does not 
occur again. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been working with state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) to 
get emergency legislation enacted that would require all school bus drivers to 
make a "flashing lights" stop whenever children get off school buses. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials said the investigation by prosecutors confirmed the 
results of their own investigation. Rueweler could not be reached for comment 
Friday.

HOT DOG FANS ATTACK REPORT WITH RELISH; HEALTH: DESPITE RECENT MEDICAL 
FINDINGS, SOME LOCAL RESIDENTS PLAN TO KEEP WIENERS ON THEIR MENUS. 
</P>

 Lou Bunn and his 4-year-old granddaughter started their grocery shopping in 
the Vons deli on Friday by picking up two packages of one of America's favorite 
foods -- hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gonna put 'em on the grill," said Bunn, a lifelong wiener hound, while 
choosing between two brands of kosher franks at the Ventura market. 
</P>
<P>
 What about recent medical findings that suggest the meaty wieners could 
increase the risk of cancer in children? 
</P>
<P>
 "I do my best to pick the best for her," Bunn said, stroking granddaughter 
Tori's hair. But "you can't give up everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Amen, and pass the mustard. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the opinion of many hot dog lovers across Ventura County, who 
dismissed the newest medical revelations as more don't-eat-that-it's-bad- 
for-you overkill. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the most stupid thing I've ever heard," said 76-year-old Ted Ring, a 
meat cutter at Jue's Market in Ventura. "I've eaten hot dogs my whole life and 
I've never had problems." 
</P>
<P>
 University research, disclosed this week, suggests that children who eat more 
than 12 hot dogs a month could have problems, specifically a higher risk of 
childhood leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies also suggest that mothers who eat a hot dog per week during 
pregnancy double the risk of brain tumors in their unborn children. The 
researchers suggest that nitrites used to preserve hot dogs could cause the 
cancers.  
</P>
<P>
 The scientists have cautioned that the findings are preliminary and based on a 
small number of cases but are significant enough to warrant further study. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one school district in Ventura County may remove hot dogs from its 
menus as a result of the preliminary findings. And some parents said they 
intend to reduce their children's wiener intake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always concerned with any research like this that comes out," said Pera 
Jambazian, director of child nutritional services for the Oxnard Elementary 
School District. "We're in the business of providing nutritious food for 
children. As it is right now, we serve hot dogs once a month and corn dogs once 
a month. It is something children enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jambazian said she plans to cut the number of hot dogs served in the 
district's 15 elementary schools. "We'll probably just end up taking them off 
the menu," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Sanchez, who brought her son and two nieces to Wienerschnitzel for 
corn dogs and hot dogs, was surprised to learn of the possible hazards 
associated with their lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't eat hot dogs that much," Sanchez said, explaining that her Santa 
Barbara family had just stopped there for a special treat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of parents will think twice after hearing that," said Carol 
Sanchez, the children's grandmother. Hot dogs "won't be the first thing on the 
shopping list." 
</P>
<P>
 But they still ate the wieners, with relish. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fast food restaurants that sell hot dogs have not seen any loss of 
customers since the potential hazard was revealed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty good business," said Graciela Soto, a cashier at Wienerschnitzel 
in Ventura, which sells eight wiener entrees. Soto said the restaurant sells a 
few hundred hot dogs daily, and Friday was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 For 14 years, John Smiley has made a living selling hot dogs from his 
umbrella-shaded stand in the Conejo Valley. "They are delicious," he told 
customers Friday. "Don't be afraid of them."  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to peddling franks at lunchtime along Townsgate Road in Thousand 
Oaks, Smiley prepares wieners for weddings and private parties. The medical 
findings linking hot dogs to cancers shocked him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been eating hot dogs since I walked to school as a kid in New York," 
Smiley said. "It would really sadden me" if the findings were verified. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert P. Sedgwick, a semi-retired neurologist living in Westlake, said 
the preliminary findings are not enough evidence to turn him away from hot 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't eat anything these days," he said, while biting into a Smiley's 
Super Dog covered with mustard, onions and relish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems 10, 20 years ago we didn't pay attention to diet," Sedgwick said. 
"Clearly (the research) is important, but it has to be verified."  
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks real estate agent Marc Smith said medical researchers can find 
something wrong with every food and every product. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything you eat is bad," Smith said between bites of a chili-smothered 
wiener. "There was one guy on TV who was 106 years old and ate nothing but 
Oscar Mayer hot dogs all his life. I think it depends on your immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you only live once," Smith added.

320 ARRESTED AND DEPORTED BY BORDER PATROL; IMMIGRATION: AGENCY LAUNCHES 
COUNTY'S BIGGEST SWEEP IN NEARLY A DECADE. CRITICS POINT TO EMPLOYERS, SAY 
RAIDS MAKE LITTLE IMPACT. 
</P>

 In the biggest sweep of illegal immigrants in Ventura County in nearly a 
decade, U.S. Border Patrol agents announced Friday that they have arrested and 
deported 320 undocumented workers at checkpoints and businesses in Oxnard, 
Camarillo, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents on Wednesday arrested 172 immigrants they said were here illegally, 
taking them into custody at traffic stops in Saticoy, carwashes in Thousand 
Oaks and street flower vending sites in Oxnard and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, agents armed with search warrants raided a strawberry farm in 
Oxnard and a manufacturer in Moorpark, arresting another 151 illegal 
immigrants. An additional 43 immigrants were arrested during the sweeps but 
were later released because they showed legitimate documentation, said Mike 
Malloy, the Border Patrol agent in charge of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 All but three immigrants arrested signed voluntary departure forms and were 
transported by bus to Jalisco and Tijuana, Malloy said. The three immigrants 
who requested hearings were released and will present their cases before the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There weren't tears, resistance or crying," Malloy said. "A lot of joking and 
kidding, actually. They know what the game is -- it's something they knew when 
they entered this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration advocates on Friday criticized the raids, saying they make little 
impact in stemming the growing tide of undocumented immigrants entering Ventura 
County. Advocates argue that U.S. citizens are not willing to work in the 
low-income jobs that illegal immigrants fill, and that not enough pressure is 
put on employers to stop hiring the immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt that a United States citizen would apply for a job at a strawberry 
farm," said Armando Garcia, spokesman for the Ventura County Coalition for 
Immigrant Rights. "As long as the jobs are available, undocumented immigrants 
will continue crossing the border. They're willing to work for whatever job is 
available for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Malloy said he decided to conduct the raids after receiving reports from 
former employees at Bob Jones Ranch in Oxnard and Moorpark-based Bendpak about 
large numbers of illegal immigrants. Usually, immigration officials put 
pressure on employers to fire undocumented workers, but Malloy said the raids 
serve as incentive for other employers to be more careful in their hiring 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Jones Ranch and Bendpak, which makes car lifts used in many auto repair 
shops, will not be fined for hiring the workers because company officials were 
unable to determine that their employment documents were counterfeit, Malloy 
said. Prompted by the employee complaints, agents audited both companies' 
records before obtaining search warrants and found that 60% of the employees at 
Bob Jones Ranch and about 70% of the employees at Bendpak had counterfeit 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Malloy said employers have no way of verifying the workers' immigration 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen McCarthy, attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance, said 
immigration agents should concentrate on targeting the employers rather than 
the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the INS is really serious about stemming illegal immigration, they have to 
come up with ways to dampen the employers' enthusiasm for such labor," McCarthy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bendpak officials declined to comment, but Bob Jones, whose Oxnard farm was 
raided, said the arrests will make little difference to his operation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of next week, Jones said, he expects immigrants will be 
lining up as always to apply for minimum wage strawberry-picking jobs on his 
250-acre ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the only people willing to go out there and do that," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' general manager, Lucky Westwood, said about one-third of the pickers 
failed to report for work Friday because they were afraid immigration agents 
would return. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done everything in our power to avoid this situation, but some of 
them got into the work force anyway, and Border Patrol felt they had to come 
and pick them up," Westwood said. "This was not between the INS and us. It was 
between the INS and the immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Malloy disagreed with Jones that undocumented immigrants are the only ones who 
will apply for low-income jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a raid last year at Waterway, an Oxnard-based manufacturing firm, Malloy 
deported 52 illegal immigrants. Executives at the company, which makes pumps, 
filters and other parts for swimming pools, asked Malloy to screen new 
applicants for the vacant positions. Waterway officials said they sent Malloy 
about 250 immigration documents and at least 200 were legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 But workers argue that undocumented immigrants are not a threat to society and 
should be allowed to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the women working in the packinghouse at Bob Jones Ranch witnessed the 
raid Thursday morning and said Border Patrol agents beat workers with their 
batons, kicked some of the women pickers and dragged them from their hiding 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 But Westwood, who also witnessed the raids, said he did not notice any rough 
treatment by the agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the fields where few workers were toiling on Friday, Westwood and 
Jones recalled the changes in immigration law enforcement in the last two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least it was better than the old days, when the Border Patrol would come 
in on their motorcycles and their horses, and the workers would scatter, and 
you wouldn't have anyone left," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Westwood: "It's been a game that's been going on for at least 30 years." 
</P>

HALF-CENT SALES TAX INITIATIVE ADVISED; FINANCES: COUNTY STAFF REPORT 
RECOMMENDS ASKING FOR VOTERS' JUDGMENT ON LEVY TO SUPPORT TRANSIT PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County officials should ask voters to consider a half-cent sales tax 
for transportation this November, county staff members reported Friday, saying 
business leaders back the measure and there is enough time for an effective 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report presented to the Ventura County Transportation Commission, the 
commission staff recommended the move based on an informal survey of local 
businesses conducted during the past several weeks with the help of a 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of business leaders agreed to support the tax and the transit 
projects it would finance because they would relieve pressure on industry to 
reduce pollution, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general consensus is that there is never a good time to raise taxes," the 
report said. But based on the discussions with business leaders, "it appears 
that there is both financial support and adequate time for a good campaign 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
 In letters addressed to the commission, a handful of local businesses 
expressed their support for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of the severe air emission restrictions that are facing Ventura 
County . . . we all realize that every reasonable measure must be taken to 
demonstrate attainment (of pollution standards) and still be able to conduct 
business in the county," wrote Marcia A. Secord, district manager for Southern 
California Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by a majority of voters, the sales tax would climb to 7.75%, 
raising more than $500 million over 20 years for road and public transit 
projects throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission members agreed to allow the staff to continue preparing a measure 
for the ballot but asked for more information, postponing a final decision 
until a special meeting scheduled for June 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've spent a lot of time talking about the unavailability of funding for 
streets and transit," Commissioner David Smith said. "I believe this option 
should be kept open." 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission agrees to move forward with the tax, it would not go on the 
ballot unless it is also approved by the Board of Supervisors and at least half 
of the 10 cities in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Consideration of the measure comes four years after Ventura County voters 
overwhelmingly defeated a similar transportation sales-tax proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 At its May meeting, the commission agreed to pay a consulting firm -- 
Townsend, Hermocillo, Raimundo & Usher of Sacramento -- $20,000 to come up with 
a ballot measure that would be palatable to Ventura County voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant has worked on successful sales-tax campaigns in Orange, San 
Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County is the largest county in California that does not collect a 
transportation sales tax, and the only county in Southern California without 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 As in 1990, the campaign -- which would cost an estimated $400,000 -- could be 
funded by businesses seeking ways to comply with federal regulations to improve 
public transit and reduce air pollution, commission Executive Director Ginger 
Gherardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the consultant, the commission staff has proposed spending 60% of 
the money on roads and 40% on public transit projects, including Metrolink and 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary list of road projects to be financed with the money includes 
rebuilding Ventura Freeway interchanges at Victoria Avenue in Ventura and 
Carmen Drive in Camarillo; widening the freeway between Johnson Drive in 
Ventura and Vineyard Avenue in Oxnard; and widening the Moorpark Freeway in 
Moorpark and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the preliminary proposal, a citizens' oversight committee would be 
formed to make sure the funds are allocated properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a draft and is subject to change based on your input and what we 
come up with from the public in the next few weeks," Gherardi told the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the commission decided to stick with a plan to pay for 
Metrolink service to Camarillo and Oxnard through June, 1995, despite concerns 
of some city and county officials that the service could eventually drain funds 
from other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The commuter train service was extended to Camarillo and Oxnard after the Jan. 
17 earthquake to ease congestion on damaged freeways. Federal emergency funds 
are paying most of the cost of the service until October 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has agreed to pay $260,000 to continue the service until next 
June in order to have more time to gauge ridership. Fewer than 150 passengers a 
day currently board the train in Oxnard and Camarillo.

LAWYERS SAY STATE RULES EXONERATE RATNER, AIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state attorney general has been advising law-enforcement officers that 
they can legally listen in on confidential conversations of suspects, despite 
charging a Ventura County prosecutor and investigator with felony 
eavesdropping. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, California Atty. Gen. Daniel E. Lungren sends law-enforcement 
officers a legal publication that specifically states that eavesdropping is 
acceptable as long as no electronic or mechanical device is used. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may legally eavesdrop on a conversation without the aid of a mechanical 
or electronic device as long as you hear it from a location where you have a 
lawful right to be," the attorney general's California Peace Officers Legal 
Sourcebook says. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacy A. Ratner and investigator Katherine 
Smith -- both charged with felony eavesdropping -- consider the statement 
evidence that their clients have not broken the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner and Smith were charged May 20, after a bailiff in a Ventura County 
courtroom reported that they eavesdropped on a conversation between a defense 
attorney and burglary defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner is accused of ordering Smith, her investigator in the case against 
Robert Lee Morrow, to sit near a courtroom holding cell last January and listen 
as the defendant discussed the charges against him with his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got basically the attorney general's own material, saying, 'Hey, it 
requires an electronic device,' " defense attorney Stuart D. Adams said Friday 
about the legal publication. Adams, who is defending Smith, has filed a motion 
asking that the charge against Smith and Ratner be dismissed. His motion, in 
part, is based on the information provided in the legal handbook issued by the 
attorney general's office, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner's attorney, Harland W. Braun, said the advice in the legal publication 
"means if someone is talking loud enough to be overheard from a public place, 
then your privacy is not being violated." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Puglia, a spokesman for Lungren, refused to comment on the advice in the 
Legal Sourcebook, which he said is intended to "provide guidance for those in 
the criminal-justice system." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal publication describes scenarios in which law-enforcement officers 
may listen to seemingly confidential conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a section called "Electronic Eavesdropping and Recording," it states 
that ". . . non-electronic eavesdropping constitutes neither an illegal 
'interception' nor an unreasonable invasion of privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 But the next paragraph appears to limit that guideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, an inmate must be given the opportunity to conduct a 
completely private ( un overheard) conversation when he is meeting with his 
attorney," the Legal Sourcebook says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner and Smith, who were placed on paid administrative leave, could not be 
reached for comment Friday. District attorney's officials will not comment on 
the issue until the case is resolved, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Braun maintained the pair was charged by "incompetent" aides to Lungren. 
Smith's attorney, Adams, agreed. Deputy Atty. Gen. Douglas Sortino, who signed 
the felony complaint, has refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only say maybe they (the attorney general's office) were afraid of 
being accused of whitewashing (the case)," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Adams said he does not expect the charges to be dropped without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not just going to say, 'Sorry! Oops!' And dismiss the thing," Adams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 19, Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Edward LeClair wrote in the report 
that Ratner ordered Smith to eavesdrop as Deputy Public Defender Mary L. 
Fielder talked with her client, Robert Lee Morrow. 
</P>
<P>
 According to district attorney's officials, Ratner acknowledged asking Smith 
to eavesdrop. But she claimed she was simply trying to figure out whether 
Morrow would be asking to have his case postponed so she could make her 
vacation plans.

ELECTIONS / COUNTY OFFICIALS; TRADITIONALLY LOW-PROFILE RACES DRAW NEW INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Amid legal squabbles and questions about Ventura County's financial 
leadership, the campaigns for the jobs of auditor-controller, tax assessor and 
clerk-recorder have attracted more voter attention than usual -- and candidates 
say there is plenty at stake in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their relative anonymity, the holders of these posts are well-paid 
administrators who are responsible for cutting the county's checks, assessing 
its property values and running its elections. They also supervise large staffs 
and manage multimillion-dollar budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, each serves as a public guardian over the daily operations of county 
government, ensuring its efficiency and effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Some county officials said all three races have attracted more attention than 
usual because of past controversies over the salaries and perks paid to elected 
officials and county administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these races have gotten more interest this time because the Board of 
Supervisors has been under attack for not having good leadership on the perks 
issue and other things," Supervisor John Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at each of the three countywide offices that voters will decide 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Auditor-Controller: Of the three races, the auditor-controller's is the most 
competitive, with five candidates vying for the job that pays $128,000 annually 
in salary and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's chief financial officer monitors county revenues and 
expenditures, conducts department audits, prepares the county's payroll and 
budget, and supervises a staff of 74. The last contested election for 
auditor-controller was in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates competing for the job are Thomas O. Mahon, 71, who was 
appointed auditor-controller last year after serving as assistant auditor for 
20 years; and accountants William Baker, 36, of Ventura; Richard Morrisset, 41, 
of Oxnard; Scott Weiss, 38, of Ventura, and Clifford Wigen, 60, of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton was disqualified from the race last month 
after Baker filed a lawsuit, claiming Stratton did not have the accounting 
experience required for the job. Stratton has since endorsed Mahon. 
</P>
<P>
 With Stratton out of the race, most of the candidates have focused their 
criticism on the appointed incumbent, whom they label a "career bureaucrat." 
</P>
<P>
 They question how Mahon can call himself an "independent auditor" when he has 
accepted campaign contributions from county employees' unions as well as from 
such officials as Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, Supervisor Maggie Kildee and 
County Counsel James McBride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe you can be an independent auditor once you take money from 
these groups," said Baker, who worked for the county as a financial analyst 
from 1985 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Wigen agreed and has made it a point not to accept money from special 
interests. Of the $25,175 in campaign contributions he recently reported, all 
but $100 came from Wigen himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not look good to take money from those who may be involved in 
audits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mahon said he sees nothing wrong with the campaign contributions he has 
received from county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been with the county for 23 years," Mahon said. "These people have 
gotten to know me and they trust me enough to give me their support. I feel 
very proud about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said he has also demonstrated that he can be impartial. He noted that 
his office conducted a stinging audit of the county Fire Department last year 
that showed it was top-heavy with managers and lax on sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son is a county firefighter and treasurer of the union," Mahon said, 
adding that his son, Chris, testified before the Board of Supervisors to 
denounce some of the audit's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon has also been criticized for not speaking out on the supervisors' 1989 
approval of large financial perks for themselves and other county officials, or 
the 1992 approval of early retirement for 43 employees and administrators at a 
cost of nearly $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never opened his mouth," Weiss said. "If I'm elected, I'm going to open my 
mouth. The public needs to have someone in there who is going to save taxpayer 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said he was not the auditor when those decisions were made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I was on the staff but this was board-approved," he said. "It was all 
done in public session. There was nothing illegal about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss and Baker said they believe that Mahon is overpaid. If elected, each 
said, they would be willing to cut their salary by 15% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon defended his salary and benefits package, saying it was well-deserved 
compensation for his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I earn it, and the work and results produced by this office" show that, he 
said. "I would question the intent of anybody who says, 'Vote for me because I 
will take less money.' If that's what they think about themselves, then that 
must be their true value." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said that since he took over the auditor's post last year, the county's 
bond rating has improved from A to A-plus, making it cheaper for the county to 
borrow money through bond sales. He also said a San Francisco accounting firm 
recently rated Ventura County as the most credit-worthy of the state's 14 
largest counties. 
</P>
<P>
 A runoff in November is possible if the top vote-getter in the auditor's race 
fails to collect more than 50% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Clerk-Recorder: In one of the more bitter battles for a countywide office this 
election season, Dan Schmidt, 39, owner of a legal advertising business, is 
running against longtime incumbent County Clerk Richard Dean, 51. 
</P>
<P>
 The county clerk-recorder receives $127,000 annually in salary and benefits. 
The clerk is responsible for supervising a staff of 62 that performs clerical 
work for county supervisors, runs county elections and keeps track of land 
deeds and other important documents. The last contested election for the office 
occurred 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, who has served as clerk since 1983, said Schmidt is running because he 
is upset about a legal complaint brought by the clerk's office three years ago 
against Schmidt and his business. The complaint alleged that Schmidt had 
engaged in false and deceptive advertising practices. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of that case, a judge recently ordered Schmidt to pay a $2,500 
fine. Schmidt maintains that he consulted with officials in the clerk's office 
before mailing advertising flyers and assumed there was no problem. The clerk's 
office, however, never officially approved the flyers, which appeared to be 
from a government agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a personal vendetta," Dean said of Schmidt's campaign. "He blames us 
for the legal problems he's had for the last three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt denied the accusation. He said he is running because he believes the 
clerk's office can be managed more efficiently. He recently filed a lawsuit to 
force Dean's office to release its 1994-95 draft budget so Schmidt could use it 
in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But Superior Court Judge John Hunter on Thursday denied Schmidt's request, 
agreeing with the county clerk's office that the budget document is in draft 
form and subject to revision. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt promises that, if elected, he would open the county clerk's office on 
Fridays and voluntarily cut his salary by 25%. He said he would recommend a 25% 
salary cut for all of the county's top administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm outraged by the high salary increases received by county officials at a 
time when public services are decreasing while taxes and fees are increasing," 
Schmidt said. "It doesn't have to happen. We can do something about it by 
getting rid of the incumbents." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean maintains that his office is operating as efficiently as possible. He 
also notes that the Board of Supervisors decides his pay and also when the 
clerk's office will open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't control that," Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean said he was shocked by Schmidt's aggressive campaign, which is almost 
totally financed by a personal loan of more than $8,000. Schmidt has used some 
of that money to pay for two four-page newspaper ads criticizing Dean's job 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be in this kind of race just 
for doing my job," Dean said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tax Assessor: Acting county Tax Assessor Glenn E. Gray, 55, is being 
challenged for his job by Ventura City Councilman Jack Tingstrom, 58. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessor's duties include evaluating all taxable property, supervising a 
staff of 113 and managing a budget of $7 million. The job pays $102,000 a year 
in salary and benefits. The last time there was a contested election for the 
assessor's job was in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's campaign has focused largely on his experience and knowledge of the 
job's technical aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to have someone who is qualified run the office," said Gray, 
who has worked in the assessor's office for 31 years, including seven years as 
assistant assessor. "It would be one thing if the other candidate had been an 
assessor. But not to have any experience at all I don't think is good." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tingstrom, 58, argues that the assessor's job is more of a managerial 
post, one that Tingstrom says he is more than qualified to fill. Tingstrom 
retired in 1985 after 30 years as a mid-level manager at GTE Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would bring a fresh perspective to the job because he has 
experience as a manager in private industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people believe that you need to have been in the job for 31 years to know 
how to do it, then they're going to vote for (Gray)," Tingstrom said. "If they 
believe that county government needs a new direction in management, then 
they're going to vote for me."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: TEXAS SCHOOL DONATES TO LOCAL CAMPUS

 Students and staff members at Thousand Oaks High School received a $1,000 
check Friday from a high school in Garland, Tex., that sold spaghetti dinners 
to help victims of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation, symbolized by an oversize check, was made during a year-end 
assembly at Thousand Oaks High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Garland were not present, but the ceremony was videotaped and 
will be sent to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks High School suffered mainly cosmetic damage during the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracks in the sidewalk and plaster were evident, and one portable classroom 
sustained structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine Harrell, a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
said state officials picked Thousand Oaks High to receive the donation from 
Texas because larger sums have already been funneled to more severely damaged 
high schools in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the donation, the high schools in Thousand Oaks and Garland 
plan to set up a sister-school relationship, said Supt. Jerry Gross of the 
Conejo Valley Unified School District. JULIE FIELDS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TEEN AIDS EDUCATORS TO JOIN WALK AT UCI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teen-age American Red Cross volunteers have been working for more than a year 
to help teach fellow students about the dangers of the human immunodeficiency 
virus, which causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The young volunteers took a 16-hour course and brought Red Cross teaching 
materials about AIDS to more than 10,000 students around the county. They make 
the presentations without adult help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more comfortable, more open," said David Nguyen, 16, a Garden Grove High 
junior who spoke recently to a group of students at El Modena High. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Youth HIV/AIDS Volunteer Educators program are taught to speak 
frankly about the dangers of AIDS, using terms that young people understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole room is teen-agers," Nguyen explained. "They really listen in. They 
want to learn. They talk to me and they talk in their own language. Teen-agers 
don't talk the same as adults." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen and a dozen other young volunteers met this week to make posters they 
will carry in Sunday's AIDS Walk. The 10-kilometer walk through the UC Irvine 
campus is expected to attract more than 9,000 marchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth-to-youth program started in February, 1993. It's probably more 
effective than adult lectures about sexually transmitted diseases, said Susan 
Sullivan, a nurse who works for the County Health Care Agency and the Red 
Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross curriculum, which the youth volunteers use, tells the number of 
AIDS cases, the causes of AIDS and how HIV is transmitted. It teaches that 
abstinence is the only sure way to avoid AIDS. But the teen-age volunteers also 
tell students to know how to use condoms to protect themselves when they do 
have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Red Cross teaching materials, condoms can be 98% effective at 
preventing HIV transmission, if used correctly and consistently. The Just Say 
No programs that work to lower drug use will not work to curtail the sexual 
behavior that can transmit HIV, said Sullivan, who has eight years of 
experience working at the Red Cross to fight AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "With sexuality, you're talking about hormones," Sullivan said. "Hormones are 
not driving kids to use drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Red Cross is so respected, the youth AIDS educator program has 
spread quickly throughout the county, Sullivan said. Most campuses already have 
students in Red Cross clubs, where they learn how to help with area emergencies 
and get training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside groups that want to bring AIDS-awareness programs to the schools can 
meet with resistance from parents, Sullivan said. But when students ask to 
teach at their own schools they are more likely to be allowed, she said. The 
teen volunteers can make the health presentation in English, Spanish, Korean, 
Japanese and Persian. Nguyen is prepared to make his presentation in 
Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 Monique Moreno, 16, and Jesus Torres, 17, both students at Santa Ana High 
School, recently spoke in Spanish with two English-as-a-second-language classes 
at Capistrano Valley High School. Many of the students were initially shy, 
Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're embarrassed, but if we say it, they'll say it too," Moreno said. 
"They want to know about protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno said she could tell some of the students had little knowledge of AIDS 
or the risks of sex.  
</P>
<P>
 But Moreno recognizes that just because she speaks to students as a peer, she 
can't force them to delay having sex. "They're going to have sex anyway," she 
said. "They're going to do it anyway, no matter what you say." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that logic, the youth volunteers do tell students how to use 
condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better to be protected than not be protected at all," Torres said. AIDS 
Walk Funds 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, money raised by Orange County walkers and corporate sponsors has 
doubled. During the same period the number of walkers has quadrupled. Each 
year, 78% of the donations are distributed to local AIDS-related organizations.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; COMPUTER HEIST NETS $40,000 IN EQUIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Several men robbed a computer store of about $40,000 in equipment Thursday 
night after they forced the store's two employees to lock themselves in the 
bathroom, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Cheng, one of the employees at Alston Entertainment, 2913 Saturn St. 
in Brea, told investigators she was in her office at about 8:30 p.m. when a man 
came from behind and ordered her not to look at him and to lock herself and the 
other employee in the bathroom, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheng told police she and her co-worker, whose name was not released, complied 
with the order. She then heard several men remove the computer equipment. She 
said she and her co-worker remained in the bathroom long after the robbers had 
left -- 1 1/2 hours -- because they feared for their lives, police said.

 Thursday night's incident was the latest in a string of computer-store 
robberies in the county over the past two years. Most of the cases have 
involved the robbery of valuable computer chips, some of them valued up to 
$1,000 each.  
</P>
<P>
 In early March, three to five armed men took thousands of dollars in computer 
memory chips and other electronic components from Shecom Computers in Yorba 
Linda, a wholesaler of computer components. 
</P>
<P>
 Three similar robberies occurred in Brea between Feb. 1, 1993 and Feb. 16 this 
year. In December, armed men stole thousands of dollars worth of computer chips 
from an Irvine computer store. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Thursday's robbery does not seem to fit the pattern of the others, 
Brea Detective Clyde A. Wason said. For one thing, he said, Alston 
Entertainment specializes in family and children's computer games. And although 
it also sells computers, he said, "it doesn't have chips (for sale) to the 
degree the other businesses carry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea Police Department is asking anyone with information on the robbery to 
call (714) 990-7625. FERNANDO ROMERO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SILVA USES SAVINGS TO FUND ELECTION BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an eleventh-hour scramble in his bid for a seat on the Board of 
Supervisors, Huntington Beach Councilman Jim Silva has dipped into his family 
savings for a $30,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
 With only a weekend remaining before Election Day, Silva said Friday the loan 
was necessary to "defend myself against attack mail" being circulated by 
opponents, specifically Huntington Beach businesswoman Haydee V. Tillotson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tillotson campaign in its recent mailings to the North County district has 
sought to portray Silva as having supported tax increases as a Huntington Beach 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and kids have been devastated by these attacks," Silva said. "We 
talked it over and decided to use the (family's) money. Certainly, this will 
financially affect my wife, Connie, and I for some years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said his campaign has already spent the money to pay for recent 
mailings, one of which highlights Tillotson's ties to retiring Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder, who made a much-publicized break with the Republican Party 
to support President Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
 Silva's mailing also makes reference to another opponent, Huntington Beach 
Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson, and her affiliation with the Democratic Party, a 
minority political organization in Republican-dominated Orange County. In a 
separate mailer, Silva claims he is the only supervisor candidate working to 
"stop our tax dollars from going to illegal aliens." 
</P>
<P>
 "When we realized what was happening in the mail, we just had to fight back," 
Silva said. "We had to provide a response." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher D. St. Hilaire, Tillotson's campaign manager, said Silva's recent 
cash infusion was an offensive -- not defensive -- tactic, decided well before 
Tillotson's mailer appeared on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's desperate," St. Hilaire said Friday. "It's the last act of a 
dying candidate. I don't think the money is enough to get him into a runoff." 
</P>
<P>
 With five candidates in the hotly contested race, it is likely that Tuesday's 
primary will force a runoff between the two highest vote getters. The other 
candidates in the race are Huntington Beach businessman John A. Thomas and 
former Garden Grove Councilman Raymond Thomas Littrell. 
</P>
<P>
 All but Littrell have committed considerable amounts of the money to the race. 
Silva has struggled to keep up financially in a race where Tillotson has set 
the fund-raising pace, loaning her own campaign $342,000. In the past, Silva 
has criticized Tillotson for making large loans to herself, saying she is 
trying to "buy the election." 
</P>
<P>
 According to campaign reports filed last week with the county registrar's 
office, Silva reported having only $5,142 remaining.KEVIN JOHNSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; NEW RECREATION CENTER SET TO OPEN JUNE 
20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With nothing in her new office but the smell of fresh paint and a plastic 
child's chair, Tracy Engel is already hard at work in her new job as recreation 
supervisor for the just-completed Rancho Santa Susana Community Center in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be spending much time at my desk anyway," Engel said, walking across 
the glossy floor of the 11,686-square-foot gymnasium. "We'll have something 
going on in every room. That will require us to be up and about all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Engel officially starts her new job Monday. Her first action will be to get 
ready for a public dedication of the facility on June 18, with an open house 
that will include games, prizes and clowns. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 20, the center officially opens with summer classes in dance, crafts 
and sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, Engel worked for the 
Conejo Valley Recreation and Park District for 10 years, most recently as 
program coordinator of the teen center. 
</P>
<P>
 Park district Administrator Jeff Anderson said Engel was selected from a pool 
of 55 candidates for the position. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his nervousness about opening the vast new facility had almost 
vanished after Engel agreed to take the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been sleeping a lot better lately," Anderson said. "She's been in 
centers for 10 years, she's got more experience than we do. We've never run a 
center like this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Engel, a resident of Moorpark, studied recreation administration at Chico 
State. Her pride in the new center was obvious on a recent tour of the gray 
stone facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the gymnasium, which can accommodate three basketball games 
simultaneously, the center has a catering kitchen, circular dance studio, 
locker rooms and two large multipurpose rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Engel said the district hopes to rent out the multipurpose rooms for wedding 
receptions and parties. 
</P>
<P>
 She said several brides had already reserved the space for summer weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing out warming trays, rows of industrial-sized refrigerators and an ice 
machine in the center's catering kitchen, she said the center could handle any 
size group, from 10 to 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no limit to what we can do," she said. "We're set up to handle just 
about everything." 
</P>
<P>
 But recreation is still the focus of the center. Looking out at the smooth 
expanse of floor in the gymnasium, Engel turned to Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get a ball down here," she told him. MARY F. POLS

<P>
 A staff member with the Orange County Community Development Council has 
received an award from a statewide group that is working to end hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Jewell, the council's summer lunch outreach coordinator, was honored 
with the "Hunger Fighter Award" by the California Hunger Action Coalition.The 
group praised Jewell for her "dedication, service and deep personal commitment 
to the effort to end hunger in California." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years Jewell has been coordinating efforts in the county to 
bring free lunches to poor children in the summer, when school is out. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture pays for the Summer Food Service Program. 
Since 1991, Jewell has worked with school districts, cities and churches in the 
county to find ways to distribute food to needy children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Community Development Council said that because of Jewell's 
work, 346,652 free meals were served to needy children in the county last 
summer. The number of children helped is expected to increase this summer, 
council officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Community Development Council is private charity based in 
Garden Grove. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; GROUP TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT GAMBLING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An organization that last year successfully opposed a proposal for card club 
gambling at Los Alamitos Race Course is continuing to work as a "watchdog 
organization against any expansion of gambling," officials announced recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, Cypress Citizens Against Card Clubs, successfully worked 
against Measure A last year.That initiative would have allowed operation of a 
card club at the race course. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign for the card club was heavily financed by the pro-gambling 
interests and was trounced at the polls last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Keenan, a spokesman for Cypress Citizens Against Card Clubs, said that the 
organization is remaining vigilant against expanded gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan said the group is marking June 8 this year as a "victory anniversary."  
</P>
<P>
 "We still think there are dangers (for possible expanded gambling) from such 
things as video poker," he said. "Our organization is going to continue, and 
we'll be endorsing candidates for the City Council in the November election." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the defeat of the card club proposal last year shows that 
rank-and-file residents of Cypress are opposed to any forms of expanded 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Members of our organization will be active in city elections, and we'll be 
appearing before and speaking to meetings of the City Council," Keenan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan said about 250 volunteers worked for Cypress Citizens Against Card 
Clubs during its battle against Measure A last year. BILL BILLITER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; STATE PANEL APPROVES CALTRANS YARD PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $2.1-million Caltrans maintenance yard to be built at the east end of 
Moorpark has been approved by the California Transportation Commission, which 
holds the authority over distribution of funds for Caltrans projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-acre yard, to be built on Fitch Avenue, was made possible by a 
complicated land swap among the California Department of Transportation, the 
city of Moorpark and a local developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans had planned to build the yard on Los Angeles Avenue at the junction 
with the Moorpark Freeway to replace a small yard that officials said is 
outdated. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorpark officials complained that the new site would conflict with a 
regional mall planned for the area, and would give drivers an unsightly first 
impression of the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a key location for the city," Mayor Paul Lawrason said. "The yard would 
have been totally inappropriate at the entrance of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark attorneys took Caltrans to court to stop construction of the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative site on Fitch Avenue was found, and the city worked out a land 
swap with the developer. 
</P>
<P>
 The land exchange will be done at no cost to the city, Lawrason said. 
Construction of the maintenance yard is scheduled to begin in October.SCOTT

Ventura, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commencement ceremonies for the graduates, who attended four years of night 
classes at campuses in Ventura and Santa Barbara, were scheduled today at the 
Santa Barbara County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Keynote speaker for the Saturday ceremony will be Arleigh M. Woods, presiding 
justice for the California Court of Appeal, 2nd Appellate District in Los

</P>
<P>
 All will take the State Bar of California exam in July, said Stan Pulle, dean 
of the law school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should all do quite well," Pulle said. "Students who have completed four 
years at the school have passed the bar exam with a 75% success rate," he said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN IS IN THE WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city soon may be asking developers to devote as much as 20% of future 
projects to affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The new affordable housing plan, which was reviewed by the City Council this 
week, is voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal relies on incentives such as density bonuses to entice builders 
to meet the 20% goal for projects involving more than 10 units. Density bonuses 
would, among other things, allow developers to construct more units than 
permitted by zoning codes in exchange for including affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Affordable housing is a "decent quality dwelling" that a person can afford to 
rent or buy without spending more than 30% of their income, according to a city 
staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 For Orange County, a family of four earning the median income of $52,700 
should pay no more than $1,317 a month for housing, according to city figures. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are hoping their affordable housing plan will be of particular 
benefit to seniors, disabled people, single-parent households, large families 
and homeless people -- all of whom are in crucial need of affordable shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, about two-thirds of the 4,000 single-parent households in Orange 
pay more than 30% for housing costs. And an estimated 8,600 low-income city 
residents spend more than 30% of their incomes on housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission is expected to consider the affordable-housing 
proposal at a public hearing sometime this summer.MARTIN MILLER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SEA LIONS' DEATHS PART OF NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite several reports of dead sea mammals washing ashore in the Ventura area 
in recent weeks, officials said Friday that the deaths are not the result of 
any unusual conditions or foul play. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, area officials attribute the apparent rise in deaths to something 
more powerful -- nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "This appears to be part of the natural fluctuation that we have here every 
year," said Mia Frost, manager of animal regulation for Ventura County. "If 
there was something abnormal going on, we would notice it right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Area lifeguards have reported that an unusual number of the dead animals have 
washed ashore over the past several weeks. They said they have found 10 to 12 
dead sea lions in the past week -- the amount they would normally find over a 
period of months. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seem to be a lot more sea lions than we're used to, both alive offshore 
and dead on the beach," said Steve White, state lifeguard supervisor. "We've 
had a lot of people coming up to our lifeguards and asking what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, whose agency helps collect the dead animals, said the deaths have all 
been easily explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are normal things -- injuries, shark wounds or sickness," she said. 
"Sea lions die like anything else." MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NURSES LOSE RULING IN PACT DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine months and 28 meetings of contract talks gave Ventura County the right to 
impose an unwanted pay and benefits package on its nurses, a Superior Court 
judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to the court that after nine months . . . the county was justified 
in breaking off negotiations," Judge Richard D. Aldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision frustrated Ventura County Medical Center nurses, who have 
threatened to strike if the compensation dispute is not resolved. Nurses will 
meet next week to discuss their next step. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it depends on whether the county will come back to the bargaining 
table and bargain with us," said Don Nielson, attorney for the California 
Nurses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they don't expect to rush back into negotiations, which 
were stalled for most of the past year. "I think there will be a cooling-off 
period for the next few weeks," said LeRoy Smith, assistant county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by the negotiations impasse, the County Board of Supervisors 
imposed a compensation package on the nurses two months ago. The nurses union 
sued, arguing that the county had not negotiated in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were saying to the union the only contract you can agree to is one that 
gives the county complete discretion," said Thomas M. Sharpe, a Fresno lawyer 
representing the union. 
</P>
<P>
 When the nurses did not agree, the county imposed an agreement that essential 
"emasculated" the union, Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have excluded the union from participation in issues which the union has 
a right to negotiate on," he said. The pay agreement leaves administrators with 
discretion on scheduling and wage issues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith denied that charge and said the county had tried mediation and repeated 
meetings to reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Friday's hearing began, the nurses and the county settled one of the 
issues contention: whether nurses can strike. In a compromise measure, both 
sides agreed that the nurses should provide three days notice of any strike 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the three days would give them enough time to try to 
block a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get the 72 hours notice, we'll still go back and seek an injunction to 
prevent the strike," Smith said. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

 Mighty Morphin Chili, Firestarters and Margaritaville are among the 30 teams 
entered in the El Camino Real Championship Chili Cookoff scheduled for 11 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. Sunday in Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10,000 people are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with chili tasting and judging, the 10th annual charity event will 
feature live country music by Western Union, line dancing lessons, Miss Chili 
Pepper and Mr. Hot Legs "beauty and brawn" contests, and a variety of food and 
beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be a chili pepper eating contest "for anyone who is foolish 
enough to eat as many chili peppers as they can," according to Melissa O'Neal, 
a city recreation supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The street is going to be packed," O'Neal predicted. "It's a fun, fun day." 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds will support TAFFY (Tustin Acting for Families and Youth), a 
partnership of public and private agencies dedicated to improving opportunities 
for local children. Members of TAFFY include the Tustin Unified School 
District, the city of Tustin, Orange Parents and Children Together, and the 
Boys & Girls Club of Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous chili cook-offs have raised up to $7,500 for local charities, 
according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The cook-off will be on El Camino Real (which will be closed to vehicular 
traffic) between Main and 3rd streets. Additional information is available from 
the city of Tustin Community Services Department at (714) 573-3326. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; CAPIZZI BACKING OF RECALL TARGETS DECRIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A director of the Westminster Firefighters Assn. on Friday assailed Dist. 
Atty. Michael R. Capizzi for his support of four city officials who are facing 
a recall election on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garrison said that Capizzi has shown a lack of knowledge about the 
situation in supporting Mayor Charles V. Smith and the other recall targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the leading law enforcement officer in Orange County, it was appalling to 
see you reduce the office of district attorney to nothing more than a political 
puppet show," Garrison said in a letter sent to Capizzi Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison was reacting to a letter Capizzi sent last week to residents 
endorsing Smith and council members Craig Schweisinger, Charmayne S. Bohman and 
Tony Lam. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters union is leading the recall drive stemming from last year's 
$900,000 in cuts in the Fire Department's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi said Thursday that the recall is ill-advised and an abuse of the 
recall process because the council members, in approving the cuts last year to 
balance the city budget, were performing "the duty we expect of all elected 
officials." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that while an investigation found insufficient evidence to prove 
criminal wrongdoing, city firefighters have engaged in payroll practices that 
were neither in the best interest of the city nor morally defensible. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garrison argued in his letter to Capizzi that the overtime practices at 
the Fire Department have been approved by the council. He added that during the 
district attorney's investigation, the firefighters volunteered to be 
interviewed and to provide documents to prove their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators refused to act on the offer, Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Smith, Schweisinger, Bohman, Lam and their supporters will hold a 
rally today at the Westminster Center, a shopping center at the corner of 
Golden West Street and Westminster Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief James Cook and Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. are expected to 
speak at the 10 a.m. rally. Also expected to attend are officials of the 
Municipal Employees Assn. and the Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters union and its supporters have also scheduled a precinct walk 
at 10 a.m. today. BERT ELJERA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; TAKASUGI DEFENDS RECORD IN OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) on Friday defended his legislative record 
in the wake of accusations by Dorothy Maron, a Democrat and former member of 
the Oxnard City Council who is seeking the 37th Assembly District seat, that he 
has little to show for his term in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't seem to have the foggiest idea about what goes on up in 
Sacramento," Takasugi said."All she has to do is look at my legislative 
record." 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi said he has earned a reputation for integrity among other lawmakers 
in the state Capitol and that he is considered a consensus-builder on 
bipartisan issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Maron made the charges Thursday while officially launching her bid to 
challenge incumbent Takasugi in the general election. She is running unopposed 
Tuesday in the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi is running unopposed Tuesday in the Republican primary in the 37th 
District, which covers most of Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Port Hueneme and 
Oxnard. He was elected to the Assembly in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a heavy part in adopting six pieces of legislation," he said in an 
interview Friday. "I helped reform workers' compensation, and in my own bills I 
addressed crime issues, education issues and business recovery issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was also very instrumental, I feel, in helping to get last year's budget 
out on time," he added. "That was the first time in seven years that this was 
done." MARY F. POLS

<P>
 Undercover narcotics detectives seized about $20,000 worth of heroin and 
cocaine and arrested two Oxnard residents for allegedly selling drugs at a 
shopping center in Oxnard, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Fernandez Ochoa, 23, was being held on $50,000 bail at Ventura County 
Jail Friday on suspicion of several drug violations.He is scheduled to be 
arraigned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old youth was also arrested and is being held at Juvenile Hall 
pending a court hearing. His identity was withheld because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said undercover deputies with the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department and Oxnard police officers arrested the pair about 11:30 a.m. 
Thursday in a shopping center at Pleasant Valley Road and Rose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Narcotics detectives had purchased drugs from the pair several times in a 
month, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 After investigators arrested the two, they also searched Ochoa's house in the 
4800 block of Olds Road and found cocaine, heroin and $2,800 in cash, 
authorities said. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; AGENCY URGED TO SUE OVER OIL SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alleging that Berry Petroleum's failure to properly maintain a pipeline caused 
an 85,000-gallon oil spill near Oxnard in December, staff members of the state 
Water Quality Control Board have recommended that the agency file suit against 
the oil company. 
</P>
<P>
 The water board staff will ask its nine-member board to refer the evidence to 
the state attorney general's office and to join a lawsuit against Berry being 
filed by the state Department of Fish and Game, said Robert Ghirelli, water 
board executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board votes to join the two lawsuits, Berry could be subject to nearly 
$2 million in fines, penalties and administrative costs, Ghirelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Taft-based oil company did not return phone calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Christmas Day, crew members with the federal Minerals Management Service 
spotted a small slick of oil on the ocean that was trailing off McGrath Lake 
near Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe an oil transfer line designed to move oil from Berry's 
Gonzales Road production fields to holding tanks across Harbor Boulevard near 
the lake failed, allowing an estimated 85,000 gallons of crude oil to spill 
into the lake and onto the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghirelli said the water board will consider the matter at its June 13 meeting 
in Glendale. J.E. MITCHELL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; STUDENT ARTISTS WIN SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cyndee Axtell, a junior at Laguna Hills High School who had never taken an art 
class before this year, has been recognized by the Niguel Art Assn. as an 
outstanding student artist. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her works of art hangs in a Dana Point art gallery after it won first 
place in the association's annual scholarship competition last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The association awarded Cyndee, 17, $700 for her realistic watercolor 
portrait. The portrait depicts a woman wading across a river as a sleeping baby 
rests on her back. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-place winner, who received $500, was Dana Hills High senior David 
Layne, who took top prize in last year's competition. The third-place prize of 
$300 went to Laguna Hills High student Adam Franks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their work is really good," said Larry Barber, the association's scholarship 
chairman. The scholarships are meant to encourage young artists to continue 
their creative expression, which association members say teen-agers often 
suppress so that they may devote attention to academic subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners' artworks were chosen from 53 entries and are on display until 
June 17 at the association's gallery at 24981 Dana Point Harbor Drive. The 
gallery is open Wednesdays and Thursdays from noon until 6 p.m. and from noon 
to 8 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER AUTO CLUB EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday is scheduled to consider the Automobile Club of 
Southern California's proposal to more than double its office at 3333 Fairview 
Road to just under 1 million square feet.  
</P>
<P>
 The auto club is asking for a change in the city's general plan -- the 
document that establishes planning goals -- to add a half-million square feet 
of office space to the 30-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion has been opposed by residents who say the resulting increase in 
density -- the amount of floor space on an acre of land -- will set a bad 
example for other landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission approved the plan on May 23 despite some strong 
opposition during more than two hours of public testimony. Nearby homeowners 
said they fear crowded streets and clogged city services. Many asked where the 
new AAA workers would live. 
</P>
<P>
 But for every person who spoke against the project, there was another who 
supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent analysis performed for the city said the AAA expansion would 
generate more than $150,000 yearly in new fees to the city. That comes mostly 
from property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,135-employee business is now credited with bringing in about $2.3 
million of business activity to the city. If the development project is 
approved, AAA plans to increase its payroll to 2,509 employees, which would 
generate about $4.5 million yearly in retail sales, services and hotel stays.  
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners Walter Davenport, John Palme and Libby Cowan approved the 
program. Davenport said he believes it would give an economic kick to the city 
without hurting residents. But commissioner Mark Korando opposed the project. 
He said he agrees with residents that it will pave the way for other 
high-density developments. WILLSON CUMMER

MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN ASSAULT ON DOG; COURTS: HE IS CHARGED WITH 2 FELONY 
COUNTS OF ANIMAL CRUELTY AFTER A FOUNTAIN VALLEY NEIGHBOR TURNED IN A VIDEOTAPE 
OF HIM BEATING THE COLLIE. 
</P>

<P>
 A Fountain Valley man pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that he taped his 
collie's mouth shut and then beat the dog with a garden tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Eugene Griffith Jr., 36, was arrested on May 6 after a neighbor 
videotaped the assault of the family's 1-year-old dog, and gave the tape to 
police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The collie, named Jazzy, was taken into protective custody after hundreds of 
outraged people called police. The dog is still at the Orange County Animal 
Control shelter in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief hearing Friday morning before Municipal Judge Martin G. Engquist 
in Westminster, Griffith and his attorney, Mark N. Phillips, rushed from court 
and declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith, charged with two felony counts of cruelty to an animal, faces a 
maximum sentence of three years in state prison and up to a $20,000 fine for 
each count, said James W. Hicks, deputy district attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 A pretrial conference is scheduled for July 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the tape shows Griffith kicking the dog, throwing rocks at her and 
beating her with a gardening tool in the back yard of his home in the 10900 
block of La Carta Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley Police Sgt. Dann Bean said Friday that in the videotape, which 
has not been released, it appears that Griffith hit the dog with the wooden 
handle of a tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might have been a spade or weeder," Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Griffith is being charged for two incidents, on April 15 and 16. 
The tape was taken on April 16.  
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said that the videotape shows beatings taking place at various times of 
the day. It was "not just one episode," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The videotape speaks for itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith was arrested at a Huntington Beach insurance company, where he works. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean said that the dog is in "great shape" and that Hicks and Griffith's 
attorney are working on finding a home for Jazzy. The dog might be placed with 
a breeder, who expressed early interest in temporarily caring for the dog and 
has the proper facility, Bean said. More than 300 people have offered to adopt 
the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision about Jazzy's future rests with the court or the Animal 
Assistance League of Orange County Inc., which is working with Animal Control 
officials on a recommendation, Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said his office is taking the case seriously and is surprised by the 
hundreds of letters it has received from angry people. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean also said the Police Department has received about a dozen letters and 
the same amount of phone calls, some from people across the country.

STATE SAYS SIMI VALLEY SOIL IS STABLE; GEOLOGY: SOME FRUSTRATED HOMEOWNERS CALL 
POST-EARTHQUAKE REPORT A FARCE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EVALUATE INDIVIDUAL LOTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite the continued settling of some topsoil in Simi Valley since the Jan. 
17 earthquake, the California state geologist reported Friday that the earth 
underneath has stopped shifting and most homeowners can plan to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, said some homeowners, who described ever-widening cracks in their 
walls and floors and called the state report a farce because it did not 
evaluate the soil conditions on individual lots. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mayor Greg Stratton said the report revealed unsettled soil conditions 
that could restrict rebuilding in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Conservation spent three months and $72,089 in federal 
disaster money to prepare the soil-stability report, which city officials 
commissioned under pressure from homeowners in the worst-hit part of town. 
</P>
<P>
 But a half-dozen homeowners said they did not like what they heard Friday at 
City Hall from state geologist Jim Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would my doors be popping off their hinges and my house be showing 
evidence it's still moving?" demanded Rich Dietrich, who was forced to move out 
of his fractured home on Sabina Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll have to ask an engineer that," Davis replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Hernandez said the foundation of his house on Sabina Circle is split 
nearly in two by an ever-deepening fissure that left his floors on a slant. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this today was a free circus," he said after hearing the report. 
"Ringling Bros. charge for admission. (State officials) don't charge, but the 
ringmaster's right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaking his head, Dietrich said later, "There is definitely evidence that my 
house is moving, and they're telling me it's not." 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to move out by the cracks in his floor and walls, Dietrich said he is 
unsure whether he will rebuild. His $170,000 insurance settlement won't pay the 
full cost of rebuilding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, one of the regions hardest hit by the quake, it was the 
violent shaking, not ground failure such as fissures, that caused much of the 
damage, Davis reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaking nearly rivaled the full force of gravity, temporarily liquefying 
the loose, sandy soil in the city's southeastern section, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground water just five to 35 feet beneath the earth's surface boiled up out of 
the earth, allowing the sandy soil to compact and settle to a lower level than 
before the quake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the worst damage and most obvious liquefaction occurred at the eastern 
end of Los Angeles Avenue around the intersection of Christine Avenue and Hope 
Street, where ancient creek beds feeding the Arroyo Simi had been filled in and 
built over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after surveying markers that were pounded into the pavement in that area 
over a two-week period in May and reviewing maps of the underground topography, 
geologists concluded that the earth has stopped shifting, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The edges of the fissures are still collapsing, which may allow settling of 
the surface in some places, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 But fissures such as these will not develop again until the next severe 
earthquake, Davis said. Chances of one happening in the next 50 years are only 
10%, and the region could go another 500 years without one, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are estimates, of course," he concluded. "There is no guarantee that 
Mother Nature is promising it will not happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Stratton said the city probably will require many homeowners to pay for 
individual soil studies before they obtain permission to rebuild on their lots. 
</P>
<P>
 That news angered homeowners who were uninsured or had no luck getting federal 
aid to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Dora Washington said columns on her house are still sinking and twisting in 
the aftershocks. Nevertheless, she said, the Small Business Administration 
denied her application for a rebuilding loan. 
</P>
<P>
 She said of the study: "I don't think it's adequate. I think the city should 
pay for (individual) engineering studies." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said the city will not pay for such studies because they are commonly 
required for building permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's a function of finding what exactly is beneath your home," he told 
the group. "Now it's the responsibility of the individual homeowners through 
FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) and Small Business 
(Administration) to get those studies done."

MOTORIST KILLED IN CRASH NEAR CEMETERY 
</P>

<P>
 An 83-year-old Ventura man was killed Friday when his car collided with an 
armored truck just as he was leaving a cemetery after visiting the grave of his 
wife, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man had not been identified late Friday, pending notification of 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 His Ford sedan was struck on the side by the truck at 4:48 p.m. apparently as 
he was making a left turn from Ivy Lawn Memorial Park at 5400 Valentine Road in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Sgt. Bob Velez said the driver of the armored vehicle, owned by 
Armored Transport of California Inc., was traveling within the speed limit and 
not considered to be at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck driver "attempted to make evasive moves," Velez said, pointing to 
skid marks curving away from the entrance to the cemetery. The truck was 
slightly damaged with two flat tires and a dented front end. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the accident pushed the victim's car about 40 feet before it 
came to rest against the metal fence separating the Ventura Freeway from 
Valentine Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The man apparently died instantly from massive head injuries, Velez said. But 
the coroner will investigate whether a heart attack could have caused the 
driver to stray into the path of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 A policeman said several rakes and garden tools in the trunk of the man's car 
initially led them to believe that he was a landscaper. 
</P>
<P>
 But two women who witnessed the accident told police that the man had 
faithfully visited his wife's grave every week since her death two years ago. 
He had used the garden tools to manicure the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The three armed guards in the truck were not injured. They remained in their 
vehicle until another armored truck arrived to move their cargo. A spokesman 
for Armored Transport said the truck was carrying money from Ventura to Los 
Angeles at the time of the accident.

ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 1C; $10 MILLION FOR IMPROVEMENTS AT 3 COLLEGES DEPENDS 
ON VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER and JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although voters may not realize it from reading their ballot materials, 
Ventura County's three community colleges have an estimated $10 million in 
construction projects at stake in a little-known measure in Tuesday's state 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1C, a $900-million higher education bond issue, would fund several 
local projects, including drawings for Moorpark College's planned improvements 
to its science and math building, equipment for Oxnard College's letters and 
science facility, and preliminary blueprints for renovations to Ventura 
College's math and science building. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the proposition doesn't pass, it would move those projects back," said 
Barbara Buttner of the Ventura County Community College District. "We would 
have to come back again with another bond issue" in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The district would receive about $827,000 for the three capital improvement 
projects if the initiative passes. But more than a dozen additional projects on 
the district's $10-million capital improvement plan could be speeded up if the 
measure is approved, Buttner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone in the three-campus district supports Proposition 1C. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Gregory Cole said California cannot afford to spend $900 million it 
doesn't have at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the state has too much indebtedness already," said Cole, who announced 
earlier this year that he would not seek reelection to the governing board in 
November. "We can wait on our facilities for a year or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Putnam, the district's director of facility planning, said the 
initiative's failure would set back the improvement and renovation timetable by 
up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would hurt us a lot because we would basically be vacating a building that 
is set up for a science building now," he said, referring to the Oxnard science 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to let a brand new building sit there, but I don't know where 
we'd get the money from," Putnam said. "If you stop the (renovation) cycle, 
you're looking at five years before you could have a building on line again." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition's local impact remains unknown to many voters because state 
election materials for such bond measures do not detail specific projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the act that has the most direct potential impact on Cal State 
Northridge. But I would not say there's general public awareness of the 
impact," said Blenda J. Wilson, president of Cal State Northridge.  
</P>
<P>
 If passed by a majority of voters, Proposition 1C would fund most of the 
planned construction and renovation projects at the state's 136 University of 
California, Cal State and community college campuses during the next two years. 
If defeated, state officials said, some projects might proceed with other 
funds, but most would be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 David Laveille, director of institutional relations for the Cal State system, 
said there would be no immediate money from Proposition 1C earmarked for the 
Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge or for the separate Cal State campus 
planned for Ventura County. But if all of the funds are not spent on projects 
at the main campus, some funding may become available for the satellite 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Northridge campus would be in line for $21.6 million for a new plant 
to centralize heating and cooling for campus buildings and upgrade other 
utilities, nearly $3.6 million to equip the engineering building addition, and 
nearly $2.1 million for the seismic strengthening of the Sierra Tower classroom 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the state's three public higher education systems are selling the 
measure as an educational investment necessary to help support a comeback of 
the state's economy. Most of the funded projects statewide involve seismic 
strengthening, modernizations and legal mandates such as disabled access, 
though some new construction is included. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike local general obligation bond measures, state propositions do not 
translate into local property tax hikes. Instead, the bonds issued for the 
projects are repaid from the state's general fund, typically over a 20- to 
30-year period. If passed, Proposition 1C annually would drain an average of 
about $64 million from the state budget, less than $2 per state resident. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, endorsed by Gov. Pete Wilson, was placed on the ballot by the 
Legislature and has little organized opposition. But college and university 
officials expect the outcome to be close either way, and worry that 
recession-weary Californians may not be in a spending mood, especially in 
Southern California after the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In a May 21-25 statewide survey of likely voters, the Los Angeles Times Poll 
found 72% did not know enough about the measure to offer an opinion. But when 
read a summary, 53% favored the measure, 35% opposed it and 12% were undecided. 
An earlier statewide Field Poll showed 47% in favor and 43% opposed, with 9% of 
likely voters undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 For education supporters, the good news is that California voters have 
approved the past seven consecutive school bond measures and four of the five 
higher education bond measures on the state ballot since 1986. The bad news is 
the share of voters favoring such measures has fallen from above 60% to just a 
bare majority in recent state elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, complicating next week's contest are three other huge state bond 
measures: $2 billion for earthquake relief, $1 billion for elementary and 
secondary schools and nearly $2 billion for parks and recreation. The total of 
the four measures, $5.9 billion, is the state's largest ever for an election, 
and not all are expected to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the state has increasingly relied on such bond measure to finance 
public projects, their passage in recent years has led to a steadily increasing 
level of bond debt draining the state's general fund. That amount was projected 
to hit 5% this year and rise to above 6% if all four measures pass, more than 
double the level from 1990.

ELECTIONS / ABSENTEE BALLOTS; DECLINE IN REQUESTS REFLECTS DECLINE IN INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The number of Ventura County voters requesting absentee ballots has dropped 
for Tuesday's primary election, reversing a 16-year trend toward more voting by 
mail and indicating low voter interest, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 34,500 voters have requested absentee ballots and, even though 1,000 
more may go out before the election, the total would still fall short of the 
last primary in June, 1992, county elections chief Bruce Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that election, 36,332 people requested absentee ballots, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley also said at a press conference that about 38% of the county's 339,356 
registered voters are expected to cast ballots in the June 7 primary, a figure 
comparable with past non-presidential primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley and County Clerk Richard D. Dean said they are not sure why fewer 
voters are requesting absentee ballots. But Bradley said it mirrors a trend 
statewide and both blamed voter apathy and a lack of compelling ballot 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure we have any burning issues this time," Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the governor's primary, Tuesday's elections include state races for 
insurance commissioner, superintendent of schools and secretary of state. Races 
of local interest include two east county supervisorial contests and a costly 
Superior Court race. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are no controversial propositions, such as the school-voucher 
initiative or high-tax proposals, to motivate voters, Dean said. And 
Republicans may feel Gov. Pete Wilson will easily win renomination, while 
Democratic voters are not too excited with their choices, Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What brings out voters are hot measures and gubernatorial candidates," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Partisans had their own analysis for why absentee ballot requests have 
decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago in the November general election, when the county issued a 
record 57,458 absentee ballots, the country "was in a mess," said Hank Starr, 
chairman of the county Democratic Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy was sluggish, crime was rampant and parents everywhere were 
dissatisfied with the public education system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's reforms have not been enacted, and people are not sure 
what to think about all the pending changes, Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So there is a sense of 'Let's sit this one out and wait and see what 
happens,' " Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr blamed the drop in absentee ballot requests on a decrease in registered 
Republican voters over the last five months. The Republicans have lost more 
than 2,000 voters countywide since January, while the Democrats have picked up 
93. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have traditionally been a stronghold of absentee voting, Starr 
said. But Bob Larkin, the GOP county Central Committee chairman, said the 
numbers are misleading because his party's push to register absentee voters 
will not start until summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Larkin had a more philosophical reason for why requests for absentee ballots 
have dropped. He called voting-by-mail a fad that is falling out of favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something almost mystical about going to the polls, seeing your 
friends' and neighbors' faces and closing the curtain behind you to vote," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like Communion," said Larkin, who is Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, county officials were not expecting the drop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have three fat boxes of postcards we intended to send to people, so I was 
surprised," Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting by mail has increased dramatically since 1976, when looser restrictions 
first allowed voting from home even if going to the polls was not a hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of absentee voters steadily climbed with each major election 
until it reached a record high with the general election of 1992. Since then, 
absentee ballot requests have dropped 26%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said that Tuesday's 38% voter turnout is slightly below the statewide 
projection of 39.8%. But it is well within the range of the last two 
gubernatorial primaries, Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were slightly behind the state (in those elections), and we think we will 
be this time, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The polls at 404 county precincts will open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. The

ORANGE COUNCIL REVIEWS 65 WORKS PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week reviewed 74 construction projects valued at nearly 
$24 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are public works projects designed to improve the city's sewer system, 
repair streets or improve traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Works Department requested approval of more than 65 projects, which 
would account for a majority of the city's capital improvement money. 
</P>
<P>
 One proposal is to widen Santiago Canyon Road between Windes Drive and Newport 
Boulevard at a cost of $1.5 million. Another proposal calls for $3.4 million to 
improve traffic flow at the Main Street and La Veta intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Two proposals would require changes in the city's general charter, city 
officials said. The first is a $1.4-million plan to buy county land for a new 
library. The second is an $80,000 proposal for design work to help improve 
response time at a fire station. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, city departments submitted proposals for 95 projects, but the city did 
not have money for all, officials said. The city staff recommended delaying 21 
projects, valued at $3.2 million, including replacing the city's main-frame 
computer and upgrading the police dispatch system. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will vote on the proposed projects June 14 after a public hearing 
at 7 p.m.

SLEEPING TEEN HIT BY PELLETS SHOT AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sleeping 17-year-old was injured Friday morning when someone fired several 
pellets through her bedroom window, a Sheriff's Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, whose name was not released, was taken to Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where four pellets were removed from 
her buttocks.Her injuries are not life-threatening, Lt. Tom Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 2 a.m. in the victim's family home in the 26000 
block of Carmenita Lane in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have something like this occur in that area is very unusual," Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pellets apparently came from a small-gauge shotgun and are similar to 
buckshot, which is used to shoot deer and other large game, Garner said. He did 
not know if the window had been open or if the attacker was on foot or in a 
car.  
</P>
<P>
 The shooting appears to be random, and authorities said there is no indication 
that it is gang related. The victim told authorities that no one would have any 
reason to harm her or her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "To our knowledge, they had not been threatened," Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no witnesses to the shooting and investigators have few leads, 
Garner said. Anyone with information is asked to call the south investigations 
unit of the Sheriff's Department at (714) 249-5221.SHOOTINGS

POP MUSIC REVIEW; FOUND: ONE VOICE, NEW VISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Talk about surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Who ever figured Barbra Streisand as David Letterman? 
</P>
<P>
 In a jab at conspiracy theorists who speculated that laryngitis wasn't the 
real reason she postponed the first four of her six shows at the Pond of 
Anaheim, Streisand came up Thursday night with a good-natured Top 10 list. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her sarcastic reasons for postponing the shows until next month: 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 -- "I've always wanted to spend four hot, muggy days in Anaheim in the 
middle of July." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 7 -- "I had to stay home and wait for the cable guy." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 -- "They were having a shoe sale at Nordstrom." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 -- "Every time I started to drive here, I got sidetracked and went to 
Disneyland instead." (See F10 for full list) 
</P>
<P>
 The sequence, which came early in the two-hour performance, was typical of the 
surprises that have made Streisand's first concert tour in almost three decades 
such a disarming and revealing affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironic, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand, the most acclaimed pop singer of her generation, spends virtually 
her entire professional life closed up in recording studios and/or on 
soundstages so that she can make sure the final product comes as close as 
possible to her perfectionist instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then she finally returns to the concert stage, where she has to simply be 
herself each night, and ends up with what is arguably the most fulfilling and 
rewarding accomplishment of her career: a show that is as warm and engaging as 
it is stylish and smart. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about drama. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hard to tell Thursday who was the most nervous: the singer or her fans, 
which included such celebrities as producer Ray Stark, tennis pro Andre Agassi 
and former U.S. Sen. Gary Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Watts, 42, had been worried all day that Streisand would have a 
relapse and cancel the show . . . or decide after a few songs that her voice 
wasn't perfect and then stop the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My girlfriend and I are from Denver and we just have tickets for tonight," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denver?" another woman said, overhearing the conversation. "We came from 
Buffalo, N.Y., because my sister who lives out here got tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 The answers about the state of The Voice came quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as she stepped through the curtain of the living room set, Streisand 
began singing a customized version of "As If We Never Said Goodbye" from 
"Sunset Boulevard" -- and the voice sounded full and rich. 
</P>
<P>
 There were points in the show when Streisand's voice, backed by a 64-piece 
orchestra conducted by Marvin Hamlisch, sounded a tad husky, but it responded 
marvelously during the evening's most demanding passages. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the singing alone isn't what has made this tour such a commanding affair. 
The chief strength is Streisand's creative vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than a safe, sure-to-please "greatest hits" parade, Streisand chose 
songs purposefully -- sidestepping signature numbers, in some cases, to make 
room for compositions that enabled her to reflect on matters ranging from 
relationships to social concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 It all came together so marvelously in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve at the MGM 
Grand Garden arena that most performers would have stuck by the same script as 
they took to the road. 
</P>
<P>
 But Streisand has rethought and reshaped the production each step of the way, 
making changes both subtle and fundamental. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half of the show -- employing a trilevel set resembling the living 
room of a Colonial mansion -- remained focused on her childhood daydreams, 
including scenes of Marlon Brando projected on an overhead screen as she 
explains that he was her first show-biz hero. There also was a lighthearted 
scene involving imaginary conversations with a psychiatrist about 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, Streisand employed more film footage as she sang two of 
her biggest hits, "The Way We Were" and "You Don't Bring Me Flowers," followed 
by more personal songs, including one dedicated to her son, Jason, and "Happy 
Days Are Here Again," a celebration of social optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 As Streisand sang "Happy Days," the song that has been identified with her for 
three decades, photos of President Clinton, Nelson Mandela and other 
sociopolitical figures flashed on the overhead screen. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pointed aside, she criticized the media for belittling Hollywood 
personalities when they talk about politics. She said she's proud of an 
industry that can touch people around the world with films about such serious 
issues as the Holocaust and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest addition to the show since Las Vegas is a 10-minute "Yentl" 
sequence -- a masterfully staged affair climaxed by Streisand doing a duet with 
her vocal from a scene in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 The sequence proved the most crowd-pleasing of the show. When the audience 
stood in ovation, however, one sensed that it was for more than the music. It 
was also in admiration of the independence and determination Streisand has 
shown over the years in such pursuits as film directing. 
</P>
<P>
 Another significant change from Vegas involves the ending of the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 In the New Year's Eve show, Streisand closed with "For All We Know," a 
melancholy song about the possibility of two people never meeting again. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the fact that Streisand has said she will never tour again and the 
strong feeling of her fans, it's marvelous theater. She performs the song while 
walking back up the living room sets that she descended at the start of the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tour progressed, however, Streisand felt that ending was too downbeat. 
In a Detroit interview with The Times, she said that she felt guilty leaving 
her fans on such a note -- especially on those nights when the audience is 
unusually responsive. 
</P>
<P>
 So she came back Thursday -- as she has done in other cities -- for an encore 
of the more uplifting "Somewhere," from "West Side Story." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as chilling theatrically, but the audience's mood does brighten 
considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 How doubly ironic -- and revealing. 
</P>
<P>
 After all these years of being pictured in the press as domineering and aloof, 
Streisand the performer proves to really be just a softy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Barbra Streisand appears tonight, July 18, 20, 22 and 24 at the Pond of 
Anaheim, 2695 E. Katella Ave., Anaheim. 8 p.m. $50-$350. (714) 704-2500.  
</P>
<P>
 Barbra's Top 10 List 
</P>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand's Top 10 Reasons for Postponing Four Concerts at the Anaheim 
Pond: 
</P>
<P>
 10: I've always wanted to spend four hot, muggy days in Anaheim in the middle 
of July. 
</P>
<P>
 9: I was trying to help work out Dan Rostenkowski's plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 8: I didn't realize it would take a whole week to dust all this furniture 
(that makes up her stage set). 
</P>
<P>
 7: I had to stay home and wait for the cable guy. 
</P>
<P>
 6: I hurt my voice yelling, "Yabba-dabba-doo!" 
</P>
<P>
 5: I wanted to add a new item to my line of concert souvenirs: Barbra 
Streisand tongue depressors. 
</P>
<P>
 4: They were having a shoe sale at Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 3: I thought my concert tour needed more publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 2: It took me three days to read Dan Quayle's new book -- and four days to 
correct the spelling. 
</P>
<P>
 1: Every time I started to drive here, I got sidetracked and went to 
Disneyland instead.

ART ON THE INFOBAHN; TECHNOLOGY: MICROSOFT'S WILLIAM H. GATES GENTLY COUNSELS 
SKITTISH MUSEUM DIRECTORS AT A SEATTLE MEETING ON THE FUTURE IN CYBERSPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "To be blunt, this is going to happen. It's not like you get on your next tax 
return to check, 'Yes, I want the information highway' or 'No, I don't,' " says 
Microsoft chairman William H. Gates, flailing his arms as a shy grin lights up 
his boyish face. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Infobahn himself is wrapping up the keynote address Thursday night at the 
Assn. of Art Museum Directors' conference on "Art Museums on the Information 
Highway" and he has finally hit his stride. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour earlier, the 38-year-old multibillionaire looked rather like a dutiful 
child -- politely enduring his elders at a dinner party while rocking in his 
chair, fiddling with his wedding ring and wishing he could disappear. When he 
rose to speak, he referred to himself as "a high school graduate" and said the 
elite group was "probably the best-educated audience I've ever spoken to." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, in response to questions about potential negative effects of advanced 
technology on museums, he is telling it as he sees it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people like me . . . who are spending lots of money putting this 
thing forward," Gates says of the communications pathway that he wants to 
control by supplying its standard operating-system software -- just as he has 
in the personal computer industry with the software Windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see 'the information highway' as largely positive," Gates says. "It's a 
matter of taking advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 How to take advantage and also take charge of art museums' role in the 
inevitable technological revolution has been the point of the four-day 
conference, which winds up today. 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed -- despite concerns about quality control, copyrights and 
unauthorized use of reproductions of artworks -- more and more museums are 
plunging into the Digital Age. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence has never been more clear than at the conference, where 
participants have watched interactive programs on everything from the 
conservation of Renaissance paintings to "virtual museums." The museum 
directors have quizzed gurus mercilessly and shrieked with amazement over such 
wonders as a Costa Rican ceramic jaguar that turns into a virtual growling 
jungle cat in an inventive program under development at Emory University's 
Michael C. Carlos Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 But now they are being treated to a bit of painfully elementary advice from 
the world's most legendary nerd: "I encourage you to use PCs now while you are 
a little bit young and a little down on the learning curve," Gates tells his 
audience, suggesting that the place to start is with CD-ROMs and E-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 All museums should have their best objects scanned into a database, if only 
for behind-the-scenes use, he says. But technological changes are happening so 
fast that museums should not invest in systems they can't afford to replace in 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rambling from one topic to another in an hour's worth of extemporaneous 
remarks, Gates often adopts a reassuring tone. He is, after all, speaking to 
museum directors who have resisted his efforts to license digital reproduction 
rights to their collections through his company, Continuum Productions Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that (by) diving in there are very many mistakes to be made. 
Diving in is a reasonably safe thing," he says. "There is no need to do any 
kind of exclusive licensing. You can retain full control of your material in 
terms of licensing it to do whatever you want." 
</P>
<P>
 As for worries about today's museum visitors turning into tomorrow's mouse 
potatoes, Gates says electronic publishing can create more knowledgeable 
viewers and increase museum audiences by making art more accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, he contends, the information highway will make quick work of 
loathsome tasks and leave more time for pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art is one of those things that as people have more leisure time and as it is 
made more approachable and interesting, it might rise in popularity," Gates 
says. "It is in your hands to decide how you rise to that challenge."

POP BEAT: ANOTHER TRAFFIC JAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON BREAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Winwood and Jim Capaldi ran into an unexpected road block when they 
tried to resurrect Traffic after 20 years: They didn't have the rights to use 
the name of the rock band they founded.  
</P>
<P>
 Chris Blackwell's Island Records U.K. owned the moniker. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were 19 or 20, he got us to sign a piece of paper, which we didn't 
believe existed," Winwood said. "He faxed copies to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 So, after Winwood and Capaldi had completed a Traffic comeback album this year 
for Virgin Records (for which Winwood records), the lawyers were called in. "It 
was more loaded in his (Blackwell's) favor than ours. They played hardball," 
Winwood said, and Traffic bought its name from Island. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Blackwell said the agreement with Traffic prohibits him from 
commenting; however, Island is releasing a box set of Winwood material -- from 
1964-91, including Traffic stuff -- later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The legalities over the name delayed the release of Traffic's new album, "Far 
From Home," and thus slowed momentum for the band's current concert tour. In a 
summer dominated by such veteran acts as the Eagles, Barbra Streisand and the 
Rolling Stones returning to touring after lengthy absences, the Traffic trek 
seems to have hit a few bumps in the road. Industry observers report that 
Traffic tickets have been less-than-hot items in many major markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Winwood and Capaldi's enthusiasm for the venture is palpable -- 
in an interview, during a band rehearsal and onstage opening night in 
Minneapolis, where Traffic sounded better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicianship is superior and Winwood, one of rock's most soulful singers, 
is impassioned in his singing and guitar and keyboard playing.  
</P>
<P>
 Just why did Winwood -- who had his share of solo success in the 1980s with 
"While You See a Chance," "Higher Love" and "Roll With It" -- decide to direct 
Traffic again? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been talking about it for a while," he said. "It wasn't a financial 
consideration. It seemed a natural progression. I felt to a certain extent that 
my music was lacking some of the ragged edges that the Traffic music has in it. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "The desire was to write in a way that paid no lip service to any kind of 
market force. The only parameters we had were. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Freedom," Capaldi interjected. "With Traffic, you don't have to preconceive 
where you're going. That's the beauty of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Winwood denies the speculation that he revived Traffic because his solo career 
has been floundering after two consecutive slow-selling albums. "We have no 
idea that Traffic is going to be any more successful than my solo albums," he 
said. "No one has a crystal ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Multi-instrumentalist Winwood, 46, and lyricist-drummer Capaldi, 49, made "Far 
From Home" in much the same way they made the old Traffic albums: They repaired 
to a farmhouse in Ireland and jammed. But this time they were without Traffic 
flutist and saxophonist Chris Wood, who died in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So Winwood used electronic samples for the reeds and woodwind parts. For the 
tour, he and Capaldi hired four sidemen, including bassist Rosko Gee, who 
played with the 1974 incarnation of Traffic, and 
saxophonist-flutist-keyboardist Randall Bramblett, who has accompanied Winwood 
on his solo tours.  
</P>
<P>
 Why wasn't Dave Mason, Traffic's founding guitarist, involved? 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Traffic is prominent on his resume, he played with the band for 
only one year and never toured the States with Traffic.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dave was never cut out to be in a group," Winwood said, despite the fact that 
Mason has joined the latest incarnation of Fleetwood Mac. "He's much more of a 
solo artist, we felt, and he did some great solo work."  
</P>
<P>
 "Far From Home" is full of the kind of long-winded rock-blues-soul-jazz-folk 
jams that made Traffic a staple on FM radio from '67 to '74. Winwood said he 
and Capaldi did not set out to make a "retro album that sounded like it was 
made in the '60s." They did meet with hot producer Don Was but decided to work 
on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we brought in an album that sounds like it was made in the 1990s 
people have a little bit of trouble with that," Capaldi said. "The tradition of 
the old stuff is still there. I don't feel we've made sort of a glossy '90s pop 
album. It's pieces of music rather than radio songs." 
</P>
<P>
 In concert, the new songs fit in with the old numbers that dominate the show: 
"Medicated Goo," "The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys," "Glad," "Freedom Rider," 
"Empty Pages," "John Barleycorn," among others. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Winwood and Capaldi seem to be drowning in a sea of joy. But 
they don't know what the future holds for Traffic. Said Capaldi: "With Traffic, 
it's like jumping into the ocean without a ticket and a boat and a route while 
crossing the Atlantic." 
</P>
<P>

ALL THINGS TO ALL WOMEN?; TELEVISION: LIFETIME STRIVES TO CORNER THE FEMALE 
MARKET WITH SERIES RANGING FROM A HOWARD STERN-TYPE SHOW TO HOME DECORATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Like two suburban homemakers on speed, Sissy Biggers and Susan Korn make jokes 
about breast pumps, thigh cream and sex after pregnancy on "Queens," a 
2-week-old talk show on the Lifetime cable-TV network. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-hosts ask TV sportscaster Andrea Joyce about the sights she has seen in 
an all-male locker room, and they earnestly share their fears about no-romance 
marriages with an anthropologist who urges busy couples to schedule sex and 
think of it as a treat, "like chocolate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Queens," intended as a female version of an outrageous, Howard Stern-style 
radio talk show, is one of a spate of new shows that Lifetime has introduced in 
the past few months in hopes of further establishing itself as the "women's 
network." 
</P>
<P>
 The new programming, which represents a $60-million investment by Lifetime, 
has a somewhat split identity, alternating between traditional women's shows 
and feminism, between praise for women's accomplishments and humor that strikes 
some observers as women putting themselves down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are 51% of the country -- you can't do one kind of programming for 
them," explained Lifetime programming vice president Peggy Allen. "We have to 
reflect the diversity of women's interests." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other recent additions to the network's schedule range from "Lifetime 
Magazine," a Wednesday night newsmagazine hosted by Lisa McRee of ABC News; to 
"Girls' Night Out," a Saturday night offering with only female comedians, to 
"Clapprood Live," a talk show on Sundays at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Lifetime will introduce two more series that, by contrast, are 
right out of women's magazines: "Our Home," airing weekdays at 10 a.m. and 2 
p.m., with host Marc Summers providing information about how viewers can "make 
the most of their homes without spending a fortune," and "The Marriage 
Counselor," airing weekdays at 11:30 a.m. and featuring a psychologist giving 
advice about issues that have been presented in dramatized form. 
</P>
<P>
 In an increasingly competitive TV environment, said Lifetime programming 
executive Judy Girard, "Original programming is what will 'brand' us in 
viewers' and advertisers' minds as the network that programs for and cares 
about women."

 Part of the difficulty of being the "women's network," however, is that women 
play many roles in life, and it may be more difficult to create a niche network 
for such a diverse group than for, say, children (Nickelodeon) or music-video 
lovers (MTV). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that Lifetime is fishing around for an identity with its original 
programming," observed Erica Gruen, senior vice president at the Saatchi & 
Saatchi advertising agency. "Having declared themselves the women's network, 
they haven't defined exactly what that means. Not that this is an easy thing to 
do; it's probably easier to define a woman's magazine for a particular audience 
-- Good Housekeeping, Vogue or whatever -- than it is to define an entire 
women's TV network." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Despite its success with cable operators and advertisers (the network had $150 
million in gross advertising revenues in 1992, according to one cable-industry 
estimate) for its mix of female-appeal network reruns and a successful block of 
parenting programming, the 10-year-old Lifetime has not created a breakout hit, 
unlike Nickelodeon, MTV and even E! Entertainment Television with "Talk Soup." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lifetime is trying a lot of new programming to see what works -- and what 
will create some buzz about the network," Gruen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who came to Lifetime from Hearst television, said that Lifetime is 
programming according to the profile of women who are available throughout the 
day.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our Home," Allen said, will focus on women's interests in home-decorating and 
cooking without assuming that they're unsophisticated -- or that they have all 
day to bake a cake. "We're going to show women how to do the decorating they've 
seen in magazines. This is not going to be a show about making jewelry out of 
leftover cheese," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Queens," which airs weekdays at 1 p.m., and which Allen created, is "aimed at 
the intelligent young woman at home who turned off the TV set awhile ago 
because she couldn't find anything she wanted to watch," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen acknowledged that "Queens" is probably the riskiest new venture, using 
two newcomers in a spontaneous format, but she disagreed with the notion that 
Biggers and Korn seem to be obsessing about sex and perceived imperfections in 
women. "Women talk about a variety of subjects, from politics to health care to 
orgasms, and I think we're reflecting that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifetime ranks No. 1 among basic-cable networks in total daytime viewing among 
18-to-49-year-old women. But its ratings (currently averaging a meager 1 in 
prime time -- representing 942,000 homes) dropped slightly over the past year, 
and USA, TBS and other cable networks also are going after female viewers with 
new programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "There certainly is competition for the women's audience, but I think that 
Lifetime is the best place to reach the female audience," said Douglas 
McCormick, who took over as president of Lifetime last year. "By experimenting 
with new and different programming, we will be more responsive to women's 
interests -- and we'll stand out more on the cable dial."  
</P>
<P>
 Lifetime's owners, the Hearst Corp. and Capital Cities/ABC, recently paid 
$316.7 million to buy out their third partner, Viacom, which sold its interest 
to help pay for its purchase of Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an indication of what Hearst and ABC think of the potential of Lifetime 
that they paid that kind of money for it," McCormick said.

Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti, will be broadcast live on 
PBS except in Southern California, where it will be blacked out like a local 
sports event so as not to impact ticket sales. The performance, set for July 16 
at Dodger Stadium, the eve of the World Cup final soccer competition here (as 
it was when they sang in Rome in 1990), will be the tenors' first appearance 
together in the United States. KCET-TV Channel 28 has not yet decided when the

PUBLISHING EXEC EXPECTED TO BE HOLLYWOOD PICTURES CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Lynton, a top executive from Disney's Hyperion Press publishing unit 
in New York, is expected to be named the new head of Hollywood Pictures, 
sources confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co., under which Hollywood Pictures hangs its banner, is 
currently in intense contract negotiations with Lynton and his announcement 
could come as early as next week when details of his deal are hammered out, 
sources said."It's between days and weeks," an insider noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynton has been house-hunting in the Los Angeles area, sources confirmed, and 
Disney officials are now looking for his replacement at Hyperion Press. 
</P>
<P>
 With his background in publishing instead of movie-making, some film industry 
observers were surprised that his name surfaced in April after Ricardo Mestres 
stepped down as president of Hollywood and became a producer on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody else (inside Disney) wanted it," said one film industry source with 
knowledge of the studio hierarchy. "I hear they are very serious about putting 
(Lynton) in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Mestres, Lynton would take his marching orders from his close friend 
David Hoberman, who was elevated to the post of president of motion pictures 
for the Walt Disney Studios when Mestres departed. Hoberman, in turn, answers 
to the real power at Disney, studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Mestres, Hollywood Pictures struggled to make hits, releasing a string 
of lackluster films from "Super Mario Bros." to "Swing Kids." Ironically, 
Hollywood Pictures is expecting a better year in 1994, with this summer's Pauly 
Shore comedy "In the Army Now" and this fall's Robert Redford drama "Quiz 
Show."

HOW SWEET IT IS; AGRICULTURE: ABOUT 30 LEONA VALLEY FARMS ARE EXPECTED TO OPEN 
TODAY FOR THE ANNUAL 'U-PICK' CHERRY SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of cherries are ripening on trees throughout this region, 
readying for the start of the annual "u-pick" season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the 30 cherry farms in Leona Valley are expected to be open to 
the public today. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers said that although Leona Valley did not get as much rainfall this past 
winter as last year, there is an abundance of cherries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like a very good crop this year," said John Mayfield, owner of Big 
John's Cherry Orchard. "That last freeze we had. . . looked like we were going 
to be in trouble, but it didn't last long enough (to hurt the cherries)." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernadette Fluharty, secretary for the Leona Valley Cherry Growers Assn., said 
the cold spell slightly affected the crop at some orchards, but even so the 
"fruit is plentiful. There will be a lot for the people to pick at." 
</P>
<P>
 Now all that is needed is a little more warm weather to make the cherries ripe 
enough for picking, Mayfield said. "Some of those trees in another week or two 
are really going to look beautiful. Some of the limbs are (so heavy with fruit 
they're) just about to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most other fruit, Fluharty said, cherries do not ripen once they have 
been picked. "When you pick the cherry off the tree, that's how it's going to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 Before picking, growers suggest taste-testing the fruit. "Every tree has its 
own taste, so sample a cherry from the tree, and find the one you like and pick 
from that tree," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchards that are members of the town's cherry growers association do not use 
pesticides or insecticides, Fluharty said, noting that members will have a sign 
outside their orchard indicating they belong to the association. 
</P>
<P>
 The handful of businesses in downtown Leona Valley will also have free maps 
available that show the location of all the member orchards. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who get carried away while picking and collect more cherries than is 
humanly possibly to consume right away, Fluharty said many orchards provide 
handouts with information about canning and drying cherries, as well as recipes 
for cooking with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluharty's Northside Cherries has 300 trees, nearly all of which offer the 
most popular cherry -- the bing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayfield's orchard includes 275 trees with bing, hearty giants, lambert and 
black tartarian cherries, all so-called eating or sweet varieties. "I don't 
have a pie cherry on the place," Mayfield said. "They're too sour." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who like the sour pie cherries, they will be ripe for picking at 
some of the Leona Valley orchards in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayfield said he will be selling honey at his orchard. He makes Big John's 
Honey, available in orange, buckwheat, lemon, eucalyptus and sage, from his own 
bee hives. 
</P>
<P>
 Other orchards also sell honey and other products, but the main attraction, of 
course, is the cherries. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweet-cherry season typically lasts only about three to four weeks, 
depending on the weather. The cherries sell for $1 to $1.25 per pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers recommend that pickers bring containers to carry the fruit home, 
although most orchards provide bags or boxes. And cherry pickers should wear 
grubby clothes because the fruit's juice stains. 
</P>
<P>
 Leona Valley will officially kick off its cherry-picking season with a 
festival today. The all-day event, held in the tiny community's downtown, 
includes a parade, craft fair, children's games and an ugly truck contest. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach Leona Valley, take the Antelope Valley Freeway to Palmdale Boulevard. 
Head west on Palmdale Boulevard, which becomes Elizabeth Lake Road, for about 
10 miles and look for the signs directing you to the orchards. 
</P>
<P>
 Information about when the orchards are open, when the best picking is and 
directions to the area are available by calling the newly established Leona 
Valley Cherry Information Line at (805) 266-7116.

2 PIVOTAL STORES TO REOPEN AFTER QUAKE; RECOVERY: THE GAP AND BANANA REPUBLIC 
OUTLETS IN SHERMAN OAKS WILL BE BACK, BUT OTHER BUSINESSES PLAN TO LEAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Good news has been in short supply among the merchants along Ventura Boulevard 
in recent months. Even when it does pop up, just as much -- or more -- bad news 
usually follows. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the story Friday, when executives from The Gap and Banana Republic 
stores shuttered by the Northridge earthquake quietly announced that the two 
shops will reopen before the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Small merchants along the strip near Van Nuys Boulevard consider the two 
stores critical to attracting shoppers to the once-popular area, which is still 
trying to recover from the one-two punch of recession and earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a vote of confidence," said commercial real estate broker and Sherman 
Oaks resident Jeff Brain. "For the community, it's a morale booster to see them 
stay." 
</P>
<P>
 But before they could start planning for better days ahead, merchants and 
residents learned that two other popular quake-damaged businesses -- Johnny 
Rockets hamburger stand and The Sharper Image boutique -- will not come back to 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Cabana, president of the Johnny Rockets chain, said he was looking for 
larger quarters farther east along the boulevard toward Studio City. "I'm 
pretty sure we won't go back into that same general area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before January's 6.8 quake, the area had been sliding into decline, the 
victim of a stubborn recession and the changing tastes of finicky shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 It got even worse when many of the stores and more than 30% of the 
neighborhood's apartments and condominiums were destroyed by the quake. The 
destruction in Sherman Oaks was second only to Northridge, the quake's 
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, most of the businesses have reopened, but the residential streets on 
either side of the boulevard remain lined with chain-link fences and empty 
red-tagged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Michael Ourieff's customers lived in those buildings. While he 
applauds the efforts of other businesses to get back to work, he wonders how 
much good it will do if surrounding neighborhoods remain ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business-wise things are filling in a little bit," said Ourieff, who owns 
Michael J's Italian Kitchen. "But neighborhood-wise, the apartments are not 
coming back. I need that neighborhood business." 
</P>
<P>
 Ourieff is looking for a new home for his restaurant at other spots along the 
boulevard, in neighborhoods that still have some life in them. "There are so 
many spots out there," Ourieff said. "I'm sure we will have no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Ourieff's departure will surely have an effect on the area, slightly 
changing yet again the mysterious and delicate dynamics of what makes a 
neighborhood work. And no one is sure how those dynamics will play out. 
</P>

 "Sherman Oaks retail is at a turning point," said Richard Close, president of 
the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. "Is Ventura Boulevard going to be and remain 
the Melrose of the Valley? Or is it going to be just another street?"

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; 60 DADS TO HAM IT UP ONSTAGE IN PTA BENEFIT 
</P>

<P>
 Scott Rader -- who at 6 feet, 5 inches tall and 270 pounds is built like a 
large football player -- looks superb in a pink tutu. 
</P>
<P>
 So says fellow actor Gordon Morris, who joins Rader and about 60 other Verdugo 
Woodlands Elementary School dads in performing eight songs and six dance 
numbers for the 47th annual Father's Follies, "Curses -- Foiled Again!" 
</P>
<P>
 A cross between vaudeville and slapstick, the follies not only allow fathers 
to act somewhat like their 7-year-olds, but also raise the bulk of funds for 
the elementary school's PTA budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's show netted about $8,000 for the PTA -- close to 75% of the 
organization's annual budget. Funds are drawn from ticket sales and business 
advertisements printed in the show's playbill. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $3 at the door for tonight's 8 p.m. performance, which will be 
staged in the Glendale College Auditorium, 1500 N. Verdugo Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, who has the lead in this year's production, said that although he has 
no acting experience, assuming the role of Boss Plaid -- the show's villain -- 
was easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been a ham at heart," said Morris, whose fifth-grade son, Eric, 
10, attends Verdugo Woodlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Other dads, some of whom have performed in the follies for 15 or 20 years, 
also enjoy the month and a half of rehearsals and general clowning around that 
accompany the yearly production, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Curses -- Foiled Again!" was written by Glendale College faculty member Jill 
Benone -- who has scripted and directed the follies for more than 20 years. The 
play features Boss Plaid plying his "dirty tricks" in an effort to take over 
the Verdugo Woodlands Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boss tries to convince school administrators to spend their money on golf 
courses rather than school improvements. He's "foiled" in his quest for power, 
however, by Dick Daring and a cast of fathers posing as fourth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Boss utters the show's final line, "Curses-foiled again," fathers 
hurry to change into multilayered skirts and fishnet hose to perform the show's 
finale-a racy French can-can.JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; RESIDENTS BLOCK HOMELESS SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to locate a homeless shelter in Van Nuys have been put on hold after 
more than 100 residents turned out at a community meeting to protest the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important to have the community on your side," said Nat Hutton, 
executive director of the nonprofit L.A. Family Housing Corp. "But (the 
project) is clearly something (those at the meeting) do not want to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Family Housing Corp. operates the Valley's largest shelter, the Trudy 
and Norman Louis Valley Shelter in North Hollywood. In Van Nuys, the agency 
wants to set up a 150-bed shelter in a vacant building at 7447 Sepulveda Blvd. 
to be called Sepulveda Center. The agency sometimes uses the building now as a 
homeless shelter in wet weather.  
</P>
<P>
 After Thursday's meeting at St. Andrews Lutheran Church in Van Nuys, Hutton 
said the agency may look at possible sites for a large shelter in other 
communities.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is an increasing need to help families who are homeless," he said, 
claiming that Los Angeles County's homeless population rose 13% between 1991 
and 1992. Of the estimated 43,000 to 77,000 homeless people in the county, as 
many as 5,000 are in the San Fernando Valley, Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it has been proposed, Sepulveda Center would provide six-month transitional 
housing for about 25 families and 50 individuals. It would also offer social 
services and amenities, such as an outdoor children's play area and community 
room. No parolees would be allowed to live in the building, Hutton said. JEFF

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; DEVELOPER TO FIGHT AUCTION OF PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The developer of a controversial luxury home project on the Burbank hillsides 
has vowed to fight an effort by a former buyer to auction off the property in a 
foreclosure sale next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "That auction is never going to happen," said Sherman Whitmore, who has been 
trying to build the 117-home project for 11 years, fighting local 
environmentalists, city and state regulations and now J.M. Peters Co. of 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 J.M. Peters, claiming that Whitmore owes $1.7 million plus interest -- what 
the Peters company put into the Burbank Hill project, has filed a notice of 
default on the property. As a result, an auction is scheduled Wednesday on the 
steps of the Los Angeles County Court Building in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 The asking price for the property is $2.28 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been instructed that we can give no comment," said Valerie Winsor, a 
lawyer representing J.M. Peters Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitmore will try to block the auction when he appears before Judge Robert H. 
O'Brien in a hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitmore filed a lawsuit against J.M. Peters last month in Los Angeles 
Superior Court seeking $25 million in damages -- the expected value of the 
developed land. The suit claims that J.M. Peters reneged on an agreement to pay 
the costs of getting the project approved by the city of Burbank and building 
required improvements such as streets and other services.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have an uphill battle," said Brian Bird, a lawyer for Whitmore. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit claims that J.M. Peters Co. had agreed in 1988 to the payments in 
exchange for a promise that Whitmore would sell the company 90 of the lots. 
Whitmore put the entire project up as collateral to be forfeited if he broke 
his promise. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, when the project was close to getting final approval from the city, 
J.M. Peters Co. told Whitmore that the company would spend no more on the 
project. According to the lawsuit, J.M. Peters Co. reported it had been taken 
over by another company and had no funds available for the Burbank Hill 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 To continue the project, Whitmore sought a $1.3-million loan from the Bank of 
Beverly Hills. The bank demanded that Whitmore put the property up for 
collateral, superseding the J.M. Peters 1131359776ED BOND

 A city employee who repaired police radios has been booked on suspicion of 
burglary and grand theft for allegedly stealing $50,000 worth of the equipment 
and hoarding it in his Pasadena home, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Darby Jr., 42, was arrested after the manager at the city's 
Communications Services Section noticed a pattern of thefts from the Civic 
Center complex, said Chahe Keuroghelian, Glendale police spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 Darby has been released on his own recognizance. An arraignment date has not 
yet been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Darby, who fixed radios for many city divisions, including code enforcement, 
fire, sanitation and public works, was taken into custody Thursday after police 
served a search warrant at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 City property seized from Darby's residence included 35-millimeter and video 
cameras, computers and radio equipment, Keuroghelian said.  
</P>
<P>
 After a monthlong investigation, officials concluded that Darby had taken the 
equipment from the city's communications facility over a seven-year period, 
police said. Authorities are unsureif they have recovered all of the equipment 
allegedl taken from the communications cneter, Keuroghelian said. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation is ongoing to determine if other parties were involved in the 
thefts, police said.JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; COLLEGE GETS GRANT TO STUDY SAFETY TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mission College has received a $50,000 grant to more effectively coordinate 
the training of public safety officials, including law enforcement officers and 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program, called the Southern California Public Safety Education 
Training Consortium, would examine ways to consolidate training costs, said 
Gayle Brosseau, the project's coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because all of our budgets are hurting, it really is perfect timing to get 
people working together," Brosseau said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Isidro Patino, the project's chairman, more than 80% of all 
public safety training is run either in conjunction with or through community 
colleges. Of the 37 police academies in the state, only three are not 
affiliated with community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, a needs assessment would be conducted of public safety 
training classes at about two dozen regional community colleges. The classes 
include academy courses from entry level classes to command courses, as well as 
continuing education classes for working firefighters and police officers. JEFF

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: WHEELCHAIRS DON'T KEEP PILOTS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COURTNEY ANDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Mike Smith taxis his Piper Arrow at Van Nuys Airport, he is just like any 
other professional pilot. But when he gets out of the plane and slides across 
the wing into a wheelchair, it becomes apparent that he is different. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has climbed into cockpits since he was 18. He got his pilot's license 
just after he graduated from high school and later flew helicopters in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 When he crashed a crop-dusting helicopter 12 years ago, an accident that broke 
his back and paralyzed his legs, his flying days seemed numbered. 
</P>
<P>
 But within two years, he had his wings back. Smith, now 49, was running a 
construction company but kept thinking about flying. He missed aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that if I had to do other things, I was going to die," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hundreds of other people in wheelchairs worldwide, Smith turned to the 
International Wheelchair Aviators for help. Based in Escondido, the IWA was 
founded by Bill Blackwood, who himself is wheelchair-bound and who in 1968 
developed hand controls for many types of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith mastered the hand controls and started renting airplanes from Aero 
Haven, a small company in his Big Bear home. 
</P>
<P>
 When Aero Haven came up for sale in 1990, Smith bought it and began to offer 
flying lessons and charter work. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can really do anything you want to if you want to put your mind to it," 
Smith says of his return to flying. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Smith began a courier service for First Mountain Bank of Big Bear and 
now flies to several L.A. area airports, including Van Nuys every weekday. He 
also outbid 14 other aircraft operators, including former employers, for a 
contract with the state of California to fly officials looking for pollution 
sources along the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
 No customer has ever refused to fly with Smith because he is in a wheelchair, 
but he notes society's views of the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is always an uphill battle for us. Everybody looks at us like, 'There's 
another person on welfare, they can't do anything, they're helpless.' They find 
out that I'm doing all this stuff," he said. "That is what I like to emphasize 
-- yeah, check it out. I throw it back in their face." 
</P>
<P>
 On the east side of Van Nuys Airport, another IWA member, Thad Taft, keeps a 
Piper Cherokee, which he flies for pleasure on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft became interested in aviation in the mid-1940s, when he flew model 
airplanes during junior high school. After high school, Taft joined the Air 
Force as a crew member on a B-26. A crash during the Korean War put him in a 
wheelchair.  
</P>
<P>
 Taft, 64, describes his life as a series of unplanned events. After the war, 
Taft entered a program to train aircraft workers, but his skills in designing 
wheelchair accommodations for his Compton home led him to 10 years of working 
in architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, Taft began to work at Lockheed as the result of a chance encounter at 
a party. At Lockheed he met a wheelchair aviator who introduced him to the 
Blackwood hand controls. In 1971, Taft learned to fly. COURTNEY ANDERSON

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: VALLEY HOLIDAY DEATH TOLL ON ROADS HITS 3

 The number of people who died in Memorial Day traffic accidents in the San 
Fernando Valley rose to at least three, and possibly four, with the release 
Friday of Los Angeles Police Department statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Thursday that the California Highway Patrol knew of two 
traffic fatalities during the holiday weekend, one in Verdugo Hills and one in 
North Hollywood. On Friday, the LAPD said it also had reports of two 
fatalities, one in Pacoima and one in North Hollywood. It could not be 
ascertained whether the North Hollywood deaths reported by the two agencies 
were the same incident. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 83 alcohol-related traffic accidents in the San Fernando, Santa 
Clarita and Antelope valleys during the Memorial Day weekend, according to the 
Peace Officers Assn. of Los Angeles County. This number does not include 
collisions handled by the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 83 collisions reported by the association, 23 occurred in the LAPD's 
Foothill Division, 19 in the Van Nuys Division, 13 in North Hollywood, 11 in 
West Valley and eight in Devonshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies responded to four alcohol-related 
accidents in the Antelope Valley, two in the Santa Clarita Valley and one in 
the southwestern Valley (an area that includes the communities of Westlake 
Village, Agoura Hills, Calabasas and Hidden Hills). Glendale and Burbank had 
one collision each.  
</P>
<P>
 The number of drunk-driving arrests in the three valleys rose to 128 with the 
addition of information from the Sheriff's Department and the Burbank and 
Glendale police departments. This figure does not include drunk-driving arrests 
made by the LAPD, which were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies reported making 10 drunk-driving arrests in the Santa 
Clarita Valley, nine in the southwestern Valley and four in the Antelope 
Valley. Glendale police arrested 18 people for drunk driving, and Burbank 
police said they made eight arrests. KAY HWANGBO

 Canoga Park School needs help getting back on track after the Northridge 
earthquake. One of the campus's buildings is still off its foundation; the 
lunch pavilion is unusable, and many of the school's supplies were damaged by 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was one of 12 schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District 
chosen to receive $10,000 each from Vons Cos. to replace school supplies lost 
or damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Applebaum, assistant principal at Canoga Park School, said her school has 
yet to decide officially what it will spend the money on, but it should cover 
"anywhere from art materials, papers, pencils, computer software and literature 
books, which were waterlogged." 
</P>
<P>
 The other 11 schools are Cantara Street, Danube Avenue, Reseda, San Fernando 
and Van Gogh Street elementary schools; Frost, Holmes and San Fernando middle 
schools, and Kennedy, Monroe and Reseda high schools. Those schools were 
determined by Vons as having the greatest need for replacement supplies.

 Vons presented a check for $125,000 to the district for the 12 San Fernando 
Valley schools May 27. MAKI BECKER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MORE SITES SOUGHT FOR WASTE DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeowners and environmentalists have asked the city to expand a list of 
alternative sites for a proposed septic-waste dump at the Sepulveda Dam 
Recreation Area in a petition submitted this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition -- signed by about 30 of the 52 people who attended a homeowners' 
meeting Thursday night -- recommends that the city, in looking for alternative 
sites, consider all city-owned property, land owned by other public agencies, 
and private property. 
</P>
<P>
 It also calls on the city to use an extensive list of criteria -- such as 
zoning and proximity to neighborhoods -- to evaluate potential sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that people came here tonight and supported the criteria that was 
prepared by the coalition," said Peter Ireland, president of the Coalition to 
Save Sepulveda Basin. "We're hoping the city will incorporate the criteria into 
the process." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted in November to delay for one-year final 
approval of the dump, located within an existing water-treatment plant. Chances 
for approval will be significantly affected by the outcome of an environmental 
study, which will include the analysis of alternate sites. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's meeting, the Department of Public Works accepted public comment 
on 19 alternative sites throughout Los Angeles that have been selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not very productive," Ireland said after the meeting. "It's too much 
of a we-they situation. They don't understand the value of public participation 
leading to a consensus on how to solve a problem."  
</P>
<P>
 But Encino resident Glenn Bailey called the workshop "a truly productive 
airing of the community's concerns about the criteria and alternative sites." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents said they want the Sepulveda Basin to be dropped entirely from 
consideration as a dump site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley has taken such a hard hit," said Van Nuys resident Susan E. 
Miller. "We're trying to get our homes to look nice. But when people hear about 
this, they are saying, 'Let's get the hell out of here.' Personally, I can't 
take any more." KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE GETS NEW FIRM TO RUN ITS SWAP MEET 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pierce College Foundation has brought in a new company to run its weekly 
swap meet, but the meet will not open this week as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 A contract with the new, nonprofit company Straight Talk, must be approved by 
the college's Board of Trustees.But approval was not sought in time due to a 
foundation "oversight," said foundation President James Breeden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully we'll get it going sometime this month or in July," Breeden said. 
</P>
<P>
 The swap meet is the foundation's primary source of funding, bringing in more 
than $100,000 a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the foundation waits for approval, the company that previously held the 
contract has moved a few miles down the road. A new swap meet operated by 
Norton Western of Scottsdale, Ariz., will open today at the Winnetka 6 drive-in 
theater at Winnetka Avenue and Prairie Street. It will run from 6 a.m. to 4 
p.m. every Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Breeden declined to elaborate on why a new operator was brought in, saying 
only, "It was time for a change." Norton Western had operated the meet for 
about five years, he said. ERIC SLATER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: SCENIC MULHOLLAND OVERLOOK TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A cool breeze, the inviting shade of a sycamore, the distant glistening of the 
sea to the west and the bucolic terrain of a canyon below -- all just a taste 
of Stone Canyon Overlook in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The viewing site located along the Mulholland Scenic Parkway, a quarter-mile 
west of Beverly Glen, will officially open to the public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The site, once named Nicada Overlook, was nothing more than a knoll with a 
bench and a neglected parking lot, according to Paul Edelman, staff ecologist 
of Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 years of work and $300,000 in costs, the overlook has been totally 
revamped. Two 35-foot-wide turrets are surrounded by stone walls and a sycamore 
tree, with a bench seat on the interior of both turrets. In addition, the 
overlook has been made wheelchair friendly, with gently sloping ramps that lead 
to the top of the viewing area. MAKI BECKER

HIGH-RANKING AIDE TO ALARCON RESIGNS OFFICE; COUNCIL: THE DISTRICT OFFICIAL'S 
DEPARTURE IS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF STAFF CHANGES IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One of Los Angeles Councilman Richard Alarcon's highest-ranking aides has 
quit, marking the fifth staff change in the councilman's one-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupe Vela, who most recently managed Alarcon's three district offices, left to 
"move on to other career opportunities," she said, declining to elaborate. Her 
last day was Friday, but she will take several weeks of vacation before she is 
officially off the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Vela also cited the need to devote more time to her family and to her hobby of 
designing and building ornate furniture. She added that she joined Alarcon's 
staff with the understanding that she would consider moving on after a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pleased to have been part of Richard's first year in office," she said. 
"It has been a tremendous satisfaction for me but I am looking forward to 
moving on to other opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Vela's decision to quit comes only three months after Alarcon pulled her from 
her duties as his City Hall chief of staff and put her in charge of his 
district operations. Mayor Richard Riordan's press secretary, Annette Castro, 
was hired to take over Vela's City Hall duties. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vela said her decision to leave had nothing to do with her transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accomplished a lot," she said. "I feel it's just time to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Among her accomplishments with Alarcon was spearheading the drafting of an 
ordinance to permit street vending in certain areas throughout the city. The 
ordinance was approved five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lupe has been an asset to me," Alarcon said in a statement. "Her expertise in 
economic development and environmental issues has been invaluable in helping me 
shape my first year. She will be sorely missed." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, she headed an effort to revitalize Pacoima by seeking the 
establishment of an "empowerment zone," a federal program that provides tax 
breaks and special aid for businesses and residents in poverty stricken areas. 
Federal officials will make a decision on the city's empowerment zone 
application in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Caron Caines, an attorney for the San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal 
Services who worked with Vela, described her efforts on the zone application as 
"tireless" and "pivotal" and said Vela has offered to help in the community 
after she leaves Alarcon's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Vela's departure is the latest in a series of staff changes in the past few 
months. Since February, when Castro was hired, Alarcon's press aide and two 
field deputies have left to pursue other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro played down the impact of the turnover, saying the office has been able 
to make good progress in its first year despite the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any office there are people with opportunities that will make them decide 
to do other things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In noting Vela's departure, Alarcon also announced the recent hirings of 
Arturo Gonzales, as field supervisor and press deputy, and three field deputies 
and a planning aide.

GRADUATIONS CAP TUMULTUOUS SEMESTER FOR 6,700 CSUN STUDENTS; COMMENCEMENT: 
HONORS CONVOCATION SUNDAY BEGINS FOUR DAYS OF CEREMONIES AND CELEBRATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Climaxing a semester that began with the shattering jolt of a destructive 
earthquake, more than 6,700 Cal State Northridge students will be eligible to 
participate in commencement ceremonies that begin Sunday with an honors 
convocation followed by three days of graduations. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the battered campus had briefly considered a return to the single 
campus-wide graduation that was the norm through 1990. But in the end, 
officials -- prodded by students -- opted to keep the approach that began in 
1991 with each of CSUN's eight academic schools hosting its own graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 The honors convocation, to fete nearly 1,000 outstanding students, will be the 
closest to a campus-wide celebration that CSUN will have to mark its surviving 
the earthquake. The temblor caused an estimated $325 million in damage, the 
costliest loss ever for a U.S. university. The ceremony will be 2 p.m. Sunday 
outside the University Club on Nordhoff Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "While faculty, staff and students have experienced both stress and a sense of 
loss in adapting to a 'makeshift' university, they have faced this challenge 
with dignity, humor and devotion to education," CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson 
wrote in her introductory message in the campus' commencement program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The achievement of the 1994 spring semester will always be a wonderful 
testament to the resiliency and strength of this campus. Indeed, the 
performance of the entire university community during this crisis has been a 
source of great pride to me. . .," wrote Wilson, who plans to shake hands with 
every student being honored at the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's event will feature a keynote address by Andrew Young, the former 
civil rights leader, United Nations ambassador and mayor of Atlanta. He 
currently is vice chairman of Law Companies, the Atlanta-based engineering and 
environmental services firm that CSUN hired to coordinate its damage assessment 
efforts after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The following is the roster of school graduation ceremonies:

JUDGE REJECTS LAST CHARGES IN ALLEGED THEFT OF RUBY; COURTS: A BIZARRE CASE 
CONCERNING A RARE BURMESE STONE CLOSES. THE LAST OF FIVE JEWELRY DEALERS IS 
RELEASED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Closing a case that featured many setbacks for prosecutors, a judge dismissed 
charges Friday against the only remaining defendant accused in the alleged 
theft of a rare, 6.76-carat ruby. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz freed the last 
of five jewelry dealers arrested in Encino last summer by the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue was the alleged theft of a jewel known as "the Mona Lisa of rubies," 
a Burmese stone the size of a small marble and reportedly worth up to $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltz granted a motion Friday brought on behalf of Rasekh Uddin Siddiqui to 
toss out a felony charge of receiving stolen property. The ruling came as 
prosecutors sought a new trial after a jury deadlocked in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm unhappy with the decision," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Eduards R. Abele. "We 
wanted to retry the case. The evidence against defendant Siddiqui was strong. 
Eight out of 10 jurors in the first trial thought he was guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Donald E. Levinson, who made the motion on behalf of the 
46-year-old Siddiqui, was not available for comment. Siddiqui previously said 
he left Southern California as a result of his arrest and is currently in the 
rug business in Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Stoltz tossed out charges against the only man found guilty of 
stealing the ruby after determining that the three-year statute of limitations 
had expired before charges were filed. Ali Reza Paravar, a 42-year-old Woodland 
Hills man who had been convicted of grand theft, was facing up to five years in 
prison when the judge dismissed his case. 
</P>
<P>
 Abele could have tried Siddiqui a second time on charges of receiving stolen 
property because prosecutors said that crime occurred less than one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of the trial for Siddiqui and Paravar, the jury acquitted a 
third man on charges of receiving stolen property, and Stoltz dismissed the 
same charges against a fourth defendant. During a hearing last year, a 
Municipal Court judge ruled there was insufficient evidence against a fifth 
defendant to put him on trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The convoluted case began Sept. 12, 1990, when downtown jewelry merchant Peter 
Morlock gave the ruby to jewelry broker Ron Levi on consignment. Levi then gave 
the ruby to Paravar, who two weeks later refused to return it to Morlock 
because Levi allegedly owed him $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Morlock took the matter to the Los Angeles Police Department, which initially 
refused to make any arrests, and Paravar held on to the stone for most of the 
next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Morlock again went to police on July 16, 1993, and in a sting operation hours 
later, the five men were arrested. The ruby was found in Paravar's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities alleged Paravar and the other men were involved in a scheme to 
extort $360,000 from Morlock in exchange for the ruby. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning of the case, dubbed by courthouse workers "The Great Ruby 
Caper," the defendants all maintained they were involved in a business dispute 
in which Levi was the real culprit.

CITY VOTES TO RENAME PARK AFTER ROCK LEGEND; COMMUNITY: FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF 
THE LATE RITCHIE VALENS CHEER THE PLAN TO HONOR THE HOMETOWN HERO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A small park in the heart of a working-class neighborhood here where Richard 
Valenzuela grew up may soon be renamed to honor the rock 'n' roll legend that 
the boy became. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Friday to rename Paxton Park 
"Ritchie Valens Park," drawing applause from half a dozen of Valens' family 
members and friends who carried a banner and photo of the teen rock star. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Richard Valenzuela in Pacoima, Valens gained fame in the 1950s but died 
at age 17 along with Buddy Holly in a 1959 plane crash that is still considered 
one of the greatest single tragedies in popular music history. 
</P>
<P>
 The name change must still be approved in the next few months by the city's 
Recreation and Parks Commission. But that did not diminish the enthusiasm of 
Valens' family and friends after the council's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such happiness," said Ernestine Reyes, an aunt of Valens who was 
clutching a photo of the smiling rock singer. She attended the meeting with her 
sister, Pauline Lozano, and Valens' sister-in-law, Rosie Morales, and a handful 
of other friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Valens received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1990 after the movie 
"La Bamba" recounted his life and sparked a resurgence of interest in the young 
musician. A few years later the Postal Service issued a 29-cent stamp bearing 
his likeness. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents Pacoima, said he proposed the name 
change so that children in the northeastern San Fernando Valley neighborhood 
could remember Valens' humble background and emulate his accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ritchie Valens was someone I admired while growing up," Alarcon said. "He 
came up against all the odds." 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Flores, a community activist and friend of Valens' family, echoed 
those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 The park should be renamed "so children can have a role model and shoot for 
the stars, just like Ritchie did," he told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Valens rose from obscurity as a teen-age guitar player in Pacoima to become 
internationally known for such hits as "Come On, Let's Go" and "Donna," a love 
song about his high school sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
 But he will probably be best remembered for "La Bamba," a rock rendition of a 
Latino folk dance tune that was on the flip side of "Donna." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Recreation and Parks Commission votes to change the park's name, 
the panel will schedule a hearing in Pacoima to take public testimony and hear 
any possible arguments against the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Paxton Park, a 24-acre park in the shadow of the Simi Valley and Golden State 
freeways, was named for the street that borders the park on the southeast side. 
</P>
<P>
 Paxton Street was named in 1888 for Catherine Paxton Maclay, the daughter of 
Charles Maclay, one of the original founders of the city of San Fernando and 
developer of the Maclay Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
 If the name change is approved, a new recreation center that is scheduled to 
open at the park in June will be named Ritchie Valens Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The recreation center will include a preschool, a gym, a stage and sound 
system, and possibly a day-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are developing plans to either erect a statue or paint a mural 
at the recreation center in honor of Valens.

GIRLS STILL HOSPITALIZED AFTER CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teen-agers injured in a car accident that killed three of their friends 
remained hospitalized Friday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Du Bois, 14, was in critical condition at Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center with numerous broken bones and a punctured lung, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Acevedo, also 14, was upgraded from critical to serious condition 
Friday at the same hospital. She suffered a broken leg and a head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, the girls were riding in a car driven by Barbara's sister, 
JoKema Du Bois, 15, who did not have a driver's license. When JoKema lost 
control of the car on Seco Canyon Road, it struck two other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 JoKema, and passengers Gena Watkinson, 15, and 3 1/2-year-old Jesica Noell, 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, crisis counselors were available for students at Canyon High 
School, where JoKema and Gena were freshmen. However, school officials said few 
students made use of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the kids came in to talk to counselors yesterday (Thursday), but not 
many today (Friday)," said Principal Mike Allmandinger. "The initial shock and 
trauma are over."

RELIGION / JOHN DART; FAME LESS IMPORTANT THAN FAITH FOR CHRISTIAN CROONER PAT 
BOONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When singer Pat Boone helped evangelist Luis Palau launch the San Fernando 
Valley Crusade this week in Van Nuys, he told the crowd: 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't think of any better way to spend my birthday than being here with 
you, worshiping the Lord and trying to help our city find the way back." 
</P>
<P>
 It was typical of Boone, who since his days as a white-bucks pop singer in the 
1950s, has Put his religion before his career -- to his detriment in show 
business, he believes. 
</P>
<P>
 A trim 60-year-old Boone is currently in a production of "Will Rogers Follies" 
in the country music entertainment mecca of Branson, Mo., playing the cowboy 
humorist six days a week, twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone had told the musical's producers, however, that he would honor previous 
commitments to be at the crusade's opener Wednesday as well as at a Beverly 
Hills dinner where State of Israel bonds were promoted to invited Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 And thus it has been for Boone, an elder at Van Nuys' Church on the Way -- 
lending his celebrity name to religious causes despite the occasional harm to 
his career over the last quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be an outspoken Christian in any business is difficult, but in show 
business you are really a pariah," Boone said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had P.R. people who abandoned me, saying that the industry is going to 
think of me as a preacher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that his record, film and television work, delimited by his squeaky clean 
image in the 1950s and 1960s, would have necessarily flourished through the 
changing tastes of later years. 
</P>
<P>
 But his religious transformation in 1970 made it all the more problematic for 
Boone to keep quiet about his faith. Before then, he was a Church of Christ 
member. He was known as an actor who wouldn't kiss a woman on screen other than 
his wife, but he was hardly an active spokesman for faith and conservative 
morality. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed when he became an outgoing charismatic believer, baptizing 
converts in his back yard swimming pool and making personal appearances at 
religious rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 He described in a 1970 book his experience of speaking in tongues and other 
charismatic "gifts," which led the next year to his "disfellowshipping," or 
ouster, by the Inglewood Church of Christ.  
</P>
<P>
 That agonizing period was recalled by Boone during his recent appearance at 
the Luis Palau Crusade at Birmingham High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Churches of Christ that Boone had been raised in, he said, took to heart a 
biblical verse in the 14th chapter of 1 Corinthians which says that worship 
should be decent and orderly. "That was the only verse we paid attention to 
because the rest of the chapter had to do with the gifts of the (Holy) Spirit," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Churches of Christ, a nationwide association of autonomous congregations 
which founded Pepperdine University, among other colleges, has traditionally 
opposed speaking in tongues and other purported signs of supernatural influence 
as manifestations that were authentic only in New Testament times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm grateful for my roots . . . for my parents' faith, and for the Church of 
Christ's emphasis on this book," Boone said, waving a Bible over his head. "The 
Church of Christ believes this is the only answer, and so do Luis and you all," 
referring to the evangelist behind him on the platform and the 8,200 who 
attended the crusade on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Church of Christ pastors and members he knew were convinced that "God was 
listening to us and not to the others," Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said, "I knew there were folks who went to other churches 
who seemed to be enjoying their worship and their supposed relationship to God 
more than we were." 
</P>
<P>
 After he was kicked out of the Church of Christ, Boone and his family were 
wooed enthusiastically by Mormon missionaries and given an offer of ordination 
by an Assemblies of God leader. But the Boones started going to the First 
Foursquare Church of Van Nuys, later to be known as the Church on the Way, when 
the pastor, the Rev. Jack Hayford, had only 40 or 50 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone said in an interview that his wife, Shirley, and their four daughters 
liked the excitement in the congregation that today has more than 8,000 
members. "There was never any service there where I wasn't moved to tears," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a period of nearly four years in the early 1970s, when a movement of young 
worshipers was emboldening adult charismatic Christians to express their 
beliefs more openly, Boone was letting groups use the swimming pool at his 
Beverly Hills home to baptize new converts. "More than 300 people were probably 
baptized in that time," said Boone, who led some rites himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainer said he has had no regrets over his years of publicly backing 
religious causes, including antiabortion campaigns and Christian political 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 He compared himself, with a qualification, to Jane Fonda in earlier years and 
actor Ed Asner in more recent years. "We're all willing to take whatever hits 
to our career are involved, but those people were in stride with the majority 
of views in the entertainment business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It could be argued, in fact, that Boone sometimes has benefited professionally 
from his religious associations. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hired by Israel to promote tourism among conservative Christians, who 
have been supportive of Israel's political positions. This week he helped State 
of Israel Bonds officials win over some Christian investors. "I pledged to buy 
$50,000 in bonds, and I will buy some more," Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, expressing religious views in public risks alienating great 
numbers of people. 
</P>
<P>
 In that vein, Boone said he has learned from his stage role as Will Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will could make comments about politics and morality without condemning 
people, and that's an admirable trait," he said.

 MORMON FUNERAL: The Salt Lake City funeral for Ezra Taft Benson, the worldwide 
president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who died Monday at 
94, will be broadcast live to local Mormon Church centers today, starting at 9 
a.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral proceedings will be transmitted via the church's own satellite 
system to stake, or regional, centers in Canoga Park, Chatsworth, Glendale, 
Granada Hills, Westlake Village, Santa Clarita, Van Nuys and North Hollywood, 
among other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 35,000 Mormons live in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and 
Antelope valleys, according to church officials. 
</P>
<P>
 CHRISTIAN SCIENCE: Most of the the 13 branch churches of Christian Science in 
the San Fernando Valley area will hold special services Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The services, on the same day as the annual meeting of the Mother Church in 
Boston, will mark 100 years since church founder Mary Baker Eddy designated the 
Bible and her book "Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures" as the "dual 
pastors" of the worldwide movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Church of Christ, Scientist, the denomination's official name, has no 
professional clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch churches in the Valley area include two each in Burbank and the 
Glendale area, and one each in Reseda, Woodland Hills, Northridge, Encino, 
Studio City, Canoga Park, North Hollywood, Van Nuys and Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 CATHOLIC SEMINARY: Father Dick Martini, rector of the Queen of Angels High 
School Seminary in Mission Hills since 1991, has been assigned to the Los 
Angeles Catholic Archdiocese's vocations office and will become its director 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini, who has been with the seminary for six years, will succeed Father 
Joseph Shea in July, 1995, as director of the vocations office, which recruits 
men and women as priests, sisters and brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Roger M. Mahony also named Father James M. Anguiano as Martini's 
successor at the high school seminary. Anguiano, who joined the Queen of Angels 
seminary faculty two years ago, "has a superb vision of what priestly formation 
should entail," Mahony said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 INTERFAITH COUNCIL: The Rev. Allyn Axelton, campus minister at Cal State 
Northridge, is expected to be elected Wednesday to a second year as president

</P>
<P>
 The council's executive committee will present an operating budget for 1994-95 
of $221,500, not including government contracts for social services. That is 
down more than $40,000 from last year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest drop was in fund raising," said a council representative at its 
Chatsworth office. "We postponed our annual human relations awards dinner this 
spring because of the earthquake and most of our fund-raising efforts have gone 
toward earthquake recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 The 8 p.m. business meeting at the Episcopal Church of St. Andrew and St. 
Charles, 16651 Rinaldi St., will be preceded by a performance by the San

SWAGGART'S EMPIRE SHRINKS -- AND SO DO THE DONATIONS; TELEVANGELISM: PREACHER 
HAS BEEN UNABLE TO MAINTAIN HIS MINISTRY'S ONETIME PROSPERITY AFTER A HIGHLY 
PUBLICIZED SCANDAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the halcyon days, televangelist Jimmy Swaggart would ask for $25, $50, even 
$100 from followers and he would get it, even if it meant the donors would have 
to do without. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Swaggart begs for pennies. 
</P>
<P>
 His age is showing, perhaps the strain from all the scandal. But the 
59-year-old Swaggart still plays the piano with that almost boogie-woogie style 
that is so akin to that of his famous and controversial cousin Jerry Lee Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds still stand, their arms raised, singing and swaying to the gospel 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crowds, like the donations, are smaller -- much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Sunday, his 7,000-seat Family Worship Center was two-thirds empty 
as Swaggart started his pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Start giving -- if you have to give pennies to start with -- and then start 
increasing it as he increases his blessing on you," Swaggart said, giving a 
thumbs up as people came forward and placed their money in several large, 
wooden boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be very amazing to the Lord if you danced down these aisles and gave 
your gift shouting 'Alleluia' all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Swaggart is one of the most gifted television preachers, but even his enormous 
talent is not enough to rebuild an empire he lost after his highly publicized 
meetings with prostitutes, televangelism scholars say. 
</P>
<P>
 The viewing audience that financially feeds his ministry also is vastly 
smaller. Where Swaggart's extensive network of cable and satellite feeds once 
covered the globe and reached 3 million Americans, only 100,000 U.S. households 
watch his weekly sermon today, according to Arbitron, a rating agency. 
</P>
<P>
 His ministry was $4.5 million in the red in 1991, the latest year for which 
tax records were available. During Swaggart's peak, the tax-exempt ministry 
earned $150 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ministry officials would not say how many students still attend Swaggart's 
Bible college at his $100-million complex in Baton Rouge. But a planned 
12-story dormitory sits abandoned, its windows void of glass, weeds crowding 
its entryway. 
</P>
<P>
 Other construction projects at the complex have also stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry was recently ordered to pay more than $1.4 million for Bibles and 
other religious publications delivered but never paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 A computer firm sued Swaggart for more than $80,000 for software and services 
it claims the ministry has not paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 Swaggart also agreed to pay rival Marvin Gorman $1.8 million last month in an 
out-of-court settlement. Gorman sued Swaggart for $90 million after the two 
swapped allegations of sexual misconduct in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all practical purposes, his career is over," said Bill Martin, a 
sociology professor at Rice University in Houston who specializes in 
televangelism. "That doesn't mean he won't continue to preach and eke out a 
living, and maybe a fairly good one. But he won't be a prominent, nationally 
known evangelist again." 
</P>
<P>
 Where does that leave him? 
</P>
<P>
 Swaggart will not say because he does not grant interviews. He has called news 
reporters "devils" at times. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin says Swaggart is left with a little television exposure, some revivals 
and business ventures in the secular world, notably rentals of the shell of his 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
 A state agency pays $2 million a year to lease several buildings at the 
ministries complex. Meeting halls are rented for business conferences. A local 
hospital, Baptist church and day-care center also rent space there. 
</P>
<P>
 A health and fitness center, originally built for students of the Bible 
college, sells memberships to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Born to poverty in a Mississippi River Delta area in northeast Louisiana, 
Swaggart got his start in 1958, hitting the revival circuit with his wife, 
Frances, in a beat-up Plymouth and living hand to mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1980s, Swaggart had built a televangelism empire. His Family Worship 
Center overflowed with attendance, and 15,000 students attended his Bible 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 He spread his message through books and records. But his main instrument was 
his weekly telecast. He was the most-watched televangelist in the country for 
much of the last decade, according to Arbitron. 
</P>
<P>
 Swaggart fell from grace in 1988 after Gorman had pictures taken of him 
outside a seedy New Orleans-area motel with a prostitute. Swaggart lost his 
Assembly of God affiliation and much of the viewing audience that financially 
fed his ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he was stopped with a prostitute in his car in California. 
</P>
<P>
 His viewing audience fell to 400,000 households. His ministries complex, which 
once employed 1,500, lost half its staff. His Bible college lost 70% of its 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the second scandal, it will be difficult for him, no matter how 
gifted a preacher and especially a television preacher, to rebuild a national 
ministry," said Quentin Schultz, author of "Televangelism and American Culture" 
and a communications professor at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Swaggart's viewing audience dwindled to 113,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Swaggart's telecast is broadcast on less-expensive local cable stations in 
some areas of the country, although ministry officials will not say where. 
Arbitron does not include cable stations in its ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin believes that Swaggart and his ministry can survive as a lean, 
scaled-down operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some pretty small ministries out there," he said. "But you have to 
wonder what he will be content to do. My guess is he won't be content."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COUNTRY STARS HEAD LINEUP FOR ANTELOPE VALLEY 
FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three top country artists -- Clint Black, Randy Travis and Hank Williams Jr. 
-- will headline the Antelope Valley Fair, officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also signed up to perform at the fair, which will run from Aug. 26 to Sept. 5 
in Lancaster, are the rock music group REO Speedwagon and the comedy duo, the 
Smothers Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased," said Ralph Bozigian, chairman of the Antelope Valley Fair 
Board's entertainment committee. "I think we probably have the finest lineup 
that we've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fair Board has allocated $415,000 to pay for the artists, but he said the 
concerts generally net more than that sum. Bozigian said the concerts draw 
thousands of people who also patronize food booths run by local charities. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people coming through the gate (means) more people spending money on hot 
dogs and hamburgers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers will appear in the fair's Redman Grandstand, which seats about 
10,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists such as Kenny Rogers and Reba McEntire have sold out the grandstand 
during past fairs, and Bozigian said Clint Black, whose only Los Angeles-area 
appearance during 1994 will be at the fair, is a strong bet to sell out this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 A new sales policy will be used this year to make sure local residents have a 
chance to buy tickets and to make it more difficult for ticket scalpers to buy 
large blocks, fair officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Concert-goers must line up to buy tickets on a first-come, first-served basis, 
beginning at 8 a.m. June 25. Sales at the fairgrounds ticket windows, 155 E. 
Ave. I, will continue the following day. Each patron can purchase no more than 
10 tickets per concert for seats in the area closest to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, tickets could be obtained by mail or by phone prior to the opening 
of the ticket windows. This year, phone and mail orders will not be processed 
until June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair entertainment schedule will be: Hank Williams Jr. on Monday, Aug. 29; 
Randy Travis on Tuesday, Aug. 30; REO Speedwagon on Wednesday, Aug. 31; Clint 
Black on Thursday, Sept. 1, and the Smothers Brothers, with comedian Carrot Top 
on Friday, Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 All concerts will start at 7:30 p.m. Ticket prices include admission to the 
fair. Tickets cost $25, $20 and $17 for the country concerts; $20, $15 and $12 
for the REO Speedwagon and Smothers Brothers concerts.

 "If it wasn't the time linebacker Phil (better known as Foo) Villapiano was

 The only difference is that Wilt scored 100 points and the Knicks got only 86

GEORGIA TECH'S RIGBY SHUTS DOWN TITANS; COLLEGE WORLD SERIES: FULLERTON MANAGES 
ONLY THREE HITS AGAINST RIGHT-HANDER IN 2-0 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After all the planning is finished and all the head-spinning baseball strategy 
is played out, sometimes it all comes down to something unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happened Friday in the opening game of the College World Series 
when Georgia Tech pitcher Brad Rigby shut out Cal State Fullerton, 2-0, on 
three hits. He struck out 10. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't so much that the second-seeded Yellow Jackets won. It wasn't so much 
that they turned the tables on Mike Parisi, who had been the winning pitcher 
when the Titans beat the Yellow Jackets, 2-0, Feb. 27 in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 What was surprising was the way Georgia Tech won Friday, and the fact that the 
normally opportunistic Titans were held scoreless for the first time in 194 
games, more than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yellow Jackets usually win with hitting, not pitching. Georgia Tech came 
into the tournament with three of college baseball's top batters. But forget 
about those guys with the .400-plus averages. Nomar Garciaparra, Jason Varitek 
and Jay Payton managed only one hit among them. The bottom of the order hurt 
the Titans and Rigby's pitching put them away. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech, No. 1 in college baseball in runs scored with an average of more 
than nine per game, scored in the fifth on two hits and Parisi's control 
problems. In the seventh, Michael Sorrow, a .240 hitter, hit his first home run 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 That was all Georgia Tech needed to boost its record to 48-16 and move into 
the winners' bracket. Fullerton (45-15) now has to battle back in the losers' 
bracket Sunday against LSU. Matt Wagner will be the Titans' starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Coach Augie Garrido felt it was a matter of missed opportunities. "We 
left several runners on base in the first three innings, and that certainly 
hurt us," Garrido said. "I think the game centered around pitching, and each 
opportunity we didn't capitalize on contributed to our demise." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech Coach Danny Hall said Rigby, a 6-foot-6 right-hander who boosted 
his record to 14-4, was the key. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was throwing the ball well and keeping us in the game," Hall said. "I was 
more comfortable with a game like this, than one with our guys out there 
slugging it. Every time we got in trouble in the game, Brad would would make a 
big pitch to get us out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans had two runners on base in the first with two outs, but Jeff 
Ferguson, who had singled, was thrown out trying to steal. A walk and an error 
gave the Titans two more runners in the second with with one out, but they 
failed to capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton had two runners again in the third on a walk to Mark Kotsay and an 
error that allowed Bret Hemphill to reach base. But the Titans again failed to 
get the clutch hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Georgia Tech defense and Rigby were stronger the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always difficult to separate whether it's the pitching or the lack of 
hitting sometimes," Garrido said. "We had a couple of swings on balls that were 
in the dirt, too. We had a another chance in the eighth but didn't get a run 
out of that inning either." 
</P>
<P>
 Kotsay opened the eighth with a double. Ferguson's low liner back to the 
mound, however, caught Kotsay between second and third, and Rigby retired the 
next two batters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yellow Jackets got the run off Parisi in the fifth when Brandon Hensley 
opened with a single, went to second on a sacrifice and took third on Michael 
Smith's base hit. A hit batsman loaded the bases, and Parisi walked Garciaparra 
to force in the run. Parisi battled back to get out of the inning without 
further damage. He struck out Scott McIntyre and got Varitek to ground out to 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 "That fifth inning was a big inning for me and a big inning for the team, but 
unfortunately, there were some mistakes on my part in it, too," said Parisi, 
who gave up five hits in 7 1/3 innings and fell to 11-4 for the season. At the 
time, Garrido said he thought getting out of the inning with only one run was a 
big plus for the Titans, but they never could get rolling on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton center fielder Dante Powell, who suffered a hamstring injury in the 
regional final, played but was clearly below-par. He grounded out three times 
and popped up once.

 Arnold Palmer is 64, hasn't won a regular tour event in 21 years, hasn't won a 
senior tournament in six years and hasn't played in the U.S. Open in 11 years. 
So why has Palmer's special invitation to play in the Open this month caused 
such a stir? 
</P>
<P>
 Is somebody afraid that he might actually scorch the greens at Oakmont Country 
Club, near Pittsburgh, or maybe turn it into nothing more than a private 
bivouac area for Arnie's Army? 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer returns to one of his old playgrounds for his 32nd and what he says his 
will be last U.S. Open. The dispute is over his invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is seen by some as keeping somebody else out. Palmer knows everybody isn't 
happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's going to be controversy," Palmer said Friday from Birmingham, 
Ala., where he is playing in the Bruno's Memorial Classic, a senior PGA 
tournament. "This (exemption) was something that was in the works for a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I said to the Open committee and everyone, I certainly don't want to keep 
someone out of the Open that might have a chance to win. I accepted the 
invitation with the thought that everyone that was in the position to play 
should be able to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know everyone isn't going to think I should do it. And certainly there are 
players and people who are going to take exception to my being invited. But 
this is a one-shot deal for me. If I can enhance the Open and draw more 
attention to it by playing, I'll be there. But this is the last time." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States Golf Assn., which conducts the Open, gave Palmer a special 
exemption so he could play at Oakmont, where he has been a member for more than 
30 years. Ben Crenshaw, Seve Ballesteros, Johnny Miller and Larry Mize also 
received USGA special exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer has been absent from the Open since the 1983 tournament, also at 
Oakmont, where he finished in a tie for 59th. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer played in his first U.S. Open at Oakmont as an amateur in 1953 and says 
he is merely completing the cycle by returning. 
</P>
<P>
 He qualified for the Open five times when he was not exempt. He also received 
special exemptions in 1978, 1980, 1981 and 1983. Then the USGA decided to stop 
giving him exemptions, which meant Palmer had to qualify. He tried and failed 
from 1984 through '89 and has not tried since. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he received his own exemption this week, Ballesteros blasted the USGA 
because of Palmer's invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I deserve (an exemption) more than Arnold Palmer," Ballesteros said. 
"Why should Palmer keep getting an invitation?" 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Hannigan, former USGA executive director, wrote in a commentary in the 
June issue of Golf Digest that Palmer's invitation is a mistake and that some 
more worthy golfer would be left out. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannigan said he thought the USGA executive committee members were confused. 
</P>
<P>
 "(They) had forgotten the difference between the U.S. Open Championship and 
the Skins Game," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said he understands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly gave some thought to keeping someone else out that might deserve 
to be there," he said. "On the other hand, if they deserve it and they can play 
well enough, it isn't going to prevent them from the potential of winning the 
Open." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, at 64, Palmer doesn't expect to win his second U.S. Open. He 
earned his only U.S. Open trophy at Cherry Hills in Denver in 1960. Palmer lost 
three U.S. Open playoffs -- to Jack Nicklaus at Oakmont in 1962, to Julius 
Boros at the Country Club near Boston in 1963 and to Billy Casper at the 
Olympic Club in San Francisco in 1966. He has five other top-five finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have won about five or six more, no question," Palmer said. 
"(Trouble) happened a lot to me at the Open. It was either me or a bad bounce 
or a bad putt." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said he is working hard on his game. He finished tied for 17th last 
week at the senior event in Malvern, Pa. He was eight strokes off the lead 
after shooting par 72 Friday at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 He may not have all the shots anymore, but he is trying to revive a few from 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping to find something that will get me sparking a little bit," he 
said. "I've had some encouraging signs lately, so we're just going to see what 
happens."

WORLD CUP '94 / 13 DAYS AND COUNTING; MEXICO REJOINS THE WORLD; AFTER BEING 
BANNED FROM 1990 EVENT, SOCCER-LOVING NATION IS EAGER FOR REVENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Marcelino Garcia Paniagua shifts in his seat and squints slightly upon hearing 
the question, but he does not flinch. The president of the Mexican Football 
Federation -- although he was not in charge at the time of the scandal -- is 
accustomed to answering it. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has been a source of shame to many Mexicans -- the soccer-loving 
country's humiliating two-year ban from international play in 1988 for 
falsifying documents and using four over-age players in qualifying for the 
world youth tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very embarrassing," Paniagua said. "There was great suffering. 
The fans were sad. They wanted their team to represent them. The results were 
that FIFA decided to punish us. We were punished. The punishment reached our 
souls. Now, we are trying to do things the right way." 
</P>
<P>
 After its brief but painful exile, Mexican soccer is back with a vengeance. 
With new leadership in the federation and a successful new coach, Mexico became 
the first team other than automatic qualifiers Germany and the United States to 
gain a place in this year's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico plays its last tuneup game against the U.S. team today at the Rose Bowl 
at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In the exhilaration of Mexico's locker room after that qualifier against 
Canada in Toronto last spring, in the midst of the champagne spray and the 
players' dancing children, the afternoon's hero -- soft-spoken Francisco Cruz 
-- found the few words to express his joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, Mexico is very happy," he said. "Mexico has been waiting for this for 
so long. It is beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 The way back for Mexico has been hard, and made harder by the passion the 
country feels for its national team. But Mexican soccer is fueled by passion, 
and the team performs at its best when the odds are against it. Such was the 
situation in World Cup qualifying.  
</P>
<P>
 It began with the anthem and typical soccer gamesmanship. Mexico played at El 
Salvador in a qualifying match in April 1993, and the Salvadorans said they 
forgot to play the Mexican national anthem. The Mexicans took it as a national 
slight. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later in Toronto, before the decisive qualifier, the Mexican national 
anthem was played, but in a condensed version. Mexican fans did not miss a 
beat, though. Even after the music ceased to play over the public address 
system, they continued to sing as their national team stood at attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a week before, Mexico had been treated badly in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. 
Before that qualifying match, the Mexican team had been besieged at its hotel. 
Honduran fans camped outside the team hotel, honking horns, playing loud music 
and training high-powered lights on hotel windows. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Honduran team fell behind in its practice session and Mexico had to 
take the field later than scheduled, the stadium crew told the Mexicans their 
allotted time was up. When the Mexican team refused to leave, the sprinkler 
system was turned on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is always against Mexico," observed Hugo Sanchez, the team's 
enduring star. "But we fight. We always fight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ties between neighbors bind, but sometimes they also chafe. The soccer 
fortunes of the United States and Mexico have been interestingly intertwined. 
Before the FIFA ban, the worst thing that had happened to Mexico in 
international soccer occurred during the 1987 Pan American Games at 
Indianapolis. During a foul-plagued game against Brazil, the Mexican team's 
masseur ran onto the field and tripped a Brazilian player who was dribbling the 
ball. The masseur was sent home. 
</P>
<P>
 At the next Pan American Games in 1991, the U.S. and Mexican teams met for the 
championship in Havana. The U.S. team won, 2-1, and a melee erupted on the 
field afterward. The loss was shocking to Mexico, especially since it was the 
second at the hands of the United States in two months. The U.S. national team 
had earlier caused a sensation when it upset Mexico, 2-0, and won the CONCACAF 
Gold Cup in Los Angeles. The Mexican coach, Manuel Lapuente, resigned in shame 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident of the Mexican masseur was of little consequence on the 
international scene. The same can't be said for the scandal in 1988, though. 
That incident resulted in the resignations of both the president and vice 
president of the Mexican Football Federation. The ban also kept the Mexican 
Olympic team out of the 1988 Games at Seoul -- the U.S. team went instead. 
Worse yet, a 3-0 loss to the U.S. team meant that Mexico would miss the 1992 
Games at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the most agonizing period for Mexican soccer was during the 1990 World 
Cup in Italy. The United States and Costa Rica -- the region's soccer gnats -- 
went, but Mexico, serving its FIFA penalty, was barred. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in 40 years that the U.S. team had qualified for the 
World Cup tournament. Mexico had been such a power in the CONCACAF region that 
qualifying in '90 probably would not have posed a challenge for a talented 
Mexican team. 
</P>
<P>
 To be kept out of the World Cup by on-field failure is acceptable to most 
athletes. But to be denied the opportunity to perform on sport's biggest stage 
because of the ill-advised actions of others never is. To be replaced by an 
unworthy stand-in was a kind of horror that has not yet faded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was both angry and embarrassed," said Javier Aguirre, who was a national 
team player in 1990 and is now an assistant coach of the Mexican team. "I was 
angry because, as players, we couldn't do anything about it. I wanted to go to 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was embarrassed because to many people, being a Mexican meant being a 
cheater. But the players were not responsible. It was very frustrating to see 
Costa Rica and the United States play when we could have done better." 
</P>
<P>
 In that context, it is difficult to underestimate the satisfaction Mexico 
experienced when it wrested back the Gold Cup by trouncing the U.S. national 
team, 4-0, here last July. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing subtle about the prevailing sentiment or significance of 
that game. The headline in one of Mexico City's daily newspapers, El Nacional, 
the day after the victory was, "For Revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans need not have felt so strongly the need to win that game to 
re-establish their soccer superiority in the region. For all the recent 
surprises, the U.S. team has won only seven times, at any level, against 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it was the timing. The game was played when Mexico was growing 
irritable with its pushy northern neighbor, which appeared to win everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the least of what the United States has gained at the expense of Mexico is 
Bora Milutinovic, the coach who led Mexico to its best World Cup finish, in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico was awarded the '86 World Cup after the original host, Colombia, 
withdrew for financial reasons. FIFA entertained bids from Mexico, Canada and 
the United States and announced on May 20, 1983, that Mexico would have the 
tournament for the second time since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans were elated at the news, which in some quarters was celebrated as a 
victory over the United States. Some newspapers ran angry editorials, objecting 
to the 11th-hour intervention of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who 
had lobbied FIFA on behalf of the American effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with only three years to prepare, Mexico was in good shape for the World 
Cup, the nation's $98-billion foreign debt notwithstanding. Having been host to 
the Olympic Games in 1968 and the World Cup in 1970, Mexico had to build only 
one new stadium among the 12 to be used. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire nation was looking forward to the event and everyone cooperated. 
The academic year was shortened and college entrance exams were moved up to 
avoid conflict with the May 31 opening game. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything appeared to be progressing on schedule until September 1985, when 
twin earthquakes hit Mexico City and, overnight, reduced parts of the city to 
twisted steel or rubble. More than 40,000 residents were suddenly homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 With overall inflation at 70%, there could not have been a worse time for 
government World Cup expenditures. With the added cost of earthquake repairs, 
most Mexicans quickly grew angry. When Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid 
presided over the opening game of the World Cup, he was booed. 
</P>
<P>
 But once Mexico's team took the field, the nation was enveloped by soccer fog, 
and de la Madrid and inflation were forgotten. As the team progressed with 
surprising ease through the tournament, the nation dared to hope that it would 
win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a wish that went unfulfilled. Mexico lost in the quarterfinals to West 
Germany. Even though the team had succeeded beyond expectations, there was an 
audible sigh in Mexico. The fiesta was over and the joy that had filled the 
lives of Mexicans drained away. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the newspaper, Uno Mas Uno: "With the defeat, reality took over. 
The euphoria of 23 days has ended and we will have to live with the 
consequences now that the football curtain has fallen." 
</P>
<P>
 The curtain has remained down for eight years, and Mexicans are ready for a 
new show. 
</P>
<P>
 Cle Kooiman, a defender on the U.S. national team, is the captain of Cruz 
Azul, a first-division professional team in Mexico City. He said the 
anticipation in the country is palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, they want to prove to the world that Mexican football is 
something to be reckoned with," Kooiman said. "The team fully expects to make 
it past the first round. I think if they don't, it will be tough for them to go 
home and face their fans. During the World Cup, everything -- I mean the 
government -- will stop and all the attention will focus on the national team." 
 
</P>
<P>
 If history is any guide, all the country's woes will be forgotten as the World 
Cup curtain rises once again. After being denied entrance to the show the last 
time, Mexico will not miss a moment of this tournament. And it doesn't matter 
that, as usual, everything is against the Mexican team, which drew into the 
so-called "group of death," with Italy, Ireland and Norway, and must play in 
the summer heat and humidity of Orlando, Fla., and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 That helps, having something to fight against. It motivates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Revenge," assistant coach Aguirre said, not laughing. "This is what we think 
of when we finally return. I think, as a country, it is very good for us to be 
in the World Cup. It is true that Mexico is going through a period of crisis in 
economic recovery. But we can help in keeping the people happy. This sounds 
romantic, but we can bring joy." U.S. vs. Mexico Game a Sellout 
</P>
<P>
 Today's international soccer game between the United States and Mexico at the 
Rose Bowl is a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Friday that all 80,000 available tickets had been sold for the 
4:30 p.m. game, the last warm-up for both teams before the World Cup.

SO FAR, BURE HAS BEEN BURIED; STANLEY CUP: MCLEAN'S GOALTENDING HAS KEPT 
CANUCKS EVEN WITH RANGERS GOING INTO TONIGHT'S GAME 3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Vancouver Canucks have yet to get a goal from high-scoring right wing 
Pavel Bure, known as "the Russian Rocket," but the New York Rangers have yet to 
fire any rockets of their own on the power play, which was the NHL's most 
potent this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks have gotten splendid goaltending from Kirk McLean, who has stopped 
89 of the 93 shots he has faced, but the Rangers have gotten more help from the 
crossbar and goal posts, which repelled four Vancouver shots Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks considered themselves fortunate to steal a game Tuesday when 
McLean's sharpness made up for their lackluster defensive play. The Rangers 
were lucky to steal a Vancouver pass Thursday that Mark Messier and Glenn 
Anderson turned into a short-handed goal that won the game. 
</P>
<P>
 So, after two games of the Stanley Cup finals, there is little to distinguish 
between the Rangers and the Canucks. There is also little reason to expect 
either team will change its strategy when the series resumes tonight before an 
expected sellout crowd of towel-waving fans at the Pacific Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just got to keep putting it on net," Ranger defenseman Brian Leetch 
said. "The way both goaltenders are playing, it's going to be tough to get it 
by them. It looks like they're all going to be tight games." 
</P>
<P>
 Leetch's definition of going to the net isn't the same as Vancouver Coach Pat 
Quinn's definition. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Quinn repeated his complaints about the Rangers interfering with 
McLean, citing Adam Graves as the worst offender and complaining that Doug 
Lidster's goal Thursday -- the Rangers' first -- should have been nullified 
because Lidster crashed into McLean. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he would have his players run into Ranger goalie Mike Richter if 
the Rangers continue to crowd McLean without punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, if I was still playing, what you do is you grab Graves and 
pound the whatever out of him," Quinn said. "Now we can't do that. Now we're 
all nicey-nicey but the violence is still running the goaltender." 
</P>
<P>
 Said McLean: "We can't let that bother us. If you do, then you're likely to 
take a penalty. . . . I'm not worried about guys in front of the net." 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams have many other things to worry about.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers haven't figured how to get a lead early or how to protect one once 
they get it. The Canucks tied Game 1 with a minute to play and won in overtime, 
and they came close to duplicating that Thursday. A shot by Bure from the point 
was blocked in the slot, and a frantic effort by Martin Gelinas skidded just 
wide of Richter with about 20 seconds left, prompting a collective gasp from 
the Rangers and their fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't believe that it would happen again," Leetch said. "And then the 
puck goes into the corner, and it's a relief." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks haven't figured how to get Bure, Trevor Linden and Greg Adams in 
high gear. They had more scoring chances Thursday than in the opener, but they 
were nowhere near the threat they were against the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 
semifinals or the Dallas Stars in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers haven't had Esa Tikkanen shadowing Bure, instead playing Messier's 
line -- with Adam Graves on the left and Alexei Kovalev or Steve Larmer on the 
right -- against Bure and his linemates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers have won that matchup decisively, particularly the Linden-Messier 
confrontations. But Quinn will get some maneuvering room in Games 3 and 4 
because he has the last line change at home, and he will use that to get Linden 
away from Messier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that we have a matchup that can keep him off the scoreboard," 
Quinn said. "Let's face it, he's one of the best playoff players that we've 
known in our time. All you hope to do there is to minimize the damage more than 
anything else and then try to make up for whatever offense they're generating 
in some fashion." Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Pavel Bure has been bothered by a strep throat, but he practiced Friday. . . . 
The towel-waving dates back to the Canucks' first trip to the finals, in 1982. 
Then-Coach Roger Neilson waved a towel to protest an official's call, and fans 
took it up as a good-luck charm. . . . The Canucks are 6-3 at home in the 
playoffs, the Rangers 5-2 on the road.

NCAA PUNTS ON PLAYOFF ISSUE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: UNABLE TO REACH A CONSENSUS, 
SPECIAL COMMITTEE DEFERS ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They came. They saw. They tabled. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went for the 23 members of the NCAA-appointed Special Committee, who 
left here Friday shrugging their shoulders about the future of a Division I-A 
football playoff. Rather than actually vote on the merits of a championship 
system, the committee decided the best action was no action. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, a stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NCAA committee has concluded that while there is merit to the concept of 
a playoff, they cannot, at this time, recommend specific legislation to the 
NCAA Presidents Commission and the NCAA Council," said UCLA Chancellor Charles 
Young, who chaired the Special Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision itself wasn't much of a surprise. Beginning with the Special 
Committee's first meeting at Indian Wells in early May, it was apparent that a 
few members, perhaps even more, had serious misgivings about a playoff. Even 
after arriving here for two more days of meetings, the committee was unable to 
resolve key issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the concerns: 
</P>
<P>
 -- What would be the academic, financial and personal impact of a playoff on 
the participating student-athletes? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How would the revenue from a playoff be distributed among NCAA member 
schools? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How would a playoff affect the existing bowl system? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How would the playoff be structured? 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the Special Committee was overwhelmed by the contents of its 
350-page research study, as well as by the reservations of the members 
themselves and their race with the NCAA legislative clock. According to Young, 
the committee didn't have enough time to satisfactorily discuss the assorted 
key issues, "although the sense is they can be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but they won't be resolved in time for the 1995 NCAA Convention this 
January at San Diego. Proposed legislation for the convention must be submitted 
by June 15, a deadline Young said would not be met. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the committee requested that a task force be formed to further study 
those main sticking points. If it were approved later this month by the 
Presidents Commission and the NCAA Executive Committee, the task force would 
complete its work by the end of fall and then report its findings to the 
original Special Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that would be far too late for anything to happen in this convention," 
said Young, who suggested a proposal might be in place for the 1996 NCAA 
membership meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the case, it now appears that the earliest a playoff system could be 
implemented is 1998. But first, proponents of the Division I-A championship 
system will have to do a better job of drumming up support. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, the presidents of the Southeastern Conference 
institutions voted, 12-0, against a playoff. William Muse, president of Auburn 
and a member of the Special Committee, relayed those results to Young. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC isn't alone. Other conferences, such as the Big Ten and the Big East, 
also have expressed doubts about a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the conclusion is at the present time . . . the attitudes have 
remained essentially as they were before, which would have been negative," 
Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to the surprise of Cedric Dempsey, NCAA executive director, the Special 
Committee never came close to voting on a playoff. Dempsey said he originally 
thought the committee would reach a consensus, thanks to the thoroughness of 
the research study. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the process continued, it became apparent that there would be no 
recommendation. The best the committee could do was agree to disagree -- and to 
ask for the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, nothing will happen until the four main concerns are resolved. Even 
then there is no guarantee a playoff will become reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that's inevitable," Young said of a playoff vote someday by 
the NCAA Convention membership. "I believe it is likely that there will be a 
vote on this somewhere along the line, either up or down." 
</P>
<P>
 No such luck Friday. The vote was decidedly sideways.

SUDIKOFF SAYS KINGS ARE FINANCIALLY STABLE; HOCKEY: DESPITE FALL IN IDB STOCK, 
TEAM FINANCES WILL NOT BE AFFECTED, THE NEW OWNER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jeffrey P. Sudikoff, the new majority owner of the Kings, reiterated Friday 
that turmoil this week at the telecommunications company he heads will not 
affect the hockey franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 IDB Communications Group's stock on Wednesday tumbled by more than 50% after 
the company's auditors, Deloitte & Touche, resigned in an apparent dispute over 
IDB's accounting practices. The company also confirmed on Friday that the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission has started an informal review of the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Also this week, IDB was named in shareholder lawsuits claiming the company had 
misled investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge stock drop raised concerns among some people close to the Kings that 
the funds of Sudikoff -- whose personal fortune is largely made up of his 
nearly 5 million IDB shares -- could be strained, limiting his ability to pay 
some overdue club bills as promised.  
</P>
<P>
 But Sudikoff, IDB's chairman and chief executive, adamantly denied that there 
would be any impact on the club, adding that King bills -- including playoff 
ticket refunds -- are being paid. Sudikoff's net worth on paper fell about $35 
million on Wednesday when the stock dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff and partner Joseph M. Cohen, an IDB director, last month bought 72% 
of the Kings from financially troubled Bruce McNall for $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the close of the sale, there was some concern from other NHL owners 
that Sudikoff and Cohen might not be able to fully capitalize the team. The 
league, however, does not share those concerns and maintains that the new 
owners have brought the team current in its bills, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff confirmed that the $50-million loan from Bank of America that 
financed most of the purchase is secured by the franchise itself, not any IDB 
stock. He also confirmed that he obtained a $5-million letter of credit to 
assure Bank of America the next loan installment would be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff said that he and Cohen met an obligation to the NHL to pay such 
things as the Kings' workers' compensation insurance and other bills believed 
to total about $800,000. He also said that they are covering about $2 million 
in other overdue bills such as equipment and doctors' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff said he generally has not borrowed against his IDB stock, although he 
added that he has used a small percentage of it as security in borrowing cash.

EDMONDS HELPS SCRAMBLE ANGEL LINEUP; BASEBALL: ROOKIE'S HOT HITTING FORCES THE 
TEAM TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP HIM PLAYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Early in the season, he was the reason the Angels decided to leave J.T. Snow 
in Vancouver when first baseman Eduardo Perez was out of action for 10 days 
with a sore wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would I call up a guy who's hitting .300 against minor league pitching 
when I've got a guy who's hitting .370 against major league pitching?" was then 
Manager Buck Rodgers' response to questions about Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he's the reason the team is willing to trade Dwight Smith for a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 For a rookie whose role was supposed to combine pinch-hitting with an 
occasional start in the outfield when somebody needed a rest, Jim Edmonds has 
had a considerable impact on the Angels' day-to-day lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 First base. Left field. Even center field. It has reached the point where 
Manager Marcel Lachemann has to find a spot for him somewhere. OK, maybe 
Edmonds won't be the first player to hit .400 since Ted Williams, but there 
have been far too many line drives shooting off his bat during the first third 
of the season to call it a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds, who has hit safely in 22 of the 24 games he has started, has seven 
hits in his last 18 at-bats and his season average is .344. His average has not 
been below .333 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann said Edmonds' offensive surge did not play a role in Friday's 
decision to send Perez to the minors and recall Snow, but he admits that 
Edmonds' defensive skills and hot bat give him a great deal of flexibility when 
it comes to making out a lineup card. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, Edmonds started in left field and hit his first home run in 
Anaheim Stadium and second of the year, a towering shot to left-center in the 
fourth inning that followed Chili Davis' bases-empty homer and landed in almost 
the exact same spot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth inning, he fired a strike to catcher Chris Turner to catch 
Milwaukee's B.J. Surhoff trying to score. And in the fifth inning, he lined a 
single to center that scored Chad Curtis with the Angels' third run. He 
finished the game at first base after Smith pinch-hit for Perez in the eighth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The off day was really good for me," Edmonds said, "I'm the type of player 
who needs a day off once in awhile. It's not that I'm playing every day or 
anything, but I just need to get away from swinging the bat, to forget bad 
habits and sort of start over." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds has 17 RBIs in 93 at-bats this season, which means he has driven in 
one run every 5 1/2 at-bats. Only Davis, Tim Salmon and Bo Jackson -- 
designated RBI guys with salaries to match -- are more efficient at pushing 
across runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody asked me why I hadn't hit many home runs, but I usually don't get 
going until the summer," Edmonds said. "I hit nine homers last year (at 
Vancouver) and 14 (at Midland and Vancouver) the year before, and both years I 
only had one before June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty happy with the consistency I've shown so far. My goal is to be an 
everyday player and I'm just going to keep working toward that goal." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an objective that is clearly within his reach. For the time being, he'll 
platoon in left with Jackson, but for how long? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Lachemann said, "but he's done pretty well against 
left-handers when he has had the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty well? In 12 at-bats against left-handed pitchers, Edmonds has five 
hits, a .417 average.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; NO-WIN FIGHT: FORUM VS. OLYMPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 June 24 seems like a grand waste. Two shows, one night, in a town that is not 
quite booming with boxing dollars these days. 
</P>
<P>
 On that date, the Forum and the Olympic Auditorium, venues straining to share 
a market that, over the long haul, might not be strong enough to sustain them 
both, will stage competing fight cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the Forum nor Top Rank, which runs the Olympic boxing operation, 
wanted this, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months ago, when the Olympic was barely a glimmer in Bob Arum's eye, the 
Forum decided to move, temporarily, from its traditional Monday slot to 
Fridays, and further decided to inaugurate the experiment on June 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Much later, ESPN slotted the same date for one of its weekly Top Rank shows. 
Arum, Top Rank's president, said he approved the card because he never guessed 
that the Forum would have a Friday show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want two fights on the same day," said John Jackson, vice president 
of Forum boxing. "I'm sure they don't want two fights on the same day. But we 
both have television deals (the Forum with Prime Ticket, the Olympic with 
ESPN), and once television becomes involved, it's hard to move dates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we're going to go head to head. It's not preferable. But it's 
a fact of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arum: "Boxing doesn't have that many fans that you can afford to have two 
venues go on the same night." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who want to portray this as a showdown of sorts, the competing cards 
are a microcosm of how the venues operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Having sent out its most consistent draw, Jorge Paez, to more lucrative 
paydays at other sites this summer, the Forum, which has a largely Latino 
audience, features a couple of popular Mexican fighters, headlined by 
super-flyweight Marco Antonio Barrera. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Rank, which has a roster dominated by American talent but is short of 
big-drawing Mexican nationals, leads with Long Beach heavyweight Jeremy 
Williams against veteran Bert Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 Not including the blockbuster crowd of 10,000-plus it drew for the Michael 
Carbajal-Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez rematch last Feb. 19, Forum crowds have 
averaged about 4,000 recently, significantly higher than the five cards the 
Olympic has had, including the March 5 reopening. Even so, Forum cards are down 
from previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole year has been down, but that was happening before the Olympic 
opened," Jackson said. "Whether it's the down economy or because of the 
controversies that everyone is aware of in boxing recently, we don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Forum, which has 22 Prime Ticket-telecast shows a year, has other 
things going, including providing Paez and two more of its top fighters for the 
undercard of the June 11 Riddick Bowe-Buster Mathis Jr. card at Caesars Palace 
in Las Vegas. In the kickoff of a four-show deal with the Forum, KCAL will 
televise the undercard. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Forum is assisting the Bowe-Larry Donald bout July 15 at Hollywood 
Park -- and taking a cut of the deal -- by making light-flyweight champion 
Gonzalez, another top Forum fighter, available to fight on the undercard. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Top Rank, which has guaranteed its season-ticket holders 24 cards a 
year, has made one major concession to the economic realities: Because the live 
gate hasn't been nearly big enough to make it profitable, there will be no more 
non-televised cards. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Top Rank has multi-fight deals with ESPN and the Spanish-language 
network, Univision, which isn't enough to sustain 24 shows a year. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes the Olympic's recent deal to stage a July 24 show on CBS, a 
possible July 16 fight featuring Rafael Ruelas on ABC and ongoing negotiations 
with a major network Arum will not name to show tape-delayed fights in the 
12:30 a.m. slot all the more important. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to get as close to 24 as possible in a year," said Top Rank 
executive Todd duBoef. "For our season customers, we're going to give them 24 
if it takes 14 months or 12 months, that's our obligation." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Arum is taking comfort in the last Olympic show, featuring 
Gabriel Ruelas, which drew more than 2,000, second only to the grand re-opening 
night -- including walkup sales of more than 1,100. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm encouraged, I really am," Arum said. "Since the Forum has essentially a 
Mexican national card (June 24), we're appealing to, I think, a different 
audience. So maybe we'll surprise everybody and we'll both do well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Words first, fists later: It won't happen until spring of 1995, at the 
earliest, but in the wake of their knockout victories on last week's MGM Grand 
card, the anticipated Oscar De La Hoya-Rafael Ruelas matchup is providing 
plenty of heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're already jealous of each other," said Arum, who promotes both. "That's 
why I had them on the same card. It's how you build up a rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
 A rivalry, Arum hopes, that will blossom into pay-per-view gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas' trainer, Joe Goossen, didn't appreciate De La Hoya's postfight 
comments that implied Ruelas was a brawler with little boxing skill -- 
especially after Ruelas' two-round devastation of Mike Evgen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody likes to open up the paper and have somebody that has 13 pro fights 
saying you have no skill," Goossen said. "Especially when you're the 
(International Boxing Federation lightweight) champion of the world, and you 
beat (former champion) Freddie Pendleton, who is a very skillful fighter, like 
Rafael has. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oscar, look, before we get any more skilled, fight us. I don't want to wait 
until they're both old men. He can't have it both ways. He can't say Rafael has 
no skill, and then duck us." Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 With the Michael Moorer-George Foreman bout all but set for Nov. 5, to be 
televised on HBO (the first non-pay-per-view heavyweight title fight in years), 
and held either at the Superdome in New Orleans or the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, 
Moorer's manager, John Davimos, is already looking to the next fight. Davimos 
said he was leaning toward fighting former champion Riddick Bowe, widely 
considered the most talented man in the division -- and someone it might be 
best for Moorer to avoid -- for a spring pay-per-view bout. That is, of course, 
assuming Bowe gets through his three scheduled summer fights -- June 11 against 
Buster Mathis Jr., July 15 against Larry Donald and an August date against an 
opponent to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 A unification bout against World Boxing Council champion Lennox Lewis remains 
a possibility for early 1995, Davimos said, but right now, Moorer-Lewis barely 
elicits a PPV pulse. Plus, a Bowe fight would earn Moorer two valuable 
commodities: big money and, in the aftermath of fighting a 45-year-old, major 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with both Bowe and Lewis you're looking at the same thing: big men 
with big right hands," Davimos said. "Teddy (Atlas, Moorer's trainer) thinks 
they're basically the same. If you can beat one, you can beat either one. With 
Bowe, the money could be substantially more. Bowe is a proven pay-per-view 
commodity, and Michael and Lennox are not. Plus, there's some credibility to be 
gained, I think, by fighting Bowe." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer recently underwent surgery on a knuckle on his left hand and will be in 
a cast for the next six weeks, Davimos said. There is obviously no love lost 
between Moorer and Foreman, whose commentary on the telecast of Moorer's 
victory over Evander Holyfield was sharply criticized by many in the Moorer 
camp. "Michael doesn't like George at all, which is good, because it'll give 
him the passion he needs," Davimos said. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 contender Gabriel Ruelas is expected to receive an offer from Don King, 
the promoter of WBC junior-lightweight champion James Leija, to promote Ruelas' 
mandatory challenge, which is supposed to be held by Aug. 7. If the offer for 
the bout is not acceptable to Ruelas, the fight will go to a purse bid. . . . 
Another fighter unhappy with De La Hoya: World Boxing Assn. junior-lightweight 
champion Genaro Hernandez, who was bypassed twice by De La Hoya, is passing 
around T-shirts describing De La Hoya as the "cardboard chumpion of the world."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; CLAIRE: OFFERMAN WRONG IN PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Offerman's tantrum in the dugout during Wednesday's game did not go 
unnoticed by Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president. Manager Tom Lasorda 
has since met with Offerman over the incident, and Claire would not say if 
disciplinary action was taken, but said he was satisfied with the way Lasorda 
handled the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts are basic -- when the manager tells you to bunt, you go out and 
bunt, and you don't need to respond to it," Claire said. ". . . He (Offerman) 
was wrong, and I can't excuse what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman was upset because Lasorda told him to sacrifice in the fourth inning 
with none out and pitcher Ramon Martinez on deck. Offerman complied, then 
demonstrated his anger to Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman has been better defensively this season, but he has been dismal at 
the plate, batting .193 in April, .213 in May and .197 overall. He has shown 
his frustration often, throwing his batting helmet or bat after making an out, 
and sometimes not putting in a full effort in running to first base. But even 
when Offerman struggles, or is blatantly insubordinate, there isn't a shortstop 
on the bench to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have long offered that Claire has not signed a backup shortstop 
because Offerman would feel threatened, which Claire denies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rafael Bournigal (the shortstop at triple-A Albuquerque) was on the roster 
when the season started, but we are carrying 11 pitchers, and when we signed 
Chris Gwynn, (Cory) Snyder can do more things for us," Claire said. "Why would 
I sign a backup shortstop when Bournigal can field with the best of them? " 
</P>
<P>
 In a short-term situation, Eddie Pye, who was called up from Albuquerque to 
replace injured Jeff Treadway, can play shortstop, though he is normally a 
second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 In a long-term situation, Claire said Bournigal would get the call. 
</P>
<P>

 Brett Butler, who hadn't made an error in two years, made one in the first 
inning Friday, ending a streak of 307 consecutive games. Butler slipped while 
fielding a bouncer up the middle by Javier Lopez that was ruled a single, but 
then missed the ball when he went to pick it up. The error allowed Terry 
Pendleton to go to third base, where he was eventually stranded. Butler hadn't 
made an error since April 29, 1992, against the Philadelphia Phillies, and has 
made only seven since joining the Dodgers before the 1991 season. MARYANN

 Nearly one year after defecting from Cuba to play professional baseball in the 
United States, left-handed pitcher Eddie Oropesa was selected in the 14th round 
of the amateur draft, signed with the Dodgers and departed for Florida. And 
before he reports Monday to the Dodger training camp in Vero Beach, he will be 
reunited with his mother, Magalis Gausch, in Miami for the first time since he 
fled the island. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Rita Maria, and 4-month-old son, Eddie Jr., are still in Cuba, and 
Oropesa, 22, who has been living in Sylmar, said he will continue efforts to 
bring them to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many things have rushed through my mind since (Thursday)," Oropesa said. 
"My mom coming to visit, my wife and my son. . . . I can't describe what a 
feeling it was to sign the contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Scout Mike Brito has recommended Oropesa begin his professional career at 
double-A San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Oropesa made headlines last July when he jumped a fence at the baseball venue 
in Buffalo during the World University Games and asked for political asylum. He 
is one of several Cuban players who have defected over the past few months and 
one of the latest to join the pro ranks. Many have lived together in Sylmar 
since their defections. FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ

 Brian Anderson will probably make his return to the starting rotation Tuesday 
against Minnesota, Manager Marcel Lachemann said. Anderson broke his left thumb 
in a May 6 game against Oakland. He pitched seven innings Wednesday at Class-A 
Lake Elsinore and gave up four hits and four runs. . . . Third baseman Damion 
Easley, who hasn't played since Sunday, re-aggravated his injured right 
shoulder and was a last-minute scratch. Spike Owen replaced him. . . . First 
baseman Eduardo Perez, in the lineup for the first time since losing a homer in 
Tuesday's rainout at Cleveland, to Dwight Smith, who lost a triple: "No rain in

 McKay Christensen, the Angels' top draft pick, went to Disneyland for grad

 After that, it might be awhile before the Angels see him again.

 Christensen, from Fresno Clovis West High, will begin his two-year Mormon 
mission in July or August. He said he isn't concerned about losing his skills 
after being away from baseball so long. The Angels hope he remembers to turn 
left when he gets to first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I'm away, I'll be able to exercise and stay in shape," said 
Christensen, who batted .486 (34 for 70) with six home runs and 23 runs batted 
in this past season. "The Angels will be able to send me workouts, things I can 
do to stay in shape. I've always wanted to play (pro) baseball. It's been a 
dream of mine, but going on my mission was a priority. The Angels were willing 
to accommodate me and I appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will turn down a scholarship offer to play football and baseball at 
Brigham Young. He had signed a letter of intent this year. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

FRENCH OPEN / WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH; SANCHEZ VICARIO WILL TRY TO PIERCE 
HOT RIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each has played six matches and has yet to drop a set. So something will have 
to give today when No. 2-ranked Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain plays No. 12 
Mary Pierce of France and Bradenton, Fla., in the women's final of the French 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have rolled into the title match, Sanchez Vicario and Pierce 
offer a contrast in styles and personalities, and how they approach the game 
says a lot about how they approach life. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario is content to linger at the baseline and trade ground strokes 
with anyone silly enough to engage her. She personifies the classic Spanish 
clay-court game that sent two women and two men to the semifinals of this 
French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, on the other hand, plays rock 'n' roll tennis as taught at the school 
that gave us Andre Agassi, Jim Courier and Monica Seles. She has electrified 
fans with a fierce forehand that could change the face of women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a result of nine months of work with lots of ups and downs," said 
Nick Bollettieri, the coach who has been instrumental in reviving Pierce's 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last month's Italian Open, Pierce, 19, was struggling. 
Bollettieri said she was dejected in Rome after she had won only one match. A 
week later in Berlin she repeated, losing her second match to Julie Halard of 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Mary, don't get mad, you don't think too well,' " Bollettieri 
recalled after Pierce had advanced to the final by demolishing No. 1-ranked 
Steffi Graf, 6-2, 6-2, in Thursday's semifinals. "I just want when you hit the 
ball, hit the next one harder." 
</P>
<P>
 On the day before the French Open began two weeks ago, Pierce won an 
exhibition, 9-1, by whaling away at the ball.  
</P>
<P>
 "I liked that," she told Bollettieri. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't hit it hard enough," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has been hitting the ball so hard, and with so much accuracy, 
her opponents can do nothing but shake their heads. Graf said Pierce is hitting 
the ball harder than Seles used to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think against Arantxa, it will be more difficult because the points are 
going to be longer and she is not making that many mistakes," Graf said. "But 
if she plays like she did (against me), she has a very good chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario, 22, has defeated Pierce three of four times but lost their 
only 1994 match in the quarterfinals of a tournament at Hilton Head, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario did not have to work hard to reach her fifth Grand Slam final, 
her third French, when she routed her friend, No. 3 Conchita Martinez, in the 
semifinals, 6-3, 6-1.

 Chip Hanauer, nine-time Gold Cup champion, was top qualifier in Friday's time

at 162.614 m.p.h. The speed was well below last year's record 170.087 by Mark 
Tate in the Winston Eagle, mainly because of a new fuel restricter valve that 
limits the flow of fuel to the turbine engines.

the six-boat Gold Cup championship race later Sunday. Ten boats are expected to

SOUTHERN SECTION CHAMPIONSHIPS; WILSON TALKS A GOOD GAME, WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Geoff Wilson heard nothing except the beat of his heart and the words coming 
from his head. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Wilson, a Fountain Valley senior, reached his target, his objective was 
clear: Get across the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson stole home, part of a double steal in the bottom of the sixth inning, 
to help the Barons defeat Lakewood, 3-2, in the Southern Section Division I 
championship game Friday night at Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "The adrenaline was just rushing through me," Wilson said. "I just knew I had 
to make it to home plate no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we needed that run because a lot of times you're not going to win 
games with base hits. This was one of those times." 
</P>
<P>
 More often that not, the Barons can hit with the best of them -- if not 
outhit. But Lakewood pitcher Luke Fitzpatrick limited Fountain Valley to only 
four hits, none for extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzpatrick, however, was unable to keep Wilson off base. This was his 
undoing. 
</P>
<P>
 A fleet outfielder, Wilson stole 21 bases this season. None were more 
important than his final three. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson scored the Barons' second run in the fourth inning on Fitzpatrick's 
wild pitch. He walked to open the inning, took second on a ground out and 
reached third on a steal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to push for runs because their pitcher was keeping it so tight," 
Wilson said. "With a guy like that, you know you have to make everything count. 
You have to try and make something happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did just that in the pivotal sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out in the inning, Wilson reached first base on Lakewood second 
baseman Steve Immel's fielding error. Wilson stole second and went to third on 
a Fitzpatrick's second wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 With two outs in the inning and catcher Dan Hoppie off first base, Fitzpatrick 
threw to Lancer first baseman Matt Dempsey. With Hoppie in caught in the 
rundown, Wilson broke for home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it our first and third execution play," Hoppie said. "We set it up so 
that when I take the big lead, Geoff then chooses when he wants to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got a great jump." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson slid headfirst and beat Lakewood shortstop David McRill's throw to 
catcher Casey Martin. Hoppie was safe at second, completing the double steal, 
which sparked a celebration on the Barons' bench and among their fans in the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never doubted he would get in there," Hoppie said. "He's got the best 
wheels on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Baron Coach Ron LaRuffa: " 'Little ball' really helped us out tonight."

SOUTHERN SECTION CHAMPIONSHIPS; HOPPIE GETS A GRIP, FOUNTAIN VALLEY GETS TITLE; 
DIVISION I BASEBALL: CATCHER KEEPS HOLD OF BALL ON PLAY AT THE PLATE AND BARONS 
BEAT LAKEWOOD, 3-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fountain Valley catcher Dan Hoppie ran in circles, still clutching that 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 A moment earlier, he had been bulled over by Lakewood's Matt Dempsey, who was 
trying to score from second on a two-out, seventh-inning single. Hoppie held on 
and so did the Barons. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley, which flirted with disaster all night, came away with a 3-2 
victory Friday to win the Southern Section Division I championship in front of 
3,400 at Blair Field. The Barons are the first top-seeded team to win this 
division since Lakewood in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was over in the blink of an eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood (24-7), the second-seeded team, had runners on first and second when 
Art Martinez lined a 1-2 pitch into center field. Dempsey hit third as Matt 
Roman fielded the ball on one hop. 
</P>
<P>
 The throw was up the third base line and Dempsey arrived at the same moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a situation where your heart falls out of your left foot," Fountain 
Valley Coach Ron LaRuffa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hoppie: "I knew the guy was going to try to get a piece of me. I just had 
to hang on." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hoppie, that was easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next thing I knew, we had won," Hoppie said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a hard-earned victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons (27-3-1), who did not lose a game outside of Sunset League play 
this season, scratched and scrounged for everything they got Friday. Lakewood 
pitcher Luke Fitzpatrick gave up only four hits against a team that had scored 
38 runs in its first four playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Ponchak got the only clutch hit off Fitzpatrick (11-2), as he singled in 
the second to give the Barons a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Barons tap danced a little. Two of their runs came without the benefit 
of hits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth, Geoff Wilson walked and later scored on a wild pitch. In the 
sixth, Wilson reached on an error and later scored the game-winner on a 
double-steal, as Hoppie got into an intentional rundown. 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school baseball, you can't always wait for the base hit," LaRuffa 
said. "When you're not hitting the ball, you have to make things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood couldn't. The Lancers had runners on base in every inning, but 
stranded 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley starter Luke Hudson wobbled through three innings. Lakewood 
had two on with one out in the first, but Hudson struck out two to end the 
inning. The Lancers got seven runners on base against Hudson, but the the only 
run they got came on a Dempsey single in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Liuzzi, usually a starter, relieved Hudson in the fourth. He had not 
worked in relief in nearly a month. Liuzzi (8-0) started the season as an 
afterthought, after having pitched only a few innings last season. But by 
league play, Liuzzi was the team's No. 2 starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you say about Jason? We didn't expect anything from him this season 
and he wins the championship game," LaRuffa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Liuzzi did so on only two days' rest, having started Tuesday's semifinal game 
against La Crescenta Crescenta Valley. Still, he struck out five and gave up 
only an unearned run, before leaving with two outs and two on in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak came in and got his fifth save, although Dempsey was the only batter 
he faced.

MISSION SAVORS CHALLENGE OF WSC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mission College baseball team won't be able to defend its Southern 
California Athletic Conference title next season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Spirit, coming off its most successful season ever, instead will play 
in the Western State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 John Klitsner, Mission's athletic director and baseball coach, said Friday 
that WSC Commissioner Aviva Kamin and the conference athletic directors have 
approved the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm real excited about it," Klitsner said. "It'll be more competitive to get 
to the playoffs, but it'll be a new challenge and I like it a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The school, Klitsner said, will remain a member of the SCAC in all sports, 
even baseball. The conference, however, will not have baseball games next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Klitsner said Mission was forced to find another conference in baseball 
because Cerro Coso departed the five-team SCAC after this season to join the 
Foothill Conference. That left only the Free Spirit, East L.A., Compton and 
L.A. City in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 East L.A., Compton and L.A. City have been invited to join the South Coast 
Conference, Klitsner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that playing with only four teams was an unworkable situation," 
Klitsner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan that is expected to be finalized next week, Mission will play 
in the WSC South Division. Six teams -- Bakersfield, Canyons, Glendale, Pierce, 
Santa Monica and Valley -- now make up that division. But Santa Monica 
officials are considering dropping their program for financial reasons or 
merging with West L.A. to field a team. West L.A. does not have a team but has 
a baseball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 Klitsner said that if Santa Monica and West L.A. don't merge or if Santa 
Monica drops its program, Mission will take over Santa Monica's slot and the 
division will be able to maintain the 25-game schedule it followed this season. 
That would give the WSC two six-team divisions, because Hancock will join the 
conference next school year and play in the North Division. 
</P>
<P>
 If Santa Monica and West L.A. combine to form a new program, then rescheduling 
will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Mission will take its rising program to the WSC next season. The 
Free Spirit won its first SCAC championship with a 17-7 record this year and 
finished 26-17 after losing two games to Rancho Santiago in a best-of-three 
series in the Southern California regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in the WSC will strengthen Mission's reputation, Klitsner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to help us," he said. "People used to (insult) our conference, so 
now it's going to help us in our recruiting."

THE MORE SHE PITCHES, THE STRONGER SHE GETS; SOFTBALL: FANCUBERTA, THE COUNTY 
LEADER IN INNINGS PITCHED, HAS LED FULLERTON TO THE DIVISION II TITLE GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If it takes an extra tug on Angie Fancuberta's shirt sleeve to get her 
attention this week, it's because she's a bit preoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Fancuberta, the county leader in innings pitched, will toe the rubber again 
today when Fullerton plays La Puente Bishop Amat for the Southern Section 
Division II softball championship at Mayfair Park in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 An experienced player in only her sophomore season, Fancuberta's mind has been 
locked in on pitching ever since the Indians scored in the bottom of the 
seventh last Tuesday to defeat top-seeded Saugus, 2-1, and advance to the final 
for the first time since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't get into anything lately. All I think of is softball," Fancuberta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to blame her for being obsessed, after all, Fancuberta is not 
only the backbone of the Indians but the entire skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is 18-13 this season, Fancuberta is 18-12. There is no looking over 
her shoulder when fatigue sets in. After all, she also is the Indians' 
reliever. 
</P>
<P>
 Fancuberta racked up 193 innings during the regular season, nearly 40 more 
than the second-highest total. Add another 35 innings in Fullerton's four 
playoff victories and her statistics become astounding. 
</P>
<P>
 And she only seems to be getting stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start in which Fullerton lost 11 of 17 preleague games, 
Fancuberta overcame her confidence problems and pulled together the team. The 
Indians posted an 8-2 record in Freeway League play to win their first title in 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's Most Valuable Player began the postseason by pitching 19 
scoreless innings in the Indians' opening-round shutouts over Savanna and 
fourth-seeded Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 She then followed with a two-hitter over defending champion Covina Charter Oak 
in the quarterfinals and held top-seeded Saugus scoreless over the final four 
innings enabling her team to claw back and win. 
</P>
<P>
 Fancuberta has an arsenal of pitches she brings to the circle, which include a 
fastball, drop, rise, curve, off-speed curve, change-up and screwball. 
</P>
<P>
 However, these days Fancuberta is finding the quickest way to get an out is 
through the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense is doing really well," she said. "Early in the season we 
struggled, but our team has turned it around and that is the biggest 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Bishop Amat (22-4), Fancuberta will be facing a team that still 
remembers losing to Charter Oak, 3-1, in the championship game last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we would win league, but I never expected us to get this far," 
Fancuberta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians may be in unchartered waters, but with Fancuberta, they have 
someone to keep the team afloat. FULLERTON VS. LA PUENTE BISHOP AMAT 
</P>
<P>
 Division II 
</P>
<P>
 When: 7:30 tonight 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Mayfair Park, Lakewood 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Fullerton (18-13); No. 2 La Puente Bishop Amat (22-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Starting pitchers: Angie Fancuberta (18-12); Christine Gil (10-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Noteworthy: Fullerton has won with defense, and if the Indians get a clutch 
hit or two, the title could well be their first since 1984 -- also the last 
time they won a Freeway League title. In three previous playoff games involving 
Fullerton, the better team on paper has lost. Bishop Amat, runner-up to Covina 
Charter Oak last year, fits the mold.

AND ON THE 2ND DAY . . . WOLF GOES; DRAFT: DODGERS TAKE EL CAMINO REAL 
LEFT-HANDER IN 25TH ROUND; 20 AREA PLAYERS PICKED SO FAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Better late than never. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real High left-hander Randy Wolf expected to be selected Thursday, 
the first day of the major league amateur draft. He finally got the call 
Friday, when the Dodgers made him a 25th-round selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a little disappointed," Wolf said, "but there's nothing I can do about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, one of 20 area players selected in the first two days, slipped to the 
25th round because of the impression that he needed a large signing bonus to 
walk away from a scholarship to Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 But, regardless of whether he signs with the Dodgers, Wolf will pitch in 
Dodger Stadium soon. 
</P>
<P>
 He picked up a save Friday to put his team back into the City Section 4-A 
Division championship game at Dodger Stadium. Wolf earned a save in the 
Conquistadores' championship victory last season in Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the other area players selected in the draft, which went through the 
46th round Friday and concludes today, were from the college ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 USC first baseman J.P. Roberge, of St. Francis High, was taken by the Dodgers 
in the 18th round. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo designated hitter Rob Neal, a 
Westlake High graduate, was taken by the Minnesota Twins in the 23th round. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine shortstop Erik Martinez, who played at North Hollywood High and 
Pierce College, was selected by the San Diego Padres in the 24th round. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale College had its second player selected Friday when the Seattle 
Mariners drafted shortstop Randy Vickers in the 31st round. Vaquero outfielder 
Bryan Warner was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 14th round Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce left-hander Adam West was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 
30th round. Left-handed pitcher Osvaldo Fernandez, who defected from Cuba and 
pitched one game at Mission College this season, was selected by the Mariners 
in the 22nd round. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Crescenta Valley players led the crop of high school players selected 
Friday. Infielder Kirk Hagge went to the Detroit Tigers in the 18th round and 
right-handed pitcher Garrett Lee was taken by the Angels in the 20th round. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark outfielder Jason Adamson was a 33rd-round pick of the Pittsburgh 
Pirates and Simi Valley third baseman Ryan Hankins went to the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the same round. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberge, a junior, hit .332 with 11 home runs, 48 RBIs and 18 stolen bases for 
the Trojans this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal's stock dropped because scouts had questions about his surgically 
repaired right shoulder. Neal, who hit .306 with 40 RBIs, said he expects to 
play this summer in Alaska, then sign if the Twins feel his shoulder is sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was drafted as a shortstop, even though this was the first year since 
high school that he'd played that position. 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers and Warner were both All-Western State Conference selections this 
season at Glendale, each hitting above .350. Vickers hit 13 home runs and 
Warner had 11. 
</P>
<P>
 West, a Thousand Oaks High graduate who has signed to pitch at Pacific, was 
10-4 with a 2.95 ERA, earning Western State Conference Southern Division 
pitcher of the year honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagge said he isn't sure if he will sign with the Tigers. A 6-foot-4 
infielder, Hagge said he has a scholarship offer from Cal State Fullerton, but 
he has not signed yet with the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee (6-4, 190 pounds) was 4-3 with a 1.33 ERA during the regular season for 
Crescenta Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Derryman attracted scouts with his powerful arm and prospect he might add to 
the 175 pounds on his 6-foot-4 frame. Derryman said he plans to play junior 
college baseball before signing. 
</P>
<P>
 Adamson hit .455 with three home runs, 20 RBIs and 12 stolen bases for the 
Musketeers during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hankins, the Marmonte League co-player of the year, hit nine home runs and 
drove in 27 runs for the Pioneers. He has signed to play college baseball at 
UNLV. Area Players Taken in Amateur Baseball Draft 
</P>

draft, which concludes today. Round information provided by players.

CALVARY CHAPEL'S JONES KEEPS UP WITH BIG BOYS; BASEBALL: SKEPTICS DECRY HIS 
SKILLS BECAUSE HE PLAYS FOR A SMALL SCHOOL. BUT HIS NUMBERS MATCH UP WELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE NEFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 His average is .526. He has 40 runs batted in. He has committed only one error 
in 28 starts. But some people still hesitate to give him his due. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel's Joe Jones is used to skeptics. Playing for a Division V team, 
there are many who say he doesn't face decent competition and anyone could 
amass outstanding stats at a small school. But Jones doesn't let it bother him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm a good hitter," said Jones, a junior. "I have confidence in my 
hitting and I'm up to the challenge to hit against anyone. The people who know 
me know how good I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel Coach Joe Walters has the stats to back up his hot hitter. 
Walters figured Jones hit .700 against the top eight teams the Eagles played. 
In the Arizona Grand Slam Tournament, Calvary Chapel faced La Puente Bishop 
Amat, San Jose Santa Teresa and two strong teams from Arizona. Jones had three 
hits against each.  
</P>
<P>
 "In league, Joe only hit .400, but against the best teams we played this 
season, he hit .700," Walters said. "You can't argue with that stat. Joe does 
better against better teams." 
</P>
<P>
 His freshman year, the Eagles made it to the Southern Section semifinals 
before losing. After an off season his sophomore year, when the Eagles won only 
five games, Jones got depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really down after my sophomore year," Jones said. "It's hard to lose 
like that. We lost a lot of good players, but I still thought we'd do better 
than that. Jim Doyle is the one that pulled me out of my slump and lifted my 
spirits." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle coached Jones during the summer on a club team. He taught him to be more 
patient, to wait for the ball and be mentally tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really raw," Doyle said. "The first two weeks he chased everything in 
the dirt. I taught him to think, to be mentally smart. He learned to be patient 
and aggressive at the same time. He is an incredible athlete. I see him as a 
Cecil Fielder; he's got that kind of hitting power." 
</P>
<P>
 But at 6 feet 3, 230 pounds, Jones is also a hot commodity on the football 
field. Playing tight end for the Eagles, such colleges as Arizona, USC and 
Colorado are sending him letters of interest. But baseball is still his first 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is serious, but baseball is what I love to play," Jones said. "I 
really want to get a scholarship in baseball or even get drafted." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle thinks Jones' draft prospects are good. Jones will be playing in the 
Connie Mack league, where he will get his opportunity to play with the cream of 
the crop of Orange County and show that he deserves to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Jones on the Cardinal team will be Katella's Jaret Wright, the 10th 
player selected in the June amateur draft, Tustin's Derek Baker, a 12th-round 
selection and Seth Etherton a 16th-round pick from Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to learn a lot this summer," Doyle said. "This is a big step for 
him and it's going to help him mature even more. He is going to have a very 
successful career ahead of him in college and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now though, Jones has his sights set on the Southern Section 
Championship. Calvary Chapel will face Sierra Madre Maranatha today.Minutemen 
are 20-4 and finished second in the Alpha League. On the mound for the 
Minutemen will be Jon Crabb (9-0).  
</P>
<P>
 "I think our chances are great," Jones said. "We're on a roll right now and we 
are going to go all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Crabb better be careful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like fast pitching," Jones said. "I don't like it slow, but against L.A. 
Whitney, I went seven for eight in a doubleheader, with two home runs and two 
doubles. They pitched slow." SIERRA MADRE MARANATHA VS. CALVARY CHAPEL 
</P>
<P>
 Division V 
</P>
<P>
 When: 11 a.m. today 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Blair Field, Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Sierra Madre Maranatha (20-4); Calvary Chapel (20-8) 
</P>
<P>
 Starting pitchers: Jon Crabb (9-0); Matt Herr (7-4) 
</P>
<P>
 Noteworthy: Calvary Chapel, the third-place team from the Olympic League, 
defeated top-seeded L.A. Baptist in the second round. First baseman Joe Jones 
leads the Eagles with a .526 average. Maranatha, the second-place team from the 
Alpha League, is led by left fielder Steve Strickland, who is batting .441.

STATE TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS; ANDERSON'S INJURY HAMPERS BID BY POLY 
GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly High's quest for a third consecutive girls' State track and 
field championship was dealt a severe blow Friday when All-American sprinter 
Andrea Anderson was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a junior, collapsed after finishing second in a preliminary heat in 
the 200 meters. She re-aggravated a left thigh injury and lay on the track for 
10 minutes before being transported to a trainer's table. 
</P>
<P>
 "My season is through," said Anderson, who finished second in the 100 and 
third in the 200 at the State meet last year. "My thigh muscle tightened up on 
the curve, and I just hung in to finish the race." 
</P>
<P>
 The finals begin today at 4 p.m., and with Anderson out the team race is wide 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who first injured her thigh before the Moore League finals last 
month, was expected to be near the top in the 100 and 200. She also runs on the 
1,600 relay team. 
</P>
<P>
 Before her injury, Anderson ran the third-fastest prep time in the nation this 
season in the 100, 11.57 seconds, and the seventh fastest in the 200, 23.74. 
Her times in Friday's preliminaries were 11.77 and 24.58. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been worrying about this day for several weeks," said Don Norford, 
Poly's coach. "We've really been watching her injury and taking things easy. I 
thought it had been healing. It's unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely changes the team race. We're certainly going to lose a lot of 
points." 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland Bishop O'Dowd, Oakland Skyline and Long Beach Wilson are among the 
leading challengers for the girls' title. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's misfortune ended what had been an exciting day in the sprints. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Howard of Moreno Valley Canyon Springs started it in the 100 with a 
10.32-second timing, the nation's fastest prep run this season. An hour later, 
he ran a 20.94 in the 200, his third time under 21 in the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Aminah Haddad of Long Beach Poly eased her team's pain by running the fastest 
qualifying time in the 200, 23.72. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Muir, the boys' team favorite, had few disappointments. Ken Haslip 
had the fastest qualifying time in the 300 intermediate hurdles and third 
fastest in the 110 high hurdles. The Mustangs also qualified 400 and 1,600 
relay teams.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; THE WICKED NORTH HAS CHANCE TO PUT STUKA BACK IN HIS PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 57th Santa Anita Handicap may be gone, but Phil Hersh hasn't forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with his wife Sophie, Hersh owns The Wicked North, who will risk his No. 
1 ranking in the latest Thoroughbred Racing Communications poll against six 
opponents in the $300,000 Californian Sunday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 For all his success, The Wicked North will always be remembered most for the 
March 5 Big 'Cap. As the 9-5 favorite, the 5-year-old finished first by 1 1/2 
lengths in Santa Anita's richest race, but in a controversial decision, he was 
disqualified and placed fourth for allegedly interfering with Myrakalu early in 
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh and trainer David Bernstein appealed the decision by stewards Ingrid 
Fermin, Pete Pedersen and Tom Ward to the California Horse Racing Board. After 
a March 19 hearing in front of referee Steve Schwartz, the stewards' decision 
was upheld on April 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Not satisfied, Hersh is continuing the fight. Although he has been told it 
could take up to two years before the matter is heard, the retired plumbing 
contractor and longtime horse owner has taken the appeal to Los Angeles 
Superior Court. In fact, the process has not started yet because neither Hersh 
nor the CHRB has received the transcript of the hearing from Kennedy Court 
Reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need the transcript to go on," Hersh said. "I see no justice in what has 
been done. It was a kangaroo court, there are no other words for it. (Schwartz) 
had his mind made up before he even walked (into the hearing). I don't know if 
he was in the same room I was in. All I want is a little justice."

 There was some vindication six weeks after the Santa Anita Handicap when The 
Wicked North went to Arkansas and won the Oaklawn Handicap. Now, Hersh has him 
primed to maintain his status as the country's top handicap horse in the 1 
1/8-mile Californian, final prep for the $750,000 Hollywood Gold on July 2. 
Among his opponents are Stuka, who backed into the Big 'Cap victory after the 
disqualification, and Del Mar Dennis, the rising star in the division with 
consecutive victories in the San Bernardino Handicap at Santa Anita and the 
Mervyn LeRoy Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Wicked North) is doing just wonderful," Hersh said. "He's been training 
well. It looked like Del Mar Dennis (was the horse to beat), but I'm not as 
impressed by his last race after seeing how Tinners Way (the Mervyn LeRoy 
runner-up) ran in New York (finishing seventh in the Metropolitan Monday). Del 
Mar Dennis has never met anything like The Wicked North or these other horses. 
I'm more afraid of Slew Of Damascus." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-highweight with Stuka at 120 pounds, The Wicked North drew the rail in the 
Californian. The others entered Friday besides Del Mar Dennis and Slew Of 
Damascus were Hill Pass, Thunder Rumble and Kingdom Found. 
</P>
<P>
 Best when racing on the outside and from off the pace, Stuka was moved too 
soon in the San Bernardino by jockey David Flores and finished seventh. Chris 
Antley, who rode the colt in the Santa Anita Handicap, will be back on him 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingdom Found, who like Stuka is trained by Gary Jones, has won three of five 
since returning to the races, but he is coming off a last place in his grass 
debut, the John Henry Handicap on May 1. However, the California-bred son of 
The Bart had an excuse because he lost one of his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Slew Of Damascus, beaten favorite in the Rolling Green Handicap at Golden Gate 
Fields in his last start, ending a five-race winning streak, is the likely 
pacesetter in the Californian. The 6-year-old Slewacide gelding was an easy 
winner of the Native Diver Handicap on the Hollywood Park main track last 
December. Corey Nakatani will ride Slew Of Damascus for trainer Craig Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunder Rumble, winner of the 1992 Travers Stakes at Saratoga, will be making 
his third start after being away for 1 1/2 years. He was fourth in a Santa 
Anita sprint, then finished fifth after battling Del Mar Dennis on the lead in 
the Mervyn LeRoy. He will be ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens will ride Hill Pass for trainer Jack Van Berg. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Accountable Lady, impressive in her first two starts, is the 6-5 favorite 
against four 3-year-old rivals in the $106,400 Railbird Stakes today at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 A daughter of The Minstrel out of Issues n'Answers and trained by Neil 
Drysdale, Accountable Lady broke her maiden by 1 1/4 lengths in 1:09 4/5 on 
April 9, then returned 19 days later to beat allowance fillies and mares by 
five lengths in 1:15 1/5. Delahoussaye will ride her. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirate's Revenge is the 9-5 second choice in the seven-furlong race. The other 
starters are Sophisticatedcielo, Beautiful Gem and Sportful Snob.

COMMENTARY; NATIONAL BET BREAKS SLOWLY FROM THE GATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For anybody who loves to play the horses, the concept of the National Best 
Seven is irresistible. The wager consists of seven stakes races run at tracks 
across the country, and picking all the winners could produce a potential 
bonanza. With the races scheduled a few minutes apart, so that they fit within 
the format of a one-hour television program, the action is breathtakingly fast. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Best Seven made its debut Monday, its problems were more 
conspicuous than its virtues. The introduction of the wager had been beset by 
various legal and political difficulties, and it hadn't been well-publicized. 
Offered at 25 tracks, plus many off-track betting outlets, wagering on the Best 
Seven totaled a mere $371,075. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were anticlimactic too. The Best Seven had too many uncompetitive 
races and formful winners, and instead of yielding a windfall it paid a paltry 
$190.75 to the many people who held perfect tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Best Seven is the creation of the Thoroughbred Racing Associations, the 
organization of the nation's tracks, which is seeking new ways to promote the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Scherf, executive vice president of the TRA, said, "Whenever we talk to 
television people, they complain that racing is two minutes of action in a 
60-minute show. We hope that the Best Seven becomes the basis of a TV program 
that will reach beyond the track into the home." The TRA wants the Best Seven 
to have the widespread appeal and availability of a lottery, one whose results 
would unfold in a weekly hour-long network television show. To appeal to the 
lottery crowd, the unit price of the new wager was set at 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The TRA's goal sounded laudable and uncontroversial, and it ought to have 
generated enthusiastic support from all parties with an interest in horse 
racing. But the months of preparation for the Best Seven underscored just how 
difficult it is for the industry to act in concert on a national level. 
Different state regulations on wagering kept getting in the way. Technicalities 
prevented New York from taking part in the Best Seven. Texas doesn't have a law 
applying to such a wager, so it couldn't participate. Nevada's race books 
wouldn't offer the bet because they thought the fee was too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 But the major obstructions came from horsemen's groups, who jockeyed for 
bigger slices of the Best Seven revenue or who simply feared the wager because 
it was something different. Horsemen in Kentucky worried that the Best Seven 
might occasionally take away from betting on their local pick six, which might 
cost them money, and this minor concern kept their state out of the Best Seven 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 Racing fans in Maryland did get the chance to watch and wager on the Best 
Seven, but they bet less than $33,000, and to anybody at Laurel or Pimlico it 
was obvious what was wrong with the presentation. Yes, the rapid-fire action of 
the Best Seven was potentially a terrific show. But Pimlico's "live" program 
was still the main offering on the track's in-house television, and its 
coverage of the 11th race -- a rock-bottom event for maiden fillies -- got top 
billing over this national extravaganza. For the Best Seven to capture 
racegoers' attention, it shouldn't run concurrently with live races. But 
horseplayers don't want to sit with no action for the balance of an hour if 
they don't play the Best Seven or get knocked out of it early. They have to be 
given the chance to bet individually on the races that comprise the Best Seven 
-- and that is not possible now. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another logistical problem involving the Best Seven that was evident 
yesterday: scratches. The industry may envision a wager that can be bet almost 
as easily as a lottery, but the Maryland Lottery never has to scratch No. 24. 
People who had handicapped the Best Seven and planned their strategy had to 
make plenty of revisions when they learned, at 1:20 p.m., that six horses had 
been scratched from the races. 
</P>
<P>
 The Best Seven is not going to generate big business if bettors have to wait 
till three or four hours before the races to make their decisions. Late changes 
ought to be kept to an absolute minimum, but the needs of the Best Seven 
conflict with racing rules that allow scratches in stakes races up to 45 
minutes before post time. 
</P>
<P>
 Various other problems afflicted the Best Seven in various locations. Some 
tracks didn't have betting slips; some didn't have past performances for the 
horses. In Maryland, there was no sound on the telecast for part of the 
afternoon -- which was not much of a loss, because the closed-circuit TV show, 
broadcast to all participating tracks, was pretty uninformative. 
</P>
<P>
 From the TRA's standpoint, the good news was that the mechanics of wagering 
went smoothly. "Operationally," said Scherf, "this was a lot better than the 
other national wagers." 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everybody in racing would love to see the Best Seven succeed. It 
would be a source of excitement and revenue but, perhaps most important, it 
would show that the industry can develop innovative ideas and make them work. 
The early results of the Best Seven have not inspired much confidence in that 
proposition.

SHUMAN PUSHES HEWLETT IN CROWD PLEASER

 The new IMCA Sprint Car class got a big boost Friday night at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending SCRA Sprint Car champion and eight-time USAC Turkey Night Grand Prix 
Midget winner Ron Shuman, in town for tonight's SCRA program at Ventura, 
stepped into an IMCA Sprint Car and gave the crowd a show in the 15-lap main 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Tempe, Arizona, native finished second to Ventura resident Paul 
Hewlett, his mere presence prevented the feature from becoming the one-man show 
it has been in weeks past. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's Randy Moody led the first three laps before spinning coming out of 
Turn 4, with Hewlett and Shuman running second and third. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point, the two racers distanced themselves from the rest of the 
field, running bumper-to-bumper until the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Maria's Ryan Cole went wire-to-wire in the 15-lap IMCA Modified feature, 
and James Weston of Santa Barbara passed Street Stock points leader and 
defending champion Paul Moore of Oak View with two laps remaining to win his 
second 20-lap main event. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Dunson of Santa Barbara won the 15-lap Mini Stock main, and Oak View's 
Scott Boucher won the Pony Stock 15-lap main and seven-lap Figure-8 race.

PARACLETE WILLING TO TAKE THE 5TH; DIVISION V SOFTBALL: SPIRITS, FOUR-TIME 
LOSERS IN FINALS, FACE CERRITOS VALLEY CHRISTIAN FOR TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A championship is past due, Paraclete High softball Coach Margaret Neill says. 
</P>
<P>
 Paraclete is making its fifth appearance in 14 years in a Southern Section 
final and the team still is looking for its first title. 
</P>
<P>
 Neill, in her 15th year at Paraclete, doesn't intend to be a five-time 
runner-up. The Spirits (24-5) will face Cerritos Valley Christian (23-3-1) in 
the Division V final today at 2:30 p.m. at Mayfair Park in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Paraclete, winner of the High Desert League title the past 16 seasons, reached 
the second round of the playoffs last year. Six starters return from that team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe that's what is driving us," Neill said. "We exited earlier than we 
wanted to (last year)." 
</P>
<P>
 Paraclete is paced by two Division I recruits. Senior ace Jamie Johnston 
(18-5), a right-hander who has signed with Central Michigan, averages nearly 
nine strikeouts a game and has a 0.60 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 The other half of the battery is catcher Ashley Gayer, a four-year starter who 
will play for Indiana next year. Gayer, the leadoff hitter, led the team with a 
.480 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Kristal Nessa (.420) and senior Adrian Bates (.380) are two of eight 
starters batting better than .300. 
</P>
<P>
 Paraclete will face a formidable opponent in Cerritos Valley Christian, which 
is unbeaten in 24 games after starting the season with three losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crusaders, who also have never won a softball title, are making their 
second appearance in a championship game -- 19 years after their first. They 
are three-time defending Olympic League champions and have lost in the 
semifinals to the eventual section champion in each of the past two seasons. 
This year is quite different, Coach Eleanor Dykstra said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came out on a mission and they haven't disappointed," Dykstra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore left-hander Susie Schoales is 15-2 and has pitched 87 consecutive 
scoreless innings. The Crusaders are led by Sara Van Diest, Erin Fluck, Angela 
Robinson and Cindy Dykstra, the coach's daughter.

COLLEGE WORLD SERIES NOTEBOOK; INJURY LIMITS POWELL IN TOURNAMENT OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Dante Powell is definitely not the same player as he was before he injured his 
hamstring in the NCAA regional championship game Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really rough to not be at 100% for something like this," the Titan 
outfielder said after Cal State Fullerton lost to Georgia Tech, 2-0, Friday. 
"When you're the leadoff hitter, it's your job to be the catalyst for the team, 
but it hurts when you're not able to steal and do things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell grounded out three times and popped up once. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leg was tender," Powell said. "It hurt some, but I fought through it. The 
two corners of the outfield picked me up on defense. I told them that they were 
probably going to have to do that. I couldn't run the way I normally would down 
the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell thought Georgia Tech's Brad Rigby pitched well in shutting the Titans 
down on three hits, but Powell pointed to another factor. "We were too 
undisciplined at the plate in this game," Powell said. "We'll need to do better 
than that. Cal State Fullerton never does anything the easy way, though. We'll 
come back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans' Mike Parisi gave up the home run to Georgia Tech's Michael Sorrow 
in the seventh inning on a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorrow said he guessed right on the pitch. "In my first at-bat, he came in on 
me. Then he threw me a first-pitch slider, and I was guessing fastball all the 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taught to get ahead of the hitter and I wanted to do that with the 
fastball," Parisi said.  
</P>
<P>
 Parisi said he felt strong in the game and was fully recovered from the NCAA 
regional last week. "I was as fresh as I've ever been," he said. "That wasn't a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Arizona State comes into the tournament with a lot of emotion about Coach Jim 
Brock. Brock, here for the 13th time as a coach, has cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of his colon has been removed along with a substantial part of his 
liver. He has lost 40 pounds and has jaundice. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned almost all the coaching duties this season to his assistants, Bill 
Kenneberg and John Pierson. They ran the team with Brock as an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Coach Augie Garrido is one of three coaches in the field whose teams 
have won two national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 He has seen some unexpected things happen before in Omaha, and he's not 
conceding anything after his team's loss to Georgia Tech. "People who appear to 
be sure-fire winners will get beat, and someone will do something to defy the 
odds," Garrido said. "That's the fun of all this." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other coaches here in addition to Garrido have won two championships. Skip 
Bertman of Louisiana State coached teams to titles in 1991 and 1993. Jim Brock 
of Arizona State had championship teams in 1977 and 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Cochell is back in the World Series with Oklahoma. No other coach has 
brought teams from three schools to the World Series. He also coached Oral 
Roberts in 1978 and Fullerton in 1988 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Matt Wagner, who will be the Titans' starting pitcher Sunday, was chosen to 
the National Collegiate Baseball Writers All-America first team this week. 
Parisi was named to the second team. 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Jeff Ferguson was picked on Baseball America's second team. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech catcher Jason Varitek was chosen as Baseball America's college 
player of the year. He went into Friday's game against the Titans batting .432. 
His teammate, shortstop Normar Garciaparra, also was a first-team choice. World 
Series Notes 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 fans supporting Fullerton were on hand for the Titan loss to 
Georgia Tech. Among them was Ed Parisi, whose son was the Titan starter. He 
said he was pleased to hear that his son was drafted by the Florida Marlins. 
Parisi was picked in the sixth round. "I think he'll have more opportunity with 
one of the new teams," he said. "He thought he would go somewhere between the 
fifth and fifth rounds. It was just a little later than what we expected." . . 
. The NCAA has agreed to keep the College World Series in Omaha through 2000. . 
. . Miami has the best won-lost record of the teams in the World Series at 
49-12.

 Dave Scott, six-time Hawaii Ironman Triathlon champion, leads an elite field 
competing in the Orange County Performing Arts Center Triathlon on Sunday at 
Lake Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-three finishers in the triathlon, which features a 1,500-meter swim, 
40-kilometer bike ride, and 10-kilometer run, will represent the United States 
at the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg, Russia, this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Smith, who won the 1993 World Championship, Brad Kearns, a two-time 
winner of the Orange County Performing Arts Center Triathlon, and 1993 
runner-up Andy Carlson are scheduled to compete in the men's race. Greg Welch, 
who won the '92 Orange County race, is also scheduled to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Michellie Jones, who won the 1993 World Championship and the Orange County 
race last year, and Karen Smyers, who finished second to Jones at the World 
Championship, lead the women's field. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of the men's and women's race will receive as Mazda Miata. The purse 
for the event is $20,000. The professional race begins at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 1,500 amateurs are also expected to compete. That race will begin 
at 7 a.m. and is shorter than the pro course with a .6-mile swim, 18.6-mile 
bike ride, and five-mile run. 
</P>
<P>
 The event has raised more than $500,000 for the Performing Arts Center in its 
first eight years. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

A LONG WAIT FOR RUSH HOUR; POP MUSIC: THE BLUES VETERAN -- AT THE COACH HOUSE 
MONDAY -- DOESN'T THINK HE'S GOTTEN THE RECOGNITION HE'S DUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The pain in Otis Rush's psyche runs as deep, sad and angry as the notes he 
wrings from his guitar. Forty-plus years as one of the most influential and 
imitated performers of the blues have brought him precious little in the way of 
financial gain or personal fame, and he never seems to forget it, not for an 
instant. Even a new, high-profile album release on Mercury Records has done 
little to soothe wounds that have been festering for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The enigmatic Rush has released a disproportionate number of records -- "All 
Your Love (I Need Loving)," "I Can't Quit You Baby," "Double Trouble" and 
"Homework" among them -- that have been covered ad infinitum, becoming blues 
standards. Often, he has been cited as a prime inspiration by such guitar 
heroes as Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Johnny Winter. But his own music 
has remained relatively obscure, his persona shrouded in a reputation for 
bitterness and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent phone interview from his home in Chicago, Rush (who plays 
Monday night at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano) still seemed 
shellshocked by his past, even as "Ain't Enough Comin' In" -- his first studio 
recording in almost a decade and the only heavily promoted, major label release 
of his career -- was hitting stores throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason it's been so long (between records) is I didn't want to record for 
anyone," he said. "I just found some people I wanted to work with. But I'd die 
before I record for these other companies, and I'm serious about that -- like a 
heart attack with cancer! I'm not angry, but to tell you the truth, I could 
have done without all the bull---- going on, man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd record, and they wouldn't release my records." He spoke of one album 
recorded "in '71 and it didn't come out 'til '77. I needed a record out, and 
they didn't want to be bothered with it. It was nominated for a Grammy award, 
and if they would have released it in '71 or '72, I might have won it. That's 
why I got tired of all the bull---- companies around here."

 He softened a bit when discussing his new label. Introduced to Mercury by 
fellow blues legend Buddy Guy, who has enjoyed a rejuvenated career through his 
association with Silvertone Records (which, like Mercury, is a Polygram 
company), Rush said he has seen a reason to believe that things could be 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to have a record that's going to work this time," he said. "What's 
different is that these people are pushing the record. They seem to want to do 
something with it. I'm proud of them. They're pushing, advertising and helping 
me out in different ways. I can't ask for more." 
</P>
<P>
 With the recent successes of such blues brethren as Guy, John Lee Hooker and 
Etta James, perhaps the time finally has arrived for Rush who, at 60, remains 
in full possession of his formidable arsenal of skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush, born in Philadelphia, Miss., moved to Chicago in 1950 and started 
recording for a number of regional and small national labels. His sole hit to 
date has been "I Can't Quit You, Baby," a song written by Willie Dixon, for 
Cobra Records in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as wider commercial renown eluded him, Rush's stinging guitar, 
impassioned vocals and eerie, minor-key compositions found favor among a new 
generation of rock musicians in the '60s, many of whom covered his material to 
much greater reward than he had received -- which remains yet another sore 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eric Clapton recorded 'All Your Love,' and everyone thought it was his song. 
And he was pretty damn quiet about it for a long time. Musicians are just like 
anything else. It's a scuffle, it's dog eat dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "But yeah, there's some good people in music -- me, myself and I, that's 
three," he added, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, I was an influence on all these people, but they ignore me and push me 
around. I'm not angry, but you check it out and look around -- I'm people's No. 
1 influence, but I'm not making no money, not getting recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those that don't give me recognition, I'll check 'em out later. Like Zep (Led 
Zeppelin) didn't give me credit for 'I Can't Quit You Baby' (included on the 
group's debut album). I just won a W.C. Handy Hall of Fame Award for that song. 
Now what they gonna do? They gotta get out of town. Now they gotta look like a 
fool or something. We gonna have a long talk!" 
</P>
<P>
 While Rush is quick to pepper his verbal catalogue of past slights with the 
assertion that he's "not angry," he doubtless has earned his reputation for 
being bitter. Still, he remains confident about a better future, carried along 
in no small part by deeply held religious convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "God's got something for us all," he said. "Every individual has a mission, 
and I think he gave me this mission. I don't think anybody can stop me from 
getting what I deserve if he wants me to have it. So I trust in God, Jesus, and 
I don't trust anybody else. That's me. I thank God alone for the sunshine."

NEW BLOOD FOR ANCIENT ART FORMS; CHOREOGRAPHY: STUDENTS UNRELATED TO THEIR 
TEACHERS ARE PERFORMING EAST INDIAN DANCE AND MUSIC. 'SHIVANJALI,' TONIGHT IN 
IRVINE, EXEMPLIFIES THE TREND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Historically, East Indian classical music and dance practitioners passed their 
knowledge on only to family members. But as younger generations place their 
interests elsewhere, new students without blood ties to their teachers are 
gaining access to the ancient art forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Acclaimed instructor Guru S.K. Rajarathnam -- whose two sons chose to be 
businessmen rather than dancers -- is one of only six teachers still living who 
came up through the traditional system, says Rajarathnam's longtime student 
Ramya Harishankar. Along with five fellow female students, Harishankar will 
execute her visiting teacher's choreography tonight at Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
They will perform "Shivanjali," a dance epic honoring Shiva, the Hindu God of 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of dancers from India have performed in this country," said Harishankar, 
who runs the Irvine-based Arpana Dance Company, "but we very rarely have the 
opportunity to see artists who belong to this lineage." 
</P>
<P>
 Rajarathnam, 62, will play finger cymbals and "conduct" "Shivanjali" by 
uttering rhythmic syllables, based on drumbeats, that serve as commands for the 
dancers' intricate, syncopated footwork, Harishankar said by phone recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite nice," she said, when Rajarathnam emits these tongue-twisting 
utterances typically performed by women, "because men have a lower, more 
booming voice." 
</P>
<P>
 This propulsive Carnatic music of south India, where Rajarathnam lives (in 
Madras), is the usual accompaniment for Bharata Natyam, the powerful dance 
style in which dancers bring to life poses of ancient temple sculptures with 
their entire bodies, including their lips and expressive, darkly outlined eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rajarathnam, the son of musicians, studied music and dance with his guru, 
Vazhvoor Ramiah Pillai, who pioneered the unique school of Bharata Natyam, 
which Harishankar subsequently studied. 
</P>
<P>
 She began training with Rajarathnam as a preteen in Madras, moved to Orange 
County in 1981, and continues to study with her "guru" during his occasional 
visits here or her trips to India. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis in our style is on grace, with a lot of fluid, soft movements," 
she said. "He didn't have a rigid style, however, so whatever each dancer's 
strength or weakness was, he'd take into consideration while choreographing. He 
encouraged us to express ourselves in our own way, even though the basis for 
what we did was always in traditional Bharata Natyam movement." 
</P>
<P>
 A traditional musical ensemble, also from India, will accompany "Shivanjali," 
which is "an offering to Shiva and depicts the different moods and facets of 
the lord," Harishankar said. These include shortcomings of this divine being, 
perceived as possessing every trait known to humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though he is considered a god, you find fault with him, and talk about 
all his characteristics from a negative perspective, yet with love," she said. 
"That's part of the traditional repertory. These offerings are made to the gods 
and goddesses from every angle, every aspect of feeling and emotion of the lord 
Shiva is brought out and explored." 
</P>
<P>
 In a phone interview from Irvine, where he stayed last week, Rajarathnam said 
through an interpreter that Bharata Natyam observers need not embrace Hinduism 
"to fully understand the art form." The dancers, however, must hold such 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice of the dance by those outside of the tradition's bloodline, he 
said, may have resulted in its slight "dilution." That, however, "is an 
inherent consequence of so many new people learning it," he said, and that 
balances out any negative effect. 
</P>
<P>
 He has some concern, he added, about how well the art form's integrity will be 
preserved, what with the eventual disappearance of blood-related gurus such as 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a little hesitant to commit that everything will be all right" in the 
next 25 or 50 years, Rajarathnam said. "There is a lot of responsibility on the 
students who are now performing the tradition, but I have some level of 
confidence it will be done." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Shivanjali," choreographed by Guru S.K. Rajarathnam, will be performed 
today at Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. 7 p.m. $10 to $20.

ON THE MAN BEHIND THE 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF'; FESTIVAL: THE 'ASHKENAZIC CULTURE 
AND MUSIC' CELEBRATION COMMEMORATES THE LIFE AND TIMES OF AUTHOR SHOLOM 
ALEICHEM. 
</P>

<P>
 A yahrzeit for Sholom Aleichem, who wrote about shtetl, will take place on 
Zuntik . Tzimmes will be served. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a glossary is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sholom Aleichem is known as 'the Yiddish Mark Twain,' " explained Vicki 
Feldon, 72, chairwoman of the "Ashkenazic Culture and Music" celebration Sunday 
at the Jewish Community Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 " Shtetl are the small towns in Eastern Europe where Jewish people lived," 
Feldon said. " Ashkenazic refers to East European Yiddish culture, and a 
yahrzeit is the Ashkenazic marking of the anniversary of a death in the family. 
</P>
<P>
 " Tzimmes is a kind of carrot stew." 
</P>
<P>
 Tzimmes is also the term for a commotion, a big to-do: The program includes 
performances of Yiddish folk songs, fiddle tunes and dancing as well as art 
displays. Special patron tickets will admit bearers to a post-performance 
reception featuring shtetl foods including kugel (noodle pudding), cholent 
(baked beef stew), blintzes (thin rolled pancakes) and mamaliga (cornmeal 
porridge). 
</P>
<P>
 The commemoration begins with free lectures sponsored by the California 
Council for the Humanities. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Fridhandler, who has translated some of Aleichem's works, will look at 
the author's life (1859-1916) and the background for his stories, on which the 
musical "Fiddler on the Roof" was based. Eli Simon of the UC Irvine drama 
department will speak on Aleichem and Yiddish theater. A short excerpt of 
Aleichem's work will be read in English and Yiddish by Fridhandler and Yakob 
Basner. 
</P>
<P>
 "In his will, Aleichem requested that his stories be read aloud in remembrance 
but not in mourning," Feldon noted.  
</P>
<P>
 Feldon earned her master's degree in folklore and mythology at UCLA and her 
Ph.D in comparative culture from UC Irvine with a focus on Eastern European 
immigrants. She'll trace shtetl images in the works of writer Aleichem, painter 
Marc Chagall, photographer Roman Vishniac and illustrator William Gropper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shtetl no longer exists, because they were all destroyed, the people 
annihilated," Feldon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Significant aesthetic expressions in the shtetl world included the wooden 
synagogues built prior to World War I. All of Eastern Europe was at one time 
heavily forested, and the vernacular architecture was wooden. There were 
extremely beautiful buildings, churches as well as synagogues, many thousands 
(of them) destroyed by Nazis," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vishniac made his documentary record of the shtetl villages in the 1930s, 
before the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see photographs of the men and women in the shtetl, you look at the 
paintings, and you find kind of a haunted look in the faces," she said. "These 
people were on the brink, pressured on all sides by the rising tide of 
anti-Semitism. Vishniac's images show children at play that are hardly 
carefree, even pathetic in some ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Aleichem worked at the turn of the century, during the period of pogroms. 
Feldon says that Chagall's strongest works were produced prior to World War I. 
Gropper made his suite of lithographs illustrating Aleichem's stories in the 
1970s in Los Angeles. "Still," Feldon pointed out, "you find this haunted look, 
definitely." 
</P>
<P>
 There are more lighthearted images, she said. Hasidic dance during happy 
events, for instance, is an important Ashkenazic image, and the fiddle even 
more so.  
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately, then, klezmer fiddler Maimon Miller ( klezmorim were itinerant 
shtetl musicians) will play Yiddish wedding tunes at the celebration and speak 
on Romanian klezmer history. Fuundala Folk Dancers, women in their 60s, 70s and 
80s from Leisure World, Laguna Hills, will perform shtetl dances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dance was a means of getting away, the only truly carefree images we find," 
Feldon said. "In that case you're really transported to another world." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Ashkenazic culture often addresses the fact that life is inherently 
difficult, and that periods of unadulterated happiness are rare, other upbeat 
images, the fiddle included, are tempered. 
</P>
<P>
 "In European folklore in general, the fiddle is the devil's instrument," 
Feldon noted. "It can hypnotize people, lead them astray, lure away young 
girls. I would rather ignore that particular aspect, of course. But it is a 
magical instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 She also reiterated one of the themes of the Aleichem short story that 
inspired a Broadway musical: "The ability to celebrate is as precarious as a 
fiddler on the roof." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ashkenazic Culture and Music: A Yahrzeit Commemoration for Sholom Aleichem" 
takes place Sunday at the Jewish Community Center, 250 E. Baker St., Costa 
Mesa. 2:30 to 5:30 p.m. JCC members, $5. Non-members, $8. Patron tickets, $18, 
includes post-performance reception. Free lectures, 2:30 to 3:30 p.m. (714)

 Judicial Endorsement: In our endorsements for Superior Court candidates last 
Sunday we unintentionally wronged Susan Bryant-Deason, a candidate for office 
No. 93.On the basis of incomplete information, we suggested that Bryant-Deason, 
a federal prosecutor, had used racial criteria in targeting prosecutions for 
selling drugs near schoolyards. We are informed by a federal judge that defense 
allegations of such targeting were rejected by the courts and that 
Bryant-Deason played a proper role in enforcing the law. We deeply regret the 
error.

I don't want to contradict her. Yeah, if I have to answer, the meeting took
