SCREENING ROOM; WOLF'S 'NINETEEN' SCREENS TODAY AT GOETHE INSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Films of Konrad Wolf" continues at the Goethe Institute, 5700 Wilshire 
Blvd., with two more outstanding pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf's autobiographical "I Was Nineteen" (today at 7 p.m.) captures 
beautifully, even poetically, the aura of uncertainty surrounding the last days 
of World War II as Russian forces commenced conquering Germany.  
</P>
<P>
 Wolf's alter ego is a likable, well-meaning 19-year-old Russian army 
lieutenant (Jaecki Schwarz), Moscow-born son of a German immigrant father and a 
Russian mother. His ability to speak German finds him ultimately charged with 
trying to persuade, via loudspeaker, German soldiers to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 The film eloquently expresses the awkwardness, danger and occasionally amusing 
aspects of the lieutenant's challenging experience while expressing a tragic 
view of war and a belief in Soviet-German solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the novel by Lion Feuchtwanger, Wolf's gorgeous, richly hued 1971 
"Goya" (Thursday at 7 p.m.), the most ambitious Soviet-East German 
co-production ever, is an epic yet intimate account of the Spanish painter that 
is also one of the great film biographies of an artist, who in this instance 
happened to be a court painter at a time when the Inquisition was in full sway. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Donatas Banionis, who bears a striking resemblance to Paul Sorvino, is superb 
as the larger-than-life Goya, at once a devout Catholic and an irrepressible 
philanderer who had a notorious affair with the Duchess of Alba, and a man who 
gradually realizes he cannot ignore the injustice and oppression of the times 
in which he lived. Wolf has said that what interested him in Goya was "his hard 
road to awareness," and his film is a glorious cry for freedom of expression.

 * A Western Classic: John Ford's 1946 "My Darling Clementine," which plays the 
Monica 4-Plex Wednesday through June 23, is as much a love story as a Western. 
Between the murder of James Earp by cattle rustlers, opening the film, and the 
final confrontation with his killers in the legendary gunfight at the OK 
Corral, Wyatt Earp (Henry Fonda) agrees to become marshal of the wide-open 
Tombstone of 1882. 
</P>
<P>
 He establishes a friendship with the complex, hard-drinking, tubercular Doc 
Holliday (Victor Mature, one of the most underrated stars of the 1940s and 
'50s), becomes smitten with Doc's proper Bostonian fiancee (Cathy Downs) while 
a fiery saloon entertainer (Linda Darnell) dreams of Doc making an honest woman 
of her. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, who embraced all of Tombstone's raffish citizenry, brings to the classic 
confrontation between the good guys and the bad guys a detached compassion. The 
expressive power of this great film is overwhelming: its effortlessly yet 
magnificently composed images, some of them of astonishing depth, all attest to 
an affirmation of human worth and dignity. This film leads into the Monica 
4-Plex's second annual Classic Western Round-Up.

<P>
 * Life After HIV: Kermit Cole's vital and touching "Living Proof: HIV and the 
Pursuit of Happiness" (at the Nuart, Friday through June 23) documents the 
lives and thoughts of HIV-positive subjects of photographer Carolyn Jones, who 
has an ongoing photo history project of the same name. The virtue of both 
undertakings is twofold: first, to show that there can be life after a positive 
diagnosis and, second, to show the wide spectrum of people who have tested 
positive, demonstrating that everyone, not just gay males, is at risk.  
</P>
<P>
 While everyone, of course, wishes they had tested negative, everyone also 
tells us how their HIV status has transformed their lives in an affirmative 
way. The cruel irony with at least one of Jones' subjects is that, as a drug 
addict since age 11, she discovered that her life was worth living only when 
she faced the possibility of losing it. Information: (310) 478-6379. 
</P>
<P>
 * Korean Cinema: Among the films in "South Korea: Ten Years of Cinema" (at the 
Monica 4-Plex Friday through June 23; the Korean Community Cultural Center, 
June 24-30) is Im Kwon-Taek's superb "Sopyonje," a stark tale about a 
hard-drinking, hard-driving master of the plaintive pansori music who wanders 
the countryside with his two foster children. 
</P>
<P>
 As painful as it is profound, the 1993 film reveals the virtually limitless 
sacrifices an art form can demand of its practitioners.

TV REVIEWS; GAYS, LESBIANS AND HATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Underneath the surface of Teodoro Maniaci and Francine Rzeznik's rambling 
90-minute documentary for the "P.O.V." series, "One Nation Under God," lies a 
welter of tribal-like loathings and accusatory stances. While the film is 
ostensibly about the history of psychological and religious techniques to turn 
gays and lesbians into heterosexuals, it is really about the growing 
Balkanization of America. 
</P>
<P>
 In true "P.O.V." tradition, "One Nation" is expressly opinionated, though in 
this case, Maniaci and Rzeznik attempt to provide an overview of what led to 
the so-called "ex-gay" movement among Christians claiming to have changed their 
sexual orientation. The pair means to expose the movement as a fraud motivated 
by hate; in the process, "One Nation" displays as much hate of that group as 
some fundamentalist Christians display toward gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't appear that way at first. Several members of Exodus International, 
a large "ex-gay" Christian organization, clearly and calmly explain their 
individual conversions and frame their changes within the religious context of 
sin and virtue. Many, like Exodus president Sy Rogers, are married and, they 
say, happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Exodus founders Michael Bussee and Gary Cooper, who left Exodus after 
realizing that it was impossible to fight nature. These lovers explain to the 
camera the stresses, pressures and inherent contradictions they see in the 
"ex-gay" movement. 
</P>
<P>
 They, and the filmmakers, then go too far: Michael dismisses some Exodus 
members as "Stepford Wives," then Maniaci and Rzeznik cut to poor Willa 
Medinger of Exodus, who explains a make-over class for women trying not to be 
lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 In a moment of screen time, the two extremes mirror each other. If "One 
Nation's" message had been "You can't fight hate with hate," it loses it here. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is on much surer ground pulling together comments from such veteran 
psychologists as Gerald Davison, who once practiced aversion therapy methods to 
change men from gay to straight, and who now acknowledges its lack of 
scientific basis. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no arguing religion, as Maniaci and Rzeznik must know; but they 
devote too little time detailing the pseudo-science of countless Freudian 
analysts and other psychiatrists who tried to alter their patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Rzeznik says in the film's preface that she discouraged Maniaci 
from turning this subject into a fictional drama. A bad idea, as playwright 
Larry Kramer dramatically proves in his fine play about his own experiences 
with anti-gay Freudians in "The Destiny of Me," which happens to be at Long 
Beach's International City Theatre through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * "One Nation Under God" airs at 10 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV

TV REVIEWS; 'MRS. PIGGLE-WIGGLE' IS JUST THE CURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chalk another one up for Shelley Duvall. The creator of "Faerie Tale Theatre," 
"Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories" and other children's TV shows, tapes and 
computer software has expanded her ambitious entertainment empire with "Mrs. 
Piggle-Wiggle," a new series on the Showtime cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
 It gets off to a shaky start tonight, but watch for future episodes. They're 
almost as good as Duvall's press material claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on decades-old moral lesson books by Betty MacDonald, the series is 
about an eccentric (Jean Stapleton, in clashing stripes and precarious hair) 
who lives in an upside-down house and has special "cures" for such childhood 
maladies as lying, whining, backtalk and sloth. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle shares her home -- oddly proportioned, wildly colorful and 
reminiscent of "Pee-wee's Playhouse" -- with a talking "hat tree" (Francis 
Bell), a parrot and a pot-bellied pig. Her sometimes-seen pirate husband is 
played with obvious relish by James Whitmore, and the general troublemaker is 
Norbert Wainright (Paul Minifie), the "chief inspections officer of playground 
standards and children's practices." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's episode, "The Not Truthful Cure," about a little boy who learns just 
how heavy, literally, "a pack of lies" can be, trips all over itself, too eager 
to please. It trots out characters -- including Christopher Lloyd as the boy's 
yarn-spinning grandfather -- scene changes, puns, long words and alliterative 
dialogue in a rushed jumble and takes half the show to get a grip. 
</P>
<P>
 When the pace eases up, the show's strengths have time to sink in: quirky 
imagination, gentle character lessons, a celebration of language and 
Stapleton's unforced appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other episodes screened are immediately and enjoyably accessible: "The 
Snooty Snippety Answer Backer Cure" and, particularly, the inspired wackiness 
of "The Radish Cure," with Ed Begley Jr. and Joan Cusack as the parents of a 
little girl so grimy she sprouts radishes. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle" airs Tuesdays at 7:30 p.m. on Showtime, with repeats 
Thursdays at 7:30 a.m. and Sundays at 8 a.m.

 Just in time for Father's Day: "The Lion King," Disney's latest animated film, 
received a loud reaction at Sunday's premiere in Hollywood -- but it wasn't all 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the scene where the main character's father, Mufasa, dies during a stampede 
of wildebeest, some young spectators in the El Capitan Theatre could be heard 
crying, "Are you OK, Daddy?" and "Daddy! Don't die, Daddy!" 
</P>
<P>
 We mention this as a warning for parents who were stuck for explanations after 
Bambi's mother bit the dust in that tear-jerker.

 Incidentally, for any of Only in L.A.'s 3-year-old readers who have yet to see 
either film, we apologize for giving away key plot developments.

 Project Spaceseed: The L.A. Cacophony Society, a band of practical jokers, has 
taken note of the large number of people who say they were kidnaped by space 
aliens "for purposes of genetic research."  
</P>
<P>
 The society feels that the invaders, "in their attempt to collect genetic 
samples," have inflicted "needless pain and humiliation" upon earthlings. 
</P>
<P>
 To eliminate this nasty problem, society members passed out special packets at 
a recent UFO expo, encouraging UFO believers to contribute to an 
Extraterrestrial Sperm Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cacophony Society hopes to preclude abductions by sending the samples into 
outer space "through channels that necessarily must remain undisclosed."

 They should be hearing from Godzilla's lawyers any time: Claude Plum of L.A. 
saw an automobile commercial on TV in which a monster attacks a city and "the 
announcer says, 'This doesn't frighten Japan but an American car does.' "

<P>
 Plum continues: "The reason that monster doesn't frighten Japan is because 
it's Gorgo and it's attacking London." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, yes, we remember that movie because the ending traumatized us. As the

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first traveling exhibition to tell the story of the world-famous Rancho La 
Brea Tar Pits will take up residence at the Natural History Museum of Los 
Angeles County/Burbank on Friday. The Ice Age road show, "Treasures of the Tar 
Pits," is the culmination of a five-year international tour. Displays include a 
detailed mural showing Rancho La Brea as it probably looked 20,000 years ago 
and a video showing the tar pits as they appear today. 
</P>
<P>
 The video includes explanations of how the tar pits were formed and how 
millions of animals were trapped there over the last 40,000 years. Interviews 
with George C. Page Museum paleontologists are part of the video. 
</P>
<P>
 Also featured in the exhibit are the skeletons of six Ice Age mammals, 
including two dire wolves, a coyote, a giant ground sloth, a saber-toothed cat 
and a North America lion. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite exhibit among young visitors to the Page Museum, "Asphalt Is 
Sticky," has been adapted for this exhibit. Visitors pull up on weighted 
handles in containers of tar, demonstrating the difficulty that trapped animals 
faced in trying to escape their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Treasures of the Tar Pits" will be at the Burbank Natural History Museum 
through Sept. 5. Call (818) 557-3562.

AL MARTINEZ: SUCH GOOD FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If he lives to be a hundred, John Harris won't forget the still life of 
compassion captured in the light of a flare on a Christmas Eve long ago: a 
paratrooper using his body to shield him from death. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris sees it as though it were yesterday, the man and his weapon merged into 
one motionless unit, leaning in front of him, ready to take bullets meant for 
him, mindless of the consequences that combat sacrifices encompass. 
</P>
<P>
 He hears the sputtering of the flare against a silence too vast to be real, 
and remembers shadows that danced against the massive jungle foliage . . . but 
mostly he visualizes the soldier. It's a memory that never grows old. 
</P>
<P>
 War often fashions permanent friendships, and this is one. It was born almost 
30 years ago in a combat zone north of Saigon at the very start of U.S. 
fighting in Vietnam and continues to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was a young reporter for the Hearst Newspapers and had volunteered, 
however reluctantly, to accompany a squad of the 173rd Airborne Brigade on an 
ambush patrol. Its leader was Staff Sgt. Charles Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Christmas Eve, and as darkness lowered over the jungle, they could hear 
Vietnamese children singing "Silent Night" somewhere in the distance. Rather 
than uplift, the music somehow enhanced a notion that had been growing since 
the patrol began: Harris felt beyond a doubt he would die that night. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of death, he found quiet heroism. After a burst of gunfire, they 
heard Viet Cong soldiers coming, and Brown placed himself deliberately between 
the enemy and the reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they returned to base safely, Brown's gesture -- seen through the quick 
light of a grenade flare -- had been imprinted on Harris' memory. He's thought 
about it ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnam War ended a long time ago, and it's the wrong season for a 
Christmas story, but this goes beyond that. Brown retired from the Army after 
27 years and three Bronze Stars, and was living in Dallas when he began 
thinking about the night he met Harris. The year was 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a good time for Brown. He was drinking hard to escape the 
nightmares that ride through disquieting dreams of war. "There is so much 
effort, so much blood, so much dying," he says as we sit at a sidewalk cafe in 
Hollywood. "Then suddenly it comes to a dead stop. Suddenly it's over. Where do 
you go from there?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's never really over. Brown was suffering from a deep depression, and in the 
midst of darkness reached out for Harris. He remembered the reporter as someone 
who thought enough of them to risk his life by accompanying their squad on a 
night that promised nothing but danger. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to say what bound the two men together, the emotionalism of 
Christmas Eve or the intensity of the feeling that each cared about the other. 
Retired now after 25 years as a journalist, 10 of them overseas, Harris was in 
Rome in 1979 when Brown, half-drunk in Dallas, telephoned him. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps sensing the pain in his voice and remembering that night 14 years 
earlier, Harris joined him in Texas and began helping him through the 
nightmares. When he left newspapering and moved to L.A. to write books and 
screenplays, he brought Brown with him, got him a job and tried to put him back 
on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe him," Harris says simply. The two men sit across from each other, 
middle-aged now, linked by the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's my moral support," Brown says, still looking military crisp in 
razor-creased denims. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris is more than that. He's gotten Brown out of jail when he was arrested 
for drunk driving, loaned him money when he needed it and let him sleep on the 
couch when he had no place else to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown spent a year in a V.A. hospital fighting a depression that threatened to 
consume him, and Harris was there for him then too. The ex-journalist visited 
the ex-soldier almost every weekend, easing him through a long night of 
emotional pain as Brown had once eased him through a long night of peril. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was beat after the war, both mentally and physically," Brown says, 
fingering a paratrooper's ring. "There were just too damned many memories." 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have given his life for me," Harris says. He's the perfect 
embodiment of a war correspondent grown older, a handsome man with a boxer's 
flattened nose. "At least I can give him my time." 
</P>
<P>
 Debts are repaid in a thousand ways, in this case through friendship. Harris 
and Brown see each other often and spend every Christmas Eve together. And they 
share the memory of a single, isolated moment caught in the hard light of a 
combat flare that, for both of them, has never stopped burning.

TWISTED ROAD FOR STREET VENDORS; WOULD-BE SELLERS ARE FACING BUREAUCRATIC SNARL 
UNDER NEW L.A. SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elation among vendors over last January's Los Angeles City Council decision to 
legalize sidewalk selling has been replaced by dismay. That's because the city 
has left them facing a bureaucratic maze that would discourage even the 
savviest followers of urban government. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't list everything that must take place before a legal vending district 
can be established; that would take up the rest of this space. We will share 
what the council has and has not done, and a bit of what is being attempted to 
negotiate the maze. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council vote allowed establishment of up to eight zones in which 
sidewalk vending would be legal for those who had acquired the proper permits 
and paid the appropriate fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is not required to take any initial action in deciding where those 
zones would be. That is up to the vendors, who must organize themselves and 
obtain enough support in a given location (a thumbs-up from 20% of the 
merchants and residents) to start the ball rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Street Vendors Assn. of the San Fernando Valley is setting the 
standard for this activity, with the help of Mission College and the advice of 
such local groups as the Coalition of Women for Economic Development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley vendors have begun seeking signatures of support in the Pacoima and 
Panorama City areas. If they are successful, they can move on to step two, in 
which a community advisory committee is established. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Valley group is so well organized, it has made the most of the 
advice from the city government's Sidewalk Vending Program. Other vendors 
around the city should follow its lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness it must be said there are far too many contradictions in the 
city's actions. In 1993, when no action had been taken to legalize vending, 952 
misdemeanor citations were issued against vendors. In the five months following 
the City Council vote to allow sidewalk vending, 850 citations already have 
been written. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the crackdown on vendors when the city has made it so difficult to comply 
with its law? If all this sounds like a city government working at cross 
purposes, that's exactly what it is.

HEALTH WATCH; HOLD THE FAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 School lunches -- typically a hamburger and fries or pizza -- serve up too 
much fat: The federal regulations allowing such high fat content have been in 
effect since 1946, long before lean and nutritious dietary patterns were widely 
emphasized. Now new regulations proposed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
would require healthier fare in school cafeterias. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules would force schools to limit the fat content of meals to 30% of 
calories and saturated fat to 10% in an average week. Those reasonable 
requirements ought to help keep arteries unclogged. 
</P>
<P>
 Eating habits are established by age 12, according to the USDA report 
announcing the changes. School lunches contribute to adult dietary patterns. 
Bad habits learned early can lead to chronic illness and premature death. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's 1995 budget request seeks $18.4 million for 
nutritional education and technical assistance. Washington will be requiring 
school dietitians to provide a computer analysis of lunchtime nutrition. The 
proposed regulations would require schools to serve more fresh vegetables and 
fruits, and that could prove expensive. The Administration should consider the 
extra costs under the new rules, which would go into effect in July of 1998. 
(The 1998 date is too far away; making this important dietary change in 1996 
would be much better.) 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government spends $4.7 billion for lunches for 25 million 
youngsters in 92,000 schools every year. The proposed new lunch rules would 
make that federal spending an investment in healthier futures.

CAN'T WAIT FOR A FEDERAL ANSWER; STATE, INDUSTRY MUST FACE INSURANCE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision by 20th Century Industries to begin immediately phasing out its 
homeowners and earthquake insurance business does not signal a crisis in 
insurance availability, but it does point up the possibility of a shortage in 
coverage for homeowners, especially in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Within three years, the state's eighth-largest insurer plans to stop offering 
its clients homeowners coverage. Effective immediately, it will write no new 
policies. At the same time, under a special exemption granted by Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi, the company will stop offering its policyholders 
quake coverage, beginning with policies up for renewal from July 23 on. The 
exemption was necessary because companies that sell homeowners coverage must 
offer earthquake insurance as well. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 240,000 owners of houses and condominiums are insured with 20th 
Century. About 90,000 carry earthquake insurance, and about 25,000 of these 
live in the San Fernando Valley. Like nearly every other large insurer 20th 
Century was hit hard by quake-related claims, with its losses reaching about 
$600 million. That exposure wiped out two-thirds of the company's surplus and 
might leave it facing bankruptcy if another large quake were to occur. 20th 
Century will stay in the automobile insurance business, but even with newly 
granted rate increases it says it can't afford to continue its homeowner 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is that other insurance companies aren't falling all over 
themselves right now to sign up 20th Century's customers. In fact, State Farm 
Insurance Co., California's largest insurer, has frozen most sales of new 
homeowners policies. Other big insurers are considering similar action. With 
more than $6 billion in insured quake losses, some insurers are skittish about 
increasing or in some cases even maintaining their exposure in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term response to the threat of possible catastrophic losses has to be 
a national program to insure against natural disasters of all kinds -- floods, 
quakes, hurricanes and the like. Legislation to provide for such coverage has 
been introduced but has not progressed in Congress. For California 
specifically, the immediate response has to be effective actions to make sure 
that all homeowners who want earthquake coverage are able to find it, at a 
reasonable cost. If homeowners and earthquake insurance sales are restricted, 
the housing market would inevitably suffer and the state's troubled economy 
along with it. Here clearly is a problem that demands top-priority attention 
from the insurance industry and from those in Sacramento who are charged with 
safeguarding the interests of the industry's clients.

POPULATION CONTROL, RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his diatribe condemning forced abortion as a means of population control 
("Column Right," June 3), Pat Buchanan quotes the U.S. cardinals' commandment 
to the President: "Do not allow our country to (trample) the rights and 
religious values of people around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, self-righteous religious zealots have consistently advocated 
trampling the rights of others to force unwanted pregnancies. Could Buchanan be 
signaling their conversion to the pro-choice position? Or is he merely 
exercising his boundless hypocrisy? 
</P>
<P>
 DONALD E. WATSON 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 * I love it when you run Alexander Cockburn and Buchanan on the same day; it 
gives idiocy such sublime symmetry. On June 3, for instance, one thinks Clinton 
ought to be celebrating the end of World War II in Leningrad (or whatever 
they're calling it these days) and the other thinks Clinton ought to be drawing 
up his social policies at the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible these two knuckleheads were separated at birth? 
</P>
<P>
 DAN RILEY 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 * Buchanan asked why the Clinton Adminstration has "outraged and provoked the 
Catholic hierarchy" with the Administration's family-planning policies. 
</P>
<P>
 While I cannot speak for the President, I can venture a guess. The traditional 
values that Buchanan defends were formulated several thousand years ago, when 
it was difficult to maintain population size and wars were won by the side with 
the biggest army. 
</P>
<P>
 Now world population has grown to a size that the ancients could scarcely 
comprehend. We are forced to steal irreplaceable natural resources from unborn 
generations, and we are wrecking their environment. To top it off, the value of 
the individual's vote continues to be eroded by our burgeoning numbers. The 
voice of the individual is drowned by the din of the masses and government 
becomes more and more remote. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the advice of the ancients regarding population growth is no longer 
relevant. Regardless of the motivation of the current Administration, it is 
correct to challenge values that seek to promote population growth.

NUCLEAR DUMP CLOSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In regard to "Nuclear Waste Dump Shuts Doors to All but 8 States" (June 4), 
South Carolina's decision to limit access to their nuclear waste facility is 
great! This decision will force California to open the Ward Valley site. The 
environmentalists' concern about contaminating the ground water in the area is 
a non-problem.Unprocessed nuclear waste (or chemical waste) can be rendered 
harmless for storage at Ward Valley (or the ocean) by the process of 
solidification in plaster of Paris, and stored in concrete pipe, sealed at both 
ends with concrete. The cost of this approach is minuscule. Let's hope our 
bureaucrats "see the light." 
</P>
<P>
 PHIL C. BALDWIN

<P>

<P>
 * The Ward Valley dump site should never be built. The argument that medical 
care would suffer is untrue. Non-radioactive technologies, which are safe and 
non-polluting, exist to replace the radioactive systems, which are dangerous 
and must be continuously stored for up to thousands of years. The new 
technology can be used for both medical care and medical research. The new 
non-radioactive technologies have not been fully implemented because the dump 
sites provide a cheap subsidy to users of radioactivity that should be borne by 
those users, not the taxpayers. The taxpayers will ultimately have to clean up 
Ward Valley 30 or 40 years from now when the private company has taken its 
profit and is long gone.

RAISING BUS FARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By proposing to raise bus fares to balance their budget (May 28), the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, in typical Los Angeles fashion, 
chooses style over substance. They reject the substance of providing 
transportation for people who need and use it (the 75,000 daily bus passengers 
who will be lost) for the style of rail-transit projects that will probably 
never generate 75,000 new transit riders. 
</P>
<P>
 With one-quarter of the current MTA budget going toward rail construction 
projects, the future of transportation in Los Angeles is bleak. The MTA will 
have to continue cannibalizing the bus system, which provides the overwhelming 
bulk of public transportation in L.A., to pay the ever-increasing costs of rail 
projects. I do not blame only the MTA board for this; they merely reflect the 
current political and funding climate that promotes building monuments (rail 
systems) rather than solving problems (providing transportation). 
</P>
<P>
 KEITH PRICE 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * The people in Los Angeles who need the bus should not be made to bear 
another rate increase. Why is this so easy for the MTA to ignore? How do they 
so conveniently lose interest in their riders -- those who have the least 
ability to absorb added costs, who are not clogging the roads with cars -- just 
the old, the poor, the disabled, the young trying to get back and forth?  
</P>
<P>
 We threw away the Red Car, then we started digging a subway nobody really 
wants here in earthquake town. Transit is a public trust. It needs to be there, 
to be cheap, and it needs to be run for the benefit of riders, not the MTA. I 
suggest bus fare be returned to 59 cents and the balance of the budget derived 
from a gasoline tax, and for further savings take a good look at who is running 
the MTA.

PRIMARY ELECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the massive failure of bond measures, I believe that voters (those 
of us who vote) have finally sent the politicians a message, which, as I 
expect, they will fail to understand. The message is: Voters are fed up with 
the lavish retirement benefits bestowed on selected individuals and huge salary 
increases for high-ranking government administrators and politicians. In the 
past decade, whenever voters approved these bond measures (which relieved 
fiscal pressures on state and local government budgets), we often found that 
agency heads and politicians often pocketed this money rather than spent it to 
benefit the general public. Maybe this time, these huge salary and retirement 
benefit increases can be stopped.

Repair of public works to the side, this measure was the last hope for funding 
CALDAP, which was the last hope of assistance for thousands of victims who have 
been turned down by the SBA for emergency disaster loans. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess it's just another sign of the times. All feelings of belonging to some

 * Is the influence of money in politics the end of democratic government? For 
the past few months, Californians have faced daily headlines alerting them of 
the fact that Michael Huffington had won his congressional seat, and was in the 
process of winning the Republican senatorial primary, because of his personal 
wealth.  
</P>
<P>
 The fact that his predecessor in the House consistently outspent his previous 
challengers, despite his advantage in name recognition as an incumbent, has not 
lessened the attacks on Huffington.  
</P>
<P>
 The influence of money in politics appears to be the media event in this 
election, the way term limits was before. The democratic process will not 
improve, whatever regulations are applied on the receipt or expenditure of 
political donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The democratic process is in danger, not because of money or because of 
tenure, but because only 33% of registered voters cast their vote, which means 
that less than 17% of the registered voters decide who will make the laws in 
this country. Add to that picture the 2,092,215 non-elected federal employees, 
(Defense Department not included), who interpret and administer the laws 
enacted by the elected legislators, and then you will understand why our 
representative government is not representative.

FINDING A SAFE WAY TO SUBDUE VIOLENT SUSPECTS; LAPD: THE 'CHOKEHOLD' BAN MERITS 
RATIONAL RECONSIDERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MEYER, Greg Meyer, an LAPD lieutenant and a police-tactics consultant, 
was an expert witness in the punitive-damages phase of the King civil trial. 
Views here are his own. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that the latest chapter is closed on the Rodney King tragedy, what has the 
City of Los Angeles learned? Why did the jury award King $3.8 million from the 
city treasury for general damages, but not a dime in punitive damages from the 
officers involved in his beating? The jury appears to have decided that the 
real roots of the King beating were to be found in the LAPD policy that for 
nine years allowed officers to beat resisting suspects with metal pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 The repulsive procedures caught on the King videotape were in effect 
sanctioned by the City Council and the Board of Police Commissioners in 1982 
when so-called chokeholds were taken out of routine use. The action was in 
response to a public outcry that blamed the deaths of some suspects in custody 
on chokeholds. (The technique, properly known as an upper-body control hold, 
applies pressure to the carotid artery in the neck to render the subject 
unconscious.) 
</P>
<P>
 It was a case of emotional rather than rational policy-making, even though 
some people warned that baton beatings would be the inevitable result. Said 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky: "If we don't have the holds, the next level of 
force . . . is the baton, and it's more dangerous from the maiming standpoint." 
Councilman Robert Farrell declared that it would be more " 'cost effective' for 
the city to settle claims for broken bones of combative suspects who are hit 
with batons rather than to pay settlements" in chokehold cases.  
</P>
<P>
 Chief Daryl Gates told the Police Commission on May 7, 1982, that batons 
"would result in injury in almost every case, a result which does not occur 
from employment of upper-body control holds." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, five days later, the Police Commission put the chokeholds on a par with 
"deadly force" (the same as shooting someone). A huge gap in the police 
use-of-force continuum was created, and it was not adequately filled. Thousands 
of people were subjected to batons and kicks who otherwise would not have been. 
On Jan. 4, 1984, Gates informed the City Council that injuries to suspects had 
risen 661% and injuries to officers had risen 521% in a before-and-after 
comparison pursuant to the chokehold moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief's request to make policy more humane was ignored. The beatings 
continued until George Holliday tested his new video camera to record police 
activity near his apartment on March 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with these types of pronouncements and decisions by elected officials 
and police commissioners, how could the jury hold the officers personally 
accountable for the results of such a poor policy process? 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, media attention has turned to deaths that occurred after violent 
suspects were hobbled -- "hog tied" -- their arms and legs drawn together 
behind them. The phenomenon known as "positional asphyxia," which was not 
discovered until the late 1980s, is apparently to blame. Typically, drug and 
alcohol abuse are contributing factors in many of these deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Institute of Justice and the International Assn. of Chiefs of 
Police have just completed a study that estimates that four out of five 
in-custody deaths are due to positional asphyxia. If the Los Angeles "chokehold 
death" cases were reinvestigated, one would probably find that the subjects 
also had been "hog tied" and that the deaths were consistent with positional 
asphyxia, not chokeholds, which many agencies continue to use with regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 So what are the solutions? 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers and jailers will continue to have violent confrontations with 
persons who choose to resist. And the public will grow tired of making 
millionaires out of convicted criminals and others who resisted arrest. The 
public must insist on a re-evaluation of police policy in a more rational 
policy-making process than Los Angeles experienced in the early 1980s. 
Law-enforcement leaders must adopt a more humane use of force on a scale 
governed by the severity of injuries that result from any given tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government is developing improved non-lethal weapons technologies, 
but more with an eye on preventing another Waco than putting something 
effective into the hands of the average cop. If we can put a man on the moon 
and return him safely to Earth, why can't we put a man on the ground and take 
him safely to jail?

COLUMN LEFT/ STEVE EARLY: WORKER ABUSE IS DOCUMENTED; NOW, ACTION; LABOR, 
GASPING FROM UNFAIR EMPLOYER TACTICS, NEEDS LAWS, NOT SYMPATHY, FROM 
GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EARLY, Steve Early is a labor journalist and lawyer who works as a 
union representative. He testified before the Dunlop Commission in Boston. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first installment of a study by the Clinton Administration's Commission on 
the Future of Worker-Management Relations was released with great fanfare in 
Washington earlier this month. The 10-member panel, headed by former Labor 
Secretary John Dunlop, spent more than a year pondering what forms of employee 
participation, collective bargaining and dispute resolution might boost 
American productivity and competitiveness and, not incidentally, improve 
working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission's findings provide small comfort to the workers who 
testified before the panel about how management related to them when they tried 
to improve their standard of living or job security by forming a union. Even 
after the commission heard many wrenching tales about violations of workers' 
rights in organizing campaigns, its report emphasizes upbeat accounts of 
"employee involvement" at non-union firms rather than discussing what needs to 
be done to curb unfair labor practices by employers. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dunlop Commission hearings around the country, employees reported that 
attempts to unionize are routinely crushed with harassment, threats, 
intimidation, anti-union propaganda, legal delays and blatant discrimination 
against union activists. Little help is available from the National Labor 
Relations Board, the federal agency responsible for enforcing workers' right to 
organize and bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told the commission -- whose members are mainly academics -- about 
careers damaged, jobs lost and lives disrupted due to widespread union-busting. 
When workers are lucky enough to win a union representation election run by the 
NLRB -- and few do -- management law-breaking doesn't end there. Statistics 
compiled by the commission show that "roughly 40% of workplaces that vote to be 
represented by a union do not obtain a contract with their employer" because so 
many companies "engage in bad-faith bargaining with newly certified unions." 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical bit of understatement, Dunlop & Co. agree that "the probability 
that a worker will be discharged for exercising legal rights under the National 
Labor Relations Act has increased over time." In addition, the commission's 
interim report hints at the existence of another trend that is depriving 
millions of workers the chance to exercise those rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies are now arguing successfully that their personnel aren't even 
"employees" entitled to protection under the law, but managers, supervisors, 
independent contractors, part-timers or temps. The crowning blow came May 23, 
when the Supreme Court ruled that a group of licensed practical nurses -- long 
near the bottom of most health-care hierarchies -- were part of management. It 
effectively barred them from organizing a union on the grounds that they 
"coordinated" patient care by other workers. 
</P>
<P>
 This cockeyed interpretation and the failure of labor law generally cry out 
for congressional relief. But, instead of immediate action on remedial 
legislation, the Dunlop Commission proposes another six months of "discourse" 
to achieve a labor-management consensus on how to reduce conflict and increase 
workplace cooperation. By the time the White House receives any final 
recommendations, it will be after midterm elections, which are not likely to 
improve the congressional climate for labor-law reform. Dunlop's search for 
consensus is, furthermore, a fool's mission. Contrary to one of his "principal 
findings," management does not share with "labor and the general public" any 
real support for "the principle that workers have the right to join a union and 
to engage in collective bargaining if a majority of workers so desire." The 
behavior of virtually all non-union bosses, when faced with employee 
organizing, proves how little support there is. 
</P>
<P>
 Few members of the commission or the Clinton Administration resemble the 
architects of labor-law reform 60 years ago, who produced the now-tattered 
NLRA. In that era, labor-oriented academics and Democrats championed collective 
bargaining as a cornerstone of industrial democracy and economic justice. 
Today's crowd of labor-policy advisers value unions only if they increase 
productivity and efficiency -- a task most managers would rather assign to 
employee committees, teams and quality circles under company control. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoring the right to unionize will take sustained grass-roots pressure and 
publicity. Worker protests over worsening job conditions will provide the main 
impetus for reform, just as they did during the New Deal. Community/labor 
coalitions, like the national "Jobs With Justice" network, can recruit 
students, churches, civil rights and women's groups as allies in the fight. 
Waiting for deliverance from Dunlop, however, is like waiting for Godot -- it's 
never going to arrive.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JONATHAN CLARKE: HOT AIR OVER NORTH KOREA CAN BURN U.S.; THERE'S 
NO EVIDENCE OF NUCLEAR CAPABILITY THAT WARRANTS WAR TALK; LET THE NEIGHBORS 
MEDIATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN CLARKE, Jonathan Clarke, a member of the British diplomatic service 
for 20 years, is now at the Cato Institute in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Administration is talking itself into another foreign-policy debacle -- 
this time over the serious issue of the North Korean nuclear program. If ever a 
situation cried out to be handled with care, precision, attention to detail and 
complete absence of confrontational rhetoric, this was it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration has been all over the map; at one moment apparently 
preparing for imminent war by shipping Patriot missiles to South Korea, the 
next allowing former President Jimmy Carter to carry a diplomatic message from 
President Clinton to Kim Il Sung. These unexplained changes in tactics are 
confusing enough for Americans. Spare a thought for the North Koreans. How can 
they possibly understand American intentions? Before the crisis gets out of 
hand, it is time to pause and take stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us remind ourselves of the state of play. To listen to the bloodcurdling 
warnings of war from senators and syndicated columnists, one might think that 
North Korea possessed a sizable nuclear arsenal, together with delivery 
systems, and was about to bomb Seoul or Tokyo back to the Stone Age. The facts 
are different. All we know is in the negative: The U.N. nuclear regulatory 
agency cannot confirm that the North Koreans have not diverted enough plutonium 
from their nuclear reactors to enable them to make a bomb. The probability is 
that they have, but we have no information -- or at least nothing has been 
shared with the American people -- about whether a North Korean bomb exists or 
is close to existing. Last year, the State Department and CIA aired a public 
disagreement over this very point. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the North Koreans have a bomb, what, if anything, do they intend to 
do with it? Is it intended to defend the homeland against more powerful 
neighbors? To ward off absorption by the South? To extract money and 
international recognition in the manner of Ukraine? To bolster their bankrupt 
economy by selling a bomb or two to Iran, Libya or Iraq? "The fact of the 
matter is that we just don't know," says one American Asia expert.  
</P>
<P>
 This is not a basis for any sort of war, let alone one that would cost a great 
many American lives and leave the capital city of an American ally in ruins. 
The absurd aspect of all this is that everyone realizes -- the North Koreans 
included -- that the war talk is empty, that the President is not going to 
launch war. To do so, Clinton would have to abandon everything else in his 
program, as well as run the risk of bringing his presidency to an inglorious 
end as Americans take to the streets to protest the death toll. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where the seeds of the debacle are being sown. By allowing talk of 
sanctions, which everyone, including an official CIA assessment, knows will not 
work, by failing to rebut the foolish war talk, the Administration is climbing 
yet another mountain of rhetoric from which it will have to stage yet another 
ignominious climb down. 
</P>
<P>
 What is to be done? First, turn down the megaphones, defuse the crisis 
atmosphere. Nuclear proliferation is a very serious matter; it will be with us 
for many years to come. "Doing something" is not enough; we need to be 
effective. If we talk tough but back off just before the point of no return, as 
will inevitably happen when the American people reject the appalling costs of a 
war, U.S. credibility on the issue of non-proliferation will be fatally 
impaired. The result? Perhaps Algeria -- neighbor to Libya and with Islamic 
fundamentalists waiting in the wings -- will decide its time has come.  
</P>
<P>
 Once the spotlight that Kim Il Sung so desperately craves has been turned off, 
the real work can begin. The main actors should be China, Japan and South 
Korea. They are all adamantly opposed to any North Korean bomb and, unlike the 
United States, have real leverage through oil, money and friendship. By turning 
the issue into an exclusively American interest, the Administration has made it 
more difficult for these countries to cooperate without appearing to be 
America's running dogs. The South Korean government is already encountering 
domestic opposition on this point. 
</P>
<P>
 Between them, these countries have an excellent shot at settling this issue, 
perhaps not as quickly as the United States might wish. Traditional Asian 
concerns for "face" may drag out the process. However, this issue has been 
brewing since 1989. There is nothing so decisively special about the current 
standoff to warrant the overheated talk of crisis. Quiet but firm diplomacy 
exercised through friends and partners has a much better chance of success than 
hot words and idle threats that no one believes.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; ANAHEIM VOTES FOR THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City of Anaheim has not been able to nail down much in recent months in 
pursuing its laudable effort to upgrade itself as a seat of entertainment and 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, after all the talk about public-private partnerships, it has been 
left pretty much to its own devices, having to carry on without the firm 
commitments it would love to have from other key players. 
</P>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co., for example, is keeping things on hold by delaying its 
decision on whether to go ahead with a planned theme park expansion, and the 
big sports franchises are either somewhat restless, as in the case of the 
Angels, or actively looking for greener pastures, as in the case of the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, there is only so much the city can do. At least credit Anaheim 
with having the courage to put itself on the line in the Disneyland area in the 
hope of a more promising future. Last week, it declared it would go forward 
with its $200- to- $300-million plan to widen streets around the park, plant 
lush foliage, bury power lines and generally clean up the area's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim announcement represents a vote of confidence while others 
calculate how much money is enough to make and how much the city is supposed to 
do for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, for example, suggest that only lucrative offers need apply, even as 
they step up efforts to talk with St. Louis and Baltimore. Respondents gave 
them a raspberry in a Times Orange County Poll, which found that nearly 70% of 
those polled said it was unimportant to keep the team. Moreover, the public 
appeared extremely unwilling to offer county subsidies. Anaheim Councilman Irv 
Pickler struck an appropriate tone when he suggested that the City of Anaheim 
simply cannot prop up the team.  
</P>
<P>
 Disney, meanwhile, has put off its decision on the proposed $3-billion theme 
park and resort next to Disneyland at least another year, maybe longer, while 
the city presses on with needed improvements. This decision by Anaheim 
constitutes a shrewd recognition that it rises or falls by the quality of its 
entertainment franchise and landscape, and the city rightly intends to be 
competitive in luring tourist dollars.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: AFTER 90 YEARS WITHOUT ONE, HOW COULD FULLERTON RECALL 
HAPPEN?; GOVERNMENT: AN UNINFORMED ELECTORATE AND WEAK MEDIA INFRASTRUCTURE ARE 
BLAMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE BUCK, Vince Buck is a political science professor at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How could it have happened? How could the respected council majority of a 
squeaky-clean and well-run city have been recalled? In its 90-year history 
Fullerton had never had a recall election, and the recognized civic leaders and 
activists across the political spectrum were solidly against it. The most 
frequently asked question about the recall backers was "Who are they?" 
</P>
<P>
 Who they are is a group of previously uninvolved individuals who met at a Ross 
Perot rally and who share a general distrust of government and a lack of faith 
in elected leaders and civil servants. Their 31-point "platform" calls for a 
dismantling of much of city government. 
</P>
<P>
 The ostensible issue that motivates them is a monthly utility tax of about $4 
per household. Some other city actions over the years still rankle some 
residents, most notably the widening of a street in the wealthy northern part 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But a modest utility tax does not seem adequate reason for a recall in a 
well-run city. Eleven other Orange County cities have such a tax. Why then did 
the recall succeed? 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton was especially susceptible to this recall because of a weak media 
infrastructure, which makes it extremely difficult for residents to know what 
is happening in the city. With a population of 115,000, Fullerton is larger 
than any city in at least 9 states. Yet it has no daily newspaper and the major 
county newspapers are unable to give detailed coverage to local events. And 
Fullerton is one of the few cities in Orange County that does not televise its 
council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Los Angeles Times Poll found that only 50% of the residents of Orange 
County could name a public official. It would be surprising if half that many 
people in Fullerton could name a city council member. With a lack of knowledge 
goes a lack of commitment and trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one reason people are not more aware of the city government is 
that it is rarely involved in controversy. To compound the problem, council 
members are oblivious to the uninformed electorate because there is an informed 
community in Fullerton to which they belong. This community is made up of 
individuals who are involved in a number of loosely linked civic and community 
organizations. This community is not unified nor exclusive. At most it involves 
10,000 individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 This leaves more than 100,000 people who are not involved in, or knowledgeable 
about, city government. While every city has large numbers of uninvolved 
individuals, in few places is the percentage so large or the lack of 
information so great, and this has accentuated alienation and distrust. 
</P>
<P>
 The council should have been aware that something was amiss in the last 
general election when a woman with no previous involvement in, or knowledge of, 
civic affairs won a seat on the council. Her victory demonstrated that there 
was a large group of voters who were easily influenced by slick campaign 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning was ignored. The council made no more effort than it had in the 
past to reach the larger community. When it became necessary to make the 
difficult decisions that today's economy calls for, those uninvolved citizens 
did not understand why services needed to be cut and taxes raised; and more 
important they did not trust council members they didn't know to make the right 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by their distrust of elected officials, the recall leaders made the 
utility tax issue the heart of their recall campaign, directing it at 
previously uninvolved individuals like themselves -- who perhaps know nothing 
else about their city government other than that it had raised taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is not unique. It has much in common with other Orange County 
cities, most notably, as The Times poll shows, poorly informed residents. 
Pursuing a broad strategy to inform and involve citizens may create greater 
trust in local government. But with increasingly difficult decisions to make 
and with distrust in government growing, more people will be looking for 
extreme, quick fixes to complex situations. At the local level this may mean 
more recalls. At the national level it may mean the election of a Ross Perot.

KNICKS COMPLAIN ABOUT FLAT FEELING; NBA PLAYOFFS: PLAYERS ACKNOWLEDGE A BETTER 
START WOULD BE A GREAT FIRST STEP IN SOLVING ROCKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID STEELE, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Chicago Bulls at 
Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks charged out and piled up a whopping 
39 first-half points, none by Patrick Ewing. In Game 7 of the East finals 
against the Indiana Pacers at the Garden, the Knicks fell behind early and had 
to rally from 12 down in the fourth quarter to advance. In Game 3 of the NBA 
finals against the Houston Rockets at the Garden, they rode the momentum of a 
critical road win right into a 16-point first-half deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Noticing a trend here? The Knicks are. They've shown an uncanny knack for 
grabbing some shuteye just when they should be grabbing the bull by the horns. 
The horrible start Sunday night at the Garden was the worst -- they came out to 
a tumultuous ovation and roof-rocking introduction -- and silenced everyone by 
falling behind 11-2 before four minutes were gone. 
</P>
<P>
 They spent the rest of the night trying to catch up, and eventually lost, 
93-89, and also surrendered the homecourt advantage.  
</P>
<P>
 "We came out flat," said John Starks Monday after the Knicks practiced at the 
Garden. "You have to come out ready to start the game off. I knew (the Rockets) 
were going to come out hard, and they would run the ball up and down the court. 
So mentally, you can't say, 'We're at home and everything is going to happen 
for us.' That's what happened, and they took full advantage of that." 
</P>
<P>
 But wasn't there any momentum to carry over from the Game 2 win at the Summit? 
"After getting a big win on the road," Starks said, "you come back home feeling 
good about yourselves, and you're not consciously into it at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a blunt assessment, but it was surprising to hear it from a team that 
wore itself to a frazzle all during the regular season to get homecourt 
advantage through every series it could, only to see it come up with its more 
uninspired performances at home. The Knicks are still 9-2 at the Garden in the 
playoffs, but have lost two of their last three games there -- to the Pacers in 
Game 5 as well as Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to explain Sunday's slow start, Derek Harper sounded exasperated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could," he said. "You hate to say you're not ready at this time of 
the year. We've played 100-odd games, and you've got to figure at this point 
you'd be ready to play. We're thinking that we're ready to play and I don't 
think we are quite ready. We're coming out flatfooted. We're not ready to play 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Pat Riley would certainly agree. It's shown up constantly. They settle 
for jump shots instead of aggressively positioning themselves and driving. They 
get soft on defense and on the boards, they give up fast breaks and putbacks 
and wide-open shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those early problems tend to get erased in the fourth quarter, when 
the Knicks have dominated defensively. But the hole they dug for themselves was 
too deep Sunday. Their first lead didn't come until 2:50 remained. While the 
Rockets deservedly received praise for retaking the lead and holding it, Ewing 
said, "In my mind, we lost it in the beginning of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the Knicks held Hakeem Olajuwon to four points and one basket in the 
fourth quarter, they knew that it was just as important to keep him from 
getting off early. "I think we're doing a good job (on Olajuwon)," Ewing said. 
"We just have to start it from the beginning of the game and not wait until the 
second half." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets know they had more passion at the start than the Knicks did, but 
they figure it was more of their own doing.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's basketball," said Coach Rudy Tomjanovich, whose team has won four of 
its last six road playoff games, including two in Phoenix after losing two 
straight at home. "Things were going good for us, we're a good road team, and 
just being here (at the Garden) fires us up." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Mario Elie was even more firm: "We play better on the road, and we play 
better with our backs on the wall," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks refused to acknowledge they were tired, but they admitted that 
having to fight from behind all night takes a lot out of them. 
</P>
<P>
 So the solution is simple: start the way the Rockets did. Tomjanovich fully 
expects that from the Knicks in Wednesday night's Game 4: "We're going to get a 
heck of a run from them. We're going to get their best shot." 
</P>
<P>
 But will it come early or late?

FAITH OR FOLLY?; DOCTORS WILL NEED PROOF THAT HOLYFIELD HAS BEEN 'HEALED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boxing officials said Monday they will need concrete medical proof that a 
faith healer cured Evander Holyfield's heart problem before allowing him back 
in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The former heavyweight champion hinted at a return to boxing over the weekend 
after claiming faith healer Benny Hinn miraculously cured him during a 
Christian revival in Philadelphia last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't rely on faith healers in a dangerous sport such as boxing," said New 
Jersey boxing commissioner Larry Hazzard. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield, speaking through a spokesman from his Fairburn, Ga., home, said 
Monday that rumors of an imminent comeback have been blown out of proportion, 
but he is considering it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said if it was God's will, he'll come back. But he doesn't know when that 
will be," spokesman Charles Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield, 31, retired in April after losing a 12-round bout with Michael 
Moorer and disclosing he had a condition known as a stiff heart. Holyfield's 
heart does not receive enough oxygen for strenuous activity. It also has a 
small hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing officials said the chance of Holyfield returning to boxing is remote 
considering the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said Holyfield has not yet seen his doctor. Ronald Stephens, 
Holyfield's physician and chief of general surgery at Crawford Long Hospital in 
Atlanta, could not be reached for comment.

 Hazzard and Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic 
Commission, said every boxer must pass routine physical exams given by medical 
advisory boards before fights. Boxers with a history of medical problems 
undergo more rigorous exams and scrutiny of Holyfield's health would be even 
more intense, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield, a born-again Christian, said he felt "a warm feeling" go through 
his chest when Hinn touched him while they were on stage in front of 9,000 
Christians on Thursday. He then collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Holyfield collapsed three times during the four-hour service and 
spent most of the time lying on the Philadelphia Civic Center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime during the three-day services, which drew more than 23,000 people, 
Holyfield agreed to give $265,000 to underwrite costs for the crusade.

 Andre Agassi and Todd Martin were the main beneficiaries Monday when the 
seedings were announced for Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, champion two years ago, was seeded No. 12 -- five places above his 
world ranking. He has dropped in the rankings due to a long layoff at the start 
of the year following wrist surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who beat Pete Sampras Sunday in the final of the Queen's Club 
tournament, was rewarded with the No. 6 seeding, three spots above his world 
ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, defending champions Sampras and Steffi Graf got the No. 1 
seedings for the tournament, which starts next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Pierce, runner-up at the French Open, will be seeded No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The draw for the two-week tournament will be held today.

 In an interview with the British tabloid Today, Gunther Parche, the man who 
stabbed Monica Seles in Hamburg, Germany, on April 20, 1993, won't say he is 
sorry, only that he would never do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not say sorry because I shouldn't talk about my feelings," said 
Parche, whose placement on probation evoked international criticism. "The only 
thing I will say is that I would never do this again." 
</P>
<P>
 Parche reiterated that he stabbed Seles, hoping his favorite player, Graf, 
would regain the No. 1 ranking -- which she did. But he refused to elaborate, 
saying he had promised the Graf family not discuss the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Seles has not played since. Basketball

 Amid speculation that the Philadelphia 76ers will name John Lucas their coach 
and general manager, a news conference was scheduled for today. Team owner 
Harold Katz met with Lucas on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas, who resigned as coach of the San Antonio Spurs last week, is also said 
to be a coaching candidate for the Clippers and Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 76ers have been without a general manager since Jim Lynam left last month 
to become coach of the Washington Bullets. The contract of 76er Coach Fred 
Carter expires in two weeks and the team has not said whether he will be 
retained. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz has said he would be willing to give both positions to one person "if I 
found the right guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Hurley of the Sacramento Kings has recovered enough from his auto 
injuries to play basketball three times a week. Team vice president Geoff 
Petrie, who met with Hurley last week, said Hurley had been checked by team 
physicians and passed his tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, he's been released to do everything he wants," Petrie said. "He's 
really excited obviously about the prospect of playing again, and he looks 
great." Miscellany  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time the Naval Academy Athletic Assn. recommended eliminating four 
sports to save $50,000, it bought a $317,000 condominium in 1992, according to 
the Baltimore Sun. Living in the condominium is Jack Lengyel, the Naval 
Academy's athletic director, the newspaper said. Also in 1992, the association 
paid to have 96 academy officials and their guests stay in a Philadelphia hotel 
and attend the Army-Navy game. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors in Hockenheim, Germany, held out little hope for British motorcycle 
racer Simon Prior, who suffered severe brain damage in a crash at the German 
Grand Prix. He was breathing through a respirator on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Indy car driver Robby Gordon of Orange will make his Winston Cup stock-car 
debut Sunday in the Michigan 400. He will drive a Ford for the newly-formed 
Kranefuss-Haas team.

 NO LIGHT TRAVEL: What does it cost to drive in Southern California? Chuck 
Kurz, manager of the Auto Club's Anaheim office, has it figured out: 44 cents a 
mile, on average. . . . That total comes from gas, insurance, licensing fees, 
taxes, depreciation and financing. The national average is just under 40 cents 
a mile. Kurz says Auto Club research shows the difference comes mostly from 
higher maintenance costs and steeper insurance.

 HENRY'S BOYS: It didn't take much prodding from Henry Segerstrom, of Swedish 
descent, to persuade restaurateurs Bill Gustaf Magnuson and Ulf Anders 
Strandberg, also Swedish, to do something special for the Swedish soccer team 
training in Orange County. . . . Result: A dinner for the team Thursday night 
-- you can join them at $75 per plate -- at Gustaf Anders Restaurant in South 
Coast Village. Segerstrom's South Coast Plaza will underwrite the cost, so all 
proceeds can go to the Swedish American Chamber of Commerce.

 STRINGS ATTACHED: It was a black bikini that supermodel Cindy Crawford 
recently brought to the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point. Some of her hosting 
scenes for MTV's "House of Style," running all month, were taped there. Says 
hotel spokeswoman Nancy Jane Parramore: "The surfers went wild when she went on 
the beach." . . . . So how did the diva look off-camera? "Nothing short of 
stunning," says Parramore. "That night I went to buy a swimsuit. After seeing 
Cindy walk around in a string bikini all day, I don't know what I was 
thinking."

 DID ISHMAEL DO IT? Up the coast a bit, maybe you've seen that 20-foot 
fiberglass whale called Moe B. Dunes in the swimming area of Newport Bay, just 
outside the Newport Dunes Resort. Over the weekend someone swiped it and set it 
up on an elaborate bed of sand on campus at Corona del Mar High School. . . . 
Blame it on students? The apologetic school has offered to pay for damage to 
the whale's neck -- from the senior class party funds.

O.J. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE FOUND STABBED TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC and DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Football great O. J. Simpson's former wife and a 26-year-old man were found 
apparently stabbed to death outside her Brentwood condominium early Monday 
morning, and Los Angeles police questioned the Hall of Fame running back, 
calling him a potential witness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpsons' two young children were asleep inside the Mediterranean-style 
condominium in the 800 block of South Bundy Drive at the time of the slayings 
sometime before midnight, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a passerby found the body of Nicole Brown Simpson, 34, sprawled on 
the steps of a walkway in front of the condominium shortly after midnight. The 
body of Ronald Lyle Goldman of the Agoura area was found a few feet away in 
shrubbery. Both were fully clothed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sharp-force injuries," such as stab wounds, appear to have played a part in 
the deaths, but other causes had not been ruled out, said Scott Carrier, a 
spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said little about the crime, declining to identify possible suspects, 
offer a possible motive or say exactly when the attack is believed to have 
occurred. Officers said only that there were signs of a struggle and that there 
was no evidence the attack occurred during a robbery or a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the grim find, police began looking for the football star, 
learning several hours later that he was in Chicago. When Simpson, 46, had gone 
to Chicago was not immediately clear, although his attorney, Howard Weitzman, 
said it was sometime in the "late evening" on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Phillips, general manager of the O'Hare Plaza Hotel near Chicago-O'Hare 
International Airport, said Simpson checked into the hotel at 6:15 a.m. Monday, 
Chicago time, indicating that the football star could have taken any of at 
least three flights that left Los Angeles after 11:30 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said Simpson had made a reservation three to five days earlier, and 
he showed up "just about the time" his reservation had indicated. Simpson 
checked out about 8:30 a.m., Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel manager said Simpson told him that Hertz, the auto rental company 
for which the ex-athlete long has been a spokesman, was holding "a function" in 
Chicago. "He was in here to talk to the people and play a little golf," 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Simpson was reached by telephone in Chicago, and he 
immediately took a flight back to Los Angeles. Shortly after he reached his 
home in Brentwood, police went to the house, and for a time at least, Simpson 
was handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellow police tape was spread across the driveway gate of Simpson's estate, 
about two miles from the condominium where the killings occurred. Police placed 
cardboard markers in Simpson's driveway, marking small reddish-brown droplets 
leading up the driveway to a point about 50 feet from the garage. Simpson's 
black Rolls-Royce was parked in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman said that at his request, Simpson's handcuffs were removed. Simpson 
-- grim-faced, wearing slacks and a polo shirt -- was driven to the Police 
Department's Parker Center headquarters Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have brought him in to conduct a follow-up investigation and to question 
him as a potential witness," Officer Rigo Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman said his client was shocked by the crime. "He had nothing to do with 
this tragedy," Weitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After about two hours, Simpson left police headquarters and was driven away. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson and his wife divorced several years ago after he pleaded no contest to 
a spousal battery charge. The charge was filed in 1989 after he allegedly hit 
her, kicked her and told her, "I'll kill you."  
</P>
<P>
 Friends said that the couple had been trying to get back together in recent 
months but that the reconciliation attempt came to an end several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime was discovered by a pedestrian who glanced inside the gated garden 
in front of the condominium and saw Nicole Simpson's body on the walkway steps, 
a few feet inside the gate. Police were called, and the body of Goldman was 
found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 As dawn broke, neighbors and passersby began gathering outside the crime 
scene. Denise Pilnak, a jogger who lives nearby, remembered hearing dogs 
barking shortly before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nonstop barking," she said. "It made me think something was going on 
with the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Pauli Orchon, 35, a marketing director who lives in the neighborhood, said she 
was there Monday morning when officials removed the sheet they had used to 
cover Simpson's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was lying on her side, just crumpled down," Orchon said. "I could see 
some abrasion to the side of her face. . . . There was a lot of blood on both 
bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Orchon said she had often seen Nicole Simpson walking her dog in the 
neighborhood in recent weeks, and she theorized that Nicole Simpson might have 
been doing that when the attack occurred. Orchon said passersby found a dog 
with a leash wandering through the neighborhood Monday morning, "and everyone 
says it's her dog." 
</P>
<P>
 A man named Jeff, who declined to give his last name, said he lives across the 
alley from the back of Nicole Simpson's home and had seen the football star 
there several times. 
</P>
<P>
 "There weren't wild parties, there wasn't a lot of noise," Jeff said. "I can't 
remember one wild thing there." 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Goodfriend, 25, a music publisher who stopped by to see what was going on 
Monday, said she had been a friend of Nicole Simpson's for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's blonde, she's tanned, she's absolutely beautiful," Goodfriend said. 
"I'm in shock. I can't believe this." 
</P>
<P>
 O. J. Simpson -- best known in recent years for his Hertz commercials, his 
work as a football analyst on NBC and his roles in "The Naked Gun" and other 
movies -- was one of the game's most popular stars. 
</P>
<P>
 During his two years at USC, Orenthal James Simpson equaled or bettered dozens 
of records, culminating his collegiate career with the Heisman Trophy -- 
awarded to the nation's best college football player -- in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was drafted in the first round by the Buffalo Bills in 1969, he went 
on to establish a National Football League single-season rushing record of 
2,003 yards in 1973. He finished his 11-year pro career with the San Francisco 
49ers as the second leading rusher in NFL history, and in 1985, he was inducted 
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

QUICK HOUSE VOTE SOUGHT ON REGULATION OF TOBACCO; CONGRESS: THE LEGISLATION 
WOULD REQUIRE THE FDA TO CONTROL THE SUBSTANCE BUT PROHIBIT THE AGENCY FROM 
BANNING CIGARETTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three key congressional tobacco foes said Monday that they will try to get a 
quick House vote on legislation that would require the Food and Drug 
Administration to regulate tobacco but would forbid the agency to ban 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), Mike Synar (D-Okla.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) 
said that they have asked the Rules Committee to allow the amendment to be 
attached to the agriculture appropriations bill so that it could be put on a 
fast track to a House vote. Usually, legislation cannot be attached to a 
spending bill but the Rules Committee can waive that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision by the Rules Committee could come today or Wednesday and the House 
could take up the measure later this week. The lawmakers made it clear that the 
amendment was not meant to imply that the FDA does not already have the 
authority to regulate tobacco products. But they said that it would allow 
Congress to vote on specific aspects of tobacco regulation that the FDA should 
address. It "would ensure that the FDA regulates tobacco in certain areas while 
guaranteeing that cigarettes will not be banned," they said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA already believes that it has the authority to regulate cigarettes as 
drugs because of the addictive nature of nicotine and has been working in 
recent months to build a case for such regulation. Nevertheless, FDA 
Commissioner David A. Kessler has asked for direction from Congress before 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, said that the industry 
has "a longstanding opposition to the FDA's regulation of a product that is not 
a food, not a drug and not a cosmetic." Passage of the amendment would usher in 
"a new era of prohibition," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment would give the agency the power to regulate the manufacture, 
sale, labeling, advertising, promotion and content of tobacco products although 
it would prohibit the agency from banning all tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
 Synar said that passage of the legislation could have "a substantial impact on 
the next generation of smokers immediately," without inflicting the "cruel 
punishment" of a ban against the nearly 50 million Americans who currently 
smoke. "We realize bans do not work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coalition on Smoking OR Health, which is made up of the American Heart 
Assn., the American Lung Assn. and the American Cancer Society, said in a 
statement that "Congress has moved one step closer to changing the course of 
tobacco control history." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott D. Ballin, the coalition's executive director, added: "If Congress has 
the courage to push this amendment through, Dr. Kessler will have the tobacco 
industry pinned."

BLACK LEADERS BEGIN WORK ON NEW CIVIL RIGHTS AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Black leaders met Monday to begin devising an ambitious new civil rights 
agenda that could cover everything from racism to health care to sanctions 
against South Carolina for flying the Confederate battle flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 70 people -- including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Al Sharpton 
and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan -- participated in the closed-door 
strategy session, part of an unprecedented three-day NAACP African American 
Leadership Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want it to be a coming together of egos," said Sharpton, a flamboyant 
New York civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning discussion focused on economic issues, the afternoon on problems 
facing youth and the black community. Media access was limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of things we've discussed, but it would be premature at this point 
to start outlining the specifics of those discussions and those proposals," 
said Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., executive director of National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People. He has been designated the summit's sole 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 NAACP Chairman William Gibson said during a breakfast meeting that he planned 
to raise the issue of economic sanctions against South Carolina for flying the 
Confederate flag at the Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina was the first state to secede from the Union and is the only 
state to still fly the banner over its state capitol. Georgia and Mississippi 
have incorporated the design into their state flags. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have no empathy for brothers and sisters of color who feel discriminated 
against and victimized when they see that flag flying," said Gibson, a South 
Carolina resident and native. 
</P>
<P>
 The NAACP, despite having promised to release a list of conference members 
after the three-day summit began Sunday, refused to do so again Monday.

ANGEL BULLPEN PROVIDES RELIEF FOR ROYALS, 12-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chili Davis started mulling over the idea Monday afternoon, gave it more 
thought during the game, and by the time the night ended, wondered perhaps if 
he should hasten his retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 34, watching perhaps the finest season of his career being ruined by 
the inept performance of the Angel pitching staff, decided he likely will 
retire within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 And that decision was made before he snapped the bat over his knee during the 
game, and stormed out of the clubhouse after the Kansas City Royals' 12-7 
victory over the Angels at Kauffman Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years, and I'm gone," Davis said. "And really, I don't know if I even 
want to play two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I need this game. And the game doesn't need me." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels (26-38) keep playing like they are these days, losing for the 
12th time in the last 15 games, Davis might have a lot of company following him 
out of the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating, man," Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. "Losing gets to 
you. When you're in a losing streak like we are, everything is magnified. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weight gets so heavy on your shoulders, you feel like you're going to 
snap." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are on pace to finish with the worst record in franchise history. 
Their only savior may be a players' strike that could wipe out the last half of 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ain't nobody no dummy in here," said Angel left fielder Dwight Smith, "we're 
scoring the runs, but we're not getting the pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you score six, seven, eight, nine runs a game like we are, you've got to 
win those ballgames." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. The Angels produced 13 hits, right fielder Tim Salmon had a 
career-high-equalling five runs batted in, third baseman Spike Owen had four 
hits, but it was all for naught. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, leading 6-4 in the bottom of the seventh with Mark Langston 
pitching, yielded a run in the seventh, and self-destructed in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals (32-29), utilizing the offensive exploits of a couple of former 
Angels, scored a season-high seven runs in the eighth on a two-run single by 
Gary Gaetti and a pinch-hit grand slam by Hubie Brooks off reliever Bob 
Patterson. It was the first pinch-hit grand slam by a Royal in the 22-year 
history of Kauffman Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, considering the Angels' season, it perhaps was only fitting that they 
surrendered the seven runs by yielding three hits, three walks, a hit batter, 
and a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just can't waste six or seven runs like that," said Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann, whose 53rd birthday was ruined. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Langston, who yielded seven hits and six earned runs in seven innings: "I 
don't feel like I did my job at all. When you get (seven) runs, I've got to win 
those games." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Angels have scored 319 runs and are on a pace to produce their 
second-largest total in franchise history, the team has a 5.46 earned-run 
average. No team in Angel history has yielded higher than a 4.52 ERA, and the 
effect is quite obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are 17-6 when they allow four or fewer runs; 9-32 when the 
opposition scores at least five runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis went hitless in five at-bats Monday, lowering his average to a 
season-low .335. A switch-hitter, Davis was so frustrated at one point that he 
batted right-handed against right-handed reliever Hipolito Pichardo, and 
grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see why (Ryne) Sandberg did what he did," Davis said. "The man showed 
me something right there. He was asking, 'Do I want the money, or do I want 
peace of mind?' He felt like he wasn't enjoying the game any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys will stay around just for the money, but he knew it wasn't fair 
to him or his family. This game controls you. This game controls your life. And 
you get tired of being controlled."

WORRELL GETS THE JOB DONE AS DODGERS STOP REDS, 5-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Relieved? The Dodgers looked positively rapturous Monday night after Todd 
Worrell breezed through the ninth inning of a 5-4 victory over the Cincinnati 
Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 A save? You bet. It was only three outs, but for a team that had blown its 
last four save opportunities, it was the sweetest moment of a tense game before 
39,535 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers pinged and pestered the Cincinnati Reds for 14 hits -- 13 singles 
and Mike Piazza's 13th home run of the season -- and then held their breaths as 
starter Ramon Martinez (6-2) sputtered out in the eighth after 126 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in the ninth, Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda plopped the game into the lap of 
Worrell, the erstwhile closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell eased some of the tension by striking out pinch-hitter Lenny Harris on 
three pitches for the first out. Deion Sanders was next, and he fouled out 
quietly to third baseman Tim Wallach. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with Barry Larkin at bat, Worrell threw a fastball on the outside corner 
that plate umpire Steve Rippley called strike three, and the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very good for the starters and good for the relievers," Martinez said of 
Worrell's performance. "I know they were maybe feeling a little pressure 
because they are struggling a little. But I know those guys, they'll come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 A three-run sixth gave the Dodgers a 5-2 lead, but such is the sorry state of 
the Dodger bullpen that everybody in the ballpark knew the real excitement was 
yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think something like this tonight is what he really needed," Lasorda said 
of Worrell. "And even though the fans started to boo him a little, they were 
pulling for him at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 After Cincinnati closed the deficit to 5-3 in the eighth, Dodger pitching 
coach Ron Perranoski elicited loud boos, then louder cheers when he visited 
Martinez and left him in to face power-hitting Kevin Mitchell representing the 
tying run with Worrell warming in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez gave up a single to Mitchell, and later a run-scoring single to Bret 
Boone, but ended the inning hanging on to the one-run lead by retiring Brian 
Dorsett on a long fly ball to the right field warning track with two runners on 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 That left it for Worrell, whose save was his third. 
</P>
<P>
 By necessity, the Reds, whose 3.01 earned-run average at the start of the game 
was the lowest in the National League, had to go the whole way with their 
bullpen. And they paid the price. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-hander Pete Schourek was forced into his first start of the season when 
starter John Smiley was scratched after feeling numbness in his shoulder over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers got to Schourek in the third and fourth, scoring two runs and 
threatening many more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, who left five runners on base in the first five innings, broke a 
2-2 tie against relievers Keith Jarvis and Tim Fortugno in a strange sixth 
inning -- when the only Dodger out not recorded on the basepaths was Martinez's 
strikeout with the bases empty to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth, Wallach and Eric Karros opened the inning with hard singles. 
Raul Mondesi knocked in Wallach to make the score 3-2, and pinch-hitter Mitch 
Webster followed with another run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster got trapped between first and second on the play, and when Boone, the 
Reds' second baseman, ignored Mondesi at third, Mondesi jogged in for the third 
run of the inning and a 5-2 Dodger lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The next batter, Jose Offerman, reached second on a double after right fielder 
Reggie Sanders dropped his short fly ball, but was picked off second base by 
Fortugno. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Dodger scoring, Martinez, who had pitched at least into the eighth 
inning in each of his last three starts before Monday, suffered the indignity 
of giving up a towering, third-inning home run to Schourek.

WORLD CUP '94: 3 DAYS AND COUNTING; GERMANY'S DRIVING FORCE; LOTHAR MATTHAEUS 
THE ENGINE BEHIND HIS NATION'S DEFENSE OF ITS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lothar Matthaeus represents the finest in German engineering. Lift the hood on 
the German national soccer team and hear his throaty rumble. While others are 
taken by showroom models -- your Romarios and Valderramas -- the Germans are 
driven to success by Matthaeus' tireless, powerful, dependable pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not a leader with elegance," Wolfgang Niesbach, the German press 
officer, explained. "He's not the leader with the most intelligence. He's a 
leader because of his power." 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old Matthaeus is not ready for the scrap heap. In German football 
lore, only Franz Beckenbauer is more revered. Once, a club manager said of 
Matthaeus: "The day shall come when I will read in a Friday paper how well 
Matthaeus played on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly what you would call a Bavarian brute at 5-feet-10 and 165 pounds, 
Matthaeus plays a much larger game. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories of his stamina are 
</P>
<P>
 legendary. First on the practice field and last to leave, he routinely runs 
younger mates into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany, not self, comes first. In the 1986 World Cup, playing with a broken 
wrist, Matthaeus set out to guard Argentina's Maradona, then the world's best 
player. Matthaeus said broken legs would not have kept him from his appointed 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of Matthaeus, I always have this vision of him getting the ball 
in midfield and just running past people for 30, 40 yards with the ball," said 
Sigi Schmid, the U.S. national team's assistant coach. "He can just bring the 
ball up so fast. He's not really a playmaker, but is asked to be a dynamo, the 
engine. It's like, 'OK guys, get on my back and I'll carry you with me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990 World Cup, Matthaeus stormed Italy like a runaway truck. 
</P>
<P>
 As captain and attacking midfielder for Coach Beckenbauer's brigade, Matthaeus 
scored four goals in leading West Germany to its third title. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, Matthaeus returns in a new position, with a new disposition, 
and is quite confident Germany can successfully defend its World Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Matthaeus actually has something to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his legend is secure, much has changed since Italy. His marriage to 
childhood sweetheart Sylvia has dissolved. In 1992, while playing for Italy's 
Inter Milan, Matthaeus ruptured knee ligaments against Parma. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that Matthaeus was finished, Inter Milan sent him packing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Italian president and trainer thought the same, that Matthaeus was 
finished, " Matthaeus said last week from Nottawasaga, Canada, where the German 
team was training. "For me, it was new motivation for coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Surgery was performed in Vail, Colo., by Dr. Richard Steadman, the orthopedic 
surgeon who has reconstructed the wounded knees of notable athletes, 
particularly skiers. It was Steadman who 10 years ago pieced together the 
shredded knee of Luxembourg skier Marc Girardelli, who returned to win an 
unprecedented five World Cup overall titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say to Dr. Steadman many times, thanks," Matthaeus said. "For me, 
he's the greatest. It was a hard injury. I was 31 years old. For many players 
with that injury, they would be finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Following his rehabilitation, which forced Matthaeus to miss the 1992 European 
Championships, he returned to his old club, Bayern Munich, where Matthaeus had 
played from 1984 to '88. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he would strengthen his bond to Beckenbauer, who has long ties to the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bayern Munich, the Germans would tinker with the Matthaeus machinery, 
change him from a midfielder to a defensive sweeper. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, Beckenbauer revolutionized the game as an attacker from the 
sweeper position. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthaeus had no qualms about making the change. In preparation for the 
national team, he played the sweeper role this season and led Bayern Munich to 
the German club championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me it was no problem," Matthaeus said. "I had played 14 years in the 
middle field, but I am happy with this new position. It's an important position 
for the team. I can order the plays from behind, and I have many choices. And 
when we have the ball, I can go in the middle of the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The downside is that Matthaeus -- now a roving defensive back, sort of 
soccer's version of Ronnie Lott -- is farther from the opposing goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was big discussion about it, that we'd miss him in the midfield," 
Niesbach said. "It is logical, that from the midfield the other goal is closer. 
He will not be attacking so often, but when he does, when he sees the chance to 
play offense, it's also going to be a big surprise for the other team." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the similarities, no one is ready to compare Matthaeus with 
Beckenbauer, who led West Germany to World Cup titles as both a player and a 
coach. Yet, Matthaeus recently broke Beckenbauer's German record of 103 
international matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Franz is in another light," Niesbach said. "Franz is 'Der Kaiser.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Matthaeus knows his place. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was and is the first person of soccer in Germany," Matthaeus said. 
"Beckenbauer is the greatest. He was my trainer on the national team and last 
year my trainer on the club team. But for me, he's not only a trainer, he's a 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
 The coronation of Beckenbauer has as much to do with the German's grace off 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthaeus, by contrast, has always been rough around the edges, a man who 
lived the way he played. In earlier days, he was a noted womanizer and pub 
hopper. Once, after a night on the town, he crashed his car into a garden 
fence. Matthaeus lost his license for eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beckenbauer was an outstanding person, not just in football, but in the whole 
German society," Niesbach said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Franz is a gentleman, Lothar is a power man. Lothar, he is always a boy in 
the middle of life. If you drink beer, Lothar drinks one, too. If we were 
thinking how to speak to the girl, he was together with the girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthaeus has reportedly mellowed, and in January, he remarried. 
</P>
<P>
 His new wife, Lolita Morena, is Swiss and works for Swiss and Italian 
television networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his social shortcomings, Matthaeus may be destined to follow in 
Beckenbauer's enormous boot steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have suggested that Matthaeus might be in line to become German national 
coach, perhaps early in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthaeus does not think that far ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a new contract in Munich for the next three years," Matthaeus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for me, I should go on with the next three years. What is after the 
next three years, I don't know. To me, what's important is the World Cup and 
the next two or three years in Munich. What is later, I must look." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthaeus, though, thinks he would make a good coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, yes," he said. "When I see the good coaches in the world, they have 
spent a lot of time playing football." 
</P>
<P>
 But first things first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am just happy I can play football," he said. "After my injury two years 
ago, my head was empty. I think it's finished for me. Later, I came back. For 
me, that's the greatest. That I can play this sport." World Cup Player at a

JIM MURRAY: PONDERING A TRUE LIFE FANTASY TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I saw a movie the other night, "Little Big League." Cute. Funny. Disneyesque. 
No crashing cars, steaming sex, gratuitous violence. As wholesome as a July 4 
doubleheader. Take the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about a card-collecting, rabid baseball fan, a Little Leaguer whose 
grandfather (Jason Robards) leaves him a big league team (the Minnesota Twins) 
in his will. 
</P>
<P>
 The kid can recite every base hit Ty Cobb ever made, he knows baseball inside 
out, he can call a slider from a seat in the third tier, knows who the third 
baseman was in the Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance infield, and when he takes over 
the team, he decides that the manager -- a Billy Martin type with a sulfuric 
vocabulary and a volcanic temper -- is not spurring his team to the pennant 
with his runaway sarcasm but actually robbing his players of self-esteem. He 
takes over as manager himself. 
</P>
<P>
 As I say, it's a fun gimmick. But it set me to thinking. What would I do if 
they gave me a big league team of my very own to run? 
</P>
<P>
 Aha! Oh, boy! Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack and let me get at that 
franchise! Stand back! I would do lots of things to those spoiled darlings. 
Such as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- I would hand out those big salaries only based on performance. No 
guaranteed income. Swing for your supper. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the guy was a home run hitter, I would offer $4 million provided he hit 
40 home runs, $3 million for 30, $2 million for 20. If he hit less than 10, I 
would consider it breach of contract, pay him nothing and sue him for 
non-performance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I would draw a parallel to golf and explain to the players that golfers 
collected monies only for performance and success at it. In other words, they 
had to play well to get paid. They got paid on a sliding scale. Golfers, if 
they play well, shoot in the 60s and get rewarded. If they play poorly, they 
miss the cut and get nothing and are out the transportation and hotel money 
they had to put up for the week. I would tell the ballplayers I would pick up 
the travel and hotel costs but if they went 0 for four, they miss the cut at 
the pay window. Good enough for golf (and tennis), good enough for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I would insist that no player ever get more money than Thomas Edison or 
Marconi, factoring in inflation, of course. I would explain that there is no 
way standing out in right field blowing bubble gum all night equates with 
inventing the electric light or the wireless or the motion picture, and the 
gift of light to mankind should be far more rewarded than hitting .257 for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If a pitcher had a less-than-.500 season or an earned-run average of more 
than 5.00, he should return the money. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If a relief pitcher or a relief corps could not hold onto a seventh inning 
9-3 lead, they should, like golfers, have their playing privileges picked up 
and they should have to go back through qualifying school and retire the side 
with the winning run on base before they could again get their cards -- and job 
-- back. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If a team loaded the bases with none out and the next three batters could 
not bring even one run in, those three batters should have to donate their 
salary for that night (or that week) to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Anyone who strikes out in the bottom of the ninth or pops up with the 
winning runs on base should have to pay to play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Salaries should be contingent upon ability to draw people into the 
ballpark. It should be remembered the greatest draw in the history of the game, 
Babe Ruth, earned only $80,000 in his best salary year. Hollywood can find out 
who fills seats, baseball can, too. Willie Mays and Sandy Koufax filled a 
ballpark. A lot of guys making more money than they did cannot fill a 
Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If a player objected to being a role model or spokesman for the game, I 
would take him at his word, take his number and name off the back of his 
uniform, list him only as Player X or Player to Be Named Later and let him play 
anonymously for the rest of his career. Let's see how many shoe contracts he 
would get out of that. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If a player was rude to the public or surly with autograph seekers or prone 
to getting into 2 a.m. fights in nightclub parking lots, I would suggest he get 
a job that would suit him better: bouncer in a disco. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I would let guys wear earrings if they were hitting their lifetime 
averages, but I would ask they pull their pant legs up so they didn't look so 
much like guys who just got out of a hotel fire. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I wouldn't object to scruffy hair and dirty uniforms if my team were called 
the Gas House Gang, but I would prefer the Yankee image. The Yankees always 
looked like chairmen of the board when they went out. One John Kruk is OK, but 
a league full of them? Do you think Joe DiMaggio ever even needed a shave? 
</P>
<P>
 -- I would never let anybody bunt and I would never walk anybody 
intentionally. I would tell my pitchers, "You got a 65% chance of getting the 
hitter out, even the best one." If my pitcher had to walk anyone, I would walk 
him intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I would remind fans that a wise man said that in the age of man, hours 
spent in a ballpark didn't count. 
</P>
<P>
 -- My doctor, Gary Sugarman, has a simple first step for his ballclub. If it's 
on AstroTurf, take it out. If it's got a roof, take it off. If a player doesn't 
play 142 games, make him a temp. 
</P>
<P>
 The director of the film, Andrew Scheinman, obviously loves the game too much 
to put it down, but he does have a symbolic scene in which the 12-year-old 
upbraids the star player for taking the fun out of the game, which is what Dr. 
Gary thinks the modern player has done to the game anyway -- broken faith with 
all the 12-year-old fans. 
</P>
<P>
 As Roy Campanella said, you have to be a man to play baseball but you have to 
have a lot of little boy in you, too. There's a line in the movie quoting Bob 
Lemon: "Baseball was made for kids, grown-ups only screw it up." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not so far-fetched a notion for a young boy to run a ballclub. Who is 
more into the game with less distractions than a 12-year-old? There's nothing 
wrong with baseball that a 12-year-old's dreams and enthusiasm can't fix. Just 
ask Willie Mays. Willie stayed 12 for 22 years. The rest of the world grew old, 
he didn't. The game grew up. That's its principal difficulty.

PLAYOFF TENSION TURNING BIZARRE; NHL FINALS: RANGER COACH MIKE KEENAN CRIES 
SABOTAGE OVER JOB RUMORS BEFORE TONIGHT'S DECIDING GAME AGAINST CANUCKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The plot is getting thicker. So is the tension. 
</P>
<P>
 One day before a game that will be the New York Rangers' greatest triumph or 
their darkest hour, Coach Mike Keenan accused Jimmy Devellano, senior vice 
president of the Detroit Red Wings, of attempting to sabotage the Rangers' 
Stanley Cup hopes by starting rumors that Keenan will leave New York to join 
the Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan's charge added a bizarre twist to an already strange series. He had 
previously claimed "media hype" and biased officiating helped Vancouver win 
Games 5 and 6, forcing tonight's decisive Game 7 at Madison Square Garden. A 
Ranger loss would extend their 54-year Cup drought and make them only the 
second team in NHL history to squander a 3-1 lead in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are people outside who don't want us to win," Keenan said 
Monday. "I think (sabotage) is a possibility. There's some history there and 
I'm not going to get into it. (Ranger General Manager) Neil (Smith) used to 
work for the Red Wings and the Islanders. Jimmy Devellano used to work for the 
Islanders. It's not my business. I know what my business is -- my business is 
to coach the New York Rangers, this year and in subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of paranoia in the industry and in the league. It's beyond my 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was a scout for the Islanders when Devellano was their assistant general 
manager. When Devellano moved to Detroit to become general manager in 1982, he 
took Smith with him. 
</P>
<P>
 The two had a falling out in 1989, after Devellano gave the Rangers permission 
to interview Smith for their GM job, then threatened to revoke it when the 
process dragged on. As a fallback, the Rangers interviewed Scotty Bowman, 
causing Smith to fear that he had lost his chance for the Ranger job. He blamed 
Devellano for interfering, and they have not spoken since. 
</P>
<P>
 Devellano said Monday he has no ill will toward Keenan or Smith and did 
nothing that might jeopardize the Rangers' chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neil has gone on and done a terrific job," Devellano said from Detroit. "I'm 
proud of him. I don't have to particularly like him as a friend to say that 
objectively. But all that's old hat, and anybody who wants to bring it up 
doesn't know the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Mike Keenan. I've known Mike for years. We've had some chats. He has a 
great record. Why he would point to me, I don't know. Somebody may have told 
him that (I started the rumors). He's under a lot of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger players were smiling about the charges.  
</P>
<P>
 "We almost have to thank whoever started that rumor in Detroit. It's taken 
some of the pressure away from us," center Craig MacTavish said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the pressure, though. The burden of great expectations sits heavily 
on their shoulders, the same shoulders that collected a league-leading 52 
victories and 112 points while the Canucks were 41-40-3 with 85 points in the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've known all along there was going to be a lot of pressure on this 
hockey team to win," MacTavish said. "That's good in a lot of ways. Certainly, 
a lot of guys in this locker room respond well to pressure. We've left it to a 
seventh game, so we may be at the mercy of a bad bounce. It's not a situation 
we wanted to be in, after being up, 3-1, but it's a situation we're very 
comfortable with." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger captain Mark Messier said: "We felt that if we tried to take on the 
54-year history of the Rangers (since winning the Cup) and everything that 
happened in the past, it would be too much for any team. What we've done is 
concentrate on what we have to do as a team to be successful. Our entire 
season, as good as it's been and as well as we've played, boils down to one 
game for the Stanley Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks come into the game buoyed by having tightened their defensive play 
and stepped up their hitting. They've also minimized the damage done by Messier 
(one goal) and Brian Leetch, whom they've hounded in the last two games and 
held to one assist. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan had an excuse for that, too. "In Game 5, they took liberties and got 
away with it. There was a lot of stickwork on Brian and they were preoccupied 
with him, if you will," he said. "It was a good game plan and they got away 
with it. They abused him with their sticks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, who would have been riding in a parade Monday had they won in 
five or six games, are looking forward to their last chance at victory. "A lot 
of players have been part of failure here," Leetch said. "I have a great 
opportunity to be a small part of success."

CITING ATTITUDE, SANDBERG RETIRES; BASEBALL: CUBS' ALL-STAR SECOND BASEMAN 
ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT BECAUSE OF A DROP IN PERFORMANCE, LACK OF MOTIVATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unhappy with his performance and devoid of motivation, second baseman Ryne 
Sandberg of the Chicago Cubs, a 10-time All-Star, retired Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not the type of person who can be satisfied with anything less than my 
very best effort and my very top performance," he said during an emotional news 
conference at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not the type of person who can leave my game at the ballpark and feel 
comfortable that my future is set regardless of my performance. And I am 
certainly not the type person who can ask the Cubs organization and Chicago 
Cubs fans to pay my salary when I am not happy with my mental approach and my 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
 The 34-year-old Sandberg, batting .238 with 24 runs batted in, signed a 
four-year, $28-million contract before the 1993 season. He received a 
$3.5-million signing bonus and a '93 salary of $5.1 million. His 1994 salary of 
$5.1 million will be prorated through Sunday. He is giving up $10.2 million in 
salary for 1995 and '96 and a $5.9-million option for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-year, $2-million personal services contract that was to begin when 
Sandberg retired will be rewritten, but the financial details and Sandberg's 
duties are still to be determined, the club said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ryne is walking away from a lot of money because he didn't feel he could live 
up to the standards he had set and it wasn't fun for him anymore," General 
Manager Larry Himes said. "It's nice to hear that money isn't the No. 1 
priority with every player. I have great admiration for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandberg's announcement wasn't a total surprise. Generally considered the best 
second baseman of his era, he said in spring training this would be his last 
season. He ripped the club's lack of stability -- only first baseman Mark Grace 
and shortstop Shawon Dunston remain from the 1991 team -- and direction. He was 
known to be displeased by the free-agent departures of Andre Dawson and Greg 
Maddux and a managerial change he had lobbied against -- Tom Trebelhorn 
replacing Jim Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs are last in the National League Central and have struggled from the 
start. Sandberg said his decision had nothing to do with the team's poor 
performance, but agent Richie Bry said: "He's financially secure and wants to 
spend more time with his family and more time playing golf. But if the Cubs 
were more competitive right now, who knows if he would have retired at this 
point?" 
</P>
<P>
 A nine-time Gold Glove winner, Sandberg reached the National League playoffs 
with the Cubs in 1984, when he hit 19 homers, drove in 84 runs and was the 
league's most valuable player, and again in 1989, when he batted .290 with 30 
homers and 104 runs, but each time the Cubs fell short of the World Series. He 
took a .290 career average into the season, but had only one hit in his last 28 
at-bats when he retired, sitting out the weekend games against the Dodgers 
after telling Trebelhorn he was thinking about retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel like I didn't have what it takes to bounce back," he said. "I've 
always played the game for fun and enjoyment, and it wasn't there anymore. I 
want to be the best player I can be, but with all those feelings and emotions 
not there, I found that I'm not able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 A broken wrist and a dislocated finger cut into his 1993 season, but Sandberg 
said injuries weren't a factor in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physically, I feel pretty good," he said. "But it takes more than physical 
ability to go out and play major league baseball. And with the standards I have 
for myself, it definitely takes more. I waited two months for the drive to come 
back, but it didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace said the news was "an absolute shock." He said Sandberg was struggling, 
but did not seem upset. "I'm shocked by it, I'm saddened by it, and I know 
there's got to be more to it," Grace said.

THE TENSE LIFE OF RILEY; EX-LAKER COACH UNDERGOES DRASTIC TRANSFORMATION FROM 
COOL LEADER TO TOUGH-GUY MENTOR WITH KNICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Riles, are you in there? 
</P>
<P>
 You still look the same, like a model on a runway, but this can't be Pat Riley 
they're talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnie Walsh, the Pacers' president, says you've "gone from an orchestra 
leader in L.A. to Hannibal Lecter with this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Your buddy, Bulls Coach Phil Jackson, suggests you're running a police state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like, his players can't talk to my players," says Jackson. "His coaches can't 
talk to my coaches. That's the difference in our style. My style is open. I 
close my practices as he does but my style is open. Freedom with the basketball 
club, closed basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
 Remember when you were a Laker? 
</P>
<P>
 If your name ever came up, people said you were the luckiest man alive and you 
agreed and that was that. If they wanted to be mean, they said you were 
coaching a bunch of softies. By way of an answer, you won four titles and made 
the finals seven times in nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 You talked about grace and athleticism and giving your players freedom to 
express themselves on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you are coaching the Knicks and you say, "The game of the '90s has become 
a game of force where people say, 'I'm going to impose my will on you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lo and behold, here you are again in the finals, with a team that went 39-43 
the season before you arrived and ate up five coaches in five years. Maybe it 
is a game of force. Maybe everything has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe nothing has changed? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not any different at all," says Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been part of two great organizations that had talented players and 
managements that were committed to doing everything they could do to win. I'm a 
lot more experienced now. I don't approach it any differently." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he's right. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes started well before he left the Lakers, although it was little 
noted and dimly appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, he was just the lucky stiff sitting one seat down when the 
high-stepping Laker players offed Paul Westhead. By 1985 when they overcame 
their Celtic curse, he'd become a real coach and by the back-to-back titles of 
1987-88, he had taken over the program. 
</P>
<P>
 They were widely written off in 1986 when Houston's Twin Towers toppled them 
and everyone, including Riley, said they needed another tower. But every year 
as the Lakers' scoring average dropped, their defensive average came down with 
it. That was Riley's contribution and it was critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson calls him the difference in the '80s. Celtic players unhorsed 
their own hard case, Bill Fitch, got an easy rider who'd do it their way in 
K.C. Jones and won three titles. Riley drove the aging Lakers to two more 
titles in '87 and '88 to give them five in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Riley was gone. He kept getting hungrier and his players kept 
getting older. 
</P>
<P>
 They went up in a puff of smoke in 1990 in a five-game upset at the hands of 
the Suns, by which time Riley had alienated himself from the players and worn 
down his last defender, Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened," says Johnson, "was he made more money, commercials and things 
than players. He became a national figure, bigger than some of the players. And 
then, with the complaints -- he just had to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't any two ways about it, It was one way. He had to go. It wasn't 
because he was not a good coach . . . . He could never come back to that team 
and coach those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, having poured the passion of his youth into the Lakers, was heartbroken 
at leaving and dismayed all over when reports of hard feelings leaked. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, he refused to acknowledge it before telling his one-time NBC 
partner, Bob Costas: 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I regret most about it is how it ended. I looked at that Laker team 
in the '80s as a team that was significant, that was unique, that did things no 
one ever did. And one of the things that we had there was the sense of being 
family and being solid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ended a little bit bitter and it ended a little toxicly and to me, I 
regretted the fact that the team would not embrace protecting the '80s . . . . 
I'm just talking about the team. When it comes down to it, it's really 12 
players, three coaches, really. Those are the people that go through it. I 
mean, management is very, very important but the ones that are on the floor, 
that are sweating, that are going through the whole thing, the ups, the downs, 
are the ones that have to preserve that time. And you preserve it by protecting 
each other, by taking care of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm sure, five to 10 years from now, when we look back on that time, 
nobody's going to remember that last year. But there'll be someone who 
remembers and they'll say, 'Well, they fragmented.' You know? 'They couldn't 
keep it together.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still going on. It was too good and it was too glorious and it doesn't 
happen that much . . . . That's what I wanted most out of that thing and I 
don't feel it was that way." He hasn't looked back since. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great moment in my past," he said a few days ago. "It's over with . 
. . . I'm not as sentimental about it as I used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's never really been Riles in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Riles was that nice, down-to-earth guy who'd been a Laker all his life, who 
hung out on the beach in Santa Monica, did color for Chick Hearn, went out with 
the press guys as a young coach and gave them the lowdown on everything, even 
if there was little left of that incarnation left by late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived in New York with a program worked out to the most minute detail, 
including the proper placement of podium, VCR and TV in a meeting room and the 
arrangement of a dining room for team dinners: round tables seating four 
players, cloth napkins folded into triangles. 
</P>
<P>
 That was just the window dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of it was the practice schedule. Two-hour drills were standard for 
the NBA, and off-days common. Riley often went three hours and gave them only 
enough off-days to keep them off balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat had an interesting theory on this," says Dave Wohl, an ex-Laker 
assistant. "He felt . . . . if you backed off and made things easier, they 
would tend to respond less, that if you made things harder -- for instance in 
the three years I was there, I don't think he ever gave Magic a day off and 
Earvin worked very hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Pat's theory was, 'If I give Earvin a day off, he's going to believe he 
needs a day off. There are days he's going to begin to feel somewhat sorry for 
himself if he's tired or there's too big a burden. So what he's going to do 
those games, he won't bring his best. Not that he doesn't want to but he'll 
allow his body and mind to convince him that he can't bring his best.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Knicks' bodies and minds would need a little work to get to 
that point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard he practiced tough but I didn't think it would be like that," says 
the Cavaliers' Gerald Wilkins, then a Knick. 
</P>
<P>
 "His practices are long, long and hard. Everybody else's practices are either 
short and medium hard, or short and hard. Or if they're long, they're not 
really as hard as his practices . . . . He demanded a lot. I guess that's what 
I want to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Practice started at 9:30. You look up, it's 10:30, 11:30. OK, practice is 
getting ready to stop now. Well, 12, not yet, 12:30. All of a sudden it's 
almost 1 o'clock. You know we've been in there three hours. The players have 
never done it. I don't think any players in the league have done it." 
</P>
<P>
 In their first season, the Knicks tied the Celtics for first place in the 
Atlantic Division -- in 12 seasons Riley has never finished second -- and took 
the Bulls to seven games in the Eastern semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, they won their division, earned home-court advantage over the 
Bulls but lost to them in six games in the Eastern finals. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, with a little help from Michael Jordan, the Knicks made the 
finals. What was left of the Knicks, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last season's team would probably have plowed this field under but this 
season's Knicks were undercut by injuries to John Starks, Doc Rivers and 
Charles Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 They had to find a point guard in the middle of the season and rehab Starks in 
the playoffs, five weeks after he underwent arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Their offense, never potent, sagged. Before Game 7 of the Chicago series, 
Riley wrote 80 on the backboard in the dressing room; that was what he thought 
they had to hold the Bulls to in order to win. 
</P>
<P>
 They won, 87-77. 
</P>
<P>
 They had to go seven games, and come from 3-2 behind, to survive the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
 They were suspected of being out on their feet coming into this series but 
they upended the Rockets in Game 2 . . . . before the Rockets turned around and 
upended them Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rockets are going to have to go over Riley who is everywhere, 
demanding his players seize the moment ("If in some way shape or form this 
summer they'll say, 'Well, it was a great learning experience to get there, now 
we know what it's all about,' then they're missing a great opportunity"), 
ordering them to start making their shots ("You're a professional player that 
gets paid a lot of money, you make those shots. You make 'em.") 
</P>
<P>
 He is perfectly engrossed, perfectly miserable and perfectly fulfilled. If he 
steals this title, he'll need a bigger bust in the Hall of Fame and he'll be 
perfectly happy, at least for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, he still keeps his watch on West Coast time. You're still in there 
somewhere, aren't you, Riles?

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; 'BENEDICT' KEENAN A SELFISH SCHEMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although New York Ranger Coach Mike Keenan has denied persistent reports that 
he will leave New York to become coach and general manager of the Detroit Red 
Wings, this circus isn't over. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two disturbing aspects to this mess: 
</P>
<P>
 -- When the first reports surfaced, he danced around them for three days. If 
he didn't talk to the Red Wings, why not deny it as soon and as emphatically as 
possible, as New York Knick Coach Pat Riley did after it was reported that he 
had been wooed by the Clippers? Because Keenan wanted to fan the flames, the 
better to get bargaining leverage with his Madison Square Garden bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If Keenan did reach a verbal agreement with the Red Wings, as is believed 
by many NHL observers and at least one Ranger executive, that's unethical. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally reprehensible is talk that he claims credit for the trades that 
brought Stephane Matteau, Glenn Anderson and Craig MacTavish to New York. 
Keenan wanted the deals, but General Manager Neil Smith made them, and at 
minimal cost. There's a difference between wanting a player and getting that 
player. Smith got the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Keenan do his job tonight in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals, or will he 
be a four-time Cup loser? 
</P>
<P>
 He said Monday he "will be coaching the New York Rangers next year unless my 
bosses decide that I won't be." They might decide they've had enough of his 
self-serving scheming and set him free. Keenan wants to call the shots, but 
that won't happen while Smith is there. Smith has made many astute draft 
selections and trades. He plays according to the rules, which makes him a 
favorite with his bosses but a pawn in Keenan's power games. Smith has told 
friends that he and Keenan won't be in the same city next season, so Smith 
might end up in Detroit when this is all settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan has earned no admirers this spring. He set up an excuse for a possible 
loss to the New Jersey Devils in the semifinals when he "revealed" that Brian 
Leetch and Mark Messier were hurt. Club insiders doubt Messier was injured, but 
saying so lifted any possible blame off Keenan. They won Game 6 and the series 
because of Messier, not Keenan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ranger coach pulled a similar stunt in the finals, blaming New York "media 
hype" for losing Game 5 when the real reasons were a disorganized defense and a 
soft game by goaltender Mike Richter. Keenan came to New York knowing it's not 
a backwater town. He sought the spotlight and now blames its glare for the 
team's shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 He said officiating cost the Rangers Game 6, inaccurately claiming that 
referees have called the first penalty of the game against the Rangers more 
often than they've called the first penalty against the Vancouver Canucks. Not 
so. Each team has taken the first penalty three times. 
</P>
<P>
 When Monday's New York Post trumpeted, "Benedict Arnold had nothing on Mike 
Keenan," Keenan said he didn't know who Benedict Arnold was. Those who ignore 
history are condemned to repeat it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Keenan will have a Stanley Cup ring if the Rangers win tonight. But he 
will have no credibility or respect around the NHL. AGENT OF CHANGE 
</P>
<P>
 Don Meehan stands to lose thousands of dollars if an agent certification 
proposed by the NHL Players Assn. becomes part of its next collective 
bargaining agreement with the league. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, to take effect on Jan. 1, 1995, is meant to prevent conflicts of 
interest affecting agents with a multitude of clients. Meehan represents many 
prominent players, including Pat LaFontaine and Wendel Clark, as well as 
coaches Pat Burns of Toronto, Brian Sutter of Boston, Scotty Bowman of Detroit 
and Jacques Demers of Montreal. He also represents the NHL Officials Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan was recently the target of a whisper campaign by rival agents who tried 
to discredit him by saying he made investments that cost his clients large 
amounts of money. However, no legal claims have been made against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is the wish of players that I no longer act for coaches, I'll 
accommodate them and respect their wishes even though I don't agree with it," 
Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he would hand the day-to-day concerns of the officials' 
association to an associate, but wants to remain involved in the next 
negotiations. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Pavel Bure's agent, Ron Salcer, denied reports that Bure threatened to stop 
playing unless the Canucks granted his request for a new contract. His threats 
were supposedly made during Vancouver's first-round series against the Calgary 
Flames and before Game 5 of the semifinals against the Toronto Maple Leafs. . . 
. General Manager Harry Sinden of the Boston Bruins interviewed former Bruin 
Eddie Westfall for the assistant GM job. . . . Sinden is considering the 
acquisition of backup Ranger goalie Glenn Healy. The Bruins gave Jon Casey a 
termination contract and otherwise will go with free agent Blaine Lacher of 
Lake Superior State in goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ottawa Senators are interested in free-agent goaltender Don Beaupre. . . . 
The Edmonton Oilers are expected to name George Burnett, coach of their Cape 
Breton farm team, as their new coach. . . . The St. Louis Blues may pursue 
free-agent defenseman Glen Wesley. . . . Will the Quebec Nordiques hire Larry 
Robinson as their coach instead of supposed shoo-in Michel Bergeron?

 Charles Barkley of the Phoenix Suns told Joseph Tybor of the Chicago Tribune 
that he's dead serious about running as a Republican for governor of his home 
state.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be governor of Alabama in 1998," Barkley said, "but I don't know 
what I'll be doing until then." 
</P>
<P>
 Said former vice president Dan Quayle, who played in a recent celebrity golf 
tournament with Barkley:

 "I told him I will come into Alabama and campaign for him, or campaign against 
him -- whatever way will help. He hasn't decided which yet."

BROCK REMEMBERED AS A PIONEER; ARIZONA ST. BASEBALL COACH LEFT HIS MARK ON 
COLLEAGUES

 Jim Brock, one of the winningest coaches in college baseball history, was 
remembered by colleagues Monday as an important influence on his sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock, who led Arizona State to two national championships and 13 College 
World Series appearances in his 23 seasons with the Sun Devils, died Sunday 
after a yearlong battle with liver and colon cancer.He was 57. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim was part of a very elite group that includes (former USC Coach) Rod 
Dedeaux and (Texas Coach) Cliff Gustafson," Cal State Fullerton Coach Augie 
Garrido said. "Because of them, college baseball continued to grow. Because of 
them, there is a much larger group of elite programs in the country today." 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service was scheduled for Wednesday in Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock, whose teams won national titles in 1977 and '81, is seventh on the 
career victory list with a 1,110-440 record. He had most of his liver and part 
of his colon removed after last year's College World Series appearance, and 
struggled with his health throughout this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had the sharpest wit of anybody I've known," Gustafson said. "He seemed to 
bring out the best in people by keeping things upbeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall called Brock a good friend. "On the field we were 
adversaries, but we were loyal adversaries, loyal to one another," he said. "I 
learned a great deal from him."

WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY; HE MIGHT BE RIGHT, BUT WHO IS HE TO TALK?

<P>
 Words to inspire as athletes prepare for the USA-Mobil Outdoor Track and Field 
Championships that begin today at Knoxville, Tenn.: 
</P>
<P>
 "Track and field is the sports equivalent of the witness protection program; 
it's a place where you can be completely anonymous," actor Kevin Pollack said 
upon presenting an ESPY award to sprinter Michael Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Johnson, we know. But Kevin Pollack?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack, of course, is not entirely incorrect. Track and field seldom enters 
into the average American sports fan's consciousness, a reality for which the 
sport's officials, athletes and agents have only themselves to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet at Knoxville is one of the two best in the country this year -- the 
other is the United States-Africa dual meet scheduled for Durham, N.C., in 
August -- and should be a showcase for the top U.S. athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many will be there, including Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Gail Devers, Gwen 
Torrence, Mike Powell, Quincy Watts, Butch Reynolds, Kevin Young, Dan O'Brien 
and Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
 But because of friction between USA Track and Field and the Santa Monica Track 
Club, three of the world's fastest sprinters -- Carl Lewis, Leroy Burrell and 
Mike Marsh -- are planning to boycott.  
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the issues are in this particular dispute, the real issue is 
that Santa Monica's manager, Joe Douglas, does not believe USATF is progressive 
enough in promoting the sport or its athletes. He is right, although it does 
not seem as if a boycott by his athletes will help achieve those goals, either. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 National champions will qualify for the track and field competition in the 
July 23-Aug. 7 Goodwill Games at St. Petersburg, Russia, but Lewis, Burrell and 
Marsh also will be there because they received at-large invitations. Waiting 
for Lewis and Burrell in the 100 meters will be Great Britain's Olympic and 
world champion, Linford Christie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I run in fear of losing," Christie said in a recent interview with London's 
Daily Mail. "I run because I like to hear 'God Save the Queen' instead of 'The 
Star Spangled Banner.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After training for two months in Westwood with Coach John Smith, Marie-Jose 
Perec returned home to France to compete in a meet Friday, beating Torrence in 
the 200 meters. In a Paris news conference the previous day, she said one 
reason she likes living in the United States is the aggressive approach to 
shopping.  
</P>
<P>
 "Achetez, achetez jusqu'a ce que vous tombiez!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't have the same rhyme to it in French, but she meant, "Shop, shop 
until you drop." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Water polo player Dan Leyson, who will play for the United States in the June 
23-26 Alamo Cup at Newport Beach, wrote about Otto Schindler's list in a 
research paper for a class at USC four years before the Academy Award-winning 
movie was released.  
</P>
<P>
 Leyson learned of the list from his father, whose family was saved when hired 
by Schindler to work in one of his factories during the Holocaust. 
</P>

<P>
 As expected, the USOC approved plans during a board of directors meeting over 
the weekend in Boston to decrease the number of U.S. Olympic festivals between 
Summer Olympics from three to two. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is expected to save the USOC $4.2 million, but the real reason for 
doing it is to cut back on multisport competitions. In the 14-month period 
between last February and next March, the USOC and its sports governing bodies 
will have had to prepare athletes for the Winter Olympics, the U.S. Olympic 
Festival, the Goodwill Games and the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC's executive committee will decide on Aug. 1 the exact years for the 
Festival. During the span between 1996 and 2000, the winter sports' governing 
bodies prefer 1997 and 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 After losing $44 million on the first Goodwill Games in 1986 and $27 million 
on the second in 1990, Ted Turner estimated that he will lose only $10 million 
this summer. That is encouraging enough for him to proclaim last week during a 
news conference that nothing could prevent the 1998 Goodwill Games, scheduled 
for New York, from happening. . . . "Well, maybe a world war," he added, 
"depending on whom was fighting whom.". . . . Greg Louganis, who won four 
Olympic gold medals, will perform in an exhibition Monday at the Gay Games in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, during the July 1-10 U.S. Olympic Festival in St. Louis, he 
will receive the U.S. Olympic Committee's Robert J. Kane Award, which goes to a 
former Festival athlete who has given back to his sport. . . . Cities bidding 
to stage future Olympic festivals are Dallas, Phoenix, Portland, Seattle and 
Richmond, Va. Next summer's Festival has been awarded to three Colorado cities 
-- Denver, Boulder and Colorado Springs. Los Angeles and Anaheim made a joint 
bid for the U.S. Olympic Congress in 1997, '98 or '99, but the winners were 
Orlando, Phoenix and Dallas. . . . As the USOC was leaving Boston, the 
International Skating Union was arriving for its annual meeting. The U.S. 
Figure Skating Assn. is attempting to push through a rule that would open the 
sport even further to professionals. The USFSA would like for all skaters to be 
eligible for ISU competitions as long as they do not participate in 
unsanctioned events. . . . The USFSA has announced its entrants for the 
Goodwill Games. Among Southern Californians on the list are Michelle Kwan and 
the pairs team of Stephanie Stiegler and Lance Travis. . . . All three train at 
Lake Arrowhead's Ice Castle International Training Center.

 Shed a tear for Chicago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 First, Michael Jordan. Now, Ryne Sandberg. Goodbye, Nos. 23. In a span of 
eight months, the best fans in America have lost their two most beloved 
athletes to premature retirement. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sandberg's decision Monday wasn't as important to baseball as Jordan's was to 
basketball last October, but it was nearly as surprising. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 How many other 34-year-old athletes would forfeit all those millions of 
dollars in salary because they thought their skills were eroding?. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A long time ago, I saw a young Cub second baseman who I thought was headed for 
the Hall of Fame -- Ken Hubbs, the 1962 National League rookie of the year from 
Colton High. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He was killed at age 22 in a plane crash after his second season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs were unlucky to lose Hubbs, but fortunate to obtain Sandberg. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He and shortstop Larry Bowa were traded to Chicago from the Philadelphia 
Phillies for shortstop Ivan DeJesus on Jan. 27, 1982. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Next stop for Sandberg will be Cooperstown, N.Y.. . . .

 Judge Patricia Gifford cutting time off Mike Tyson's sentence would have been 
as startling an upset as Buster Douglas knocking out Tyson. . . .

<P>
 Even if you aren't a fan, do yourself a favor and watch the hockey that begins 
at 5 p.m. today on ESPN. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This is no ordinary seventh game of a Stanley Cup finals. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It matches a team counted out as long ago as Tuesday when it trailed in the 
series, 3-1, against a team that last won the Cup as long ago as 1940. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Even if the New York Rangers-Vancouver Canucks game at Madison Square Garden 
doesn't live up to its billing, the postgame handshakes and the victorious 
captain's skate around the rink with Cup raised high will make it all 
worthwhile. . . . In the fourth quarter, an NBA most valuable player is 
supposed to be the go-to guy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon has become the can't-find guy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But he showed his value to the Houston Rockets in another way in the final 
half-minute Sunday night when, instead of trying to force a shot against the 
collapsing New York Knick defense, he fed Sam Cassell for the decisive 
three-point basket. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most important assist of the series thus far. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Knick power forward Charles Oakley, who usually leaves opponents bruised, is 
aching all over and has to ice down his shoulders, ankles and knees after every 
game. . . .

 The Say No College Basketball Classic -- featuring many local players and 
recruits -- begins a two-month run at Trade Tech downtown with a tripleheader 
Friday at 6 p.m. Five games are scheduled both Saturday and Sunday, starting at 
noon. Admission and parking are free. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 New York's first-place baseball team, the Yankees, couldn't have picked a 
better time for a slump. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 With the Rangers and Knicks playing for championships, nobody has been paying 
much attention to baseball in New York. . . .

<P>
 Doug Jones, the new closer in the Philadelphia Phillies' bullpen, is known as 
"the Mild Thing.". . . .

 The St. Louis Cardinals would love to have a twin-brother battery some day -- 
pitcher Brent Wagner, who was taken in the first round of the draft, and 
catcher Kyle Wagner, taken in the 21st round. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Doug Million didn't quite live up to his name when he signed a 
$905,000 contract with the Colorado Rockies after being drafted in the first 
round. . . . 
</P>

 The only good thing about Brocco's scratch from the Belmont Stakes is that 
Hollywood Park fans might get to see him in the Swaps Stakes on July 23. . . .

 Johnny Tapia, the undefeated flyweight from Albuquerque who didn't fight for 3 
1/2 years because of a drug problem, will make the fourth start of his comeback 
attempt on June 24 at the Olympic Auditorium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 9 is delighted with the high ratings -- an average of 5.4 and a peak 
of 8.5 -- that the boxing show from the Forum got Saturday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball America says California forward Lamond Murray and Minnesota guard 
Vashon Leonard will go to the Clippers and Louisville forward Clifford Rozier 
will go to the Lakers in the first round of the NBA draft on June 29. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Rodman's status with the San Antonio Spurs is shakier than ever now 
that John Lucas is no longer around to baby-sit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It must not be easy for Boston fans to root for a Chamberlain -- Red Sox 
outfielder Wes Chamberlain. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: New York 5, Vancouver 4, the winning goal being scored by Mark 
Messier at 5:54 of overtime.

WORLD CUP '94 DAILY REPORT; VETERAN WEGERLE WILL NOT START OPENING GAME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Roy Wegerle, the most experienced forward on the U.S. team, said Monday he 
won't start Saturday in the Americans' World Cup opener against Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegerle, 30, was injured Jan. 8 and had three arthroscopic operations on his 
right knee this spring, the last on April 15. He hasn't played a full game 
since Jan. 3, when he scored for Coventry City during a 1-1 tie with Swindon 
Town in England's Premier League. 
</P>
<P>
 The South African-born Wegerle, who became a naturalized U.S. citizen before 
the 1992 U.S. Cup exhibition tournament, scored the goal for the United States 
in a 1-0 victory against Mexico on June 4, the last World Cup warm-up for the 
Americans. In his only other action since the injury, he played 19 minutes 
against Saudi Arabia on May 25 and 13 minutes against Greece on May 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no substitute for match fitness," he said. 
</P>

 Seventy-one percent of Americans surveyed still don't know the World Cup is 
being played in the United States, according to a Harris Poll released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-six percent of those surveyed say they're not interested in watching any 
games on television and 65% aren't interested in attending. Only 38% know that 
the World Cup involves soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll of 1,253 adults was conducted from May 23-26 and has an error margin 
of 3%.

 The Nigerian soccer team was prevented from leaving the country for the United 
States because of visa problems, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nigerian squad and a delegation from the country's soccer federation had 
been due to arrive in Dallas on Monday evening but World Cup officials said 
they had been advised they would now be arriving today. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreas Herren, spokesman for the world soccer body FIFA, said: "The Nigerian 
team has some kind of visa problems that have delayed their departure." 
</P>
<P>
 An official from the World Cup organizers added: "Some visas were apparently 
not in order and the flight has been delayed. We believe it will now arrive at 
5 a.m. on Tuesday, but we are still seeking details from Lagos." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has made an exception to allow a flight from Nigeria as all 
flights emanating from Lagos are banned from entering the country because U.S. 
authorities consider it a transit port for drug smugglers.

 Referees who fail to comply with a directive to send off players tackling from 
behind will be sent home, FIFA President Joao Havelange said.

 "Any referee who doesn't show a red card for a tackle from behind will be 
going home on the first plane the following day," he said. "All the referees 
know it."

 FIFA will decide in October how to allocate the eight extra places at future 
World Cup finals when the tournament is expanded in 1998.

 Africa, Asia and North and Central America would all receive extra places 
under the two main proposals put forward, Havelange said, and Oceania would be 
guaranteed its own berth for the first time.

 Assailants armed with automatic weapons mugged the pregnant wife of Brazilian 
soccer star Bebeto in Rio and almost kidnapped the player's brother, according 
to police and news reports.

 Denise de Oliveira, 25, was stopped at a traffic light in the Tijuca district 
of Rio at 7:30 p.m. on Sunday when a black sports car pulled up in front of her 
car.

 Two men with machine guns ordered Oliveira, eight months pregnant, Bebeto's 
brother, Wilson de Oliveira and his wife, Nivalda, out of the car. 
</P>

 "One of them wanted to kidnap Wilson. Denise pleaded with them and gave them 
her Rolex wrist watch so they would go away," Nivalda told the Rio daily Jornal

 The ads on television in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, pitched a vacation package that 
was a soccer fan's dream: A flight to the United States, tickets to every World 
Cup game, and even a hard-to-obtain U.S. visa. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounded too good to be true -- and it was, the government-run newspaper 
Fraternite Matin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested two of the four Ivorians identified as the directors of the 
group, called Dimension International, and were hunting for two others after 
learning they had withdrawn the equivalent of $26,000 from an account set up to 
collect payments for the tours.

 Players will not be barred from drinking water during World Cup games as some 
team managers feared, FIFA said.

 "Players will be allowed to take drinks during matches as long as they stand 
on the (sideline)," said FIFA press officer Guido Tognoni.

 "We won't allow drink bottles to be thrown on to the (field) but, of course, 
we will allow the players to take in fluid."

 Brazil 1994 -- Brazil is considered by many to be the World Cup favorite. The 
Brazilians have abandoned the sweeper and returned to a 4-4-2 formation. The 
two forwards might be the world's best combination: Romario scored a Spanish 
League-high 30 goals for champion Barcelona; Bebeto had 16 for runner-up 
Deportivo de la Coruna. Future stars are Muller and Ronaldo, a 17 year-old 
sensation who has drawn raves from Pele.

THESE DEFENDERS NEVER REST; THE FAVORED TEAMS IN THIS YEAR'S TOURNAMENT HAVE 
ONE THING IN COMMON: A DEFENSE ANCHORED BY A VETERAN RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE 
BEST IN THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Asked to list the top defenders in international soccer, anyone knowledgeable 
about the sport would not find it difficult to come up with at least a 
half-dozen names. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, for example, is one quick group of six: Franco Baresi, Oscar Ruggeri, 
Ronald Koeman, Andreas Brehme, Ricardo Gomes and Luis Carlos Perea. 
</P>
<P>
 These are players who have an established reputation as the best in the 
business. They are respected, and indeed feared, by strikers worldwide. They 
have written their names into the history of the game by their ability to foil 
opposing forwards, to break up attacking moves and to thwart the best-laid 
plans of coaches from Barcelona to Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the rocks upon which opposing teams founder and upon which their own 
teams are built. 
</P>
<P>
 The six mentioned also have two other things in common: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Each will be playing in World Cup '94 this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Each is more than 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is one common thread that runs through all the leading candidates to 
win the championship, it is that their defense is anchored by a veteran playing 
in what certainly will be his final World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the last hurrah for defenders whose names have become familiar during 
the past decade or more. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them will be on the World Cup-winning team unless this tournament 
produces upsets of monumental proportions. It is almost impossible to imagine 
that one of their teams will not be the champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Will it be Baresi, who this season won yet another Italian League title with 
AC Milan and helped the club win the European Cup for the fourth time in six 
years, kissing the solid gold World Cup trophy in Pasadena on July 17? 
</P>
<P>
 Baresi, who was on Italy's 1982 World Cup team in Spain, turned 34 on May 8 
and was bitterly disappointed when the Italians finished third in the 1990 
World Cup, losing to Argentina in a semifinal game at Naples. 
</P>
<P>
 Another player on the field that night was Ruggeri, the grand old man of the 
Argentine defense and a World Cup winner in 1986. Ruggeri turned 32 in January 
and has been beset by injuries in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 All the same, South America's player of the year in 1991 has led his country 
to consecutive Copa America victories and into two consecutive World Cup 
championship games. It is not likely Coach Alfio Basile will disregard 
Ruggeri's vast experience this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Koeman, whose club, Barcelona, was beaten by AC Milan in the 
European Cup final at Athens in May. The Dutchman has been a mainstay of The 
Netherlands' national team for as long as anyone can remember. Now 31, Koeman 
got a European Championship winner's medal with the Dutch team in 1988 and a 
European Cup winner's medal with Barcelona in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 His specialty is the free kick, which he has developed into an art form. His 
free kick beat Italy's Sampdoria in the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley 
Stadium in London and another one helped keep England out of World Cup '94 when 
the Dutch beat the English in a vital qualifying match at Rotterdam last 
autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 Another player with a ferocious kick is Brehme, who will always be remembered 
by Argentine fans because it was his perfectly placed penalty kick just inside 
the left post that beat goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea in the 1990 World Cup final 
and gave Germany its hard-fought victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Brehme, 33, has been a member of the German national team since 1984. He 
retired briefly from the team after Italia '90 but was recalled by German Coach 
Berti Vogts because Vogts could find no one who could play the left back 
position better than Brehme. Christian Ziege was challenging strongly for the 
spot last summer, but Ziege was injured in April and will miss the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 That means Germany will have most of its 1990 defense intact for this 
tournament. Joining Brehme at the back will be two other members of the 1990 
World Cup-winning team, Juergen Kohler, 28, and Lothar Matthaeus, 33, who is 
playing sweeper instead of midfield. A third member of that team, Guido 
Buchwald, 33, has been playing more in midfield recently, but could be used on 
defense again just as easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Gomes, 30, who was a vital part of Paris St Germain's drive to 
the French League championship this season. Gomes is paired at the back of the 
Brazilian defense with another veteran, Ricardo Rocha, 31, who left Real Madrid 
in Spain this year to join Vasco da Gama in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Add right back Jorginho, 29, who is on the verge of winning the Bundesliga 
championship with Bayern Munich in Germany, and the vastly experienced Branco, 
who turned 30 in April, and it is obvious that Brazil has a defense every bit 
as "ancient" as Germany's. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is Perea, who was a revelation for Colombia in the Copa America 
tournament in Ecuador last summer and in the qualifying matches for the World 
Cup. At 30, Perea is Colombia's most experienced international and, with Luis 
Herrera, 31, forms the backbone of the Colombian defense. 
</P>
<P>
 These six great defenders could be the key to their countries' World Cup 
fortunes. But are they over the hill? Have they lost the pace they need to keep 
up with today's lightning-fast forwards? Should they have been put out to 
pasture already, leaving the World Cup to younger men? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers will come in the weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there are several other defenders in the tournament who are getting 
a bit long in the tooth. Ireland's Paul McGrath is 34, Norway's Rune Bratseth 
is 33 and Greece's Stelios Manolas will be 33 in July. 
</P>
<P>
 But for every veteran defender in the World Cup, there are a half-dozen 
younger players waiting to take the spotlight on the international stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Italy's Paolo Maldini, 25, already are recognized as among the best 
in the world. Others, like Mexico's Ramon Ramirez, 24, and the Netherlands' 
wonderfully named Ulrich Van Gobbel, 23, are waiting for fame to find them. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup '94 will be the sieve that sorts the best from the rest. But don't 
discount those old defenders just yet. The last waltz has yet to be danced.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; MITCHELL RETURNS TO LINEUP FOR REDS

<P>
 Outfielder Kevin Mitchell of the Cincinnati Reds, who sat out two games 
because of an eye injury suffered in a bar incident, was back in the lineup 
Monday against the Dodgers. Before the game, Red General Manager Jim Bowden 
issued a statement saying the team had completed its investigation of the 
incident and had cleared Mitchell of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell suffered a swollen right eye Friday night after being hit at a 
prominent Cincinnati-area nightspot. He sat out the last two weekend games 
against the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell told the Reds he was an innocent bystander at The Waterfront, a 
restaurant-bar frequented by athletes, when he was hit by a flying bottle. His 
account was disputed again Monday night by the establishment's owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Ruby, the restaurant owner, told the Associated Press on Monday night 
that Mitchell got into a disagreement with a woman he knew and she hit him with 
a beer mug. TIM KAWAKAMI

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; EXPOS' FASSERO MISSES LINER -- AND A NO-HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Expo left-hander Jeff Fassero came within one out -- actually one pitch -- of 
throwing a no-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates Monday night at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Expos' 10-2 victory, Fassero had a one-two count on Carlos Garcia when 
Garcia hit a waist-high drive back at the mound. Fassero stuck out his glove to 
the right side and almost snagged the ball, but it bounced out and rolled 
toward third base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it hit my thumb," Fassero said. "I lost it for a second when I looked 
into my glove, because I thought I had caught it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fassero recovered and made a strong throw to first baseman Randy Milligan, but 
Garcia slid head-first and barely beat the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he put his glove out I thought sure he had caught the ball," Garcia 
said. "Usually, I don't slide into first base much, but you don't have a chance 
to break up a no-hitter every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Umpire Bob Davidson called Garcia safe, and there was no dispute about the 
call -- or the ruling that it was an infield single instead of an error. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time this season that an Expo pitcher lost a no-hitter in 
the ninth. Pedro Martinez held Cincinnati hitless on April 13 until Brian 
Dorsett led off the ninth with a clean single. 
</P>
<P>
 Still needing one out for his first shutout in 29 major league starts, 
Fassero, 31, lost that, too, when Jay Bell followed with a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Fassero (5-4) was pulled after Bell's homer, and got a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Expos hit four home runs, three of them in the fifth inning to finish 
Denny Neagle (6-7). 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 5, Houston 4 -- Matt Williams and Todd Benzinger each homered at 
San Francisco to help the Giants end a four-game skid. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who hit his National League-leading 23rd homer, said, "What Dusty 
(Baker, the Giants' manager) decided to do for the next couple of days is stay 
away from the batting cage and just let us work it out ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 William VanLandingham (2-0) allowed two runs on four hits over 6 2/3 innings 
in his fourth major league start. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 7, Atlanta 2 -- Marvin Freeman, facing his former team, helped the 
Rockies end a 16-game losing streak against the Braves, allowing one run on 
eight hits in seven innings at Atlanta. He didn't walk a batter and struck out 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman (6-1), signed as a free agent with the Rockies this winter after 3 1/2 
years with the Braves, lowered his ERA to 2.89. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves had been the only club the Rockies, in their second season, had 
never defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Bret Saberhagen pitched five-hit ball for seven 
innings and helped his cause with a pair of timely bunts at New York. 
Saberhagen (7-3) gave up two runs, struck out six and walked one to win for the 
third time in his last four decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 2, Florida 1 -- Tom Pagnozzi singled in Ray Lankford with one out in 
the ninth inning at St. Louis to give the Cardinals a victory over the slumping 
Marlins. Mike Perez (2-1) got the victory despite allowing an inside-the-park 
home run -- the first in Marlin history -- to Bret Barberie in the ninth.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CANSECO'S BIG NIGHT: THREE HOMERS, EIGHT RBIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All Ken Griffey Jr. did Monday night at Arlington, Tex., was hit a grand slam, 
drive in a career-high six runs -- and get upstaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Canseco hit three homers, including a 480-foot shot, and drove in a 
career-high eight runs in leading the Texas Rangers over the Seattle Mariners, 
17-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco, who missed the previous three games because of a hip injury, went 
five for six with a team-record 14 total bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco hit a two-run homer in the first inning and a three-run shot in the 
third and a solo shot, his 19th, in the seventh, matching a career high for 
homers in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 His 480-foot blast was the one in the third and was the longest in Arlington 
since the Rangers began recording distances in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Canseco had RBI singles in the second and fifth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredible feeling, but that's what Ken Griffey Jr. has felt all 
season," Canseco said. "You want to pinch yourself to make sure it's real." 
</P>
<P>
 In his last eight games, Canseco is 19 for 34 with eight homers and 20 runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey hit his 26th homer, and sixth career grand slam, in the sixth inning 
as the Mariners pulled within 11-5. He was three for five. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 7, Toronto 3 -- Mark Clark, one of baseball's best-kept secrets, 
kept his Jacobs Field record perfect and pitched the Indians to their 12th 
consecutive home victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark (8-1) allowed three runs and nine hits in 7 2/3 innings and won his 
sixth consecutive decision to improve to 5-0 in eight home starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquired by the Indians from St. Louis for Mark Whiten in March 1993, the 
right-hander blossomed when he changed from an abbreviated windup to a full 
over-the-head motion late in the season after a stint on the disabled list. 
He's 11-2 in 18 starts since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Belle hit his 16th home run and Manny Ramirez his 11th for Cleveland. 
Joe Carter hit his 16th for Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Brad Cornett (0-1) lost his first big league start, hurting himself by 
walking five batters. Three of them scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 5, Boston 2 -- The Red Sox lost their fifth in a row as Roger 
Clemens (6-3), the only Red Sox starter to win since May 26, allowed four runs 
on eight hits in six innings at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens struck out five, increasing his American League-leading total to 103, 
but was outpitched by Jim Deshaies (3-6), who allowed two runs on eight hits 
and struck out a season-high seven in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox, who have lost seven in a row at home, and 10 of 12 overall, may 
have also lost first baseman Mo Vaughn for an indefinite period. He was in 
considerable pain after being hit by a pitch in the right elbow in the third 
inning, but X-rays showed no fracture. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 1, Oakland 0 -- Jason Bere (8-1) allowed two hits over eight innings 
and struck out a career-high 14 for the White Sox at Chicago. But he walked six 
and was lifted after 129 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 3, Baltimore 1 -- Melido Perez (4-3) held the Orioles to six singles 
over eight innings at Baltimore, ending the Orioles' four-game winning streak.

 Signed as a "bonus baby" out of high school, Egan made his major league debut 
with the Angels in 1965 at 19 and eventually became their starting catcher. But 
he was beaned by the Detroit Tigers' Earl Wilson in 1969, suffered a broken jaw 
and never regained complete sight in his right eye.After being traded to the 
Chicago White Sox in 1971, he rejoined the Angels in 1974 and retired the next 
year with a disappointing .200 career average.

 Egan, 48, lives with his wife in Arizona and is an account executive for a 
trucking company. Although his children are grown, he still spends much of his 
spare time coaching Little League teams and plays in charity golf tournaments.

 Chan Ho Park, whose double-A San Antonio club was on its All-Star break, was a 
visitor at Dodger Stadium Monday night but was due back in San Antonio today. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Park and his uncle had lunch with Manager Tom Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about a lot of things," Lasorda said. "We talked a little about 
some things that we wanted very clear with him. He's doing fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda said that however warmly he feels about Park, the Dodgers never 
considered bringing Park up during the recent bullpen struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had a starter opening, we'd have him up here," Lasorda said. "But he 
hasn't pitched enough to bring him up here and put him in the bullpen. It would 
be an injustice to the young man." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda bristled when he was asked if the bullpen problems have altered the 
way he approaches the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that's going to affect if I take out a pitcher is whether I 
think that pitcher has lost his stuff," Lasorda said. "If I see he's lost it, 
he's coming out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid to use any of those guys. They're the ones who got us to where 
we were -- four games out in front. You go through hitting slumps, defensive 
slumps, starting-pitching slumps, and now we're in a relief-pitching slump. 
We'll get through it."

 Dodger Executive Vice President Fred Claire said relief pitcher Jim Gott, who

PREP NOTES: CIF DRIVES AWAY WITH A TITLE SPONSOR

 Toyota has signed on as title sponsor of the California Interscholastic 
Federation, effective July 1, it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the contract are still being worked out, but it is believed the 
deal is worth between $1 million and $2 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIF has been without a title sponsor since last July when Reebok did not 
renew its contract.

 Toyota is the second corporate sponsor to sign with the CIF in the last year, 
joining the Vons grocery store chain.

 Dean Crowley's fate as Southern Section commissioner will be decided at an 
Executive Committee meeting June 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley, 60, has been the section's acting commissioner since October when 
Stan Thomas was forced to resign for allegedly misusing his expense account. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our options is certainly to make Dean's position as commissioner 
permanent," said Gary Smidderks, executive committee president. "My feeling is 
that his performance has been favorable with the committee, and I don't expect 
any problems." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Crowley remains commissioner, one of his priorities will be to straighten 
out the football playoff groupings for next season. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of appeals have slowed the process and the playoff groupings will not 
be final until the Southern Section Council meets again in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 The playoff committee met again last week and made several changes. It is now 
recommending that groupings be based on equity instead of geography and that 
revisions be made again in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule for next season will made based on the latest recommendations, 
even though things could change in October.

ON THE BEACH / JODY BERGER: MACHADO GETS TO STAY CLOSE TO HOME

<P>
 Even among surfers, Rob Machado stands out as extremely relaxed. He's also a 
right-foot first surfer, or goofy footer, in a crowd of lefties. 
</P>
<P>
 But what really singles him out is the speed with which he has moved to the 
top of the sport. Machado, 20, began surfing professionally two years ago and 
earned rookie of the year honors in 1992. In 1993, he became U.S. Surfing 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado, already considered a contender for the 1994 world championship title, 
enters Wednesday's Body Glove Oceanside surf contest as a local and a favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado grew up in Cardiff and learned to surf in and around Oceanside, but 
it's not the homecourt advantage he's excited about. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only advantage I'll have is sleeping in my own bed," he said. "I can just 
kick back and cruise up to the contest when I want." 
</P>
<P>
 The Body Glove Oceanside is the sixth stop on the Bud Surf Tour, the national 
circuit that feeds the world tour. In a double-elimination format that 
culminates with finals Sunday, surfers will compete for $20,000 and 1,000 
points on the world qualifying tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The top 16 surfers in points earned at the end of the year earn a spot on the 
World Championship Tour the next year. Many surfers, including Machado, compete 
on both levels. 
</P>
<P>
 With world tour dates in Australia, France, Brazil and Hawaii, and national 
tour dates in Hawaii, Virginia and all over the California coast, Machado 
spends little time at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the longest I'll be home for a while," he said. "I'll be home for a 
month. Usually I'm home for only a week or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Machado's most recent trip was a 10-day stay on Habara Beach, Japan. Competing 
in the Marui Pro, the second stop of the 10-event tour, he scored his first 
world tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
 With $130,000 in purse money and former world champions Kelly Slater and Derek 
Ho in the water, it was clearly Machado's biggest victory. And yet he's not 
feeling any pressure to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day of the five-day Oceanside contest, he'll leave his parents' house in 
Cardiff an hour or 1 1/2 hours before he needs to be in the water. He'll arrive 
at the beach near the Oceanside pier, survey the scene, surf his heat and head 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just looking forward to enjoying myself," he said. "I think competition 
is something you can do for the wrong reasons. The whole reason I started 
surfing was to enjoy myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Success must have been merely a side effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got lucky," he said of the Marui Pro, and while it might be true, it's 
not the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado is known for generating amazing speed in small waves. He's at his best 
when the surf is less than four feet. The final day in Japan, the surf was 
exactly that -- four feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The conditions: Sean Collins of Surfline-Wavetrack, the industry's leading 
wave forecaster, expects surf at Oceanside to be in the waist-to-shoulder-high 
range, or two to four feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now it looks like small swells out of the southwest combining with the 
local northwest windswell," Collins said, adding that when there is one pure 
swell direction in Oceanside, the waves come in lines, which tends to favor 
goofy footers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have a little bit of windswell, lefts are going to be the favorite 
wave out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Machado: "It's a really good site for a contest. It's a beach break, and 
any kind of swell will get in there pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The competition: Machado's main rivalry will come from his friends, as it 
often does. Taylor Knox of Carlsbad, Chris Brown of Santa Barbara, Dino Andino 
of San Clemente, Pat O'Connell of Laguna Niguel, Richie Collins of Newport 
Beach and Jeff Booth of Laguna Beach also are expected to surf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably friends with half the guys I'm surfing against," Machado said. 
"But you just surf the heat, and when you're on the beach, whatever happened is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, currently the points leader on the domestic tour, won the Oceanside 
event last year, defeating Machado in the finals. Booth won the 1991 and 1992 
events and the 1987 Oceanside as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Up the beach: While spectators watch the final rounds of surfing Saturday and 
Sunday in Oceanside, farther north women will be competing in the Reebok 
Hermosa Beach Open as part of the Women's Pro Beach Volleyball tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The double-elimination event in Hermosa and the tournament in Sacramento the 
next weekend were expected to decide who would compete in the Goodwill Games, 
July 23 in St. Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of visa requirements, the deadline for naming players was moved to 
June 22 and now there is little question who will go. 
</P>
<P>
 Karolyn Kirby and Liz Masakayan, who won the Hermosa Beach Open last year, 
have won five of the six 1994 WPVA tour events, and finished second in the 
other. With 460 points, they are 64 points ahead of their nearest competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbra Fontana and Lori Kotas-Forsythe defeated Kirby/Masakayan on June 5 in 
the Myrtle Beach Open and finished second to the leaders in two other 
tournaments. Fontana/Kotas-Forsythe have 396 points, 40 more than the 
third-place team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hermosa Open, now the final event before the deadline, players will 
earn one point for playing each game and two points for winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told the third-place team couldn't possibly get enough points with 
just one event left," Fontana said. "But that doesn't make Hermosa a letdown in 
any way. I lived there for a number of years, and it's just a great place to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana grew up in Manhattan Beach and played volleyball for Mira Costa High 
School. She was a four-year starter at Stanford and then earned a law degree at 
Santa Clara. She joined the WPVA tour in 1991 and became association president 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Goodwill Games are very exciting. I think all the athletes have their 
eyes on the international game," Fontana said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Fontana and Kotas-Forsythe finished third in the world rankings 
established by the Federation Internationale de Volleyball of Lausanne, 
Switzerland (FIVB), which oversees the international game. Kirby and Masakayan 
were ranked first and a Brazilian team was second. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day Hermosa Beach Open begins at 9 a.m. Saturday, with 32 teams 
competing for the $9,400 first-place money. Competition resumes at 8:30 a.m. 
Sunday and finals are scheduled for 3 p.m. Admission is free.

AWOL MARINOVICH SUSPENDED BY WINNIPEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Marinovich was suspended by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers Monday for going 
AWOL Saturday to get a second opinion from his own doctor on the season-ending 
knee injury he suffered the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I'm supposed to do," Cal Murphy, coach/general manager of 
the Canadian Football League team, told the Winnipeg Free Press."We have called 
his agent, but he hasn't even called back. It must be a holiday down there." 
</P>
<P>
 The former USC and Raider quarterback, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament 
in his left knee on the first day of training camp, had been scheduled to 
undergo an arthroscopic examination to determine the full extent of the injury 
Monday in Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Fertig, Marinovich's grandmother, said he was scheduled to undergo a 
magnetic resonance imaging examination Monday in Southern California. The 
machine, however, was broken, and the MRI was rescheduled for today. Marinovich 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Marinovich's action could cause the Blue Bombers to terminate his two-year 
contract. If he is released, it's believed the Blue Bombers might try to 
acquire rookie Kevin McDougal, who signed recently with the Rams.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: CALVARY CHAPEL WASTED NO TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel High of Santa Ana started competing in sports five years ago, 
shortly after opening, and has built one of the top athletic programs in the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel and Riverside Poly each won three team sectional titles in this 
academic year, the most among schools in the City and Southern sections. Both 
are parochial schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Poly is a well-established school with 2,000 students, Calvary Chapel 
is new and has only 550 students. It does not field teams in every sport and 
has limited athletic facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its handicaps, administrators have carefully built successful programs 
by hiring top-quality coaches and limiting growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried not to field too many teams right away so that they wouldn't all be 
talent-poor," said Kris Van Hook, the school's football coach and athletic 
director. "Slowly, we've built up, and we plan to add girls' tennis next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles won section titles in boys' and girls' volleyball and wrestling 
this year, and the baseball team finished as runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrestling team has been the most productive. Coach John Azevedo is a 
former college assistant at Notre Dame and Wisconsin and quickly built the 
school into a power. Calvary Chapel is the two-time defending State champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Many teams at the school practice off-campus because of a lack of facilities. 
The football team, for example, works out at a nearby elementary school, and 
the wrestling team trains at a sports center in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We estimate that about 70% of our students participate in at least one 
sport," said Van Hook, a former football assistant at Cerritos College. "We 
never envisioned this kind of success so soon, but I think it's great." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parochial schools fared well in championship competition this year, further 
adding to the debate that they should compete separately from public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Mater Dei won titles in boys' basketball and soccer and finished as 
runner-up in football and girls' basketball. Pasadena Poly won championships in 
girls' tennis and soccer and finished second in boys' basketball and tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Peninsula had the most successful year among public schools. It 
won a title in girls' tennis and finished second in boys' cross-country and 
girls' cross-country, basketball and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Toyota has signed on as title sponsor of the California 
Interscholastic Federation, effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the contract are being worked out, but it is believed that the deal 
is worth between $1 million and $2 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIF has been without a title sponsor since last July, when Reebok did not 
renew its contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota is the second corporate sponsor to sign on with the CIF in the past 
year, joining the Vons grocery store chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing and Financial Management Enterprises of Woodland Hills has been 
representing the CIF in marketing negotiations for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried to remain patient and build a model program that can be used for 
years to come," said Chet Swenson, president of M&FM. "Toyota is a big boost 
and a company we targeted from the very beginning." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dean Crowley's fate as Southern Section commissioner will be decided at an 
Executive Committee meeting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley, 60, has been the section's acting commissioner since last October, 
when Stan Thomas was forced to resign for allegedly misusing his expense 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a 25% reduction in staff, Crowley has turned things around, and the 
state's largest section probably will come in under budget for the first time 
in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our options is certainly to make Dean's position as commissioner 
permanent," said Gary Smidderks, Executive Committee president. "My feeling is 
that his performance has been favorable with the committee, and I don't expect 
any problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Starr will remain as football coach at Woodland Hills Taft next season 
despite recent allegations that he recruited players. Starr denies recruiting, 
but the City Section Rules Committee recently placed the program on one year's 
probation. Principal Ron Berz met with Starr last week to discuss his fate, and 
Berz decided to keep his coach. "A mistake was made and we addressed the 
issue," Berz said. . . . Jeff Sink, girls' basketball coach at Fairbanks 
Lathrop High in Alaska the past 14 years, has been named the new coach at 
Brea-Olinda. Sink replaces John Hattrup, who resigned this month after only one 
year on the job. Sink, 43, was 172-73 at Lathrop. At Brea-Olinda, he takes over 
one of the country's premier programs. The Ladycats have won four consecutive 
State titles. . . . The 27th L.A. Watts Summer Games begin Saturday and 
continue through June 26. More than 12,000 athletes will compete in 14 events.

BLADES' COACH A REAL SON OF A GUN; ROLLER HOCKEY: BOBBY HULL JR., WHO TOOK THE 
HELM OF THE LOS ANGELES TEAM THIS YEAR, KNOWS ALL ABOUT FAMOUS RELATIVES. 
</P>

<P>
 Blake Hull is destined to lead the good life, which is to say he is guaranteed 
the chance to live his own life. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake's father, Bobby Hull, Jr., knows all about namesakes. So he chose his 
son's carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother Blake was always the lucky one," Hull says. "He always had this 
charmed quality. He seemed to be able to get through any tight situation 
looking like a million bucks." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby didn't seem appropriate. It hasn't been easy going through life with 
that name. And we considered Brett, but we didn't want to hang another famous 
name on him. That's my joke. I've gone from being Bobby Hull's son to Brett 
Hull's brother." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the story of a man and a woman, whom you don't know, who have fathers 
that you do know, and their team, which is 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
 For quite some time now, Jeanie Buss has been Jerry Buss' daughter. Which 
might be why when she needed a coach for the L.A. Blades, the Roller Hockey 
International team she runs, it appealed to her to have someone who was 
somebody's kid at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Bobby Hull, Jr. will be coaching the Blades again tonight when they face 
Oakland at 7:30 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the four-on-four, inline skates hockey league is a little brother to the 
NHL, why not run with the Tori Spelling-factor? 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Hull and Buss, an RHI All-Surname team would have a Chelios (L.A.'s 
Steve, brother of the NHL's Chris), a Vachon (Blade goalie Nick, son of Rogie), 
a McSorley (Buffalo owner and GM Chris, brother of Marty) and two Granatos 
(Chicago's Rob and Cammi, siblings to the NHL's Tony). 
</P>
<P>
 In the team's first year, Buss made the mistake of thinking she could win in a 
roller hockey league without real hockey players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our coach last year was the best roller hockey coach in the world," Buss 
says. "But he was uncomfortable with ex-NHL guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Buss needed real hockey players and a real hockey coach to lead them. So, 
Brett Kurtz, a Blade forward with extensive ice hockey experience, rounded up 
the talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Buss had to find a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Kings-Toronto Maple Leafs game, Buss met Nick Newton, the graphic 
designer responsible for the original Mighty Ducks logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Buss also needed a logo -- almost as badly as she needed a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Newton said, I'll throw together some ideas. And I play in a rec league 
with this guy who would be perfect . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "My mouth dropped," Buss says. "I didn't know that there was a Bobby Hull, 
Jr." 
</P>
<P>
 The junior Hull knew hockey, partly from years of playing in college and the 
minor leagues but mostly through genetics. And his name would (a) command the 
attention and respect of his players and (b) sell tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 And Buss understood something fundamental about Hull. 
</P>
<P>
 "We relate on that level as children of famous fathers," she says. "In some 
ways, we're trying to establish our own identities. We always have that kind of 
shadow hanging over us." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hull, the Blades are a chance to be around hockey. So what if the hockey 
world thinks you're just His Kid? 
</P>
<P>
 "After 20 years of it, I'm used to it. And it's fun to talk about it. I'm 
proud of my dad and brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Might as well live in the world you're happiest in.

NEWSWIRE: CAPRIATI WILL UNDERGO COUNSELING PROGRAM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tennis star Jennifer Capriati has agreed to enter a drug-counseling program to 
settle a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge, a Miami prosecutor said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorandum for deferred prosecution has been filed to admit Capriati, 18, to 
a program run by The Advocate, a nonprofit agency used by Dade County courts to 
dispose of minor criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she successfully completes it, the state attorney's office has the 
authority to administratively drop the case," Dade County court spokesman Mort 
Lucoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquaintances claimed Capriati used crack and heroin during a weekend of 
partying at a Coral Gables motel in May. She left a substance abuse clinic 
Friday after a 23-day stay. 
</P>

 Andre Agassi and Todd Martin were the main beneficiaries Monday when the 
seedings were announced for Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, champion two years ago, was seeded No. 12 -- five places above his 
world ranking. He has dropped in the rankings due to a long layoff at the start 
of the year following wrist surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who beat Pete Sampras Sunday in the final of the Queen's Club 
tournament, was rewarded with the No. 6 seeding, three spots above his world 
ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, defending champions Sampras and Steffi Graf got the No. 1 
seedings for the tournament, which starts next Monday.

 In an interview with the British tabloid Today, Gunther Parche, the man who 
stabbed Monica Seles in Hamburg, Germany, on April 20, 1993, said, "I will not 
say sorry because I shouldn't talk about my feelings. The only thing I will say 
is that I would never do this again." . . . Former world No. 1 Tracy Austin -- 
returning to the scene of her devastating 1983 back injury -- was ousted in the 
first round of a women's tournament in Eastbourne, England. Austin, attempting 
a comeback at 31, was eliminated, 6-3, 6-4, by No. 73-ranked Kristine Radford 
of Australia. Miscellany

 The Clippers' Dominique Wilkins, who becomes a free agent on July 1, is 
considering a $21-million, three-year contract offer to play for a Greek 
basketball team, his agent said. Clipper spokesman Joe Safety called it a 
negotiating ploy, adding that the club still hopes to sign Wilkins, who 
rejected an $8-million, two-year offer.

<P>
 Amid speculation that the Philadelphia 76ers will name John Lucas their coach 
and general manager, a news conference was scheduled for today. Team owner 
Harold Katz met with Lucas on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas resigned as coach of the San Antonio Spurs last week. 
</P>

 Boxing officials said they will need medical proof that a faith healer cured 
Evander Holyfield's heart problem before allowing him back in the ring. The 
former heavyweight champion hinted at a return to boxing over the weekend after 
claiming faith healer Benny Hinn miraculously cured him during a Christian 
revival in Philadelphia last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield, speaking through a spokesman from his Fairburn, Ga., home, said 
rumors of an imminent comeback have been blown out of proportion, but he is 
considering it. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeaten welterweight David Kamau (20-4-0) of Los Angeles won a 12-round 
majority decision over Raul Hernandez (19-19-1) of Bell in the featured fight

CHRISSIE HYNDE: ALL WORK AND ALL PLAY; POP MUSIC REVIEW: DRIVEN BY HER MUSIC, 
THE LONGTIME ROCK STAR SENDS THE MESSAGE THAT DOING THE BUSINESS OF PLAYING IN 
A BAND IS ITS OWN GREATEST REWARD. THE RESULT IS A DYNAMIC CONTRAST BETWEEN 
TAUT AND DREAMY MATERIAL AT THE HOUSE OF BLUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chrissie Hynde has been creating distinctive music for the Pretenders for 15 
years, but the most endearing thing about her performance at the House of Blues 
on Sunday was her attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything about the show conveyed an unspoken but unmistakable belief in 
rock's potential to be a transforming force and a necessity of life. Her focus 
and ferocity insisted that just doing the business of playing in a band is its 
own greatest reward. 
</P>
<P>
 Under those terms the inconsistency of Hynde's career seems less a matter of 
miscalculation or the tragic accidents that hit the Pretenders early on than a 
product of very different priorities -- ones you rarely encounter in a rock 
world full of ambitious clawing for position. 
</P>
<P>
 Like her vision of rock's essential role, Hynde's music reflects her 
upbringing in the Midwest in the '60s and '70s, a setting where she embraced 
everything from the Motown and Merseybeat of pop radio to the heartland 
grunt-rock of a Grand Funk Railroad to the underground forces that expanded the 
music's expressive horizons. 
</P>
<P>
 So while she's a sucker for a frat-house, beer-bust riff, she's too much the 
craftswoman to leave it just a dumb riff. She shakes things up with rhythmic 
invention (the return of original drummer Martin Chambers made this jumpy, 
driving side of the band especially potent Sunday) and the melodic flair of a 
pop classicist. 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Blues show -- part of a U.S. tour of club dates that also 
scheduled a Roxy concert on Monday -- was propelled by the dynamic contrast 
between the taut, tough, metallic tunes and the expansive, dreamy, pop-leaning 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 Hynde, 42, was in great voice, her melismatic croon sounding radiant on the 
flowing pop songs, her tart accusations full of fire and bravado. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Without laboring to sell the band's new album, Hynde and her new lineup 
integrated four of its songs into a set that compiled music from nearly all 
Pretenders periods. The ease with which the new tunes -- especially the sultry 
"Hollywood Perfume" -- fit in reflected both Hynde's renewed inspiration and 
her new music's absence of major advances. 
</P>
<P>
 Hynde seemed to be having a great time, charged by the close quarters and 
intimate interplay with the audience. Playfully coming on as the tough chick, 
she was part Shangri-La and part Supreme, a bit of Patti Smith and a female 
Ramone. 
</P>
<P>
 She struck her stances with a timeless rock grandeur made effective by her 
total involvement and lack of self-consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest edition of the Pretenders -- Hynde, Chambers, guitarist Adam 
Seymour and bassist Andy Hobson (with a supplemental keyboardist, Zeb Jameson) 
-- still seems to be coming together, playing solidly enough to create plenty 
of sparks but not quite finding the interplay or force to make it transcendent.

ART REVIEW; KEN PRICE AND ED MOSES: INDIVIDUALISTS IN TANDEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Beat Generation revival is afoot so it's entirely apt that two grizzled 
veterans of that era should be showing their art together. Ed Moses and Ken 
Price share history going back to the late '50s at the legendary Ferus Gallery. 
They also stand out as individualists among nonconformists. 
</P>
<P>
 Price was nurtured in the womb of a revolutionary class taught at Otis Art 
Institute by ceramic sculptor Peter Voulkos. It grafted the spontaneity of 
Abstract Expressionism to that of Japanese raku ware. As a result, the craft of 
potting was promoted to the status of sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a gifted draftsman and potentially brilliant painter, Price has 
remained an obdurate clay artist. Saying what kind is a tougher nut. He has 
made everything from hostile eggs to turtle cups and ironic curios in the 
accents of Mexican American Southwestern vernacular art. Just when you think 
you might get by calling him a Pop Primitivist or a Folk Aristocrat he comes up 
with a new oxymoron that deconstructs definition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The present gaggle of about 10 works, showing at the L.A. Louver Gallery, are 
abstractions with strong hints of expressive content. Some are lumpy and 
organic-like fossilized root balls. The colors of pieces like "True Blue" catch 
light in extraordinary ways. They radiate a nebulous glow. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, faceted works are sophisticated and slightly flashy as if 
thinking of Art Deco Cubism. Predominantly a suave matte black with flashes of 
green and red, the largest appears fairly narrow in depth until you peek around 
the back to encounter a tapering rectangle that puts you in mind of the bump on 
the rear of those television sets designed to look slender when they are as 
clunky as the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 One motif common to both sets seems significant. Works are notched in such 
fashion as to suggest a ledge high atop a cliff. Small black rectangles or 
silhouettes of cubes on the abutted vertical will do for entrances to very 
domesticated caves. Portals are so black as to appear painted on the surface. 
They are, in reality, holes. Ah, shallows that are deep. Open portals that 
appear closed. It's all very Zen and mordantly witty. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses has spent a long career on a quest through the labyrinth of classical 
modernist abstraction. He ran it through the sensibility unique to himself and 
L.A. art, its craziness, love of craft and urge to hybridize. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year he made an astonishing summary in a group of works that melded the 
primitivism of Lascaux with that of the graffiti writers. They achieved the 
impossible dream of combining figurative imagery and abstraction, absolute 
spontaneity and complete technical control. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of feat that puts a fellow in the awkward position of being his 
own toughest competition. Never capable of settling into a trademark manner, 
Moses has dealt with this dilemma through understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Frontals and Reversals," new works echo the dribbles and earth tones 
of the previous bunch but look like blown-up sections turned backward. Staining 
soaks through, covered with clear acrylic that sometimes gives images the 
problematical appearance of large prints under glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures are now suggested within abstract shapes. "Revere Ome Number 1" has 
intense physical richness and a hint of hanging female torsos. By contrast "Ome 
Bu Number 1" is a sheet of thinly stained plywood evoking landscape. "Revere 
Dug Number 4" has rich rivers of acrylic blobs that suggest a microscopic inner 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Every painting points provocatively in another direction, to a new idea. They 
play hob with the conventional show-biz notion that the next movie has to be a 
bigger hit than the last one. For an artist like Ed Moses, it's the quest that 
counts.

THE WEEK AHEAD: BERLIN; FAREWELL TO ALLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 2,000 American, British and French soldiers will march down Berlin's 
monument-studded Strasse Des Siebzehnten Juni this Saturday as the city of 
Berlin bids its final, official farewell to the Western Allies who have 
occupied it since 1945. The last American soldiers are scheduled to leave 
Germany on Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was the Soviet Red Army that virtually single-handedly overwhelmed 
Berlin and broke the Nazi power base there 49 years ago, no Russian troops will 
participate in Saturday's parade through the city. German authorities instead 
have scheduled a separate Russian farewell parade in the Berlin suburb of 
Koepenick. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Russians say they would prefer to march down Berlin's most historic 
boulevard with their World War II Allies, authorities say it was routine to 
hold separate Eastern and Western ceremonies during the time the Berlin Wall 
marked the division of East and West Germany.

WORLD VIEW; RICH-POOR GAP WIDENS AROUND THE GLOBE; ABOUT 20% OF THE EARTH'S 
PEOPLE NOW CONTROL NEARLY 85% OF ITS WEALTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 20th Century, an era of unparalleled economic progress and improved living 
conditions, may ultimately be judged instead by a starkly different trend: the 
staggering gap between rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest numbers reveal painful divisions. At the close of the century, the 
richest 1 billion people -- or 20% of world population -- control almost 85% of 
global wealth, while the poorest 1 billion command less than 2%, according to 
the new Human Development Report, a survey by the U.N. Development Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity means the top layer of society earns 60 times the income of the 
bottom, a gap that has doubled -- from 30 to 1 -- in just three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: In the mid-1990s the meek show no signs of inheriting the 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere are the dimensions of the gap and its impact more egregious than here 
on the Arabian Peninsula. Despite modest oil discoveries in the 1980s, Yemen is 
growing poorer compared to its oil-rich neighbor Saudi Arabia. The paltry per 
capita income in the Arab world's poorest country plummeted 14% between 1989 
and 1992, to $1,374. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before a civil war erupted in Yemen last month, poverty permeated Sana, 
the capital and legendary city reputedly founded by Noah's son Shem. A downtown 
section has been transformed by hovels made of plastic cartons and large tin 
cans held together by baked mud. "Night City," where cinder-block homes were 
illegally erected overnight, has sprouted on the capital's hilly outskirts. And 
across from the Yemeni president's home, squatters have pulled together a vast 
camp from bits of old tin, plastic sheeting, wood and stones. 
</P>
<P>
 The ominous gap between rich and poor is evident around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The underlying factor in all this world disorder is the sheer power of 
uncontrolled great wealth in the hands of a few nations, coexisting with the 
absolute poverty everywhere. The laws of the jungle operate," former Tanzanian 
President Julius K. Nyerere has written of the post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rich developed countries continue to get richer and more developed while 
the poor stay poor -- not always only relatively. In the last decade the 
peoples of Latin America and of Africa, as well as in many parts of Asia, have 
seen their desperately low standard of living decline even further. The income 
and technology gap between North and South gets geometrically wider all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.N. figures, poverty is the most acute problem of the developing 
world. More than a third of the people in these countries live below the 
poverty line. Worldwide, more than 1 billion people are surviving on the 
equivalent of $1 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Disparities between the prosperous and poor are visible in myriad ways: 
</P>
<P>
 * In California, sixth-graders work on computers in air-conditioned classrooms 
while kids in Mozambique use sticks and bark to learn to write in open-air 
classes. One of four South African children does not go to school at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * A designer handbag in Paris costs $1,500, more than the annual per capita 
income in more than 40 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Media conglomerates merge in New York to open an information superhighway 
while 40% of the population in Russia, so recently a superpower, plummets below 
the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rival British and American shipping companies vie to build the world's 
largest and most luxurious cruise liners while hundreds of thousands of 
homeless live atop massive garbage dumps in Mexico City and Manila. 
</P>
<P>
 The poverty gap will affect both rich and or poor on every continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Some regions now face being so powerless, so marginalized by poverty, that 
they will fall off the world's political and economic map for generations. 
Other areas can expect an explosive backlash in a world where the 
communications revolution makes comparative living conditions highly visible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poverty is the greatest threat to political stability, social cohesion and 
the environmental health of the planet," warns the new U.N. report. "These 
disparities . . . deserve the urgent attention of policy-makers." 
</P>
<P>
 The gap may even threaten the patterns of change. Shortly before his election 
as U.N. secretary general in 1992, Boutros Boutros-Ghali said bluntly in an 
article in the Mediterranean Quarterly: "Democracy cannot take root unless 
certain minimal institutions and an adequate living standard exist." 
</P>
<P>
 In the post-Cold War world, where equality and empowerment are catchwords, the 
poverty gap is also a symbol of division. It is rapidly becoming a barometer of 
global trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new Iron Curtain between North and South . . . will be reinforced as a 
result of the gap between the standards of living in the rich and poor 
countries," Boutros-Ghali predicted. The result will be a "process of 
marginalization" that "practically leaves no place for the Third World or 
Africa, except where humanitarian aid is concerned," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospects for progress are not uniformly bleak. Between 1960 and 1992 "all 
countries have made substantial progress in human development," the UNDP report 
notes. Over the past half a century, world income increased sevenfold (in terms 
of real gross domestic product) and income per person more than tripled. The 
human development index -- calculated on the basis of income, life expectancy, 
literacy and education -- doubled in developed countries and increased by 80% 
even in the poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this gain has been spread very unequally -- nationally and 
internationally -- and the inequality is spreading," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Europe and Japan, for example, living conditions made 
unprecedented strides in 25 years. Average life expectancy increased from 51 to 
63 years. Average per capita consumption of goods and services increased by 
70%. And enrollment in primary education neared 90%, according to the World 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet worldwide, all but the richest 20% saw their share of world income drop 
between 1960 and 1991. And poverty drags down the quality of life. In the 
squatter camps of Sana, the Yemeni capital, many toilets are no more than holes 
in the ground, and water must be bought from trucks. Few kids are in schools, 
and thousands of men with paintbrushes, shovels or squat daily on street 
corners hoping to be hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 40% of Yemen's labor force is unemployed, and more than one in five 
Yemenis lives in absolute poverty. Yemen's crisis is all the more conspicuous 
in context. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the border in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, construction costs for the new 
airport, the world's most modern, ran more than half of Yemen's annual gross 
domestic product. The Saudi airport boasts an indoor oasis, 3,000 square feet 
of stained-glass windows, walls of marble quarried in Italy and etched with 
Koranic verses in England, and a bronze-domed mosque for 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But facilities like this tell only part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, Saudis live 17 years longer than Yemenis, and only one-fifth as 
many Saudi children die before age 5, according to the UNDP report. The average 
Saudi has three years more education resulting in 23% higher literacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrodollars may have skewed the gap, but Saudi Arabia -- which ranks 67th on 
the UNDP's human development index -- is far from the top rank. And at 142nd of 
173 countries surveyed, Yemen is not the worst. However, the impact on the two 
Arab neighbors is symptomatic of the poverty gap and its dangerous effects.

<P>
 "Yemen has its own peculiar problems, but a lot of what is happening here is 
like what is happening in the world," said Amat Alim Sowswa, Yemen's deputy 
minister of information and its highest-ranking female official. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it gets worse, we're going to witness a kind of revolution of the poor in 
all forms of unrest that is eventually bound to spill over into rich areas 
too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower end of the global gap is represented by the abysmal poverty in 
Africa, where many countries are worse off in the 1990s than they were at 
independence in the 1960s. In 1965, Ghanaians were better off than South 
Koreans or Thais. The UNDP index now ranks South Korea 32nd, Thailand 54th -- 
and Ghana 134th. 
</P>
<P>
 World Bank data suggests that even the most productive African countries -- 
Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe -- are unlikely to reduce poverty for at 
least another generation. At optimistic growth rates, others could take decades 
to return to income levels of the 1970s -- and another half a century to turn 
the tide. With twice the U.S. population, Africa's total wealth is just 
slightly above Belgium's. 
</P>
<P>
 The gap is not limited to income. In health services, industrial countries 
average one doctor per 400 people, while developing countries average one per 
7,000 -- and some African states have only one per 36,000, the UNDP reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Wealth is most heavily concentrated in Latin America. The inequities are the 
greatest in Brazil, Guatemala and Honduras. In Brazil, the top 20% earn 32 
times more than the poorest 20% -- up from 26 to 1 in just two years, the UNDP 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The divide in Brazil is largely geographic, between the wealthy, 
industrialized south and the poor, largely agricultural north. The regional 
disparity includes 17 years in life expectancy and 33 percentage points in 
literacy and 40% in per capita income. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the biggest challenge for post-apartheid South Africa is the 
internal gap. It ranked 93rd on the UNDP index. But as a separate country, 
white South Africa would rank 24th, above Spain, while black South Africa would 
rank 123rd. "Not just two different peoples, these are almost two different 
worlds," the UNDP concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal gap is not limited to poor countries. In the industrialized 
world, wage differentials in manufacturing also widened during the 1980s in 12 
of 17 member countries surveyed by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Some reasons for the growing divisions are systemic, others political: 
</P>
<P>
 * The collapse of socialism and its safety net of benefits, along with the 
introduction of competitive free markets, have led to soaring increases in both 
poverty and wealth in Asia, Africa and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions have declined most sharply in the former Soviet Bloc. They are now 
more critical than in the West during the 1930s Depression or Latin American in 
the "lost decade" of the 1980s, according to a new UNICEF report. 
</P>
<P>
 In nine former East Bloc countries -- Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Romania, 
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Albania -- plummeting gross 
domestic product levels have left 20% to 70% of the populations living on or 
below the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some cases in the Second World are now worse than in the Third World," said 
Eric Thurman, president of Opportunity International, a Chicago-based human 
development group. 
</P>
<P>
 Internally, China's economic reforms have led to record growth -- and a record 
gap between vibrant urban centers in Beijing and Shanghai and distant 
backwaters like Qinghai and Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vietnam, economic liberalization has fostered both the rise of a new class 
of business people and brokers and an estimated 15% unemployment. More than 
700,000 workers in state-owned companies have been let go, while about 100,000 
demobilized soldiers are jobless, contributing to a new class of street people. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lengthy wars -- fought by forces oblivious to cost and allowed to drag on by 
an uninterested post-Cold War world -- are setting back Third World countries 
to pre-colonial conditions. Paid for by its diamonds and oil, Angola's 
two-decade-old civil war has turned developed areas into shattered landscapes. 
Without outside aid, up to half a million people would soon starve there, 
relief groups say. 
</P>
<P>
 The demise of the Cold War also cost many countries virtually the only 
leverage they had in winning funds or attention from either East or West. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aid still goes largely to former strategic allies rather than to poor 
countries. "Aid is still based on the shadows of the past. The world has not 
adjusted its sights to post-Cold War realities," said Mahbub ul Haq, chief 
architect of the U.N. human development index. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, the United States gave 16 times the amount per capita for El 
Salvador over Bangladesh, which has a population 22 times larger and five times 
poorer than El Salvador. But is El Salvador such a strategic place today?" 
</P>
<P>
 Based on current patterns, foreign aid is unlikely to help close the gap. 
Often it perpetuates inequities. 
</P>
<P>
 Better-off recipient countries get more than $240 per person, for example, 
while the worst-off states often get less than $1 per person a year, reports 
the Overseas Development Council. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inefficiency, corruption, bad debts, protectionism and skewed priorities 
also deserve much of the blame. "At a time the entire world is reducing 
military expenditures an average of 3.6% a year, the two poorest regions of the 
world -- sub-Sahara Africa and South Asia -- are increasing spending on arms," 
Haq said. 
</P>
<P>
 India and Pakistan have for several years spent nearly twice as much on arms 
as Saudi Arabia, which is 20 times richer, he added. In contrast, Costa Rica 
abolished its army in 1948 and invested a third of its resources in health, 
education and housing. It's now the most prosperous Central American country, 
with one of the highest human development ratings in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike East Asia's major investments in basic education and health, most 
African countries decreased social expenditures in the 1980s -- up to 64% in 
Gambia, 70% in Nigeria and 82% in Sierra Leone, the World Bank reported. 
</P>
<P>
 * Several countries with adequate resources to narrow the gap are choosing not 
to address poverty. "Brazil is rich enough to deal with poverty problems and so 
is the United States. We're not for the same reason Brazil isn't: We don't want 
to," said John W. Sewell, president of the Overseas Development Council in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the gap, human progress is likely to continue to make significant 
strides. "Social indicators -- average literacy, life expectancy, mortality and 
others -- are improving. On average, those are much better than they were in 
the developing world 40 years ago," Sewell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's like the man with his head in the oven and his foot in the icebox. 
The average temperature doesn't tell the story." 
</P>

<P>
 What I had forgotten, in being gone from Africa for so long, is that nothing 
in Africa is impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 The man at the airport tells you the plane is full, but that doesn't mean you 
can't get a seat. The man at the border says it is impossible to cross into 
Rwanda, but he doesn't mean it's totally impossible. Sometimes it takes words, 
sometimes money. But with patience and the right touch, you can accomplish 
almost anything in this unstructured, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants world. 
</P>
<P>
 So here I was, on foot, on the bridge over the Kagera River that separates 
Tanzania and Rwanda, the swirling waters below filled with bodies from a 
massacre of unimaginable proportions, and six slovenly Tanzanian soldiers were 
waving their rifles at me. They were sprawled in positions of semi-slumber 
against the hulk of a cannibalized car, and they did not move at all. Only 
their rifles did. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is impossible to cross," one of them finally said. "The border is closed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pakistani photographer I was traveling with turned to leave. I took his 
arm, signaling him to have patience, and offered the soldier cigarettes. A few 
words of greetings in Swahili floated out of the past and into grasp. The man 
wearing corporal stripes stared hard at me through puffs of smoke and smiled. I 
knew I would get across the bridge to Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 I had arrived at the Benaco refugee camp up the road from the bridge the day 
before, lugging my portable computer and a plastic hotel laundry bag containing 
half a dozen candy bars, three cans of spaghetti, a roll of toilet paper and a 
pint of whiskey. My mind spun with hurried travel: an overnight flight from 
Washington to London; another from London to Nairobi, the capital of Kenya; a 
frantic scramble to get aboard a twin-engine plane that a journalist colleague 
had chartered for the 300-mile trip from Nairobi to a dirt strip in an isolated 
region of Tanzania, an hour's drive from the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The airstrip was on an utterly barren plain. There was not a building, not a 
person, not a sign of civilization in sight. The pilot waved farewell. He 
taxied down the runway and, in a cloud of dust, disappeared over the horizon. I 
can't remember ever feeling more misplaced, and it seemed certain I was doomed 
to spend the rest of my days lost in some forgotten corner of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before, I had been enjoying springtime in Washington, and now . . . 
The thought was interrupted by an echo of past lessons learned in Africa. No. 
1: Don't get rattled. Time is inconsequential, and everything eventually works 
out. Suddenly, out of nowhere, on a rutted road that had not even been visible 
to me, a man named Omar appeared in his shiny Range Rover. We shared no common 
language, but it was quickly negotiated that for $50 he would take me and my 
photographer to the refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp was an awesome sight. Blue-and-white tents supplied by the Office of 
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees stretched as far as I could see, 
through the valley, up the hillsides and down into the ravines. There were 
people everywhere, shoulder to shoulder, 300,000 of them, lined up for food, 
walking in an endless procession to a river-fed pond, waiting for medicine, 
moving with their cattle and goats -- a blur of humanity made homeless by war, 
its future of no particular concern to those fighting for control of Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Red Cross had set up a cluster of tents for its staff, and a 
nurse told me I could stake out one of them for my residence. There was no 
electricity, no telephones, no running water in this tent city that had sprung 
up on the empty plain in a matter of days. It was growing dark when I found 
Bryan Murphy of the Associated Press and asked him how to get into Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just go to the border and ask for a man named Tony," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 We set off at dawn the next morning. Omar was in a cheerful mood; we had 
agreed to reward him generously for the trip into Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 The border was 30 minutes away, marked by a large sign that said "Pepsi-Cola, 
It's Your Choice." A Tanzanian policeman in a spotless white uniform greeted us 
warmly there and said it might be a long wait; he didn't know when the 
immigration officer would return. 
</P>
<P>
 African Lesson No. 2: If you wait for things to happen you may wait forever; 
take control. We drove back to the immigration officer's village, two miles 
away, found his home and rousted him out of bed. He accompanied us back to the 
dreary little checkpoint that served as the immigration office. He said there 
might be a problem with my exit visa, but it turned out he didn't really mean a 
problem, just a minor inconvenience that could be fixed with a gratuity. 
</P>
<P>
 He sent us on foot down to the one-lane bridge, 200 yards away, and said that 
if we could talk our way past the Tanzanian soldiers and into Rwanda, Omar 
would be allowed to follow with his vehicle. When another group of journalists 
had passed this way two days earlier, one of the Tanzanian soldiers had said, 
"You know, we could shoot you right here and no one would know." He was 
taunting more than threatening. This time, with the gift of American 
cigarettes, we were allowed to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 A Tanzanian soldier with a torn uniform escorted us across the bridge, pausing 
to point out the bodies that floated in the river below. They crashed against 
the stone walls of the gorge like department store mannequins, as if they had 
never contained human life. The whirlpool currents swung them to and fro and 
banged them against the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, here comes another one," the soldier said with a small chuckle. And 
down a 100-foot-high, thundering waterfall another corpse was propelled into a 
free fall, arms flailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Two young rebels from the Rwandan Patriotic Front guarded the village on the 
Rwandan side of the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there a man named Tony here?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, he is about," one of the youths replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we talk to him?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You can if he agrees." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony ambled down from the shambles of a police station from which government 
troops had been driven a few weeks earlier. He was a lieutenant in the 
guerrilla army, a handsome, articulate man of about 30. He spoke perfect 
English with a slight British accent and was, I later learned, a 
combatant-turned-press-officer -- a sure sign that knowledge of the value of 
public relations and press agentry has reached even the most distant outposts 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 I introduced myself and said I worked for The Times. "It is good to meet you," 
he said. "I have read your book." 
</P>
<P>
 I was flabbergasted. Fourteen years earlier, I had written a book on Africa 
that had been banned by every black African country, and rather than being 
complimented, my mind raced, asking, "Oh, God, did I say something about the 
Tutsis or Hutus that's going to get me into trouble now?" It turned out I 
hadn't. Tony sent for Omar. 
</P>
<P>
 With two armed guards for security and Tony for enlightenment, we set off on a 
daylong journey through rebel-held territory, passing abandoned villages, 
visiting a hospital where massacre victims with terrible wounds lay, stopping 
at a beautiful little Roman Catholic church in a grove of spruce. Five hundred 
bodies were clustered in the church and throughout the still grounds outside. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, back at the refugee camp in Benaco, on a starlit plain as 
beautiful as those the African-born writer Elspeth Huxley adored, a plain far 
removed in distance and spirit from the familiar trappings of home, I plugged 
my computer into the Associated Press' generator, sat in my tent, the computer 
cradled in my lap, and wrote a story for The Times. Children who had never seen 
a white man, much less one of the strange devices I held, pressed against the 
barbed-wire fence and called out to me in a friendly Swahili greeting: 
"Mazungu, mazungu!" White man, white man. 
</P>
<P>
 There was not a Tanzanian telephone for 50 miles around in any direction. But 
later, just after midnight, I pointed the AP's portable satellite phone toward 
a satellite over Sao Paulo, Brazil. I dictated my story to a woman at the 
newspaper who identified herself as "transcription," then dialed my wife, 
Sandy, in Virginia and over a crystal-clear connection told her all that I saw 
and heard outside my tent. It seemed odd that our two different worlds should 
be connected by this invisible link through the distant skies. 
</P>
<P>
 I told her, among other things, of the dozens of international and African 
relief specialists I had met in camp. The United Nations, the Red Cross, 
Concern, CARE -- they were all there, and I came to hold them and the work they 
do in great admiration. I was only passing through, but endless tragedies like 
this were their life's work. Somalia, the Sudan, Turkey, Ethiopia and now 
Tanzania -- each passport stamp testified to some great disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 My journey to Benaco and Rwanda lasted four days. I slept on the ground for 
the first time since Vietnam, tried hard to remain constipated and was 
surprised at how easily I adapted to not shaving, bathing or eating meals. 
Yesterday I gave a colleague my leftover candy bars and drove to the airstrip 
in the back of a refugee's pickup truck. It took me 12 hours to hitchhike a 
ride back to Nairobi, Kenya, first on a single-engine plane of unknown origin 
to Mwanza, on the Tanzanian shore of Lake Victoria, then on a Red Cross charter 
piloted by Ken Maurce, who said, "It's a bloody shame what people do to each 
other, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Norfolk Hotel in Nairobi found me lodging despite my unsavory appearance 
and odor, and a doctor today examined the scores of dime-sized red welts that 
have itched their way up my back and down my legs. "Maybe insect bites, maybe a 
reaction to Africa," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 I am now freshly clothed and well fed and of respectable countenance. I am 
again part of Africa's privileged class, something the long-suffering refugees 
in Benaco can never be. On the radio I have just heard that there is a 
potential pollution threat on the Ugandan side of Lake Victoria: The corpses I 
saw from the bridge over the Kagera have completed their journey and are now 
washing ashore alongside the huge lake. But a Kenyan official says that the 
decomposed bodies will not threaten Kenya's supply of drinking water or fish.

THE WEEK AHEAD: CARTAGENA; EMBARGOES ON AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When leaders of Latin America, Spain and Portugal meet today in Cartagena, 
Colombia, hot topics are expected to include economic embargoes on Cuba and 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the fourth summit of Ibero-American heads of state. At last 
year's meeting, in Brazil, 21 leaders signed a resolution criticizing the U.S. 
embargo against Cuba's Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, foreign ministers of the Organization of American States called for 
tightening the international embargo against Haiti's military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day summit this week also is likely to serve as a warm-up session for 
a hemispheric summit conference scheduled by the Clinton Administration for 
December in Miami.

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; LEFTISTS DEEPLY SPLIT IN SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA; AFTER YEARS 
OF WAR, IT'S PEACE THAT THREATENS THE MOVEMENTS' SURVIVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the marathon hours of last month's Sandinista party convention, Daniel 
Ortega and Sergio Ramirez sat in the seats of honor that their long tenure as 
president and vice president of Nicaragua had earned them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two veteran Sandinistas barely spoke to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the convention ended, Ortega loyalists had unceremoniously dumped 
Ramirez, who heads a faction of moderates, from the party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 An angry Ramirez stormed out of the convention hall, and his followers are 
considering leaving the party altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 In El Salvador, where 12 years of civil war finally came to an end and the 
leftist guerrillas formed a political party, the disintegration came even more 
swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 On their first day in office last month, a group of rebels-turned-lawmakers 
broke with their leaders and sided with the ruling right-wing bloc in a vote on 
National Assembly officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The disobedient legislators have been suspended from their party posts, and 
they may eventually be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1980s, the U.S. government spent billions of dollars through 
proxy armies to try to destroy the two largest leftist movements in Central 
America: the Soviet-armed Sandinista National Liberation Front of Nicaragua, 
and El Salvador's Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Americans failed to accomplish in war, however, now seems to be 
occurring in peace. The unity forged fighting a common enemy has dissolved, and 
the left in Central America has entered a profound crisis, one that threatens 
its survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "All political forces in the region are in crisis, especially those that 
defined themselves in the Cold War," said Hector Dada, a political analyst who 
heads a liberal think tank in San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The left) has the huge problem of having to pass from the use of weapons to 
conquer total power, to the use of elections, which does not give total power. 
How does the left define itself now? What does it mean to be a leftist? These 
are the difficulties that are being expressed." 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews in Managua and San Salvador, several leftist leaders argued that 
the internal frictions are part of a natural evolution as the parties find 
their way in the new world order. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the often bitter and unusually public disputes have crippled the FMLN 
and the Sandinista Front as effective opposition forces and sowed doubts about 
their political futures. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the fronts disagree on what their post-Cold War role should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Factions within each favor moving more quickly toward the political center to 
modernize their organizations into forces that can win elections and run 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Larger, opposing factions want to fight free-market economics and retain close 
ties to the traditional rank-and-file. 
</P>
<P>
 The more centrist factions accuse their opponents of remaining mired in their 
authoritarian past, and the opponents in turn accuse the centrists of betraying 
their parties' revolutionary ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, in the (Sandinista Front) as well as in the FMLN, we are living a new 
period of ideological and political struggle, caused by our setbacks, failings 
and errors, and also by the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union," Schafik Handal, secretary general of the FMLN and head of the 
Salvadoran Communist Party, told the Sandinista convention delegates in a 
keynote address. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all in the same crisis of searching and debate." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Sandinista Front and the FMLN formed in the 1970s as a union of a 
variety of forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sandinista Front combined three basic tendencies, each with a different 
view on how to conduct revolution, but they eventually achieved a seemingly 
monolithic unity after ousting the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sandinistas ruled Nicaragua, while fighting U.S.-backed Contra rebels, 
throughout the 1980s, until finally losing elections in 1990 to conservatives 
led by President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
 At the behest of Cuban leader Fidel Castro, meanwhile, five leftist 
military-political organizations in El Salvador joined forces to become the 
FMLN and wage war on a series of U.S.-backed governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Sandinista Front, the five factions of the FMLN maintained their 
distinct identities during the war. They ran separate clandestine radio 
stations and controlled separate pieces of territory. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many observers now see a split within the FMLN as inevitable, 
though few of them are ready to predict an immediate, formal division. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall of communism and the Soviet Empire -- traditional backers of the FMLN 
and Sandinista Front -- suddenly forced both groups to re-examine the backbone 
of their movements. 
</P>
<P>
 The disarray of the left has different consequences in each country. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nicaragua, a divided Sandinista Front could clear the way for a far-right 
candidate to win presidential elections in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 A fragmented FMLN means that there will be few checks and balances in El 
Salvador on right-wing President Armando Calderon Sol. 
</P>
<P>
 The simmering discord within the Sandinista Front, which first became obvious 
after the Sandinistas' 1990 electoral loss, bubbled over in the weeks leading 
up to the party's second-ever convention last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Vice President Ramirez and his supporters held press conferences that 
the radio stations -- controlled by ex-President Ortega and his supporters -- 
refused to cover. The two factions traded insults: Ramirez and the moderates 
were accused of being pro-Yankee sellouts; Ortega and the hard-liners were 
labeled intransigent Stalinists. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Ortega's faction won out -- and won big. He was reelected as 
secretary general of the party, a post he has held for 15 years, and his allies 
received enough votes to dominate the 15-member National Directorate, or 
executive council. 
</P>
<P>
 With his victory, Ortega is a likely candidate for president in 1996, even 
though opinion polls have shown Ramirez to be the Sandinista who most appeals 
to the general public. If the party splits, however, the chance for victory in 
the elections seems even more remote. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics saw the results of the convention as a step to the hard left that 
allows little space for reformers. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention delegates, for example, voted to stick with the party anthem, 
which refers to Americans -- el yanqui -- as the "enemies of humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are (members of the party) who still think it's July 19, 1979," Ramirez 
said, referring to the date Sandinistas marched triumphantly into Managua after 
the insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega insisted that he is open to new ideas but pointed out that his election 
was the product of a "democratic process" that should be respected. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissident Sandinistas say they want to create a form of Sandinismo that is 
more democratic and flexible and that can attract the thousands of supporters 
who have abandoned the party out of disgust with corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Sandinista militants became disenchanted in 1990 after the party and 
Ortega lost the election and their leaders proceeded to make off with 
businesses, homes and properties that had been confiscated by the Sandinista 
government. The episode became known as La Pinata. ) 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to show the dissatisfied that there is another Sandinismo," longtime 
party activist and political scientist Silvio Prado said. "We have to have a 
new relationship within the Front that is not submission and direction but 
cooperation. . . . If not, the party will get weaker and weaker by the day, 
until it disappears." 
</P>
<P>
 In El Salvador, conflicts among the FMLN leaders were legendary, and they have 
become increasingly public since the U.N.-brokered peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
 Joaquin Villalobos, the guerrillas' most successful military strategist, leads 
one faction, while Handal and the largest group within the FMLN, the Popular 
Liberation Forces, generally fall on the other side.  
</P>
<P>
 Participating in democratic elections for the first time last March, the FMLN 
won a handful of municipal posts and 21 seats in the legislative National 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on May 1, the day that the new legislators were sworn in, that the most 
recent conflict exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-wing politicians who dominate the National Assembly had made changes 
in rules governing the officers of the assembly, enhancing the right's power. 
</P>
<P>
 Handal said the FMLN agreed to protest by refusing to vote for National 
Assembly officers during inauguration of the congress. But, to the surprise of 
many, seven FMLN legislators broke ranks and voted for the new officers, 
including several from the right. 
</P>
<P>
 FMLN legislators Ana Guadalupe Martinez and Eduardo Sancho, who were among 
those who chose to vote, were also voted in as officers. 
</P>
<P>
 A furious Handal immediately announced that the seven dissident legislators, 
plus accused ringleader Villalobos, no longer represented the FMLN and had been 
suspended from their party leadership positions. They could face expulsion 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let it be clear," the bearded Handal intoned, "they do not represent us." 
</P>
<P>
 In a flurry of television appearances, the chastised legislators responded 
that they were voting their convictions, and in a pluralistic political 
organization they should be allowed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to ask the question, which is more important: mechanical unity, or a 
new identity that makes you electable?" Villalobos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In El Salvador, all the powers are transforming. The right is changing, the 
army is changing, relations with the United States are changing. . . . If the 
left does not change, all of the other powers will consolidate, and the left 
will be left out of the picture."

MEDIA; SPAIN TRIES NEW TACK TO PROTECT FILMMAKERS; THE GOVERNMENT HAD RELIED ON 
SUBSIDIES TO BOOST ITS INDUSTRY. NOW IT'S LIMITING U.S. FARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping for a hit, Spanish director Jose Luis Garcia tried last fall to book 
the debut of his new movie into Madrid's theaters at the peak of the Christmas 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 But his distributor, United International Pictures, decided instead to release 
"Tirano Banderas" ("Banderas the Tyrant") in mid-January, at the close of the 
seasonal moviegoing gold rush. The reason: Nearly all the high-season dates had 
been reserved for what are considered better box-office bets in Spain -- 
American movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tirano Banderas," a satirical look at a Latin American dictator, drew modest 
interest in the capital when it was finally released and this spring is 
continuing an unremarkable run in the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us who work in Spanish film are used to getting the bad dates," 
lamented Garcia, who wrote the story for this year's Oscar-winning foreign 
film, "Belle Epoque," and has himself made several successful comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 Favoritism for American movies is not surprising, he said. Most Spanish film 
distributors went out of business years ago. The business is in the hands of 
Americans now. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish movie makers complain that U.S. distributors unfairly squeeze 
Hollywood's throwaways into theaters here -- and thus squeeze out the locals -- 
by selling package deals of one blockbuster U.S. film coupled with three or 
four B movies. 
</P>
<P>
 But change is coming. And the cavalry riding to the rescue of the Spanish film 
industry is -- you guessed it -- Spanish. New regulations passed by Parliament 
last month set ratios for screenings of American movies vis-a-vis Spanish or 
European films. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations, sponsored by the Culture Ministry, pit Spain's movie industry 
and its government against their American counterparts. Underlying the 
legislation are two basic questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Is Spanish cinema on the ropes because of a Hollywood bully with bigger 
muscles? 
</P>
<P>
 * Or, have Spain's directors and producers just forgotten how to entertain 
their compatriots, leaving distributors and theater owners to make their money 
by showing more popular American films? 
</P>
<P>
 It may be a bit of both. With a stable of directors like the late Luis Bunuel, 
Carlos Saura and current successes like Fernando Trueba and Pedro Almodovar, no 
one argues that all Spanish films are losers. But ironically, the Spanish 
government's attempts to boost its film industry since 1984 may have sent 
crowds packing because the Culture Ministry doled out cash primarily for 
avant-garde film projects, some of which never made it to the theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Subsidies were given without rewarding success at the box office, without 
regard to what spectators wanted," which was not avant-garde fare, acknowledged 
Pedro Perez, head of the Spanish Film Producers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 There were few options, Perez said, because audiences here are too small to 
justify making extravagant mega-productions like "Jurassic Park." The country's 
box-office record is $10 million for Almodovar's "Women on the Edge of a 
Nervous Breakdown," but a typically successful Spanish film earns only about $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the causes, the market share of American films at Spanish box offices 
rose from 43% in 1966 to 80% in 1993, while Spanish directors' share of their 
home market shrank from 20% to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall movie attendance plummeted by 78% during the same period, though 
Spanish filmmakers try to make up much of that loss with showings on TV, where 
Spanish cinema is still very popular, and residuals from increasing video sales 
and rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, as the global talks of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade sped into their final stage, Spain's film industry, echoing France's 
ultimately successful campaign to restrict American films, went on the 
offensive. The industry lobbied Spain's Socialist government for restraints. In 
December, the Spanish Cabinet issued a film decree just under the GATT 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The law required big-city movie houses to show one day of a Spanish or 
European Union-produced film for every two days they show a U.S. film, or for 
every three days in cities with populations under 125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government early this month agreed to keep the ratio 3 to 1 for all 
cities, after Spanish producers and theater owners and the U.S.-controlled 
distributors negotiated a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the new law stiffens longstanding rules for obtaining dubbing 
licenses, essential for high earnings in Spain since U.S. films are shown with 
subtitles only at a scattering of big-city theaters. Until now, distributors 
got one dubbing license for the debut of a Spanish film and up to three more, 
depending on the earnings. Distributors accumulated a backlog of tradable 
licenses that the government says eliminated any incentive to promote Spanish 
films. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules set a maximum of two licenses per Spanish film, specify an 
expiration date of two years for each license and make them non-transferable. 
The government hopes the rules will encourage the U.S. distributors to promote 
Spanish films more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, however, cried foul. U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor complained about Spain's law before Congress, and U.S. officials 
in Madrid say Washington may fight the law on the basis of multinational trade 
agreements to which Spain belongs. Direct trade reprisals against Spain would 
be a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 More likely is a compromise that is beginning to emerge from negotiations 
between officials of both governments and separate talks between the Spanish 
and U.S. film industries. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent meeting in London attended by U.S. studio heads, Spanish producers 
and Myron Karlin, chief operating officer of the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America, negotiators discussed self-regulation of the Spanish market, said 
Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique Balmaseda, director of the Culture Ministry's Institute of 
Cinematography and Audiovisual Arts, says the talks aim "to balance the 
interest of both industries. The defense of Spanish film doesn't have to 
prevent free access to the market."

NEXT STEP; BRAZIL GETS REAL . . . ABOUT ITS CURRENCY; ON JULY 1, THE 
INFLATION-BATTERED NATION WILL SWAP ALL ITS OLD MONEY FOR NEW IN A BOLD 
EXPERIMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a heavily guarded building just outside this city's grimy dock district, a 
special operation is being carried out. Eleven men pile neatly packaged bricks 
of currency on a vibrating countertop. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, the bricks, weighing about six pounds each, jostle forward along 
the surface and, reaching the edge, plunge into the glowing belly of a furnace 
waiting below. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve hours a day, the work crews coax more and more bank notes -- Brazil's 
cruzeiro real -- into the fire. Outside, a constant plume of white smoke issues 
from a single chimney, announcing their destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The pot-holed entryway leading up to the building's huge iron gate is crawling 
with armed guards. They shoulder M-16s and wear .38s on their hips. Cellular 
phones bulge from their trouser pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 They might not have bothered. It's not that this money is totally worthless. 
If a thief could get past the guards, he could bag quite a treasure -- but he'd 
have to spend it fast. For the irony is that Brazil's incendiary inflation rate 
is licking at the value of money by the hour, and the currency is almost 
worthless by the time it enters the furnace. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 1, Brazil authorities hope, this will all change. The cruzeiro real 
will be laid to rest, and from its ashes will rise the real . 
</P>
<P>
 More than a sense of deja vu plays at memories here. Since 1986, five 
currencies have burnt out. But in previous schemes, old currency was phased out 
gradually as a new one began to circulate. For the first time in this country's 
history, all the currency will be swapped on a single day. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens have been given the rest of this month to turn in their cruzeiros for 
the new reals before the changeover. Merchants also have until July 1 to 
convert their prices. Bank accounts will automatically be switched to the new 
currency, which will be pegged in value to the U.S. dollar. The Central Bank is 
well stocked; 27 billion reals (about $27 billion) have been minted. 
</P>
<P>
 With the real , Brazilians hope a modicum of sanity will finally dawn on one 
of the world's most calamitous economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Brazil logged 2,500% inflation. Last month, alone, prices rose by 
45%. Brazil's is not quite the world's worst inflation rate; 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Zaire share that dubious honor. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it may be the only nation of this infamous club that has flirted with 
hyper-inflation and somehow managed not to plunge into chaos or civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 This rise and fall and rise of so many monies has dizzied Brazilian consumers 
and punished the economy, but one factory is working at breakneck pace -- the 
Casa da Moeda, the Brazilian mint. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists have found steady employment in fashioning designs for an ever growing 
roster of notes. Each new note comes stamped with one of a veritable pantheon 
of national heroes, from barons to biologists. 
</P>
<P>
 But each has met an ignoble end, losing face as their denominations lose 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 The new real , by contrast, will feature the fauna and flora of Brazil, but 
not because the mint has run out of heroes. So quickly was the real scheme 
concocted, the Central Bank claims that it did not have the time to secure 
legal releases from illustrious families to use the images of their famous 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need permission from animals," said Antonio Carlos Meda of the 
Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, each new currency has come with newly minted promises of 
economic stability. Each time inflation has come roaring back. 
</P>
<P>
 There may not be many more chances to get it right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every economic plan that fails gives people reason not to believe in the next 
one," political scientist Walder de Goes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one wants to bet on the long-term viability of the real plan, hope 
holds that this currency will be a lasting one, maybe even the last. Many 
companies are already doing their homework to prepare for seismic changes that 
low -- or no -- inflation would bring to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 First, however, the country will have to mend its old ways. For years, 
Brazilians liked to believe that they had mastered the art of living, even 
prospering, with soaring prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The country successfully staved off the worst effects of rising prices through 
indexing, or constantly ratcheting up wages, rents, and other volatiles with 
the ever higher cost-of-living indexes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the prices of everything, from movie tickets to machine tools, sped more or 
less together along the fast lane, the reasoning went, then no one was really 
run down by inflation. Fantasy, said the economists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like telling a man to relax because his wife gets home every day at the 
same time. Four a.m.," said the acerbic Delfim Netto, who was planning minister 
15 years and eight currencies ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy is that Brazil got used to inflation. Some Brazilians even got 
comfortable with it. They were the people of means, who bedded down their 
capital in funds and bonds that climbed in value from dusk to dawn. People like 
bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 For sure, lending money in times of high inflation means risk, and the higher 
the risk the steeper the premium on the banks' capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But most Brazilians are out of this league. Their modest wages do not qualify 
them for these high-ante assets. They must make do with passbook savings that 
barely keep up with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, banks capture these "unprotected" cruzeiro reals and lend them out 
again -- mostly to the government, which is always starved for capital -- and 
pull in double or so the amount a day later. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing this money margin, what bankers call the float, has assured the 
financial sector a fortune from inflation. Brazil's six largest banks earned 
$5.8 billion simply by managing the float, said Carlos Daniel Coradi, a Sao 
Paulo auditor specializing in banks. 
</P>
<P>
 If inflation plunges, the float will all but vanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The adjustment will be painful, especially for overextended state-owned banks. 
Hundreds of branch agencies and as many as 4,000 layoffs are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Then why in the world would anyone want inflation to end? The perversity of 
inflation is that virtually everyone, from the corner baker to an automobile 
maker, became a lay banker, not for love of money but simply to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Pih explains. Pih moved to Sao Paulo from his native Taiwan as a boy, 
and inherited his father's wheat milling company, Moinho Pacifico. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pihs have done well in their adopted home. Moinho Pacifico has a lean 
260-employee shop, no debts and solid markets. Tall, impeccably dressed, with a 
wine-colored Mercedes in the garage, Pih emanates prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, while many businessmen were just trying to hang on, Moinho Pacifico 
made a killing. Not on wheat -- that was a disaster -- but on playing the 
inflationary money-go-round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost $1.6 million milling wheat," Pih said, "but closed the year $3.6 
million in the black. Speculative profits." 
</P>
<P>
 Pih took cruzeiros from wheat sales, invested the funny money in high-yielding 
accounts, made back a fortune and bought newer, better machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, inflation has been fantastic," he said. "For the country, it's a 
disaster. It's turned me into an engineer of interest rates. This is totally 
unreal. But all of us had to behave this way, in order to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Some do not. A year ago, Carlos Coradi placed a small ad in the newspaper 
announcing counseling for companies looking to buy or sell or merge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a shower of phone calls," he recalled, shaking his head. "Ninety 
percent of them were sellers. Many of them were desperate and many of them came 
just to moan about their awful situation. It was like psychotherapy." 
</P>
<P>
 But the skeptics, who are legion, say the real plan is nothing but a political 
ploy, meant to boost its creator, former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, who also happens to be running for president in the Oct. 3 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, unlike the previous economic schemes, whipped up in closed rooms and then 
released half cooked, the real plan was more carefully confected. For months, 
in fact, the details were negotiated item by item with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The injection of a stronger currency into the market will of course make 
consumers feel richer, and that will trigger a burst, maybe even a boom, of 
buying. Unchecked, that could lead quickly to more inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, however, Brazil is weathering a mini-recession which gives industry 
slack time to meet rising demand without resorting to price hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The down side is that although the real may stop the upward spiral of 
inflation, prices may remain parked at penthouse levels. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also real doubts as to whether the government has curbed its own 
appetite. It was unchecked government spending that undermined the bold plans 
of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Brasilia reportedly has the cash -- thanks to a $16-billion emergency fund -- 
to get through 1995 without ringing up the mint for more. 
</P>
<P>
 But along with the white smoke, a whiff of expectation, even optimism, laces 
the air these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Front-running candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, of the leftist Workers 
Party, has of course roundly denounced the plan as cheap electioneering. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he also has taken care to say, if he's elected and the plan is working, he 
would not tamper with it. 
</P>
<P>
 And no wonder. "Lula," who is 48, is part of a generation that has never known 
a day without inflation. It is the Brazilian workers, the class he champions, 
who punch in and watch their wages turn to ash while others make profits in 
their sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brazil has been diagnosed as a culture addicted to inflation, a 
consensus seems to have emerged that it is time to break the habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Time, you could say, for the country to get real . If not, one more currency 
will go up the chimney.

CULTURE; OFF THE RACK; FROM ROYALTY TO PRETENDERS, EVERYONE WHO'S ANYONE KNOWS 
WHERE TO GET OUTFITTED FOR ASCOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The glittering crowd in the Enclosure during Royal Ascot Week, which begins 
today, will include tastefully turned out aristocrats, millionaires, American 
tycoons and a charlatan or two. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's one thing many of the gentry will have in common: They'll have 
rented their fancy cutaways and top hats from a London firm known to everyone 
as Moss Bros -- where the abbreviation for brothers rhymes with Moss. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss Bros will tog out nearly 10,000 patrons of the thoroughbred track this 
week, the beginning of England's summer social season. Some outfits are rented 
out twice, and even three times, during the racing week. Wise customers have 
reserved their morning coats well in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss Bros not only rents the styles, it helps set them, with a keen eye on 
society's pacesetters. For instance, the establishment maintains close ties 
with Buckingham Palace to make sure it is on the royal wavelength in sartorial 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor Anthony Hopkins, awarded a knighthood by the queen, stopped by Moss 
Bros to make sure he was properly attired. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, the palace passed the word to Moss Bros that at next month's 
wedding of Lady Sarah, Princess Margaret's daughter, black morning gear would 
be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Black was also the designated cutaway color at the wedding of the Prince and 
Princess of Wales, but Diana's father, Lord Spencer, insisted that he would 
wear gray -- and did. 
</P>
<P>
 "The customer is always right," murmured a Moss Bros executive of Spencer's 
outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus Moss Bros is suitably represented at Royal Ascot, weddings, a royal 
garden party, a ball, or a white tie-and-tails dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our head fitter, Roy Weston, can make anyone look good," said corporate 
consultant Colin Woodhead, pointing to the fitting rooms where customers waited 
patiently, first-come, first-served, for Weston's talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can size you up coming in the door. There's no one he can't fit. Moss Bros 
would never let anyone leave the premises unless his kit could pass royal 
inspection." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many in the royal Establishment rent or buy their own formal wear 
from Moss Bros, and many wealthy patrons who could easily afford to purchase 
morning suits prefer to hire, officials say, noting that the price of a new 
three-piece morning suit runs from $750 to $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 American customers can line up their outfits in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Ward runs a travel agency in Atlanta that takes a party of 10 to 15 people 
on a weeklong house party for Royal Ascot every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We order by fax," Ward said. "They can make hired suits look custom-made. 
They have never let us down." 
</P>
<P>
 The classic morning wear, with a black herringbone cutaway coat with dove gray 
waistcoat and striped trousers, runs about $60 for 24 hours -- with shirts, 
ties and shoes additional. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it maintains a more traditional line of clothing, Moss Bros claims to 
be the largest renters of formal wear in the world. But it got into the "hire" 
line almost by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was founded in 1851 by Moses Moss, who opened a men's clothing 
shop in Covent Garden, Central London's vegetable, fruit and flower market, and 
also the home of the Royal Opera House. His policy: "Giving good value and 
selling good stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 By the turn of the century, the business had grown, moved to larger quarters 
down the street (it now has branches in dozens of British cities) and was taken 
over by the founder's two sons, George and Alfred Moss, where it acquired its 
distinctive Moss Bros name. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers introduced the first ready-to-wear, or "off-the-peg," suits for 
the rising middle class -- at a time when all men's attire was custom-made. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Edwardian era, at the beginning of this century, Moss Bros became the 
place to buy all manner of special attire for royal, diplomatic, military and 
formal occasions, and its fame spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "People knew that if they had been invited to a special event in Britain, they 
would always be properly advised and attired if they had been to Moss Bros," 
Woodhead said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1897, Alfred Moss had a friend of good social standing who had lost his 
fortune as well as his white tie and tails. 
</P>
<P>
 To maintain his social standing, he needed a dinner outfit, and Moss lent him 
one from the store. After a time, the friend borrowed the dinner outfit so 
often that Moss asked him to pay something toward its care -- and they settled 
on a modest sum and so created the first formal-wear hire service. 
</P>
<P>
 When the friend regained his fortune, enough to own a whole wardrobe, he still 
chose to "hire" from Moss Bros since he knew that his tails would be cleaned, 
pressed and immaculate. 
</P>
<P>
 Morning dress, which is compulsory in the Royal Enclosure at Ascot, with the 
tail coat, waistcoat (vest) and striped trousers, was what most British gents 
wore every day 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They would change into white tie and tails for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lounge or business suit became popular for daytime wear, and the white 
tie was fossilized with the advent of the black-tie dinner jacket -- 
popularized by Americans belonging to a country club at Tuxedo Park, N.Y., 
hence the name. 
</P>
<P>
 As day dress became more informal, the tail coat and top hat remained the 
correct dress for special occasions. And Moss Bros stood ready to supply. 
</P>
<P>
 One commentator at the coronation of King George VI in 1937 said there was so 
much Moss Bros stock worn by those taking part, from dukes to coachmen, that it 
could not have taken place without the company's products. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss Bros clientele have included such celebrities as cowboy actor Tom Mix, 
composer Sir Edward Elgar, playwright Noel Coward, impresario Mike Todd, 
designer Valentino and British Cabinet members. 
</P>
<P>
 In World War II, Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery and U.S. Gen. George S. 
Patton were customers for custom-made uniforms. And a back room at Moss Bros 
was secretly used to create authentic French clothing for spies parachuted into 
occupied France. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Moss Bros is more focused on weddings than war. Modern brides are 
demanding that the participants in their rites hire from the experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the reason for the increasing use of formal wear at weddings," 
Woodhead said, "is the videocorder. People like to film weddings and they want 
action. Since they are filming, they are the stars -- and want to be dressed 
like stars, once in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The comeback of formal wear is reflected in the Moss Bros Group, which 
includes Cecil Gee and Savoy Tailors Guild stores. Group sales last year were 
up 11% over 1992, profit climbed, and the outlook remains promising. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our rental department has contributed much to our overall success," 
Woodhead said. "It has given us a can-do corporate culture like the Americans. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 As an afterthought, he added: "Funny. After a wedding, the item most often 
found in the returned garment is a marriage certificate."

MARKET SCENE; STOCKS AS A CONTACT SPORT; BOMBAY'S BUSY MARKET IS NICKNAMED 'THE 
RING.' BUT THE BOISTEROUS TRADE WILL SOON GIVE WAY TO THE COMPUTER AGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The warning bell has sounded jarringly, signaling just 15 minutes left in the 
trading day, and a swarm of traders have Darnesh, one of the Bombay Stock 
Exchange's brightest whiz kids, pinned against a pillar. 
</P>
<P>
 They roughly grab the shrimpish 25-year-old's earlobes or the flesh of his 
cheeks or neck to get his undivided attention, then shout questions at him to 
try to close a final deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can give five quotes in a single second," said an admiring BSE official, 
eyeing the crush around the young black-haired Gujarati. "Three hundred and 
seventy-five companies he can give quotes for!" 
</P>
<P>
 If capitalism is a jungle, as somebody said, then it doesn't get any wilder -- 
or noisier -- than on the floor of the Bombay Stock Exchange. Suitably named, 
as in other contact sports, the floor is called "The Ring." 
</P>
<P>
 For two hours each business day, from noon to 2 p.m., amid stagnant air, 
raucous noise and the grayish light let in by a dome that looks like an 
inverted version of New York's Guggenheim Museum, any number of 4,200 brokers' 
agents converge to shout their readiness to buy and sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of India's great fortunes have been made in the Brueghelian tumult of 
what is proudly said to be Asia's oldest stock exchange, where 3,500 companies 
are now listed. Some scams have been just as lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speculation is central to a stock exchange. People come here to trade in 
risk," said the exchange's executive director, Arvind N. Kolhatkar. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no fights though, broker Kanti V. Dand wants it made clear.  
</P>
<P>
 As in a demonic dance, some of the traders -- most of whom are young Gujarati 
men, natives of an Indian state famed for its business acumen -- circulate, 
while others keep assigned spots on the floor. Dealers in the "A" group -- 88 
blue-chip Indian companies whose trading volumes are high -- have special 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 In blue jackets, assigned the role of incorruptible guardian angels, members 
of the Quotation Service hover, ready to jot down a buy or sell order as a 
guarantee that the terms of a deal will be respected by both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 A few old men hobble by on canes, enjoying the hubbub and the vicarious 
thrill. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have worked here and don't know anything else," Suresh More, a young 
officer in the Quotation Service, explained. "They come here because they feel 
they are in their own house." 
</P>
<P>
 They won't feel that way for long, it seems. Like the mechanical adding 
machine, the rotary dial telephone and other outdated relics of the business 
world, the days of BSE trading as a contact sport are numbered, if Kolhatkar 
and the rest of the leadership are able to implement their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 By October, the exchange housed in a futuristic building on Bombay's Dalal 
Street plans to introduce electronic-screen-based trading, which means the firm 
Darnesh works for will be able to trade with other brokerages via computer 
terminal and will not need to meet their representatives in the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we go screen-based, this physical process will be eliminated," Kolhatkar 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the powerful old guard in Bombay financial circles resisted change 
at the BSE for years, but India's economic reforms, tougher government 
regulations, the threat of competition and an upsurge in business fueled by a 
wave of foreign investment have left them little choice but to evolve. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the time-honored way of doing things on Dalal Street has 
left brokerages gagging on paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 At Parag Parikh Financial Advisory Services Ltd., the eponymous chairman 
surveyed a desk piled high with the seven-inch squares that constitute shares 
of Tata Iron & Steel Co. (TISCO) stock and the long forms that accompany each 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 All that paper represents stock purchases worth about $66,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the United States, I don't think that stockbrokers ever see a share of 
stock," Parikh said. "Here, high volume gives me no advantage. It just means 
more paper to process." 
</P>
<P>
 Until that system is modernized, each share transfer form must be signed by 
seller and purchaser; the seller's signature must be authenticated, and tax 
stamps worth five rupees, or about 15 cents, must be affixed to the form for 
every 1,000 rupees, or $30 worth, of stock traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Since TISCO shares are issued in denominations of 50, a purchase of 1,000 
shares generates 20 stock certificates and share transfer forms, each of which 
must be dated, filled out, signed and stamped. The process can take months. 
</P>
<P>
 The hassle of dealing with such chores has limited the capacity of banks and 
brokerages to accept investor money. 
</P>
<P>
 When the chairman fell ill at the Bank of Hong Kong here, his office was taken 
over by clerks so they could stick stamps on transfer forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Screen-based dealing and a central depository for paperwork should greatly 
streamline the trading process, Kolhatkar, the Bombay Stock Exchange executive, 
predicted during an interview in his 25th floor office overlooking the 
still-growing business district of Bombay. His plan is to connect stock 
brokerages throughout the city via microwave transmitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Screen-based trading, which began in 1971 in the United States, is already the 
rule at two-thirds of the world's markets, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to the fact India was so much an insular country, trading practices never 
improved here," Kolhatkar said. "But there's one good thing about Indians. They 
resist change as long as they can -- but when they have to adapt, they change 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Competition is one reason. Two years ago, when the Indian government was 
stunned by a securities scam involving BSE investments that led to losses 
estimated at more than $420 million, a plan was floated for a new exchange free 
of Bombay's notorious wheeler-dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Stock Exchange is supposed to open at another Bombay locale -- 
with state-of-the-art screen trading, speedy settlements and completely open 
transactions -- in phases, beginning with trading in wholesale debt this month. 
Some members say next year is more likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would consider it as solving the problems of the Bombay Stock Exchange, and 
also competing with them so the customer gets the best services," said Parikh, 
a charter member. "It'll be survival of the fittest." 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing a change in the wind, even Bombay's old guard brokers, who have run 
the BSE for decades on terms profitable for themselves, are signing up to join 
the new market. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last year, about $1.5 billion in foreign investment, much of it 
American, has poured into the BSE, which has a total market capitalization in 
the neighborhood of $140 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Indian law allows only registered foreign financial 
institutions to invest. 
</P>
<P>
 In December alone, the infusion of foreign cash topped $400 million. By April, 
however, the inflow had dried up to $4 million in a typical week, in large 
part, analysts here said, because the rise in U.S. interest rates gave outside 
investors other attractive options. In large part because of the drop in 
overseas demand, the BSE index is off about 14% since the year's start. 
</P>
<P>
 Another body blow for brokers came when the watchdog Securities and Exchange 
Board of India, effective March 12, banned a practice called "forward trading." 
That meant buying on the margin using money loaned at interest rates higher 
than those charged by banks. The practice allowed speculators to roll over 
stock purchases for months. 
</P>
<P>
 After watchdog agency's ukase, trading collapsed by 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Kolhatkar's sunny predictions about the advent this autumn of 
screen-based trading, some brokers doubt the ability of the BSE to swiftly 
introduce a central depository system to centralize paperwork, which they say 
is essential for Western-style stock market transactions. The old men may feel 
at home in "The Ring" for a little while longer. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, predictions are widespread that trading will pick up again in 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long term, Kolhatkar, a former civil servant, is bullish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still just scratching the surface," he said. "There are only 25 million 
shareholders in India. Our population today is around 900 million. There is 
room for expansion."

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; TIBET; CHINESE ARE REWEAVING THE REGION'S SOCIAL FABRIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELISABETH GRINSPOON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sonam is a tall, handsome, 34-year-old taxi driver who worships both Buddha 
and Rambo, oblivious to any contradictions that might imply.  
</P>
<P>
 Jigme is a 44-year-old carpenter, rebuilding a famous Buddhist monastery that 
was destroyed during China's 10-year Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that 
sent rampaging Red Guards into the four corners of Tibet. He says that Tibet is 
better off today than it was 40 years ago, but adds that there are too many Han 
Chinese migrants here, threatening to reverse the gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Ngawang is an aristocratic Tibetan physician, daughter of a high-ranking 
rinpoche -- or reincarnated Buddhist teacher -- who hides her fluency in 
Chinese and worries about Tibet's lack of "environmental consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 Yu, 28, is a successful Chinese businessman and haughty colonist from the 
"Middle Kingdom." As we dance one evening in the fancy Sunlight Nightclub he 
whispers: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tibetans are very stupid. This place is a primitive society that still 
needs to be developed. We have to train the Tibetans." 
</P>
<P>
 These were some of the characters I encountered on a recent four-week journey 
through Tibet with an American photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 Since anti-Chinese riots broke out in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, in 1987, 
foreign journalists have been severely restricted in their travels to Tibet. As 
a prospective graduate student in forestry at Yale University, I'm not 
precisely a journalist. And my fluency in Chinese allowed me to leap many of 
the hurdles set up by the Chinese government. The result was a rare, 
unobstructed view into a land that for many years has been the focus of a 
propaganda battleground between the Chinese government and the followers of the 
exiled Tibetan religious leader, the Dalai Lama. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographer and I flew from Beijing to Tibet, which is often called "The 
Roof of the World" because it lies on a plateau that averages more than 13,000 
feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Chinese government, Tibet is a primitive land being led 
benevolently into the 20th Century under the astute leadership of Beijing. For 
the Dalai Lama and his many overseas celebrity supporters, Tibet is a land 
raped and sacked by Hans, China's ethnic majority, who invaded the country from 
the east in 1950 and forced the Dalai Lama to flee in 1959.  
</P>
<P>
 We found Tibet neither as oppressive as some human rights organizations claim, 
nor as progressive as the Chinese government asserts. Many Tibetans claimed 
that religious rights have blossomed in recent years. Still others feel that 
they are being submerged by a flood of Chinese immigration. Most of the 
Tibetans claimed that the standard of living is better now than it was before 
the Chinese invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tibet is much better off now than it was before the Chinese came," said 
Jigme, the carpenter working on the restoration of the Tashilhunpo Monastery in 
Xigaze. "Then, there was not one (concrete) multistory building, now there are 
many. Then we did not have enough food to eat or clothing to keep warm; now 
that problem is basically solved." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he pointed to the downside: "When the Chinese first came it was good, our 
lives improved, but now there are more and more Chinese coming, and it is bad." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Chinese government statistics, 95% of Tibet's 2.3 million people 
are ethnic Tibetans, but this figure is suspect. It probably does not include 
the substantial Chinese military presence or Chinese living here without 
residence permits. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lhasa, Chinese appear to outnumber Tibetans. The London-based Tibet 
Information Network quotes unofficial sources as saying only one-third of the 
civilians in the city are ethnic Tibetans. 
</P>
<P>
 The influx of Chinese migrants is clearly transforming both the appearance of 
Lhasa and its social fabric. Traditional Tibetan-style buildings are being 
destroyed. Only a small section of the old city remains standing, the area 
around the Jokhang Temple, Tibet's most important religious site. While many of 
these old buildings are scheduled for demolition in 1995, hundreds of craftsmen 
and laborers are working on restoration of the Jokhang itself. And the temple 
is packed with Buddhist pilgrims every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Lhasa's distinctive architecture is disappearing, and it looks 
more and more like any other Chinese city. The view of the awesome Potala, the 
former winter residence of the Dalai Lama and one of Tibet's most important 
landmarks, is marred by a new pin-striped water tower, while the street below 
the Potala is lined with rows of Chinese shops, restaurants, and karaoke bars. 
The Potala's interior has been cheapened with tacky chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
 In one Lhasa restaurant frequented by Tibetan yuppies who drive motorcycles 
and four-wheel-drive vehicles, a life-size poster of Michael Jackson towers 
over a small portrait of the Dalai Lama. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Tibetan men who work for the Department of Foreign Economics and Trade 
wear black leather jackets and shiny gold jewelry, a sharp departure from the 
plain clothes of the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in fluent Mandarin on cellular phones, they make deals with China's 
provinces on quotas for coveted imported goods earmarked for Tibet's drive to 
modernize. The special quotas are granted under a Chinese government program 
that gives preferential treatment to minority and backward areas. Instead of 
benefiting Tibet, however, they result in profits for the young Tibetan 
hustlers. 
</P>
<P>
 These Tibetans, the first generation educated under the Communist Chinese 
system, spend their evenings and cash in places like the Sunlight Nightclub. 
Here, both Tibetan and Chinese thirtysomethings share the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at one of the club's many tables, each decorated with a plastic rose 
illuminated by a spotlight, Yu Wenhua, a Chinese businessman who owns an 
electronics company in Lhasa, took me for a spin on the dance floor, explaining 
that the nightclub is similar to those in his native Jiangsu province, so it 
makes him a little less homesick.  
</P>
<P>
 Tibet, said Yu, a tall, thin man in a suit and tie, has more and more of the 
comforts of home, but it has a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came here eight years ago there was absolutely nothing," he 
said. "There were no multistory buildings, only mud houses. There were no paved 
roads, only dirt and cobblestone." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest changes, he said, have been in the last two years, since China's 
paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, made his now-famous trip to the south that 
launched the country on a development binge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the pace of change is growing more and more rapid, but this place is 
still like a primitive society. Tibet will never achieve the level of 
development of Jiangsu, because the people here are too stupid," Yu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other Han Chinese, dreams of wealth brought Yu to Tibet, which the 
Chinese call Xizang -- "Western treasure house." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 8 years old, I was hungry," he said, pointing to his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was not enough to eat," he continued, taking a huge wad of bills out of 
his wallet to pay for a round of drinks. Yu's secret to his success in Tibet, 
he explained,is a Chinese saying: "The mighty dragons are no match for the 
native serpent," which means, he explained, "that when you first come to a new 
place you have to establish good relations with the locals." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a cost to Chinese ambitions here. For instance, the migrants and 
their quest for wealth are taking a toll on Tibet's environment, which was 
pristine before the Chinese invasion. The soil is not suitable for supporting a 
large population. Intense cultivation and chemical fertilizers are increasing 
crop yields to feed the growing Han population, but these techniques are also 
causing desertification. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmland in Tsang, Tibet's western province, is sandy, and afternoon dust 
storms are so bad that most townspeople do not dare to go out. These daily 
storms presage a probable dust bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is not the winds, it is the sound of explosives. Tibetan religious 
doctrine considers mining sacrilegious, but even in remote parts of the country 
one cannot escape the sound of blasting as workers build roads and mine Tibet's 
vast mineral wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 More blasting is required to tunnel through Mt. Kumba La for a $40-million 
pump-storage hydroelectric station being built to meet Lhasa's growing energy 
needs. The blue-green waters of one of Tibet's largest lakes, Lake Yamdrok, 
home to a mythical dragon and teeming with aquatic life, will be pumped up Mt. 
Kumba La at off-peak energy demand periods, and then will be released at peak 
periods down a vertical drop of 8,400 feet to run turbines that are expected to 
generate 90 megawatts of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Women in brightly colored, traditional Tibetan-style dresses with infants 
strapped to their backs work in the fields by the lake, as women in the area 
have probably done for generations. But I learned from three young boys that 
life along Lake Yamdrok has already started to change. The boys told me in 
perfect Mandarin that they wanted to be, respectively, a banker, driver and a 
policeman when they grew up. They like to play TV video games when they are not 
doing homework, and they want to live in Lhasa. 
</P>
<P>
 Ngawang, the doctor of traditional Tibetan medicine whom I met as she was 
making a pilgrimage to Samye, opposes the Lake Yamdrok project, but she 
believes that her efforts to protect Tibet's environment will fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Tibetans have not developed an environmental consciousness, and those 
who do have an understanding of environmental problems have no power," she 
said. "The cadres make all of the decisions, and the cadres are all Han 
Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a Western-style mountaineering jacket and a Tibetan hat, Ngawang 
expressed her strong concern about the Chinese educational system. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Mandarin is poor, because Tibetan parents do not want their children to 
learn Chinese and the Chinese ways, so they do not send them to school," said 
Ngawang. "But we need Mandarin to survive, so it puts us in a difficult 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, more than the extensive military presence, the educational system is 
China's most powerful tool, next to television, in submerging the Tibetan 
culture and diluting Tibetan nationalism. Tibetan schoolchildren see Chinese as 
the language of modernity; they see Tibetan as the language of backwardness. 
</P>
<P>
 An 8-year-old Tibetan girl I met in a restaurant, clean and well dressed with 
a charming smile, asked me in perfect Mandarin to sing a song in English. Then 
I asked her to sing. She sang a couple of patriotic Communist Chinese songs 
including, "I love Beijing's Tian An Men Square, the sun rises over Tian An 
Men, the great leader Chairman Mao Tse-tung guides us forward." 
</P>
<P>
 When I asked her to sing a Tibetan song, she refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonam, our talkative driver, in contrast to Ngawang, supports the 
Chinese-style development of Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, his work unit, which is part of the transportation department, took 
him on a tour of Beijing, Guangdong and Shanghai. Sonam was impressed with the 
modernization of these regions, especially Shanghai's Nanpu Bridge.

 He is a tall, well-built man just starting to get a pot belly. He said that he 
got fat when he quit smoking a few years ago after a bout with pneumonia. The 
windshield and dashboard of his army green jeep are covered with stickers: 
"No-smoking" in English, "Harley-Davidson" and "Rambo." 
</P>
<P>
 When we were in Tibet he was taking a leave of absence and using his work 
unit's jeep as a taxi to take people the 1 1/2-hour ride from Xigaze to 
Gyangze. He jumped at the chance to make a bigger profit to take us in the 
other direction on the old road to Lhasa, via Lake Yamdrok. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonam's two sons, ages 9 and 12, are bilingual. They are enrolled in school, 
and Sonam hopes that they will go on to university. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonam is grateful that they have the opportunity to receive an education that 
he never had. Born in 1960, he did not learn about Tibetan Buddhism when he was 
a child, because any display of religious belief was forbidden during the 
Cultural Revolution. When Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978 and restrictions on 
religious practice were loosened, Sonam became curious about Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I was afraid of Buddha," he said. "But later I learned that praying 
is for the peace and the good of all beings, and I was no longer afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Norbu is a 52-year-old craftsman who is overseeing the restoration of murals 
on the walls of Gyangze's Palkhor Chode Monastery. At the age of 9, he began 
his training in painting tankas , religious scrolls. He said he was forbidden 
to practice his craft from 1959 until 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are few craftsmen left to keep up the complex Tibetan art of 
painting mandalas, which are symbols of transformation through enlightenment, 
and tankas , which are religious scroll paintings, Norbu is confident that his 
disciples, along with the generation of disciples that are now being trained, 
will fill the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 "For more than a generation there were no artists trained," he said, "but now 
we are training some who are starting young enough, and they will keep the 
traditions alive." 
</P>
<P>
 There is another side to the story. The government is paying Norbu to restore 
a monastery that the state is fixing up as a major tourist attraction for 
Gyangze, where a luxury hotel has just been built. Norbu said that when all of 
the work on the monastery is finished later this year, the craftspeople will 
return the monastery to the country and cadres will come for a big celebration. 
But many of the more remote monasteries and nunneries, such as Tidrom Nunnery, 
that will never be on the route of a package tour have received no restoration 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 After four weeks' traveling in Tibet, the most vivid impressions are of a land 
with startling contrasts: traditional Buddhist seminarians exist alongside hip, 
cellular-phone yuppies; restoration of sacred temples is accompanied by 
environmental destruction on a massive scale; the goal of universal education 
runs parallel to cultural alienation; gold-plated tourist temples smack of 
prosperity while off the tourist track, sites such as the Tidrom Nunnery starve 
for attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in individual families, the divided path brought by Chinese colonization 
is evident. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobsang was a little boy encountered at Ganden Monastery. 
</P>
<P>
 A talkative 12-year-old, Lobsang said his sister attended a Chinese school and 
did very well, allowing her to advance to higher study at the university, 
something impossible to imagine in the pre-Chinese days, especially for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his sister's success, Lobsang said with a smile on his face, "my 
mother is happy every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Lobsang himself did not do well in Chinese school but chose a path that also 
pleased his mother. He is in the Ganden Monastery studying to be a monk. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he exclaimed again, "my mother is happy every day."

BOYER FINDS A GAME SOUTH OF THE BORDER; BASKETBALL: FORMER UC IRVINE CENTER IS 
A STAR OF MEXICAN LEAGUE TEAM IN TIJUANA. HE HOPES IT MIGHT LEAD TO STEADY WORK 
IN CBA, NBA OR EUROPE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The run-down 3,000-seat Municipal Auditorium on the south side of town 
normally is used for boxing or volleyball. But on this night, for the second 
time in 17 years, professional basketball is being played here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tijuana Dragones-Pioneros of Delicias contest was scheduled to start at 
7:45, but the youth game that preceded it ran long, so the referee didn't toss 
up the ball until nearly 8:15. 
</P>
<P>
 The late-arriving, laid-back crowd is distracted by a Dragones' mascot, who 
dances to Madonna songs during timeouts and plays with children during the 
game. Adults are occupied by dozens of Tecate beer salesmen, who seemingly are 
never more than 10 feet from their prospective customers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the court, the undermanned visitors from Delicias, dressed in tan cotton 
shorts with pockets and red nylon practice jerseys, are being blown out by the 
Dragones, who are wearing fashionable mesh uniforms with a Dragon emblem on 
their chests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dragones are being led by 6-foot-3 sharp-shooting guard Steve Wise, who 
played his college basketball for the Colorado Buffaloes. They are anchored by 
6-10 center DeForrest (Dee) Boyer, the tallest and easily the heaviest player 
on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer, who played high school ball some 60 miles up the road in Oceanside, 
isn't much of a factor on offense. Occasionally, he doesn't bother making the 
trip across half court. When he does, Boyer often acts as a screener or a 
passer for Wise, who scored 54 points in the Dragones' 146-113 victory. But on 
the defensive end, Boyer is a factor -- plugging the lane, blocking shots and 
grabbing most of his team's rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months removed from his final college basketball game at UC Irvine and not 
yet removed from his studies, Boyer is making the transition to professional 
basketball. It's not the NBA or even the CBA. It's the CBP or Conference of 
Basketball Professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boyer is not complaining. He's being paid a guaranteed salary of $30,000 
for the 68-game, five-month season, which includes 12 exhibitions. He also gets 
free rent at an apartment in Tijuana and he can make bonus money, depending on 
the team's regular-season and playoff finish. The team also travels to all of 
its games by plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to pay your dues, and I see this as paying my dues," Boyer said. "I 
was out of shape. I needed something to keep me in the sport. This popped up so 
easily, I had to go with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something else comes up, I'll probably take it if the pay is better. But I 
don't know if the CBA is paying as well. From what I heard, it's $500 a week 
there, compared to $1,000 here." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer learned about the CBP a month ago through Dragones' forward Darin 
Aguilar, who played at Southern California College and has known Boyer since 
high high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darin asked me what I was doing as far as basketball. I said, 'Well, nothin,' 
" Boyer said. "He said, 'This team I'm playing on down here needs a center. 
They want you to come down.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-day tryout, Boyer was offered a contract by Dragones' General 
Manager Marco Ortiz. Before he signed, Ray Johnson, Boyer's agent and former 
high school coach at El Camino, did some checking on the CBP. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pay surprised me a lot," Johnson said. "It made me question the validity 
of it. But the contract was standard and it seemed OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer said his mother had many more reservations than Johnson about her son 
playing basketball in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, my mom was (upset) at me for coming down here," he said. "She was 
like, 'Is that what you want? You have high goals.' I told her that this is 
going to start me off. I have talent, but I don't think I can go into the NBA 
right now. I still want to work on my game a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the CBP's 16 franchises can have four U.S. players, two of whom must 
be Mexican-American. The Dragones' U.S. players are Boyer, Wise, Aguilar and 
Ray Rodriguez. Tijuana had a team in the other Mexican professional league, 
CIEMBA, but it folded 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Boyer and Wise are being counted on as saviors for the new franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans are 100% responsible for the success and failure of the league," 
Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Dragones appear to be successful. They have averaged about 2,000 
fans for their first three games and, thanks mostly to the play of Boyer and 
Wise, they are 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer was averaging 20 points, 16 rebounds and 6 1/2 blocks after three games, 
but then he is not exactly going against Patrick Ewing. On this night, Boyer 
was matched up against Timo Brise, a 6-7 muscular player from Virginia Union 
with limited skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best player on every other team is American, so you're going one-on-one 
every night against basically Americans," Boyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriquez, who is playing for his third CBP team in five years, says the level 
of play is comparable to Division I college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of players who come here from Europe," said Rodriguez, who 
played college ball at New Mexico Highlands, an NAIA school. "They played 
Division I and some of the Mexican-Americans played Division I. The style of 
play is pretty rough." 
</P>
<P>
 But this night, Boyer was one of the few players who contested jump shots and 
the play underneath the basket was anything but rough. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, UCI Irvine Coach Rod Baker believes Boyer can gain from his experience 
in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking if he goes down there and has a good season and gets himself in 
shape, and someone from Europe sees him, he could be playing year round," Baker 
said. "Everybody in Europe needs size, and this just dropped out of the sky for 
him. For an unproven commodity like Dee . . . a lot of guys don't even get this 
far." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who says he has secured Boyer a tryout with the New Jersey Nets in 
the fall, also thinks the CBP could be beneficial to Boyer's career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an outstanding opportunity," Johnson said. "But if he doesn't get 
himself in shape, he could get himself hurt. It could be the beginning of a 
career, and also the end of a career if he doesn't take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he's nearly 300 pounds, Boyer said he is slowly working himself into 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came in, I was real bad," he said. "My wind's good, I had twisted my 
ankle (in the fourth quarter of first game) so I just didn't want to go real 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer played about 43 of 48 minutes last Thursday before leaving to scattered 
applause with two minutes remaining in the game and his team ahead, 137-109. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I thought I was going to get hurt out there, I'd have taken myself out," 
he said. "I know if I was paying someone this much money, I'd want them to play 
the whole game and contribute a whole lot." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to learning about professional basketball, Boyer is also 
attempting to learn another language and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shock at first," he said. "The language barrier is great. You can 
understand some words, but other times, I'm looking to Ray (Rodriguez), asking 
him to translate. My roommate (Aguilar) and I are going to make flash cards for 
each other so we can learn Spanish. As a kid, I always wanted to learn Spanish. 
I was too lazy to take a Spanish class." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer is still taking a class at UCI. Between games, he commutes from Tijuana 
to Irvine. After this quarter, Boyer will be 20 units short of earning a degree 
in criminal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's as big of an accomplishment as Dee being a professional basketball 
player," Baker said. "Dee and I had a deal that he got his degree. Coming in 
here from a junior college, it looked like that would be hard for him to do. 
But I'm as proud of him as I could be." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said Boyer already has surpassed most people's expectations for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "People doubted where his heart was, academically and on the court," Johnson 
said. "He's proved a lot of people wrong already. He wants to take that up 
another level." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Baker: "I think he wants to better himself, prove something to his 
mother, and I think he has the need to be something other than just big." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the group of young fans who greeted him after the game with 
applause and swarmed him asking for autographs, Boyer already is something to 
the children of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 While walking out of the arena to catch his ride, someone told Boyer that he 
could become a star in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't bother me any," Boyer smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Baker: "Who knows? Dee could make a career for himself down there. Worse 
things could happen to a guy."

A PUBLICITY GIANT SPINS FOR ITSELF; MOVIES: PMK'S PARTNERS SAY DEFECTIONS ARE 
PART OF THE BUSINESS AND POINT TO RECENT ADDITIONS TO ITS HIGH-PROFILE ROSTER, 
BUT INDUSTRY WATCHERS ARE WONDERING IF THE FIRM IS LOSING ITS LUSTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It appears that some of Hollywood's most formidable hand-holders are in need 
of a little comfort themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 PMK, the publicity firm that nurtures and cultivates magazine covers for many 
of Hollywood's top-drawer talents, has had some high-powered defections in 
recent days -- actors Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfeiffer reportedly split over a disagreement on how much she was expected to 
promote her Columbia film, "Wolf," which opens Friday; she is currently without 
publicity representation. Sarandon reportedly was unhappy with what she thought 
was an underwhelming amount of publicity, and apparently wanted to make a 
change before the release of her high-profile July film, "The Client"; she has 
defected to the equally high-powered Nancy Seltzer, who also represents 
Sarandon's pal (and former PMK client herself) Julia Roberts. And Robbins, 
Sarandon's longtime companion, bailed late Friday for several reasons, 
including how PMK handled Sarandon's exit as well as his own publicity, inside 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest PMK exits have prompted some agents, studio executives and 
competitors to wonder aloud whether a bit of polish has finally rubbed off the 
glitzy reputation of Hollywood's public-relations heavyweight, headed by 
partners Pat Kingsley, Lois Smith and Leslee Dart, which for years has been 
considered comparable to Creative Artists Agency's dominance on the talent side 
of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 While the recent exits at PMK are disappointing for the firm and noticeable 
because of the stars' high profiles, Kingsley and others point to plenty of 
recent signings, including Ralph Fiennes, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant and Woody 
Harrelson. They are additions to an enviable roster including Jodie Foster, Tom 
Cruise, Sharon Stone, Al Pacino, Richard Gere, Holly Hunter, Candice Bergen and 
Roseanne Arnold (Tom Arnold was dropped recently after the divorce proceedings 
were begun).  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the firm must cope with Pfeiffer's departure so close to the opening of 
"Wolf," which co-stars Jack Nicholson. A Columbia executive said the studio has 
found Pfeiffer to have been "wildly unreasonable, refusing to promote the film. 
She was sick and tired of working and wanted a break. She wanted to go to Fiji 
but Lois Smith wanted her to do the press junket." Sources also speculate that 
Pfeiffer's pregnancy may have been a factor in her refusal to promote "Wolf." 
Neither Pfeiffer, who reportedly is now vacationing in Fiji, nor her ICM agent, 
Ed Limato, could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith would say only that she and Pfeiffer, her client of six years, had a 
disagreement "over one specific thing. I love Michelle dearly. And I don't for 
a minute think that she has suffered from overexposure. If anything she has 
been too low-key." 
</P>
<P>
 PMK also represents "Wolf" director Mike Nichols and is involved in publicity 
on the film for the studio.  
</P>
<P>
 Just what Sarandon, a PMK client for eight years, wanted and didn't get is 
unclear, though sources say the actress hasn't been happy with the amount of 
publicity she has received recently. On behalf of Sarandon, Seltzer said: "PMK 
can explain it any way it makes them happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins' exit, sources say, was in part triggered by PMK's position on 
Sarandon's departure, which happened two weeks ago; he has declined to comment. 
Smith told The Times last week: "I think Susan is fabulous. But I want to make 
it clear that she did not leave us. We suggested to her that if she was unhappy 
(with the amount of coverage PMK was generating for her), she should probably 
go somewhere else. We respect her decision."  
</P>
<P>
 "We expected (Robbins' departure) because it would have been awkward. There 
has never been any indication from him of being unhappy with how PMK has 
handled his coverage," Kingsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Studios generally pay a star's publicist for handling publicity on a film, 
including placing newspaper and magazine profiles related to the movie. It's 
usually part of the star's movie contract. The publicist's fee in these cases 
does not come out of the star's pocket, which is why some studios and other 
publicists see dual representation as a conflict of interest. As a result, some 
studios complain that they don't get their money's worth and that a star's 
personal publicist is often a hindrance. In fact, one source said that Walt 
Disney Studios is so fed up with what it sees as the interference of personal 
publicists that it is formulating new clauses in contracts dictating what 
publicity a star has to do on a picture. Other sources say 20th Century Fox and 
Columbia have considered similar stipulations as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of rap has been around," says Kingsley. "But the problem for 
studios is they don't have the confidence of personalities. That is why a 
publicist like myself is there, to act as a liaison and work on cooperation 
from both sides. It's really an advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a business where people leave and new ones come all the time," says 
Smith, noting publicists don't have contracts. "It's just the way it goes." 
</P>
<P>
 The exodus at PMK applies to talent within the firm as well. Young publicists 
who have left the PMK nest and started their own firms include Susan Culley, 
who reps Christian Slater and Liam Neeson; partners Annette Wolf and Lisa 
Kasteler, whose clients include Alec Baldwin, Patrick Swayze and Nicolas Cage; 
and Harry Clein of Clein & White, which represents mostly high-profile 
independent films.  
</P>
<P>
 The boutique firms are focused on attracting up-and-coming young talent -- 
just as Kingsley did when she bailed from Rogers & Cowan, the entertainment PR 
powerhouse of the '70s and early '80s. Kingsley and Smith started Pickwick in 
1971, which evolved into PMK with new partners in 1980. Currently the firm has 
nine publicists in L.A. and nine in New York, handling a total of 150 clients. 
</P>
<P>
 But one element has never changed in the last 23 years, says competitor Clein. 
"Pat and Lois still remain the best at knowing how to calm their clients . . . 
to make them feel OK when everything appears to be falling apart. In this 
business, that can go a long way."

TONYS: YOU CALL THIS 'PASSION'?; COMMENTARY: THE BEST MUSICAL AWARD WAS TO BE 
THE MAIN EVENT, BUT THE PRESENTATION TO SONDHEIM AND LAPINE WAS ANTISEPTIC, 
REFLECTING A CATEGORY IN WHICH GETTING ENOUGH NOMINEES WAS DIFFICULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The high point of Sunday night's Tony telecast came when award presenter Paul 
Sorvino remarked, innocently, "What a season!" He seemed immediately to regret 
the words, which apparently compromised the impish honesty of his co-presenter 
Madeline Kahn, whose eyes rolled skyward. Always the lady, she corrected 
herself with a delicate smile.  
</P>
<P>
 What a season indeed. Last month the Tony nominating committee was forced back 
into its pen when it emerged with only two best musical nominations -- for 
"Passion," the Stephen Sondheim/James Lapine show, and for Disney's "Beauty and 
the Beast," popularly resented among insiders for having the subtlety of an Ice 
Capades (the irony here being that in past years the awards community resented 
Sondheim for not having the subtlety of an Ice Capades). 
</P>
<P>
 Willing to do anything to avoid the embarrassment of seeming to endorse "Best 
Little Whorehouse Goes Public," the committee reappeared with nominations for 
two defunct musicals, "A Grand Night for Singing," the Rodgers and Hammerstein 
revue that seemed to have wandered accidentally from a cabaret onto a Broadway 
stage, and the baffling Dutch import "Cyrano," from which the telecast didn't 
bother assembling a scene (the given reason: The show is playing "around the 
world," where, one hopes, it is recouping the $8 million it lost in New York). 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's main event, in which "Passion" KO'ed "Beauty and the Beast," was 
strangely antiseptic. James Lapine exhibited the emotion of a man picking up 
his laundry when he won for best book, and for his part Sondheim mentioned it 
was "always great doing business" with Lapine. Perhaps that lack of excitement 
is natural when you win for a work far less substantial than the one you should 
have won for ten seasons back. That was the year that Jerry Herman's "La Cage 
aux Folles" won over "Sunday in the Park With George," the first 
Sondheim-Lapine collaboration. The contest was rather like the "Star 
Wars"/"Annie Hall" runoff at the Oscars in 1977, with "La Cage" representing 
the gauche entertainment whose win would signal the end of western civilization 
and "Sunday" the smart, elegant epitome of what made life worth living for the 
true connoisseur. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's politically incorrect to say so, this year the dichotomy was a 
false one. Despite its overproduction, a dreadful child actor and some cheesy 
special effects (hello, Doug Henning!), "Beauty and the Beast" offers a 
terrific score, funny and often deeply felt. In fact, its best lyrics (which, 
like "Passion's," examine the irrelevance of beauty and the liberating aspects 
of love) are more generous and even inventive than anything in Sondheim's 
carefully constructed logic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One couldn't help rooting for "Beauty" when composer Alan Menken blinked back 
tears at the nominator's mention of his longtime collaborator, the immensely 
gifted lyricist and bookwriter Howard Ashman, who died in 1991. Menken's face 
was a reminder of the effulgence of emotion in "Beauty" and of its unashamed 
desire to give pleasure (did anyone miss the dancers with spinning plates as 
tail-fans?).  
</P>
<P>
 The further irony is that Sondheim, who can summon up great wells of passion 
on the subject of artistic obsession ("Sunday") or obsessive vengeance 
("Sweeney Todd") can only cerebrate on romantic passion. 
</P>
<P>
 The best play competition was a meatier contest, with two vastly different and 
equally worthy plays to root for or against. I wanted to see "Twilight: Los 
Angeles, 1992" win and not only because Tony Kushner's "Angels in America" won 
last year. The Anna Deavere Smith play is faltering at the box office; it was 
pushed out of Pulitzer consideration for reasons that seemed arbitrary and 
wrongheaded; and finally, Diana Rigg took best actress over Smith, leaving 
Smith's overwhelming achievement completely unheralded.  
</P>
<P>
 In her play about the 1992 riots, Smith approaches one of the great and most 
complex questions of the century, that is, "How could this have happened?" -- 
the same question addressed, for instance, by filmmaker Marcel Ophuls in his 
Holocaust documentaries "The Sorrow and the Pity" and "Hotel Terminus" -- as a 
cubist puzzle, addressing it from all possible sides and interpreting it with a 
generous and compassionate intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Kushner, on the other hand, asks the question, "How do we live with what's 
happened?" and his subject is, of course, the devastation of AIDS. The play 
ends with a blessing on the audience, a blessing of "more life" bestowed by the 
character Prior Walter, a man who has learned to live after being abandoned by 
his lover, who has learned to live with physical pain and partial blindness, a 
man who has been chosen by a council of angels for an otherworldly relief from 
this life. But Prior declines, and when he comes back to Earth and bestows that 
blessing, audiences enjoy a rare sensation -- that whatever may come after 
leaving the theater is in fact a miracle and a blessing. So one can't possibly 
begrudge this award, because "Perestroika," the play's second half that won on 
Sunday night, is a stunning achievement, more moving and less bogged down with 
exposition than the play's first half, "Millennium Approaches."  
</P>
<P>
 In fact the entire play is much more entertaining and less earnest than a TV 
viewer might assume from Kushner's acceptance speech. Additionally, the 
playwright seemed to have been dressed by one of the "Best Little Whorehouse" 
designers, in gold lame vest and red satin cravat. This year he made no mention 
of the "scary orchestra" that threatened to engulf loquacious speakers with 
strains of "There's No Business Like Show Business." The song starts softly but 
quickly gains alarmingly in volume, and it did seem to scare "Passion's" Donna 
Murphy who raced it to a finish.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 But the real purpose of the Tonys, as everyone knows, is to make an hourlong 
national commercial, primarily to sell musicals. Unfortunately, this pressure 
sends producers into a tizzy, and more often than not the natural charm of a 
musical is completely lost. "Damn Yankees," for instance, features a lovely, 
human moment near the top of the show that could have translated onto the small 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 A middle-aged man who has just sold his soul to the devil sings a lovely 
farewell to his sleeping wife and races down the stairs, only to emerge from 
his suburban front door as a strapping young baseball player, who finishes the 
song in a thrilling, virile baritone. It's one of those moments that goes far 
beyond its function in the plot -- serving also as an ode to aging and loss -- 
and one that is electrifying in its theatrical simplicity. Instead of showing 
that (or, bewilderingly, a song by star Bebe Neuwirth, familiar to TV audiences 
from "Cheers"), the "Damn Yankees" segment featured a dance number with 
prancing baseball players, and it seemed that someone on speed had set the 
metronome. The number had a slight whiff of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the show's most entertaining moments came in the first half. 
Unfortunately, it was in a commercial in which "Seinfeld's" Julia Louis-Dreyfus 
offers to color the hair of another passenger on a New York City bus (the 
results elicit a "she looks fabulous!" from a nonplussed passenger). All told, 
the season wasn't as bad as Madeline Kahn's mugging might have indicated, but 
it's still a sad day when Broadway producers can take a clue from Clairol about 
how to sell a product.

MADNESS FOR THE SAKE OF VARIETY; STEFAN HAVES' COMIC SPECTACLE KICKS OFF SERIES 
AT FORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stefan Haves stands clad in shiny red boxer shorts amid semi-chaos. The gym 
floor of the Gascon Institute fencing school is filled with huge puppet heads 
on 20-foot stilts and sundry huddles of partially costumed performers. 
</P>
<P>
 It may look like entropy, but there's method to this madness -- "Moon Over 
Madness" to be exact. Director-performer Haves' comic variety spectacle opens 
the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre's Summer Nights series on Friday, Saturday and 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an ambitious undertaking. Not just because the show's scale is what 
Haves dubs "Busby Berkeley in the '90s," but also because this genre of silent 
theater lacks an established Southland audience base. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent popularity of Cirque du Soleil and "Fool Moon" notwithstanding, 
this is the type of performance that Americans usually associate with kiddie 
birthday parties. "There are so many obstacles when you have a discussion about 
variety arts," says Haves. "People think of it as the low of the low, 
basically. However, in Europe it's the high of the high." 
</P>
<P>
 And Haves, for one, is out to show Americans what they've been missing. "When 
I was in Europe I would see shows and not understand the language, but amazing 
actors would captivate me based on their relationship to their bodies and other 
actors," he says. "The most amazing shows I ever saw were silent theater." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-born and raised Haves, 35, started out as an actor. "When I 
was 18 or 19 I did some television, but I wanted to earn my stripes as a 
theater artist, to feel a sense of not being an impostor," he says. "Variety 
arts is the one place where, if you put in enough hours, you can pass torches 
or learn to unicycle." 
</P>
<P>
 There is an emphasis on craft for its own sake. "Once you get a good seven 
minutes, you own that," says Haves. "But it takes a certain kind of discipline. 
It's like haiku -- honing something very small and precious -- but the typical 
L.A. actor doesn't understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Haves attended Cal State Northridge and Brandeis. He trained with Czech 
director Antonin Hodek, among others, and studied Lecoq movement training in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 He met David Shiner when both were working as street performers in Europe in 
1981, beginning a long-term professional association that most recently 
resulted in Haves' stint as a creative consultant for the New York and L.A. 
productions of Shiner and Bill Irwin's "Fool Moon." 
</P>
<P>
 "Stefan is a great help in my work and he's a creator in his own right," says 
Shiner. "I can always trust Stefan to give me clear critiques, to guide me when 
I get stuck. He has a great eye for the style of work that we do and he's one 
of the rare people who's trying to bring this style of work back." 
</P>
<P>
 Haves' own performances include his signature comic contortion act "Backman," 
for which he was awarded $10,000 as one of "America's Funniest People." 
</P>
<P>
 He is best-known in L.A. theater, though, for his 1990 adaptation of Jack 
London's "The Call of the Wild" and the more recent variety showcase 
"Vaudevillage." These productions also marked the advent of Haves' company, the 
Physical Theater Project, now known as the L.A. Physical Theater Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Haves hasn't attempted anything as big as "Moon Over Madness" before. A 
fantasy montage that starts out looking like "Shakespeare under the stars" and 
jumps to 1994, the show incorporates music, clowning, masks and puppetry and 
features such artists as Wolfe Bowart ("Harold's Big Feet"), puppeteer Steven 
Ritz-Barr and Guggenheim fellow Daniel Stein in his L.A. debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, says Haves, it's a chance for his fellow variety performers to 
stretch their creative wings. "I'm offering an opportunity for artists who 
wouldn't otherwise be able to do this kind of work," he says. "We all do gigs 
with our signature pieces, but what's attractive is collaborating. Yes, we're 
going to put in signature pieces with artists who can fill a 1,200-seat house 
by themselves. But these same artists can also go out on a limb with new 
material." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Haves and company get a break when it comes to union 
requirements. Because there's not a word spoken in the show, the contract falls 
under the jurisdiction and more lenient requirements of AGVA, the variety 
artists' union, rather than Equity, the actors' union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moon Over Madness" is billed as a show "in the tradition of Cirque du 
Soleil," and features at least one ex-Cirque performer, Denis Lacombe. "I look 
at what I'm doing here as a visual comic symphony -- closer to jazz," says 
Haves. "There's a whole other story happening in rhythm and behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Such simple humanism is particularly appealing in tough times. "There are a 
lot of people who are looking for escape now, something where they don't have 
to think about what's happening on the outside," says Haves. "I don't want 
anything outside the theater to come into the theater while I'm performing. I 
want to transport the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Haves' characteristic comic impulse is to reach the Everyman in each 
audience member. "I'm interested in the power of the pathetic, of mortality," 
he says. "I'm just this guy onstage, with just a stick. If I have the courage 
to be that pathetic or vulnerable onstage, that becomes a metaphor for all of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 "Comedy is about obstacles," Haves continues. "The obstacles I have with a 
toaster are the same obstacles that we all have 12-14 hours a day. Being a 
schmuck on this planet, we are all having to deal." 
</P>

 WHEELERS AND DEALERS: Ventura County transportation officials are doing 
everything they can to coax commuters out of their cars and into trains and 
buses (B1). . . . But it's going to take a lot more coaxing in some areas, 
particularly in the east county. In Simi Valley, 34% of the households own 
three or more cars. This means more cars on local roads, but it also means more 
customer traffic for Simi Valley auto dealers like Darrell Coletto. "We hope 
the trend continues to grow." 
</P>

 PAPER FOLDS: The big news at the Oxnard Press-Courier on Monday was the 
announcement by the publisher that the paper will cease publication this week 
after 95 years as the city's hometown paper (B1). . . . Officials cited the 
California economy, the competitive market and declining ad sales for the move. 
Said publisher Kirk A. Davis, "We recognize that newspapers provide an 
important public service, but this is a business and we weren't able to meet 
all of our obligations." 
</P>
<P>
 FLAG DAY: Today marks the 217th anniversary of Old Glory. Although cotton was 
the primary material used in flag making in 1777, this is no longer the case. 
Polyester and nylon are also used and, while more expensive than cotton, are 
preferred by some because of their lasting quality. . . . "Nylon flies better 
and dries better than cotton," said Dan Lanshe, co-owner of American Eagle 
Flags & Banners in Ventura. "It also has a nice snap to it." 
</P>
<P>
 BABY BUSINESS: Hoping to attract more Medi-Cal patients, Community Memorial 
Hospital recently opened a clinic near Oxnard's La Colonia neighborhood to 
serve new mothers. Now Ventura County Medical Center is proposing to do the 
same, as competition between the two hospitals for low-income patients 
escalates (B1). . . . Richard Reisman of Community Memorial said the hospital 
must expand its opportunities in poor areas like La Colonia. "We are 
latecomers, but we're very serious about being here now."

 Merck & Co. Raises Prices on 22 Drugs, Cuts Them on 2: The New Jersey-based 
pharmaceutical company said it raised prices from 2.7% to 3.8% on medications 
such as its ulcer drug Pepcid; Vasotec, its drug for high blood pressure, and 
Proscar, its drug for benign enlarged prostate. Merck cut the prices of two 
cholesterol drugs: the 40-milligram dose of Zocorby, by 32%, and the 
10-milligram dose of Mevacor, by 28%.

 Macy, Federated Officials Confer: R.H. Macy & Co. executives, who have opposed 
Federated Department Stores' plan to merge the two retailers, have begun 
meeting with Federated officials to hear details of the proposal, sources 
said.But after their first meeting last Friday, "we still believe our plan 
would offer the most recovery to the creditors," a Macy official said. The 
rival retailers have been trying to win support from Macy creditors for 
competing bankruptcy reorganization plans. Macy's proposal provides for the 
company to return to public ownership under current management. But Federated 
wants creditors to accept a plan that calls for Federated to take over its 
rival.

COMPANY TOWN; U.S., FRANCE AGREE TO SEEK RESOLUTION OF FILM DISPUTE; TRADE: 
KANTOR STRIKES AN UNEXPECTED THREE-PART AGREEMENT IN PARIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and France have agreed to take a new stab at resolving their 
bitter dispute over movies, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two countries -- legendary sparring partners in the trade arena -- also 
agreed to sit down and address their common concerns over access to Japan, 
considered the main transgressor when it comes to trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have agreed to begin to hold informal talks," Kantor said at the annual 
meeting of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 In a third development, groups from Paris and Washington plan to delve into 
the contentious new link between trade policy and worker rights -- a high 
priority for both governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said he struck the three-part agreement over dinner Monday night with 
his French counterpart, Gerard Longuet. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a new tack, the informal talks will group not just government officials 
but labor and industry representatives as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The audiovisual sector has long divided the United States from the European 
Union, which fears that Hollywood will sound the death knell for Continental 
filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that most Europeans are more keen on Rambo than Zola, Longuet 
has argued long and loud against Hollywood blockbusters, all in the name of a 
higher European art. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States had pushed hard to bring the multibillion-dollar industry 
under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade when talks 
wrapped up last December. But France balked and America backed off, while 
vowing that the issue was far from dead. 
</P>
<P>
 There is big money at stake. According to industry data, the U.S. film, TV and 
home video industry earns about $8 billion of its $18 billion in annual 
revenues overseas. Of that, some 55% comes from Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a 1989 European broadcast directive that ensures at least half of 
all European Union television programming is home-grown. France has taken it 
one step further, mandating a 60% domestic content. 
</P>
<P>
 What has also galled the Clinton Administration -- which relied on strong 
backing from Hollywood to help it capture the White House -- are rules that 
deny U.S. artists and producers full royalties when their work is shown at 
European theaters. The royalties are instead plowed back into EU industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The new U.S.-Gallic alliance -- given their past wrangling over everything 
from oil seeds to fish to wine -- had not been foreseen. Kantor met last week 
with EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, who said the movie dispute did not 
even come up. 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside the new attempt to make greater inroads in the film business, 
Longuet and Kantor also agreed that the two sides should team up on two other 
highly contentious trade issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has been pushing an aggressive market-opening strategy in 
its talks with Japan. Some trading partners have expressed fears that Americans 
are negotiating for U.S. firms alone, despite U.S. claims to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 All previous attempts by Brittan to step into the fray and "trilateralize" the 
negotiations have come to naught. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Longuet is stepping in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
 Longuet and Kantor also agreed to delve into the trade-labor debate, which 
many countries fear is a mask for higher wages overseas and amounts to First 
World protectionism.

EXECUTIVE SUITE: COMPANY TOWN; HOLLYWOOD PICTURES GETS NEW PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As expected, Walt Disney Co. has named publishing executive Michael Lynton 
president of its Hollywood Pictures division. He succeeds Ricardo Mestres, who 
resigned in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynton's appointment is unusual because of his lack of background in the film 
business. For the last three years, he has been senior vice president of Disney 
Publishing Group, where he has overseen Disney's domestic publishing 
operations, including Hyperion Books. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lynton is also a close friend of David Hoberman, Disney's president 
of motion pictures, whom he will report to. Lynton will assume his new post 
June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sony Pictures Entertainment has named Fred Bernstein president of Columbia 
TriStar Motion Picture Cos. As expected, he will team with Columbia TriStar 
Chairman Mark Canton in the management of Sony's motion picture operations.  
</P>
<P>
 * Tom Ruegger has signed a new multiyear deal as executive producer for Warner 
Bros. Animation. 
</P>
<P>
 * SI Communications has appointed Lauren Walker director of radio operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Janine M. Coughlin has joined Atlantis Films' Santa Monica office as 
director of literary development. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet, chairman and chief executive of Credit 
Lyonnais Securities U.S.A., is leaving the investment banking firm to pursue 
other activities in finance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heidi Sinclair has joined the Burson-Marsteller public relations firm in Los 
Angeles as head of its interactive and entertainment technologies practice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jerry Brown has been promoted to senior account executive for music at Lee 
Solters Co. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adeena Karsseboom has been promoted to vice president of development at 
Raffaella Productions.

BUILDER USES AVIATION TECHNOLOGY TO HELP BICYCLES FLY; ENGINEERING: GEORGE 
BANKE'S CUSTOM-MADE, LIGHTWEIGHT FRAMES ARE ON THE CUTTING EDGE AND A FAVORITE 
WITH TOP CYCLISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Banke went from machine-tool planner on a mile-long fighter jet 
assembly line to owner of a 90-foot shop that builds bicycle frames. But he's 
still making his creations fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Aviation engineering technology -- from the use of space-age metals to wind 
tunnel testing -- has made his custom-made, lightweight frames a favorite with 
top cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to walk out of a place like (General Dynamics Corp.) and walk into 
a small building and imagine that you could still use almost all the processes 
that they used," said Banke, a 47-year-old Fort Worth native. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we use the basic technology . . . that they use in the aircraft 
industry," said Banke, whose goal is to furnish members of the U.S. national 
team with bike frames. 
</P>
<P>
 John C. Kennedy, president of Nova Cycle Supply Inc., based in Rocklin, 
Calif., says Banke Racing Works is on the cutting edge of frame-building 
through its use of high-strength aluminum alloys and ability to quickly 
introduce new techniques and designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, a leading supplier of materials for frames, said there are trade-offs 
with Banke's style of building, but his clients are willing to accept them. 
</P>
<P>
 "George builds a little bit different than other builders. He is absolutely 
into the performance-type bike. He is willing to forfeit some longevity for 
performance," said Kennedy in explaining that the frames don't last as long as 
a heavier frame might. 
</P>
<P>
 From a white stucco shop in a west Fort Worth business park, Banke has been 
custom-fitting cyclists to 3 1/2-pound frames since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Banke took a voluntary layoff from his job at the General Dynamics 
Fort Worth F-16 fighter jet plant, where hundreds of jobs were cut as part of 
the post-Cold War restructuring of the defense industry. The plant is now owned 
by Lockheed Fort Worth Co. but still produces F-16 fighter jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before quitting the job, Banke had been experimenting with building 
bicycle frames for friends and for his 16-year-old daughter, Natalie, an 
amateur racer. Before that, he had built drilling rigs in the 1970s, as well as 
go-cart frames. 
</P>
<P>
 Banke said metal fabricating experience, which he gained at the old General 
Dynamics plant and elsewhere, enables him to build better frames. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been slowed by any old-time methods like lug frame construction," 
said Banke. Many mass-produced frames are stamped or welded together using 
metal attachments called lugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Composites of carbon, graphite, titanium and beryllium are used, as well as 
steel and aluminum products Banke used in aviation, to obtain the right balance 
of weight, rigidity and strength. 
</P>
<P>
 A knowledge of aircraft dynamics has also been useful, he said. Banke puts his 
bike frame designs in a wind tunnel at Texas A&M University to test them. 
</P>
<P>
 His frames, which cost $1,700 to $4,000, take 20 to 25 hours to make. His shop 
produces about 300 frames a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Frames are custom fitted to the client's body using techniques developed by 
French coach Cyrille Guimard and other world-class racing experts, says Banke, 
who says a good fit means the difference between a good rider and a great one. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident mechanic Joe Young, who does performance tuning and builds bikes at 
the shop, said the company has modified a fitting technique used by Italians 
who prefer a lower saddle than some French riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Following construction, Banke's wife Betty spends eight to 10 hours per frame 
to put on high-gloss paint, followed by a base coat-clear coat. Some customers, 
including master riders and major racers, can also order custom hues. 
</P>
<P>
 The custom frame shop is not as common in this country as in Europe, where 
clubs sponsor frequent races and bicycling is a bigger industry. But the idea 
is catching on, and about 800 such shops currently exist in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to think we've improved on the idea here," Mrs. Banke said. "We took 
what others have done and researched what does and doesn't work and rejected 
what doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Banke bicycle riders, including Natalie, would agree.

JOB SWITCH TURNS BUILDER INTO HOME SHOPPER; REAL ESTATE: CHAD DREIER, WHO LEFT 
KAUFMAN & BROAD, IS WORKING TO INCREASE PROFITS AT THE MARYLAND-BASED RYLAND 
GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX DOMINGUEZ, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chief executive officer of the nation's third-largest home builder knows 
what it's like to be a home shopper. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Dreier did plenty of house hunting after leaving Los Angeles-based 
builder Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., where he was second in command, to take the 
helm of Ryland Group Inc. last November. 
</P>
<P>
 He searched for a new home on weekends while renting a condominium in downtown 
Baltimore, mixing business with what he says is pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the business, so going out on a Saturday and looking at homes is half 
hobby and half work," explained the 46-year-old Dreier, who eventually bought a 
house in Ellicott City, just outside Baltimore (no, it wasn't a Ryland home.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ryland Group hasn't been nearly as lucky, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the company lost $2.7 million, or 34 cents a share, due largely to 
a $45-million charge it took for falling land prices, mostly in Southern 
California. Revenue totaled $1.47 billion, compared to $1.44 billion the 
previous year, with home building accounting for $1.2 billion and financial 
services and other subsidiary activities accounting for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Net income was flat for the first quarter of this year, with Ryland earning 
$6.2 million, or 36 cents a share, compared to $6.6 million, or 38 cents per 
share, last year. Revenue totaled $332.5 million, up from $295.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The main challenge for Dreier is to increase Ryland's profits and persuade 
investors to continue giving the company money to finance developments. Time is 
of the essence. 
</P>
<P>
 "My experience is that you want to sell homes as fast as you can because 
markets can turn and you don't want to get caught," Dreier explained. "I don't 
know if you want to be in a position holding land more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost think we're more like a retailer. Lots are a component of our 
product, and you have to turn it out fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreier is a tall, jovial guy-next-door type, the father of two college-age 
children. He enjoys sports, but concedes he's more of a spectator than he would 
like to be. At work, however, colleagues and industry analysts describe him as 
fast-moving and direct. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreier wants to accomplish three things at Ryland: Return the company to a 
leadership position in the home-building field; maximize the benefits of its 
mortgage operation to help sell homes and make profits; and improve investor 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 He says Ryland homes will become more open, with family rooms adjoining 
kitchen islands, more master bathrooms, more "great spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts like what Dreier is doing so far. Lawrence Horan, who follows Ryland 
for Prudential Securities, says he expects the company to earn $2.20 a share in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing several things to enhance gross margins," Horan said. "First off, 
he's changing the way they buy land, trying to buy it better. That means to 
turn it more quickly, get faster asset turnover." 
</P>
<P>
 Horan said Dreier also plans to centralize the purchasing of materials and 
refocus on entry-level housing, some of the same strategies Kaufman, Dreier's 
former employer, adopted to deal with the falling Southern California market. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Brothers analyst Ivy Schneider said Ryland stock had been trailing in 
the home-building industry for several reasons, including poor marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schneider says she expects the company to earn $1.95 a share in 1994 and 
has issued a "buy recommendation" for the stock, citing the improving housing 
market and Dreier's turnaround program. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryland stock hit a 52-week high of $25.625 a share in early February on the 
New York Stock Exchange. It has been trading in the $20-per-share range lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider predicts Ryland will trade in the mid-$30s in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's (Dreier) going to be implementing several strategies, and I think it's 
just going up from here, hopefully no more on the downside. It's just a matter 
of when that happens," Ms. Schneider said. "I think it's an opportunity from an 
analyst's perspective. The stock has good valuation, because it's been a dog 
relative to the group." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryland built 8,000 homes last year in 48 markets spread across 18 states. The 
company's main markets are in the Middle Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast states 
and in Southern California. The company also has an international division. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ryland has a strong presence in the mortgage business, originating 
28,000 loans last year, Dreier said he knows his job is to return Ryland to a 
leading position as a home builder. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were on Wall Street and invested in this company, that's what you 
would invest in," he said.

FILM PRODUCER HAS UN-HOLLYWOOD STYLE BUT TRAINS SHARP EYE ON MOVIE-MAKING; 
MEDIA: JAMES ROBINSON, HEAD OF MORGAN CREEK PRODUCTIONS, SAYS HE WANTS TO BE IN 
CHARGE OF HIS OWN STUDIO BY 1995. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 He doesn't socialize with starlets at beachside Malibu soirees, shop the 
boutiques of Rodeo Drive or peruse scripts while cruising down Sunset 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of his un-Hollywood touches, James Robinson, a former automobile parts 
distributor from Baltimore, has definitely made his name known in Hollywood. He 
heads Morgan Creek Productions, one of the country's most prominent independent 
film producers. 
</P>
<P>
 He runs it from a nondescript office overlooking his hometown of Baltimore, 
known more for commercial shipping and crab cakes than for celebrity glitter 
and world movie premieres. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson waited until he was in his late 40s to try movie-making. While others 
try and fail, he doesn't seem to consider his success any big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's successful and stays successful unless you're smart," Robinson said. 
"It's an unforgiving business. But you can do well if you make the big plays. 
Kind of like professional sports." 
</P>
<P>
 Since it formed in 1988, Morgan Creek Productions has accumulated several 
successes that include "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," "The Last of the 
Mohicans" and "Major League." Morgan Creek has also produced a few bombs: "The 
Crush," "Stay Tuned" and "White Sands." 
</P>
<P>
 Movie-making is the third career for Robinson, 57. After graduating with a 
business degree from the University of Maryland, he put in a brief stint as an 
Army photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved into distributing Subaru cars and parts in the Midwest, then branched 
into imported car and truck part processing centers in Los Angeles and 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending 24 years in the automotive parts industry, Robinson took his 
first steps in the film business in the early 1980s by providing bridge 
financing, the term for interim financing of film projects while producers try 
to line up a studio to distribute the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1984, he had co-produced a movie with Joe Roth, who went on to become one 
of Hollywood's biggest film executives. The duo made two other movies before 
forming Morgan Creek Productions, named after "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek," 
a comedy released in 1944 about a woman (Betty Hutton) who gets pregnant but 
can't remember who the father is. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth left Morgan Creek in 1989 to head 20th Century Fox's film studio and 
later formed his own production company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't just waltz into this business," said Robinson. "I studied it and 
learned it. I was ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Morgan Creek is based in Baltimore, Robinson must still spend 
considerable time in Hollywood, home to almost all the industry's key 
personalities and decision-makers. So he commutes, flying to the West Coast for 
a few days every Tuesday night and working out of Morgan Creek's office in 
Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 5 1/2-hour flight, he changes from a Baltimore family man, father 
of five, into a hard-driving production executive with a crammed agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being on that plane and flying back gives you a different perspective," 
Robinson said. "When I hit Los Angeles, I'm working nonstop. And I don't mean 
working Hollywood parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson likens himself to the movie moguls of yesteryear, building an empire 
that extends beyond film and into the recording, theater and film distribution 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Morgan Creek Productions, Robinson owns Morgan Creek 
International, which distributes films in the international market; Morgan 
Creek Music Group; Morgan Creek International Theatres, which in a joint 
venture with Warner Bros. will bring 36 screens to the Netherlands; and a 
substantial interest in the First International Theatre chain, which operates 
screens in Kansas, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way I've always operated in all my businesses," said Robinson, 
dressed in khakis in his downtown Baltimore office. "As long as it's linked to 
the core business. What I'm doing is how they did it in the olden days." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Morgan Creek is privately owned, it's not obliged to publicly disclose 
its finances. But Variety, the Hollywood trade magazine, says Morgan Creek 
spends about $200 million on production, prints and advertising annually. The 
company is expected to spend about $1 billion to produce and market about 25 
films over the next three to four years, Variety said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's willingness to put up his own money for film projects sets him 
apart, said Rob Friedman, president of worldwide publicity for Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim is unique in how he operates," Friedman said. "He is a guy who will step 
to the plate if he feels he needs to fix his movie. He will reach into his own 
pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan Creek Productions works closely with Warner Bros., which signed a 
contract in 1991 to release Morgan Creek's movies in the United States. The 
company's films previously were distributed by 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan Creek International distributes the movies overseas. Warner pays for 
advertising and gets a chunk of the proceeds from sales abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson says that, by 1995, he wants to head his own studio, which in 
Hollywood parlance is a single organization that produces, markets and exhibits 
its own films. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can either buy one or build one," he said. "It would be nice to have that 
when I check out. I should be in the studio business in the next two or three 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson wouldn't elaborate on which Hollywood studio interested him. But he 
said that if he does buy a studio, he will still maintain his home in Baltimore 
and the management style that has evolved since Morgan Creek Productions was 
founded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little less centralized and I delegate more," he said. "I like to have 
people who act in an entrepreneurial way. People in key roles having a vested 
interest in the company is important."

 Call it the battle for babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks ago, Community Memorial Hospital opened a family care clinic near 
one of Oxnard's poorest neighborhoods and has been drawing in 10 to 12 new 
mothers a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ventura County Medical Center is asking the Board of Supervisors today to 
approve a new county clinic about a mile away, even closer to the La Colonia 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the rush to serve some of the county's neediest residents, those typically 
shunned by the health care establishment? 
</P>
<P>
 The quirks of the state's Medi-Cal system and the realities of health reform 
have suddenly made it profitable to care for some low-income residents, 
particularly expectant mothers.  
</P>
<P>
 "The changing reality of what's happening in medical care in America has 
stimulated private physicians to expand their practicing opportunities," said 
Dr. Richard Reisman, the medical director of Community Memorial's Center for 
Family Health. "We are late comers, but we're very serious about being here 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 But county doctors say the private clinic could end up skimming off the only 
patients who bring any substantial reimbursement from Medi-Cal, the state's 
program for low-income health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are taking away our only real subsidy and making it more difficult for 
us to serve those people that nobody else wants," said Brian Prestwich, a 
family practice doctor at the county's Las Islas Family Medical Clinic in south 
Oxnard. "That's my concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders in the predominantly Latino neighborhood remain skeptical about both 
clinics. Many remember angrily how the county shut down a small clinic there 
just two years ago. Residents were expected to travel to Las Islas or use a 
small clinic run by Clinicas del Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the people who used the facility were shocked," said Carlos Aguilera, 
a community advocate. "I think they were stabbed in the back." He is not 
impressed with Community Memorial's efforts either. "Isn't it funny when one of 
the most expensive hospitals in the county, who would probably kick the poor in 
the teeth before they let them in, now want to make a profit on them?" Aguilera 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over the two clinics underscores a deeper division between the 
county medical center and the private hospital that sit across the street from 
each other in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial administrator Michael Bakst sees the county's new clinic as 
the latest in a series of efforts to compete with his institution. He has 
protested plans to add a new outpatient wing to the public hospital and to 
provide health care there for county employees. "I don't think that government 
has a right or a role to compete with the private sector," Bakst said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 But county supporters say it is Community Memorial that has moved into the 
public hospital's territory. In addition to opening the clinic, the private 
hospital has run newspaper ads with huge pictures of babies. 
</P>
<P>
 With thousands of patients who pay nothing at all, the county system relies on 
pregnancies -- and the nearly $1,000 in reimbursement for each patient -- to 
offset its losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's a particularly offensive and specious argument," said Reisman, 
the obstetrician-gynecologist who directs the Community Memorial clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The county, he said, is essentially asking low-income, pregnant women to 
subsidize health care for the rest of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who should subsidize that: the person with Medi-Cal, the paying patient or 
the taxpayer?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial, which just received a contract to accept Medi-Cal 
payments, now offers low-income residents a choice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they choose to come to a private setting, with board-certified physicians 
rather than residents, they should have that right," Reisman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county hospital has a family practice residency program, but also employs 
board-certified doctors. "All of our deliveries are performed or supervised by 
the obstetrics department," said Pierre Durand, county hospital administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Hilton and James Dykstra, who moved to Ventura County this spring, 
did not want to deliver their baby at the county hospital because they feared 
the maternity ward would be overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 They chose the Community Memorial clinic, and came to the hospital Monday 
morning for the birth of their daughter. Dykstra said the experience was far 
better than their last child's birth at an Antelope Valley hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nicer, quieter, more attention," he said. "Everything is explained. It's not 
just done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But critics question whether that sort of choice is available to all 
prospective Medi-Cal clients. In most cases, the state pays far less for 
medical procedures than private insurance companies do. "The bottom line is if 
you're not pregnant, if you're a child who is ill or an adult who is ill, there 
are very few options for you," said Prestwich from the county clinic.

TOUGH MARKET FORCES ANOTHER LOCAL PAPER TO END PUBLICATION; MEDIA: THE 
95-YEAR-OLD PRESS-COURIER BECOMES THE THIRD NEWSPAPER IN THE COUNTY TO FOLD IN 
THE PAST 18 MONTHS. 
</P>

<P>
 The 95-year-old Oxnard Press-Courier will cease publication on Thursday, the 
third newspaper to fold in the past 1 1/2 years under the pressure of Ventura 
County's competitive newspaper market. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the state's troubled economy and the county's tough media market, 
newspaper officials announced Monday that the Press-Courier could no longer 
afford to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is with deep regret that we take this action," said Kirk A. Davis, 
publisher of the Press-Courier. "Over the past 95 years, we have developed and 
felt a special relationship with the residents of this community." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have covered them through good times and bad, but we unfortunately cannot 
keep the paper running in today's California economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto-based Thomson Newspapers, which owns the Press-Courier, also announced 
Monday that it would cease publication of the Ventura Sun and the Camarillo 
Sun. The weekly Ventura paper was launched in late 1992 while the twice-weekly 
Camarillo paper started publishing early last year. Both were circulated free 
to readers. 
</P>
<P>
 The closures represent the latest in a series of changes on the local 
newspaper scene that have led Editor & Publisher magazine to call Ventura 
County the site of one of the hottest newspaper wars in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition heated up in 1990, when the E.W. Scripps chain, headquartered 
in Ohio, announced it would move its afternoon Ventura Star-Free Press to 
morning delivery. At the same time The Times launched its daily Ventura County 
Edition, after previously operating a weekly Ventura County section. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times expanded its coverage of the county in May, 1993, by starting east 
county and west county editions. By that point, Scripps had launched its own 
expansion strategy. The newspaper chain, operating as Ventura County 
Newspapers, bought full ownership of the Simi Valley Enterprise, the Camarillo 
Daily News and the weekly Moorpark News-Mirror in 1992. It already owned the 
Thousand Oaks News Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to acquiring existing papers, Scripps also began publishing a 
zoned edition of its Ventura paper for Oxnard, which it calls the Oxnard 
Star-Free Press. After folding the Camarillo Daily News in 1993, the company 
replaced it with another zoned edition of the Star-Free Press, which it calls 
the Camarillo Star-Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Another victim of the newspaper competition in the county was the Santa Paula 
Chronicle, which closed in December, 1992. The Santa Paula paper was owned by 
another branch of the Scripps family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Daily News continues to operate in the county, with special 
zoned sections for Simi Valley, the Conejo Valley and the west county. The 
owner of the paper, however, announced last month that it is for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 With the closure of the Press-Courier, the only daily newspapers actively 
covering Oxnard are the West County Edition of The Times and the zoned edition 
of the Star-Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
 And newspaper managers say they see the battle for readers in Oxnard, and 
throughout the county, growing more fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County is an incredibly competitive newspaper market and it's also a 
difficult economy," said Jeffrey S. Klein, president of The Times Ventura 
County Edition. "The Times is committed to Ventura County . . . and we think 
there will be many Press-Courier readers who will try us out." 
</P>
<P>
 Added John Irby, editor of the Star-Free Press: "I think it (the 
Press-Courier's closure) is indicative of the fact that newspapers are 
businesses, we survive on revenue, and in this competitive market it looks like 
there wasn't enough to go around." 
</P>
<P>
 The Press-Courier had been trying to reverse a downward spiral that saw daily 
circulation drop from a peak of 23,087 to its current level of 16,208. At one 
point, in March, 1993, the paper's circulation had fallen to 15,538. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, it began printing the newspaper on new presses. In March of last 
year, the Press-Courier switched from evening to morning delivery to boost 
circulation. At the same time, it redesigned its cover and launched a number of 
new features and sections, including an entertainment tab called Weekend -- 
which was expanded and renamed Stir. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Audit Bureau of Circulation numbers this spring showed the 
Press-Courier with a slight circulation gain after four years of steady losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1990, its daily circulation stood at 19,631; this March it reported 
a daily circulation of 16,208, a gain of nearly 700 papers over the previous 
year. That increase, however, was not without expensive discounting and 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thomson chain had quietly tried to sell the Press-Courier since the start 
of the year. But with weak circulation and dwindling advertising revenues, the 
newspaper group found no takers. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Davis said there was little choice but to fold. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past two years, we pursued every avenue available to us to try to 
salvage the newspaper," he said. "In the final analysis, the declining economy 
and increased competition was just overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 The Press-Courier, and the Ventura Sun and Camarillo Sun, had a total of 172 
full- and part-time employees, with the bulk of those working for the 
Press-Courier. On Monday, employees expressed shock and sadness at the closure 
of a publication that billed itself as "Oxnard's hometown newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard rumors almost as long as I've been working there, but in the last 
couple of months they've been heating up," said Jim Schultz, who has covered 
Oxnard City Hall for the Press-Courier since arriving at the newspaper 11 years 
ago. "But I had no idea it was happening (Monday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Said one employee who refused to identify herself as she left the paper's 
downtown Oxnard office in tears: "I don't want to talk to you unless you have a 
job for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said plans are to sell the Press-Courier's facility in downtown Oxnard. 
City officials lamented the closure of the plant, not only because it puts 
nearly 200 people out of work but because it produces a gaping hole in the 
city's efforts to revitalize the city's downtown district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really saddened by the news," said Steve Kinney, president of Oxnard's 
Economic Development Corp. "They have been very aggressive in putting the 
Press-Courier behind some of the major development campaigns in the city. I 
feel like I'm losing an ally in that respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Magnuson, editor of the paper, called her staffers "real troopers." She 
said that "most people know we didn't give up without one heck of a fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper began as the weekly Courier, and during its first 13 years had 
eight different owners. It became an afternoon daily in 1909, and in 1940 was 
renamed the Oxnard Press-Courier. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and others at the newspaper noted that the Press-Courier already is 
planning its final edition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you one thing," he said. "We are going to put out one hell of an 
edition on Thursday."

INVESTIGATORS SAY AN ACCIDENT CAUSED BLAZE; OAK VIEW: BLACK FAMILY MAINTAINS 
THEIR HOUSE WAS DELIBERATELY TORCHED. OFFICIALS REPORT THEY CAN FIND NO 
EVIDENCE OF ARSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite a black family's contention that their Oak View home was deliberately 
torched, fire investigators said Monday that last week's blaze was not an 
arson, but some kind of accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no crime," said fire investigator Peter Cronk of the swift-moving 
fire that displaced 10 people and injured three. A full report on the fire is 
expected to be released on Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rummaging through the fire-gutted house last Tuesday, fire officials said the 
pre-dawn blaze was either arson or an accident. But after several days of 
investigation, fire and sheriff's officials said there was no evidence to 
suggest that the fire was deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no physical evidence to support a crime," Lt. Craig Husband of the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department's major crimes division said Monday. "It's 
not an arson, at least not an arson where anything was thrown into the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Husband said it is possible that the fire was started by someone, possibly by 
a family member, who was smoking inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that a cigarette started the blaze was among the early avenues of 
investigation, but family members have adamantly denied that anyone in the 
house was smoking when the fire started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't smoke," 13-year-old Shuwana Stanford said Friday. Shuwana, who 
suffered first- and second-degree burns to her face in the fire, has said she 
was sleeping on the living room couch when the fire broke out.  
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Stanford family members have said they think they were the 
target of an attack. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Shuwana's grandfather Lonnie Stanford would not comment Monday on the 
investigators' conclusion that it was not an arson, he had earlier said he was 
standing by what he saw on the morning of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't start itself and we didn't start it, so how did it get started?" 
Stanford said Friday. "I know what I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members told investigators that they heard a "pop" before the blaze 
started in the living room and saw a single stream of fire, as if from a 
flammable liquid, moments before the modest three-bedroom house was engulfed in 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
 They also described seeing a hole in the living room window before evacuating 
the burning structure. 
</P>
<P>
 But a dog trained to detect arson was unable to identify any flammable liquids 
in the charred house, and investigators could find no evidence of a hole 
because the windows were blown out by the fire.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert M. Featherston, owner of the burned home and a former insurance company 
investigator for 12 years, has said he believes the fire was the result of a 
hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any cause for the fire and fires have to have causes," he said 
Monday. "My insurance pays for it if it's arson or accident, but I think the 
community has a right to know what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Ojai Valley, support for the family has continued to pour in during 
the past week. About $3,400 has been donated to the Stanfords through a relief 
fund set up at Ojai Valley Bank, and dozens of bags of clothing and housewares 
have been dropped off at local fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been overwhelming," fire spokesman Norman Plott said. "I've taken 
over five truckloads of clothes, blankets and cookware. The community has 
helped so much we've had to shut off the clothes drive." 
</P>
<P>
 Plott said in addition to the donations, Happy Valley School has offered the 
family temporary residence in one of its dorms. The American Red Cross had 
relocated the family to an Ojai motel after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of negative things that happen in everyday life," Plott said. 
"And on the heels of something very tragic, there's been a lot of positive 
support."

POLICE REPORT SAYS MANNES ADMITTED SHE WAS DRINKING; CAMARILLO: ACCORDING TO 
ARREST RECORD, THE CONVICTED DRUNK DRIVER SAID SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMING ALCOHOLIC 
BEVERAGES FOR TWO DAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Diane Helen Mannes admitted she had been drinking for two days last weekend 
when deputies found her drunk in a parked car surrounded by a variety of empty 
alcoholic beverage containers, said a police report obtained Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannes, 39, who served time for a 1989 drunk-driving accident that killed 
three young men and injured two, sat in Ventura County Jail on Monday awaiting 
arraignment for the alleged violations of state parole and county probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears she had been drinking quite a bit," said Sheriff's Sgt. Keith 
Lazz, reading from the arrest report. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannes served about two years in prison for felony drunk-driving in connection 
with the injuries of two men whom her car hit in the March, 1989, accident on 
the Conejo Grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite repeated attempts by the Ventura County district attorney's office to 
prosecute her for murder in the deaths of the other three young men, Mannes 
eventually was allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter and released on five 
years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of her county probation stipulated that she stop drinking and attend 
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Deputy Timothy Waite reported finding Mannes in the passenger 
seat of a parked 1993 Geo Metro with a man identified as Richard Romney just 
after 1:15 a.m. at Pleasant Valley Park in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 A breath test showed that Mannes' blood-alcohol level was .245% -- more than 
three times the legal limit for driving. The car was littered with a 1 1/2-pint 
bottle of vodka, a three-quart bottle of wine, an empty malt liquor bottle, an 
empty Coors can and an empty Zima bottle, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 A paper bag containing two empty cans of Club Margaritas lay on the ground 
outside the passenger door, Waite's report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how much she had drunk, Mannes reportedly said she drank five shot-sized 
drinks of vodka and told the deputy she was taking several forms of 
anti-depressant drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Romney then told Waite that Mannes had stopped taking the medication three 
days earlier, the deputy's report said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Waite asked why she was drinking when probation required her to abstain, 
she told him that she was using the alcohol to get off the medication because 
she no longer wanted to take it -- and that she had been drinking for two days, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report says nothing about whether Romney had been drinking, but it says 
that Waite warned him not to drive, Lazz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannes is due to be arraigned Wednesday in Ventura County Superior Court on 
two alleged violations of probation: that she had consumed alcohol and that she 
had alcohol in her possession, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin DeNoce. 
</P>
<P>
 DeNoce said the judge probably will set June 23 as the hearing date for those 
charges, the same day Mannes is to face charges that she earlier violated 
probation by failing to attend AA meetings and forging attendance cards to hide 
her absences. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannes faces up to three years and eight months in state prison for violating 
the terms of her county probation, DeNoce said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also could be sentenced to as much as a year in prison for breaking the 
parole she was granted after serving time for a felony drunk-driving conviction 
she received for injuring the two young men, said state parole officer Randy 
Yamanaka. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannes had served about two years and nine months of a three-year parole term 
when she was arrested Saturday, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Yamanaka said he is reviewing the police report and considering whether to 
recommend that her parole be revoked.

RIDERS WANTED; WITH FEW USERS AND LITTLE FUNDING, COUNTY PUBLIC TRANSIT IS 
STRAPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Whenever Mimi Chuntz leaves her Camarillo home to go to the market, to the 
doctor or to visit friends, she gets there by means unfamiliar to most Ventura 
County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuntz, 72, takes the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in New York, where everybody took public transit," Chuntz said. 
"It's safe and it's cheap. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 But county leaders with a nervous eye to the future worry that there aren't 
enough transit riders such as Mimi Chuntz to keep buses and trains running. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 10% of Ventura County residents use public transit. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless more residents are coaxed out of their cars and into buses, trains and 
car pools, the county stands to lose millions of dollars in much-needed federal 
transportation funds tied to improving air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal gas tax funds account for up to half the $64 million the county and 
its 10 cities receive from the state and federal government for transportation 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal Clean Air Act, the county by 2005 must reduce the number of 
days when the air is considered unhealthful to no more than three in a 
three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1991 to 1993, pollution levels in Ventura County exceeded the federal 
health standard on 56 days, leading the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 
to designate the county's air quality problem as severe, a category surpassed 
only by the extreme rating assigned to the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the county's air quality has improved dramatically in the past 20 
years. In 1974, pollution levels for ozone soared above federal standards on 
122 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Public transit is crucial to further improving air quality and complying with 
the federal mandates, said Chris Stephens, a planner with the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest, most important challenge in cutting down on pollution is getting 
people out of their cars," Stephens said. "That is not going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1980 to 1990, vehicle miles traveled on state-run roadways in Ventura 
County rose more than 60%, according to Caltrans. By 2010, Caltrans predicts 
the number of miles traveled will increase another 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to prove that prediction wrong, Transportation Commission staff members 
have been pushing the panel to improve public transit throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the commission approved Metrolink commuter train service to Simi 
Valley and Moorpark. Earlier this year that service was extended temporarily to 
Camarillo and Oxnard to ease congestion on freeways damaged in the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 And in response to complaints from residents about the difficulty in traveling 
on public transit within the county, a countywide bus service designed to link 
most of the county's cities is scheduled to begin service July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Painful Process 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say the public transit projects are too expensive and could force 
cities to sacrifice already scarce dollars they now spend on roads. 
</P>
<P>
 They also argue that a shortage of funding for the public transit programs may 
pit longtime city bus services against the new commuter trains and countywide 
bus programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Running these extra services is all fine and well, but if you're taking money 
away from the cities, what good is that?" Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani 
said. "You're hurting more than you're helping." 
</P>
<P>
 But cities may be forced to tighten their belts, because getting cars off the 
road is essential to improving air quality, said Scott Johnson, planning 
manager for the county's Air Pollution Control District.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because of our population growth and our proclivity to drive, drive, drive, 
we are jeopardizing funding for roads and a score of other programs,' Johnson 
said. "If we want to improve our air and hang onto funding, it is going to be 
painful." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, businesses and government agencies have borne the brunt of the 
pollution reduction burden. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's strict trip-reduction ordinance, called Rule 210, requires 
businesses and agencies employing 100 or more people to provide incentives to 
reduce the number of people driving alone to work. Businesses with 50 to 99 
employees will face the same mandate starting in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 And in February, the Board of Supervisors agreed to require county workers to 
car pool, ride a bus or find another way to get to work other than driving solo 
at least one day a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's severe air quality rating has prompted intervention by the 
EPA. The agency has drawn up a Federal Implementation Plan with stiff control 
measures, aimed at businesses, to further rid the air of ozone. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is a proposal to require industry to reduce emissions by 25% by 
2005, regardless of whether the business has already cut emissions by 
installing modern pollution controls. 
</P>
<P>
 As more and more companies are compelled to conform to these mandates, county 
transportation officials expect the demand for public transit to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is actually a really great time for us because we are seeing our transit 
programs expand, and if everything goes right, demand will increase as well," 
said Mary Travis, transit program manager for the Transportation Commission. 
"With these new programs, we will be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Car pools and city buses are currently the only options for residents cutting 
down on car use. While each city in the county provides some sort of public 
transit, most buses run once an hour on limited routes and provide no way to 
get from one city to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Interconnect, a commuter bus that runs from the county government center 
in Ventura to The Oaks Mall in Thousand Oaks, provides cross-county service. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a die-hard public transit fan like Chuntz is quick to criticize the 
current system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mess," Chuntz said. "You've really got to know what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes Chuntz an hour by bus to get to Camarillo City Hall from her home in 
Leisure Village. By car, the trip takes about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 To visit her children in the San Fernando Valley, Chuntz uses a complicated 
system of buses, taxis and airport shuttles that she devised herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way you can get around is if you plan days in advance," Chuntz said. 
"And don't even think of going anywhere on Sunday, unless you feel like 
walking. It's a system only a true fan of public transit could love." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes for VISTA 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials are hoping the new countywide bus service called Ventura 
Intercity Service Transit Authority, or VISTA, will fill in some of the gaps 
and prompt more residents to take the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 VISTA is meant to supplement city bus services by providing buses that will 
link cities throughout the county, either with hourly scheduled service or 
Dial-A-Ride programs that pick up residents at their homes and take them to the 
nearest bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Four VISTA routes will connect every city in the county except Ojai. VISTA 
will provide bus service for the first time to Point Mugu Naval Air Station, 
Camarillo State Hospital and business parks in Camarillo, Newbury Park and Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The service, which will cost an estimated $600,000 a year, will be funded for 
the first two years with a special federal grant for pilot projects. After 
that, if VISTA is successful, the cities and the county will have to come up 
with the money to continue the service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Commission estimates that VISTA will attract 600 riders a 
day system-wide. 
</P>
<P>
 But some city and county leaders wonder whether anyone will actually use the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the skeptics is county Supervisor Vicky Howard, chairwoman of the 
Transportation Commission. Howard voted in favor of VISTA, but said she does 
not think it will lure drivers from their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not optimistic about it," Howard said. "What may happen is that people 
who aren't able to get around now will be able to get around, but I don't see 
people giving up their cars for the bus." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if an underused, 3-month-old temporary shuttle service from Thousand 
Oaks to the Moorpark Metrolink station is any indication, transit officials are 
facing an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 earthquake, the Thousand Oaks City Council received federal 
funding to run a temporary shuttle from The Oaks Mall to the Moorpark Metrolink 
station, a route that will be taken over by VISTA in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 10 passengers a day ride the full-size coach, which makes two round 
trips in the morning and two in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But Travis, the commission transit manager, insists that VISTA will be 
different. The commission is planning an aggressive marketing campaign, 
complete with discounts and free rides, to familiarize residents with the 
service and encourage them to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 "A big part of the problem is that people who aren't used to taking the bus 
don't even know the service exists," Travis said. "We're really going to try to 
let people know it's here, it's convenient and it's easy to use." 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders, however, say they are nervous that they will be forced to pick 
up the cost of continuing VISTA service after the federal money runs out. 
</P>
<P>
 They point to a recent decision by the transportation commission to continue 
Metrolink service to Oxnard and Camarillo at least until the summer of 1995 -- 
nine months after federal funding ends. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission agreed to start the service to help ease congestion after the 
earthquake, believing it could be discontinued in October, when funding from 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency runs out. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the May commission meeting, Executive Director Ginger Gherardi told the 
panel that the county is obligated to continue Metrolink service to Oxnard and 
Camarillo because the service is taking in enough money to meet state 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The county and the cities of Thousand Oaks, Ventura and Oxnard challenged that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a meeting earlier this month, the commission reaffirmed its plan, after 
Gherardi told them that for the first year of service, the county would only be 
required to pay a fraction of the actual cost of service to the two stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising Rail Cost 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the commission will borrow the $1.6 million needed to pay for 
Metrolink service for the next fiscal year, including stops in Simi Valley, 
Moorpark, Camarillo and Oxnard. The money will come from the county's emergency 
highway call-box program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are robbing Peter to pay Paul," said Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank 
Schillo, who also serves on the commission. "It's no way to run a 
transportation program." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo and other commissioners are also concerned about the rising cost of 
Metrolink service. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink operates in an area composed of Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San 
Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, representatives from each county, acting as the Southern 
California Regional Rail Authority, determine how much each county pays for 
Metrolink service. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the authority decided to double Ventura County's share, from 
$800,000 to $1.6 million. They also agreed that the county has not been paying 
its fair share for service for the past two years, and decided to levy an 
additional $1.6 million for services rendered. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Councilman Bill Davis, who represents Ventura County on the rail 
authority, is negotiating to reduce the county's share. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is also joining with several other counties in asking for an 
audit of the authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really feel these numbers are inflated," said Davis, said who also sits on 
the Transportation Commission. "But the fact of the matter is, Metrolink is 
going to cost a whole lot more than we thought." 
</P>
<P>
 As the cost for Metrolink service soars, no new transportation money is 
available to pay for the trains. 
</P>
<P>
 So Metrolink backers are looking to fuel the costly commuter rail service with 
the same pot of dollars cities use to run local bus lines and make road 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in July, 1995, the cities of Oxnard and Ventura, which have the 
largest bus-riding populations in the county, may be forced to cough up part of 
the cost for Metrolink by dipping into their bus funds or competing with other 
city services for general fund money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County, like many other counties, is going to have to face the very 
basic question of buses versus rail," says William Fulton, an independent 
researcher and urban planner based in Ventura.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unless the funding picture changes dramatically, there are going to be some 
awful fights over whether money goes to poor people who ride the bus or rich 
people who ride the train." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest loser could be South Coast Area Transit, or SCAT, the county's 
largest provider of city bus service. SCAT serves Oxnard, Ventura, Port 
Hueneme, Santa Paula and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old agency recorded more than 2.8 million passenger boardings last 
year, said Maureen Hooper Lopez, director of planning and marketing. Seven 
smaller city bus companies provide service in the rest of the county, picking 
up an additional 1 million passengers a year. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, a year of Metrolink service, including the Camarillo and Oxnard 
stations, provides about 145,000 passenger rides in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "With trains and countywide buses going for a piece of the funding pie, it's 
going to be more and more difficult for us to get our share," Lopez said. 
"There are going to have to be some major policy decisions about what is truly 
effective in cutting pollution and moving passengers." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Hidalgo, a spokesman for Metrolink, said ridership on the trains needs 
time to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "History has shown that as time goes on, more people become aware of and 
interested in Metrolink service," Hidalgo said. "After a while you see families 
moving to places that are near the train and planning their lives around the 
train." 
</P>
<P>
 Half-Cent Tax Proposal 
</P>
<P>
 Others are critical of the priority given to Metrolink, a suburban rail 
service that caters to white-collar commuters at the expense of city bus 
services whose riders mainly are poor, elderly or disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a survey conducted by the rail authority, the typical Metrolink 
rider is a white, 40-year-old professional with an annual income of more than 
$60,000. The average SCAT rider is nonwhite, over age 50 and makes less than 
$15,000 a year, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Government subsides pay about $1.46 per SCAT rider, Lopez said. Metrolink 
estimates its per-rider subsidy at $6.80. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura City Manager John Baker, who is leaving his post in July, told the 
commissioners at their May meeting that continued funding for Metrolink could 
jeopardize city services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question my successor and the city of Ventura will be faced with is 
whether to pay for police and fire or the bus," Baker said. "Because that is 
where it will come from if you continue to fund Metrolink." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to attack the funding problem, the commission later this month will 
consider recommending to the Board of Supervisors that a half-cent sales tax 
measure for transportation be placed on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar initiative put before the voters four years ago and touted as a way 
to bring Metrolink to Ventura County failed by a 2-to-1 margin. The tax would 
have raised more than $630 million in tax revenue and matching funds to pay for 
Metrolink, road repair and other transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Without new funding, county officials agree that decisions about where to put 
limited resources are only going to get harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the transportation people are plugging the dike with their fingers and 
toes and it is barely holding," said Johnson, of the county's pollution control 
district. "The bottom line is that we are running out of money." 
</P>

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; WOMAN TO FACE TRIAL IN SEX WITH TEEN-AGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County Superior Court judge on Monday ordered a 35-year-old Thousand 
Oaks woman to stand trial for allegedly having sex with a teen-age boy more 
than once a month for 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 During a preliminary hearing, a Ventura County sheriff's detective testified 
that the victim, who is now 18, told him his sexual relationship with Gloria G. 
Goldman began in August, 1991, and continued until several months ago.The boy 
said they often had sex twice a week, Sheriff's Detective Bob LeMay testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations surfaced after the boy confided in a man LeMay described as a 
spiritual counselor. The counselor then called the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy told LeMay that his sexual relationship with Goldman, whom he called 
Gigi, continued even when her family vacationed with his. The boy alleged that 
he had intercourse with her on trips to Big Bear, Lake Powell, Utah and 
Disneyland, LeMay testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The detective also testified that the boy's mother recently told him that the 
boy had recanted his allegations. But LeMay said he had not spoken to the boy 
about that. 
</P>
<P>
 Another teen-age boy, who occasionally cleaned Goldman's pool, testified 
Monday that he had never had a sexual relationship with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman is scheduled to be arraigned in Superior Court on June 27. She remains 
free in lieu of $10,000 bail. She faces 11 counts of a lewd act upon a child, 
18 counts of oral copulation and two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; REALTORS HONOR POSTERS FOR FAIR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the sixth year in a row, a Simi Valley realtors group is honoring local 
youths who designed posters advocating fair housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley-Moorpark Assn. of Realtors awarded cash prizes of up to $200 
to seven Simi Valley youths whose posters depict the contest's theme of equal 
housing regardless of race, religion, sex, age or disability. 
</P>
<P>
 First-place winners are Simi Valley High School senior Amie Chessen, 17; 
Hillside Junior High School freshman Ryan Cramer, 15, and Pine Crest Elementary 
School sixth-grader Kristin Polanski, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Amie, who has won first place twice before, said she plans to pursue art 
studies when she graduates from high school this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The funny thing is, I'm a procrastinator," said Amie, who created her winning 
entry with oil-based colored pencils in about six hours the night before the 
contest deadline. "The idea just came to me, and it didn't take that long to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who created his winning poster using an air brush, plans to teach the 
technique at a Simi Valley arts supply store this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really cool what you can do with air brush," Ryan said. "I'm still 
experimenting with new ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin said she has already signed up to take Ryan's class. The winning 
posters will be sold by the realtors group in a silent auction.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PROGRAM REWARDS CHILDREN FOR READING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's libraries on Monday kicked off their annual summer reading 
program, one of the few services for young readers that remain in the county 
after severe budget cuts in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who sign up for the summer reading program receive gold stickers or 
other small rewards for every five books they have read between Monday and Aug. 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's purpose, organizers said, is to encourage children to crack open 
a book during summer vacation instead of gluing their eyes to a television set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Summertime is an in-between time for many children when they lose their 
reading skills because they're not doing it every day," said Julie Albright, a 
children's library services technician for the county's Library Services 
Agency.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the program has no age limit, most participants are from kindergarten 
age through fifth grade.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Library Services Agency runs the local libraries in 
Ventura, Camarillo, Ojai, Oak View, El Rio, Simi Valley, Port Hueneme, Moorpark 
and Piru. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; STEREO SHOP OWNER SUSPECT IN ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Reseda stereo store owner was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to commit 
armed robberies at two stereo equipment stores in Simi Valley and Irvine, Simi 
Valley detectives said Monday . 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Barish , 35, of Chatsworth posted bail Monday at Ventura County Jail 
and is scheduled to be arraigned in Ventura County Superior Court on Friday, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Police Detective Tom Marshall said investigators focused on Barish 
as a suspect because he was seen by employees in both stores several days 
before they were robbed in February and May. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street from Barish's stereo store in Reseda is a U-Haul company 
that loaned out trucks to Barish on the days the robberies occurred, Marshall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives served search warrants at Barish's house and business on Friday and 
recovered some of the $110,000 worth of stereo equipment stolen from both 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall said investigators do not believe Barish was actually involved in the 
robberies that took place Feb. 3 at Hi Fonics Corp. in Simi Valley and on May 
27 at Advanced Marketing and Distributors of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall said, "He didn't do the actual robbery. We feel he cased the joints 
and rented the U-Hauls for the robberies." PEGGY Y. LEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY RETHINKS FEE HIKE FOR 
LANDSCAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to the anger of Thousand Oaks residents who face a 10% increase in 
fees charged for city landscaping in front of their homes, council members have 
agreed to search for creative ways to reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The fees, which are charged to 11,000 Thousand Oaks households for gardening 
and landscaping work performed by city employees, are scheduled to be increased 
from $128.92 to $141.72 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the proposed increase was announced, the city has received 77 letters 
protesting the hike. 
</P>
<P>
 One resident who spoke against the rate change at last week's City Council 
meeting called the increase "unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how any government office can present an increase of this size," 
resident Ed Greenwood said. "We don't have an endless supply of money. The city 
has got to go back and see how it can be done for less." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they were not satisfied with the city's effort to 
minimize the price increase. City staff had already reduced the proposed 
increase from 19% to about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't think it's reasonable," Councilman Frank Schillo said. "I think 
we can come up with some creative ways to handle this." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo suggested that the city look into the fiscal effects of trimming trees 
and mowing medians less frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Works Director Don Nelson said last week that his staff was working to 
further reduce the cost increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going through all the numbers to make certain there's nothing there 
that couldn't be eliminated," Nelson said. "But a lot of the increase has to do 
with a rise in water and labor costs, and I'm not sure there's much we can do 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said the final proposal will come to the council next Tuesday, when the 
panel is scheduled to vote on new fees. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; 100 EVACUATED AFTER 500-GALLON AMMONIA LEAK

<P>
 Nearly 500 gallons of ammonia was spilled at an Oxnard company Monday morning, 
causing the evacuation of about 100 people, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt by the spill, which occurred about 7:45 a.m. at Boscovich 
Farms at 711 Diaz Ave.The company freezes fruits and vegetables and uses large 
amounts of ammonia in the refrigeration process, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 An employee who was draining oil from a 500-gallon ammonia tank inhaled a big 
dose of fumes from ammonia leaking from the tank and left without closing the 
valve, said Oxnard Fire Battalion Chief Terry McAnally 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the ammonia leaked out and formed a large cloud that prompted 
many nearby businesses to call authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Police closed off about half a dozen streets while firefighters evacuated 
about 100 employees at Boscovich Farms and nearby businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ammonia is a hazardous, flammable material that attacks mucous membranes and 
sinuses, McAnally said. Firefighters simply allowed the spill to evaporate, 
McAnally said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they left after three hours at the site, all of the ammonia had 
evaporated, and employees were allowed to go back to work, he said. PEGGY Y.

<P>
 Two men were arrested Monday on suspicion of stabbing a 17-year-old Camarillo 
youth at a Camarillo restaurant, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Joey Allejo, was in fair condition Monday afternoon at Ventura 
County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The two suspects, Joseph McKeen, 20, of Oxnard and Michael Lowe, 30, of Port 
Hueneme were being held Monday on $250,000 bail each at Ventura County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 2:30 a.m. Monday when Allejo got into an argument 
with McKeen, Lowe and another man outside the Denny's Restaurant at 1659 E. 
Daily Drive.  
</P>
<P>
 The fight escalated when one of the men got a knife from his car, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allejo, with the three men in pursuit, then ran into the restaurant, past 
diners and into the kitchen, where he was stabbed several times in front of at 
least three witnesses, detectives said. One of the men Allejo was arguing with 
was found at the scene and arrested but later released. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two men fled the restaurant but were found after a brief search of 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Monday they did not know what triggered the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeen and Lowe are scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday. PEGGY Y. LEE

 An Oxnard man who was shot at a friend's house was killed by a shot fired 
through the kitchen window, Oxnard police detectives announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But no suspect or motive has been identified in the slaying of Ricardo 
Gonzales, 38, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales was visiting friends in the 200 block of Clara Street when he was 
shot Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators on Monday said evidence suggests that the killer was standing 
outside the house and fired through a kitchen window, hitting Gonzales in the 
upper torso. Police had no information on whether Gonzales was the intended 
target of the bullet. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SETTLEMENT REVEALED IN DUNES TOXICS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard Dunes residents, who had sought as much as $100 million to compensate 
them for homes built atop a toxic dump, received a total of only $306,000 in a 
1993 settlement with the city of Oxnard, according to court records unsealed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the 175 residents fared better with the city than did the five 
remaining plaintiffs, who took their case against the developer before a jury a 
year later. In February, a Ventura County jury awarded damages to only one 
homeowner, but those have yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Before backing out of the seven-year lawsuit, Oxnard put $1.3 million toward 
attorneys' fees, said Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig. 
</P>
<P>
 "You decide whether it's worth rolling the dice and whether it's worth paying 
all the attorney fees," Gillig said. "We decided we would not roll the dice and 
walk away from the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners filed suit in 1987, two years after learning that their homes 
had been built on land once used to dump oil-field waste. State health 
officials found no dangerous level of contaminants, but residents said the 
publicity had ruined property values in the subdivision off Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillig said attorneys were leery that Dunes plaintiffs would sue for decreased 
property values and emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, the jury agreed with the homeowners that the developer, Oxnard 
Shores Co., had been negligent in selling them the property. But, except for 
one case, the panel ruled that the developer's negligence had not damaged 
property values. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the other homeowners settled with the developer before the trial began. 
Court records on that settlement remain sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oxnard case, $80,000 of the $306,000 settlement was paid by insurance 
companies, Gillig said. The bulk of the legal fees were also covered, although 
the city is now suing Hartford Insurance Co. for further payments. PHYLLIS W.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL WANTS DUMP MEASURE OFF BALLOT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura City Council members voted Monday to oppose the Weldon Canyon landfill 
initiative, which will ask voters in November whether a 551-acre garbage dump 
should be built between Ventura and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 The city may also join Ojai and Ventura County in legally challenging the 
ballot measure.Voting 6 to 0, City Council members asked the Ventura city 
attorney to investigate the ramifications of such a challenge. Councilman Jack 
Tingstrom was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai City Council members have threatened to sue to stop the ballot measure. 
Three of the five county supervisors, including those representing Ojai and 
Ventura, also say they oppose the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 However, leaders in other cities, including the west county cities of Oxnard 
and Camarillo, say they will vote to support the November ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Landfill opponents say it would pollute the air in the west county and 
discourage residents from pursuing progressive recycling efforts by making it 
too easy to dump their trash. They also claim it could prove so huge that the 
operators would have to ship in trash from Los Angeles County just to break 
even. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the initiative dismiss many of the landfill opponents' 
objections as mere scare tactics designed to slough the trash problem off their 
shoulders onto someone else's. 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue, they say, is that with the Bailard Landfill in Oxnard reaching 
capacity, there will soon be nowhere left for the county's western cities to 
dump their non-recyclables. CONSTANCE SOMMER

SUSPECT CALLS SHOOTING ACCIDENTAL; PORT HUENEME: GRAND JURY REPORT SAYS TIMOTHY 
EDWARD CHRESTMAN GAVE SEVERAL ACCOUNTS OF HOW ANDY LEE ANDERSON DIED AT A 
REMOTE CAMPGROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The alleged killer of a Simi Valley man gave police a half-dozen accounts of 
the March slaying, saying first that he witnessed the crime and finally 
insisting that he accidentally shot Andy Lee Anderson, according to grand jury 
testimony made public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In his final account, Timothy Edward Chrestman told investigators he was about 
to clean his shotgun at a remote Rose Valley campground when he accidentally 
pulled the trigger, striking Anderson from about 60 feet away, according to a 
transcript of the grand jury hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman, of Port Hueneme, said he then purposely shot Anderson's Australian 
shepherd, Sheila, because the dog tried to bite him as he opened the door of 
Anderson's truck to drive away. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman's statements were summarized during four days of testimony last 
month before the Ventura County grand jury. The proceeding led to an indictment 
charging Chrestman with murder, robbery, cruelty to an animal and a special 
circumstance that could send him to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chrestman's first account of the shooting, he told detectives he was 
fishing and heard a loud shot, then saw "two male Hispanics" standing near 
Anderson's car. In a second version, Chrestman said a high school acquaintance 
had killed Anderson after having words with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Chrestman told detectives he shot Anderson by accident. But he still 
gave several versions that included details about going shooting and fishing 
with Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Frawley, who is prosecuting the case, told the 
grand jury that Chrestman was a depressed, habitual liar who killed the 
24-year-old Anderson to steal his truck.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is no other motive but robbery," Frawley told grand jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy who is supposedly freaked out after accidentally killing someone . . . 
is that same person going to shoot a dog just because he thinks the dog might 
bite him?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman's father, Edward, told the grand jurors his son had been anxious to 
leave Oxnard and go to Florida or San Diego to find work in sportfishing. The 
day before he left to go camping, Chrestman had broken into his parents' home 
and stolen a pair of binoculars, which he later sold to a pawnshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman is scheduled to be arraigned in Superior Court on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other witnesses who appeared before the grand jury last month testified about 
ballistics evidence linking an expended shotgun shell to Chrestman's shotgun. 
The shell was found at the Middle Lions campground, where Anderson's body was 
dumped in some foliage and where Chrestman had been camping. 
</P>
<P>
 And, witnesses said, tests showed the shot was fired from a distance of 144 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley said if the shooting had truly been an accident, Chrestman would not 
have manually ejected the shell in order to load another one into the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson died after being struck once in the back. Fragments of the slug 
punctured his heart and severed his aorta. Anderson's dog was shot four times 
inside the truck cab. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities identified Chrestman as a suspect after Anderson's blue truck was 
found abandoned in West Hollywood in the early hours of March 6. On the seat 
inside lay Chrestman's wallet with identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, Chrestman called his father to ask him to come pick him up on 
Pacific Coast Highway. Sheriff's detectives were at the house during the call 
and followed Edward Chrestman until he spotted his son walking near Zuma Beach.

AUDIT OF BOOKSTORE SHOWS MAJOR LOSSES; FINANCES: REPORT CALLS ACCOUNTING 
PRACTICES AT OXNARD COLLEGE INADEQUATE. NO ONE IS ACCUSED OF INTENTIONAL 
IMPROPRIETIES. 
</P>

 The Oxnard College bookstore has lost tens of thousands of dollars during the 
current academic year, but auditors say incomplete records have thwarted their 
effort to piece together the paper trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Community College District ordered the audit in January 
after it became apparent that numbers provided by the bookstore for the second 
half of 1993 did not match its ending balance from the first half of that year. 
</P>
<P>
 A summary of the audit, released by district officials on Monday, said the 
bookstore failed to keep track of how much money was due in accounts 
receivable, how much was owed to employees, and whether the store was making or 
losing money. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one has been accused of any intentional improprieties, the audit 
summary says: "It is not reasonable that the above noted condition of the 
bookstore records would have resulted purely out of an unintentional ignorance 
of accounting procedures. Controls which are basic to any accounting system 
were not implemented." 
</P>
<P>
 While the audit summary suggests that bookstore manager Sharon Davies should 
have known the accounting practices were inadequate, district officials said 
Monday that they are not sure that Davies did anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "This report doesn't reflect missing money," said Comptroller Sue Johnson. "We 
don't know that there is or there isn't any (money missing)." 
</P>
<P>
 The auditors "are saying that the records clearly should have been in better 
condition than they were," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to auditors, the bookstore lost as much as $183,000 in the six-month 
period ending Dec. 31, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But, the audit said, those operating losses could be lowered by uncollected 
accounts receivable of up to $40,000. Also, Johnson said, an inventory 
conducted last week showed the bookstore has about $100,000 more in merchandise 
than the auditors estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said it is too early to be more specific, but she estimated that the 
losses probably will turn out to be less than $50,000 over the six months. But 
she acknowledged that both the Ventura and Moorpark college bookstores are 
money-making enterprises, and the Oxnard College store should have posted a 
better performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether an operation loses or makes money does not mean wrongdoing," Johnson 
said. "It merely means it may not have been managed properly." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies said Monday that further review of her managerial practices would prove 
she has done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been an employee with the Ventura County Community College District for 
22 years," said Davies. "I have always loved my job and when all of the facts 
are in place, I will be exonerated." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies referred further questions to her lawyer, Beverly Hills attorney David 
C. Bernstein, who said his client has always received positive job performance 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein also said district officials have failed to provide him copies of 
the various reports he has requested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's suspicious that the district, for reasons of its own, has 
elected not to release the documents on which it bases these allegations," 
Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inventory taken of the bookstore shows absolutely no loss or shrinkage," 
he said. "Everything is accounted for." 
</P>
<P>
 But the audit describes an accounting system that lists a disbursement book 
$20,000 out of balance and cash registers that were closed out only 38 times 
over six months, while common retail practice calls for daily summaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our opinion, this is a material weakness in the internal control 
structure," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also criticizes Davies for failing to correct the accounting errors prior 
to the independent audit and for failing to seek assistance in balancing the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 "The above findings and the state of records we observed, at a minimum, 
disclose negligence in maintaining the financial records of the Oxnard College 
Bookstore," the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees discussed Davies and the bookstore audit in closed session at a 
meeting last week of the governing board. A decision on potential disciplinary 
actions is scheduled to be announced at a special budget meeting next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein said he and Davies are considering legal action against the college 
district and the accounting firm for "what appears to be truly outrageous 
conduct" in releasing the audit report without more facts. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit comes in the midst of a projected $3-million shortfall in the 
college district's budget for the upcoming fiscal year. In addition, a dozen or 
more members of the college and district staffs have been called before the 
Ventura County grand jury in recent weeks to testify about the district's 
fiscal condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the grand jury is looking into possible financial improprieties, 
but they would not elaborate. The 1993-'94 grand jury report is due out July 1.

BANKER GETS 18-MONTH PRISON TERM; FRAUD: THE DIRECTOR OF A NOW-DEFUNCT THOUSAND 
OAKS BANK IS SENTENCED FOR MAKING FALSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- THE LATEST 
CHAPTER IN A LONG HISTORY OF LEGAL TROUBLES. 
</P>

<P>
 A federal judge on Monday sentenced financier Olen Boyce Phillips, the former 
director of the United Community Bank in Thousand Oaks, to 18 months in prison 
for misrepresenting his debts on loan applications and in bank statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, 54, pleaded guilty last April to making a false entry into the 
records of the now-defunct Thousand Oaks bank in 1989. He also pleaded guilty 
to submitting a false financial statement to obtain a personal loan from 
Charter Pacific Bank of Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges were originally part of a 12-count indictment filed in 1993 by a 
grand jury in Los Angeles, which accused Phillips and his banking partner, 
Phillip L. Chase, of fully understanding their debts when filing for loans with 
banks in Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Both men initially claimed to have 
greatly underestimated their debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips and his attorney could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Community Bank was shut down in 1989 for lack of funds, and it has 
since cost taxpayers a total of more than $9 million to cover its federally 
insured accounts, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the prison sentence, U.S. District Court Judge William D. 
Keller ordered Phillips, known as O.B., to pay $190,000 in restitution to 
Charter Pacific Bank and Larry and Wanda Thomas, who had borrowed money from 
the United Community Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase pleaded guilty to one count of federal bank fraud last April, and was 
sentenced to two years of probation, 200 hours of community service and a 
$5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's sentence was the result of a separate probe by the FBI, triggered by 
the failure of Westlake Thrift, a subsidiary of United Community Bank. That 
probe led to the convictions of six business people for bank fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The liquidation of Westlake Thrift cost taxpayers about $6 million, according 
to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal jury last December acquitted Chase of one count of filing false 
documents, but deadlocked on eight other counts against him and Phillips, 
forcing a mistrial in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The mistrial set the stage for a retrial last March, including additional 
charges that were filed after further FBI investigation, but Chase and Phillips 
pleaded guilty to some of the charges last April, and the rest were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's sentencing was the latest chapter in a long history of legal problems 
for Phillips starting in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the largest fraud cases in county history, Phillips and Charles 
Francoeur, 37, were charged in 1992 with defrauding 21 real estate investors 
out of about $2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Phillips was subsequently convicted of only one of the 81 counts of 
grand theft he had faced, a Ventura County judge in May issued a $5.1-million 
judgment against Phillips in a civil suit related to the same Thousand Oaks 
real estate deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips will probably serve his sentence in Texas, where he now resides, 
according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Brent A. Whittlesey.

WHITE WAS INACCURATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the May 20 edition of The Times, Superior Court candidate Colleen Toy White 
expressed concern about the validity of the recent poll conducted by the 
Ventura County Bar Assn. The survey, which was directed to all attorneys in 
Ventura County, favored her opponent, James M. Farley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. White stated in an interview that she expected the results because a 
"large number of the (bar) members make their careers defending criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 That was an inaccurate assumption. The survey was directed to nearly 1,400 
attorneys, not just those identified as belonging to the Bar Assn. In fact, the 
Ventura County Criminal Defense Bar Assn., which represents most criminal 
defense attorneys in the county, reports that it has only 93 active members.

WELDON DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the article, "Writer Pens Critique of County Project," urban 
planner-essayist William Fulton argues for creating strong individual 
communities, stating that "communities need to be self-contained on the 
neighborhood level, yet connected in an effective way to the rest of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot reconcile this understanding of our basic human need to feel 
connected to our cities and our county with Mr. Fulton's support of the 
proposed dump in Weldon Canyon.He suggests the dump should be approved because 
"You can get riled up about saving one canyon, but if we're going to generate 
trash, we have to figure out how to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Fulton, we have a way to deal with trash; the recycling centers being 
built in Oxnard and Ventura. Moreover, an ill-advised, unwanted and outdated 
dump, which -- to be economically viable- -- will have to import millions of 
tons of garbage from outside the county, directly threatens the "sense of 
place" that Fulton hollowly praises. Furthermore, it strikes me as antithetical 
to Fulton's "vision" to pit the different cities of Ventura County against each 
other (a tactic, by the way, being employed by the out-of-county corporation 
bankrolling the Weldon Dump initiative). 
</P>
<P>
 I urge Mr. Fulton to get out of his ivory tower and visit Ojai and Weldon 
Canyon on a beautiful day when the air is scented with orange blossoms. He'll 
see that we already have a sense of place, and that we do care about our 
community, and our neighbors in the Ventura County area.

FLYNN PRAISED FOR METROLINK CONNECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to commend Supervisor John K. Flynn for his efforts in bringing 
the Metrolink as an alternate mode of transportation to Oxnard. Mass transit 
not only provides safe and comfortable transportation, it promises that the 
world our children inherit will be cleaner because each of us has made a 
conscious decision to care about the future.Flynn's leadership on Metrolink 
demonstrated his commitment to our children and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Many critics of Metrolink cite the expense we now must incur for operating 
costs and the impact this will have on the road repairs. I agree that potholes 
must be filled. However, it is necessary that local city and county agencies 
allocate funds more efficiently and spend less money on studies which do not 
necessarily impact the public's welfare as Metrolink does. This does not need 
to be an all or nothing equation. I hope that other elected officials will 
emulate Flynn's example and think about our future needs and not what's 
politically expedient.

PARENTING EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As one follows the news on television and in the newspapers, it is difficult 
not to be saddened and frustrated by ever increasing street violence and the 
many other problems that threaten society today and in the future. There are 
problems with the widespread development of gangs, with poor school attendance, 
drugs, teen pregnancy, lack of respect for law and authority in general, lack 
of respect for property and the rights of others, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Public schools are charged with the education of our children to prepare them 
to be productive members of society. Along with better teaching techniques, the 
current emphasis for change in high schools is on academics: more math, 
science, geography, etc.; and on more vocational preparation. No public high 
school in Ventura County requires training in "parenting skills" as a 
requirement for graduation. Academic and vocational training are both necessary 
and should be continued. However, considering the number of teen pregnancies 
after marriage, pregnancies through laboratory techniques, adoptions by couples 
or by single men or single women, etc., one of the things we can be absolutely 
sure of is that almost all of our young people will become parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, whether or not they become effective parents may well depend on 
what they learn in school. Providing young people with the skills for effective 
parenting should be a major goal of every high school.

ELIMINATE BIAS ON ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your May 21 issue was an article describing a car-bicycle collision which 
stated, "CHP officers have not yet decided whether to cite a Newbury Park woman 
who crossed over double yellow lines on Potrero Road in Newbury Park and struck 
a bicyclist, critically injuring him." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was passing another car on a curve, crossed double yellow lines and 
critically injured a bicyclist (he lost a kidney, suffered broken bones and 
damage to vital organs, according to your article) and the CHP doesn't know 
whether to issue a citation? 
</P>
<P>
 If I may offer a suggestion to the CHP: Get over your bias about cyclists 
because the vehicle code gives us the right and responsibilities of a motor 
vehicle, remember that the same code states it is against the law to cross a 
double yellow line and get out that citation book and start writing. I presume 
a citation would have been written if she had collided with another motor 
vehicle under those same conditions.

DEAF IN SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was with interest and a sense of frustration that I read your article on 
the "Dilemmas of the Deaf" by Maia Davis in the May 23 edition of your paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Deaf children are not "handicapped" by their deafness, they are "handicapped" 
by their lack of language. As only a small percentage of a young child's 
education takes place at school, and as a residential school is not a realistic 
option for most lower-elementary school age deaf children, they must have 
communication outside of the classroom, with the family. It is this lack of 
communication, and not a flaw in the local public schools, that sends many deaf 
children away from school with less than their hearing classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 As the mother of a 6-year-old deaf first-grader at Loma Vista School, I have 
seen first hand the difference between those children who have two-way 
communication with their families and those who do not. Deafness, in and of 
itself, does not make all deaf children the same. There is no one answer to the 
educational needs of all deaf children. They are individuals, have different 
needs, abilities, interests and developmental levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Going to Loma Vista School allows my son to live within a few miles of his 
school. It enables me to have ongoing contact with his school, to volunteer 
there and to be on the PTA board. He plays Little League and soccer with his 
Loma Vista classmates. On the weekends and after school, he plays with his 
school friends, both deaf and hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year he will be mainstreamed full time. This, for our family, was never a 
"goal." It was a decision based on his needs. There will never be any one 
"perfect" answer, but local public schools are not the poor choice that your 
article implies. To further imply that those of us who choose to send our 
children there do so because we want less for our children is wrong and it is 
unfair.

 Hip-hop performer Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes of the group TLC is accused of burning 
down the mansion of her boyfriend, Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Andre Rison, 
and trashing two of his cars. Comedy writer Tony Peyser reports that a 
spokesman for Lopes said the incident "was unfortunate, but will make a really 
cool video." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno says it started out as a small fire, but that the firemen were all 
preoccupied -- reading Playboy. He added that many think Lopes overreacted to 
Rison's staying out all night: "Even Shannen Doherty is saying, 'Take it easy, 
girl.' "

 Peyser, on Arkansas trooper Danny Lee Ferguson insisting that Paula Jones

</P>

<P>
By COLIN McENROE, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been trying lately to figure out who among the people I know has been 
abducted by aliens, meddled with and put back. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a wide circle of friends. I don't think I boast when I say that my 
friends are the sort of people aliens would find interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Many friends are attractive and full of vitality, and those aliens who are 
engaged in breeding human beings or hybrid species -- which goes on a lot, 
according to the latest accounts -- would be foolish to turn up their noses (if 
they have noses) at my friends who do (nice ones, mostly). 
</P>
<P>
 It will be suggested that I have loads of friends who have been abducted, who 
have spent well-recollected hours in some of the nicer pods, who have been 
given haircuts or been harvested in more deeply stirring ways. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be suggested that my friends don't tell me, because it is bad manners 
to burden another soul with long-winded stories involving probes. 
</P>
<P>
 My friends do have very nice manners. 
</P>
<P>
 But my experience is that if you hang around long enough people will tell you 
anything. If you stay late enough at parties, you will hear people confess to 
the hostess, loudly, levels of hatred or love for the hostess that would seem 
to require the summoning, at minimum, of a constable or nurse practitioner. 
</P>
<P>
 If you look people in the eye, they will tell you of inappropriately intense 
relationships with Venetian blinds or pressure washers. They will confess 
theological beliefs that require a larger participation in the business of the 
universe by Marvin Hamlisch than he is actually believed to have. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, I am trying to think of something nobody has ever told me or at least 
told someone who told me. In that latter category belongs a story that makes me 
think large trout can have more surprising lives than I had ever imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody has ever, ever, when the Gewurztraminer bottle is down to the 
little crystalline structures you subsequently wish you'd poured onto the 
grass, said to me: 
</P>
<P>
 "Funny thing. Last summer, one afternoon, I'm out on the mower. Have I showed 
you the new one? Briggs & Stratton, 12.5 horse, shift-on-the-go, it's a beauty. 
Anyway, long story short. This blue light comes down, shuts off the mower, 
lifts me up in the air, I'm flying like a sonofagun. I wind up inside this huge 
lime-green butler's table. And these little guys strap me down, open up the top 
of my head, do some stuff there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then there's this whole thing like -- remember Steve Moore's bachelor party? 
-- it was sort of like that, but in a more sterile environment. At one point, I 
said, 'Hey fellas, does my CIGNA cover all this?' Anyway, next thing, I'm back 
home, in the house, the Sox are up 5-3, Hesketh grooves one to Buhner and 
that's that." 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that game." 
</P>
<P>
 "Two weeks later, this thing falls out of my nose. Here, I got it with me. 
That part's a highly compressed carbon compound and the little filaments are 
glass and amino acids. I found out if I put it near the TV set, it unscrambles 
Showtime." 
</P>
<P>
 I should have had this conversation, because these things happen all the time. 
I have been reading a new book by John Mack, a celebrated Harvard psychiatry 
professor, who started treating people who thought they were abducted and 
decided they were probably right. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you imagine the department chairman at Harvard? 
</P>
<P>
 "John, we couldn't get you interested in teaching pigeons to play Ping-Pong or 
something, could we? We still have B. F. Skinner's old stuff in the supply 
closet." 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out you may have been abducted if you can't account for hours of your 
time, have unexplained marks on your body, wake up paralyzed with a strange 
presence in the room and see puzzling lights. 
</P>
<P>
 That's my average day. Maybe I'm the guy. If so, I can stop telling my friends 
about the Venetian blinds. I'm the guy.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourth of July came early when the South County Community Clinic Auxiliary 
unfurled the stars and stripes for its 12th annual gala, "Made in the U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
 A sellout crowd of more than 450 guests, most dressed in star-spangled red, 
white and blue attire, attended the patriotic dinner/dance Friday at the 
flag-draped San Juan Capistrano estate of Arthur and Gaye Birtcher. The 
$150-per-person gala netted more than $90,000 for the clinic, which provides 
health care to the needy in Orange County. Home Sweet Home 
</P>
<P>
 American flags greeted party-goers as they arrived at the Birtcher home, a 
French chateau the couple designed themselves. The Birtchers traveled 
throughout France taking photographs of 17th-Century chateaus, then 
incorporated favorite features like towering turrets into their design. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're Francophiles at heart," said Gaye Birtcher, the event's chairwoman. 
Nevertheless, she chose the U.S.A. theme. She sported stars and stripes on her 
shirt and cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests wandered about the grounds listening to the Barbersharps Quartet and 
sampling all-American hors d'oeuvres such as Maryland crab cakes and Virginia 
ham on cornmeal biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone likes the U.S.A. theme," said Thyra Decker, event co-chairwoman. 
"You bring out the flags, and they start crying." 
</P>
<P>
 The dress code called for clothing that was made in the United States, and 
those not following the code received a fine from a posse of "All Stars" 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to cost me tonight," said Linda Berkshire, auxiliary president, 
whose navy pantsuit was not American-made but who showed her allegiance by 
sporting a stars and bars scarf. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Liuzzi, who accompanied his mother, Mary Liuzzi, dressed like Abraham 
Lincoln, complete with fake beard and top hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look like him, and I'm honest," he said. Mom and Apple Pie 
</P>
<P>
 After the reception party-goers gathered in an outdoor arena surrounded by 
trees with twinkling lights. There they bid on items in a silent auction that 
were representative of all 50 states, from a woven wrap bearing a buffalo a la 
Wyoming to a Maine lobster. 
</P>
<P>
 Tables decked with sunflowers were set up amid bales of hay and a campfire, 
where guests later had s'mores, those roasted marshmallow concoctions that are 
Scouting favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 For dinner, the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach prepared American 
specialties, serving a salad of California field greens with Oregon dried 
cranberries, grilled Montana range chicken, Minnesota wild rice with Georgia 
pecans and, of course, Granny Smith apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Party-goers spent the rest of the night stomping their boots to the sounds of 
the Diamond Back Band, with country singer (and committee member) C.D. Buchanan 
making a special appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The South County Community Clinic in San Juan Capistrano serves people who 
can't afford health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think of San Juan Capistrano with houses like these (the Birtcher home), 
but you find the hidden poor. They're there," said Dr. Thomas Bent, medical 
director of the clinic. Bent attended with his wife, Carolyn, a committee 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing more people who used to have everything -- a nice house, station 
wagon and fluffy dog -- and suddenly one person gets laid off. They're the 
nouveau poor. They've never had to seek help before. They're embarrassed and 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come to our office expecting to take a number and sit on plastic 
furniture, but it looks, feels and smells like a doctor's office should." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Walker, who has staged fund-raisers for the clinic at his Marbella Plaza 
in San Juan Capistrano, received the auxiliary's Community Leadership Award for 
his contributions.

ART / CATHY CURTIS; FUZZY WAS HE; POSTER PROVOCATEUR'S LATEST EFFORT, LACKING 
THE CLARITY OF PAST WORKS, IS A DUD LOCALLY 
</P>

 It's been a while since we had a good art scandal in Orange County. So those 
who got wind last month that poster provocateur Robbie Conal would be 
plastering unflattering images of Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, and 
former President Richard Nixon along the streets of Yorba Linda -- of all 
places! -- were waiting to watch the sparks fly. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happened, the project failed to ignite. There were very few posters on 
the streets, hardly anyone appears to have seen them, and those who did 
registered bafflement about Conal's message -- and even the identity of the 
people on the poster. 
</P>
<P>
 Other posters by Conal have raised community hackles in Los Angeles and other 
cities -- particularly the one he did of then-LAPD Chief Daryl Gates, shown 
with a shooting target superimposed on his body. Gates' quote that casual drug 
users "ought to be taken out and shot" was reproduced with the last word 
crossed out and replaced with beaten . 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dole poster was a dud, at least in Orange County. (In Los Angeles, 
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich eventually denounced it as "visual pollution" 
and asked that the artist be fined for "illegally plastering posters on private 
and governmental property." After nearly five weeks, however, no Orange County 
official has sounded off publicly on this non-event.) 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, one problem with Orange County as a poster site is purely logistic 
-- as could be seen in the days preceding last week's primary election. To 
attract drivers' attention, you really need a billboard, while the few areas 
with sufficiently dense foot traffic tend to be privately controlled spaces, 
like shopping centers, which are quick to tear down any handiwork that 
distracts from the bright, happy world of consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 On Conal's poster, large letters above Dole's head read, "NOTHING PERSONAL." 
The portrait was based on media-disseminated images of the Kansas Republican 
tearfully giving one of the eulogies at Nixon's funeral. Nixon himself appears 
with his dog Checkers in a small insert in the poster, labeled, "Richard M. 
Nixon Memorial Pet Peeve." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Dole trying to be nice, trying to show some personality and failing," 
Conal told a reporter. "Dole shedding a tear is akin to (Nixon's) Checkers 
speech and makes him heir apparent to the vacated vampire's throne." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether political or commercial in nature, a poster is a very specific genre 
that has only seconds to make an impact. Instantaneous recognition is as 
important as clarity and brevity. As it happened, however, neither I nor 
several newsaholic colleagues at The Times immediately recognized Dole's face 
on Conal's handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he is the highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, Dole hasn't 
had nearly the media exposure of Conal's other targets, which include former 
President Ronald Reagan ("Men With No Lips") and his wife, Nancy ("Women With 
Teeth"), former White House aide Oliver North ("Contra Cocaine") and 
televangelists Jim and Tammy Bakker ("False Profit")). 
</P>
<P>
 Conal's expressionistic rendering didn't help, either. Driving by (or even at 
closer range), a viewer was unlikely to notice a tear leaking from one of 
Dole's eyes. Similarly, the images of Nixon and Checkers were too small to read 
clearly from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also ill-advised to require the viewer to relate a recent event to one 
that happened 42 years ago. Several younger people I talked to were unaware of 
the "Checkers" speech, which Nixon gave before the 1952 election, when he was 
running for vice president. (To defend himself against charges that he was the 
beneficiary of an $18,000 slush fund set up by California Republicans, Nixon 
appeared on TV and acknowledged a gift he did receive -- a cocker spaniel named 
Checkers, given to his daughters by a wealthy Texan.) 
</P>
<P>
 Most peculiar was Conal's convoluted reasoning in equating a graveside speech 
from a longtime friend with Nixon's famous public pleading. Other than the fact 
that both speeches were televised, and both men were visibly moved, what is the 
connection between Nixon's calculated political gesture and Dole's low-key 
remarks? 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I'm no supporter of Dole's, whose positions on abortion and gay rights, 
the presumed powers of the United Nations and other issues run counter to my 
own. But Dole really was a friend of Nixon's, and he was speaking at a funeral, 
where the deceased's misdeeds generally go unremarked. (After Nixon's death, 
even the media did a 180-degree turn from its Woodward-and-Bernstein days and 
painted in heroic terms the only U.S. President to resign in disgrace.) Even if 
the analogy did make sense, though, Conal seems to have forgotten that he was 
making "people's art" for the streets, not work meant to be pondered at length 
by the cognoscenti in a white-walled gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He once told an art school audience that, although he has been influenced by 
such politically driven artists of the past as Honore Daumier and Francisco 
Jose de Goya, his biggest inspiration comes from the tabloids, with their 
sock-'em images and brief, screaming headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 But in "Nothing Personal," he seems to be using the tabloid form without 
following through on the utter simplicity of tabloid style. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is the great strength of conceptual art to actively involve the 
viewer in "creating" the work, a street poster has to hit fast and hard. (When 
Barbara Kruger painted a huge American flag with brief politically themed 
questions on an exterior wall of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles 
in 1990, she was well aware of the special requirement of drive-by art.) 
</P>
<P>
 Conal, who earned a master's degree in art from Stanford University, has 
studied with such respected painters as Frank Lobdell, Nathan Oliveira and Leon 
Golub, who is known for his huge images of terrorists and their victims. Had it 
not been for art dealers' lack of interest in his work, Conal probably wouldn't 
have taken it to the streets eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, however, Conal is represented by Koplin Gallery in Santa Monica 
and has shown his work in numerous group exhibitions. Four years ago he had a 
one-man show at the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be that this acceptance by the art world has caused him to lose the 
common touch, the ability to function -- as he once described himself -- as "a 
low-level irritant"? 
</P>
<P>
 Conal clearly adores media attention, and he's terrific with sound-bite 
quotes. But it's also quite possible that his fame has begun to occlude his 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe his provocations about people he feels "abuse their power in the name of 
representative democracy" would be more effective coming from an anonymous 
artist whom no one could accuse of careerism. Even Antonovich's complaint 
seemed to be primarily directed at Conal's track record as political gadfly, 
not at the content of his most recent poster. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was more than a year ago that Conal, who is 49, told an 
interviewer: "Many young people out there . . . are legitimately more angry 
than I am, and it's their turn to take this over." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a larger question of whether posters are still an artist's most 
effective means of reaching a large, non-specialist audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The heyday of the poster began in the 1860s, when the development of color 
lithography offered a cheap, eye-catching way to capture the attention of the 
urban public casting about for entertainment possibilities in an era before TV 
and film. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, the witty images of Jules Cheret and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec 
advertised singers and actresses, notably Sarah Bernhardt. Bolstered by the 
decorative serpentine line of the turn-of-the-century Art Nouveau style, poster 
art spread to Austria, the Netherlands and the United States. In the '30s, 
suave Art Deco stylization enlivened European posters for ocean liners, 
household products and cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 While the appeal of these advertising posters was driven purely by style, 
political posters at the time of the Russian Revolution offered a heady mix of 
passionate conviction, lofty theorizing and eye-catching visuals -- a vivid mix 
of typography and design. In contrast, World War I brought out sentimental and 
paternal ("Uncle Sam Needs You") imagery on the U.S. home front. 
</P>
<P>
 The poster's last big moment may have been the '60s, when psychedelic designs 
advertised rock groups and simple graphics raised public consciousness about 
injustices from war to worker exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, when posters have become little more than crass vehicles for marketing 
and merchandising, other formats may offer more promise for artists hoping to 
reach ordinary people outside art institutions with political messages that 
challenge accepted opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious ploys involve infiltrating electronic media (Conal himself has 
talked about switching into "an attack on prime time with 30-second videos"), 
electronic message boards and computer bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter what the medium, even the most outrageous artist's message has 
to be very clear and very seductive -- just like the tantalizing poster images 
of Gay Paree.

MUSIC REVIEW; ORCHESTRA LETS DOWN SINGERS IN BAROQUE FINALE 
</P>

 There can be few festivals as noble of purpose as the annual Baroque Music 
Festival Corona del Mar, which concluded its 14th season Sunday afternoon at 
St. Michael and All Angels Church. 
</P>
<P>
 As in past years, artistic director Burton L. Karson chose imaginative 
programs that sought to reveal the heart of the genre.The program book was 
beautifully printed, and the program notes were both expert and interesting. 
And this year, for the first time, the Festival Orchestra played period 
instruments, built around a core supplied by Michael Eagan's Apollo Amused 
ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 The repertoire for the finale was typically serious: Handel's urgent "Dixit 
Dominus," followed after intermission by Bach's great "Cantata No. 61" and two 
works by Alessandro Scarlatti (father of the more famous, keyboard 
sonata-composing Domenico), the endearing "Concerto Grosso No. 3" and a 
"Magnificat" that has become a Burton L. Karson specialty: The 10-minute work 
for chorus and orchestra, composed for and premiered at the Roman celebration 
of St. Cecilia's Day in 1720, received its American premiere two years ago from 
these same forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, as during the two previous festival finales, the supporting forces 
let down the steady, occasionally thrilling work of the Festival Singers. The 
orchestra scrambled to keep together and often suffered from poor intonation 
and lack of concentration. Meanwhile, among the vocal soloists, only tenor Mark 
Goodrich in the Bach deserved special mention. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert was dedicated to Dr. Helmut Weiss, a longtime patron and member of 
the festival board who died last year at age 80.

 KOCE Channel 50 in Huntington Beach is "keeping the door open" but has no firm 
plans to offer PTV, a new PBS service for children that KCET Channel 28 in Los 
Angeles will begin July 11 and that other stations are expected to pick up in 
January. KCET will be among 11 stations in the country launching the package of 
children's shows and outreach programs for parents and teachers, aimed at 
helping all kids start school "ready to learn" by the year 2000. A KOCE 
official said she is not sure when or if the channel would pick up the service, 
but she noted that the channel already offers six hours a day of instructional 
programming for students in grades K through 12.

LOCAPALOOZA, SOCCER FEST WILL ROLL INTO TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As always, grass-roots rock promoters looking for an angle are taking note of 
doings in the wider world and are jumping on the bandwagon. Hence the Rock 'n' 
Roll Soccer Fest, an evening of alternative bands at Old World in Huntington 
Beach in honor of the upcoming World Cup tournament, and Locapalooza, a daylong 
alternative rock fest in Riverside modeled after the Lollapalooza touring 
package coming to Cal State Dominguez Hills in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Voodoo Glow Skulls, the Nuckle Brothers, Gameface, Endswell and Outspoken will 
play at Soccer Fest on June 24 starting at 7:30 p.m. In keeping with the 
international flavor of the World Cup, promoter John Pantle is offering half 
off the $8 admission price to anyone who presents a foreign passport. And 
slam-dancers will be penalized for using their hands. Old World is at 7561 
Center Ave. in Huntington Beach. (714) 323-8683. 
</P>
<P>
 Locapalooza takes place Sunday from noon to midnight at the Riverside Armory 
in Fairmount Park (the California 60 freeway and Market Street). The lineup 
includes the Skeletones, Boom Shaka, Engines of Aggression, Stanford Prison 
Experiment, Sublime, Naked Soul, Sages of Memphis, Vitamin L, Kiss the Clown, 
Brother Vibe and Killing Tree. There'll also be food and craft vendors, 
information booths for nonprofit groups, and body-piercers and tattoo artists. 
Admission: $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (909) 793-9795 or (714) 740-2000 
(Ticketmaster).

 Speaking of festivals . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The WOMAD festival coming to Irvine Meadows on July 10 is the big acronymic 
concert of the summer with Primus, Midnight Oil, Arrested Development and Live 
topping a bill that stretches to encompass acts from Africa, China, 
Turkmenistan and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But FESTAC (Festival of African and Caribbean Arts & Culture) is another set 
of initials for music fans with broad tastes to consider. FESTAC Explosion '94 
takes place June 26 at the Rainbow Lagoon in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Set to appear are the Salsa Legends with Ray Baretto, Larry Harlow and Yomo 
Toro, Soca performer David Rudder, reggae singers Mutabaruka, U-Roy and Wendy 
Shaw, and African pop star Tabu Ley Rochereau and his 16-piece band from Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will run from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tickets are $18 in advance. (310) 
839-9846 (English speaking) and (310) 677-5540 (in Spanish).

 Is it too early to start scouting the rock 'n' roll rookie class of 1995? 
</P>
<P>
 One fledgling contender worth watching is Wiskey Biscuit, a band from 
Huntington Beach that recently signed a deal with Geffen Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a hometown gig at Old World a few weeks back, the six-man band's 
bluesy rock sound called to mind the gutsy music that Bob Dylan and the Rolling 
Stones were cranking out circa 1965-66. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Jason Mason (his real name, we're told) is a scrawny fellow with an 
obvious Dylan fixation. While he was a bit too introverted in performance, he 
showed magnetism and the ability to communicate both humor and wounded feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 The band played with a loose assurance as lead guitarist Jeff Cairns, a 
commanding, tasteful player, served as a strong second focal point to go with 
Mason (who contributed some strong harmonica playing). 
</P>
<P>
 The group has a well-placed mentor in Scott Weiland, the singer with Stone 
Temple Pilots; his younger brother, Michael, is Wiskey Biscuit's drummer. (The 
band will open for STP, the Meat Puppets and Redd Kross at Irvine Meadows July 
17.) 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Weiland produced a demo tape for the Biscuits, and STP's manager, former 
Orange County musician Steve Stewart, took them on as a client. Stewart says he 
played the tape for Geffen executive John David Kalodner, who offered them a 
deal on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat there with my mouth open," Stewart said. "He was so moved and affected 
by it. I knew he was committed to them," which led the band to choose Geffen 
over Atlantic (STP's label) -- which also had offered a contract. After signing 
the deal, the band members, all in their early 20s, moved to Los Angeles where 
they share a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart says plans call for July recording sessions in Austin with producer 
Paul Leary, the Butthole Surfers guitarist who produced the Meat Puppets' 
latest album. An early 1995 release is expected.

TOBACCO PITCHMAN AGREES STARS DID NOT RECEIVE GIFTS; CIGARETTES: BROWN & 
WILLIAMSON DOCUMENTS OUTLINED PAYMENTS. MIDDLEMAN SAYS INFORMATION IS BOGUS. 
</P>

<P>
 Paul Newman did not get a Mercedes. Bob Kovoloff did. 
</P>
<P>
 Kovoloff, of Encino, ran a nearly $1-million campaign in the early 1980s to 
place Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co. brands in feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 His Associated Film Promotions, then among Hollywood's most prominent 
product-placement firms, often eschewed written deals with studios, claiming to 
rely instead on lavish gifts to members of movie casts and crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on internal documents leaked from B & W to members of Congress and 
news organizations, The Times reported last month that Newman, Clint Eastwood, 
Sean Connery and Sylvester Stallone, among others, supposedly got expensive 
jewelry, cars and other items, purchased by Associated with B & W's money. 
</P>
<P>
 But those reports prompted indignant denials by some of the celebrities. And 
now, challenged on the details, Kovoloff -- a pioneer product pitchman who has 
faced dozens of lawsuits over his business dealings -- says that many of the 
goods never reached the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Connery "never got any jewelry," he said in a telephone interview last 
week. "Paul Newman never got a car. Sylvester Stallone never got a car. Clint 
Eastwood never got a car. They never got a thing from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a B & W audit in 1983 listing the gifts said it relied exclusively on 
records provided by Kovoloff's firm, Kovoloff last week called the listing 
bogus, denied furnishing the information and said he did not know where it came 
from. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion over how the money was spent was not his doing, Kovoloff insisted. 
"A lot of (stuff) could have been made up," he said. Kovoloff declined further 
comment, and did not return additional phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that Brown & Williamson set out -- years after Congress 
barred tobacco firms from advertising on television and radio -- to buy display 
for its products in motion pictures. But in selecting Kovoloff as its Hollywood 
pitchman, B & W got fewer results than it hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 The product-placement effort "in our view was a failure," acknowledged B & W 
spokesman Tom Fitzgerald. "It was not an effective use of our marketing 
dollars." Fitzgerald declined to comment on the audit -- conducted by B & W to 
ascertain how its money was being spent by Kovoloff's firm -- or on 
Associated's use of the tobacco firm's money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kovoloff, 57, is no stranger to disputes over property and money. During the 
1980s and early '90s, he and his companies faced a torrent of lawsuits from 
angry clients, landlords and employees -- a legal onslaught checked only by his 
bankruptcy filing in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * Former clients Nikon and Panasonic won court judgments of $70,000 and 
$349,000, respectively, over expensive photographic and electronic equipment 
loaned to Associated as movie props but never returned. In its defense, 
Associated claimed it was understood "that many of the products would not in 
fact be returned as that is the custom and practice in the motion picture 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 * After Pizza Inn Inc., paid a promotional fee of $100,000, the firm 
"instantly began to be unable to ever locate" Kovoloff, said Jeff Rogers, 
president of the Dallas-based chain, which was listed as a creditor in 
Kovoloff's bankruptcy filing.  
</P>
<P>
 * Florida Smoked Fish Co. filed suit against an ad agency over what it termed 
an unfulfilled promise of a movie scene in which famished patrons held hostage 
in a supermarket were to eat bagels and the company's fish products. The ad 
agency contracted for the placement with a Kovoloff firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Trumbull County Convention and Visitors Bureau in northeastern Ohio won 
a lawsuit over $35,000 it paid Associated to promote the area as a film 
location. "Nothing ever came of it. . . . We would write letters to him, place 
telephone calls, and there was no response," said Darlene Russo, administrative 
assistant for the visitors bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kovoloff and his companies also were sued repeatedly by landlords for unpaid 
rent on office space and luxury homes. "He's a deadbeat extraordinaire," said 
Ryan Martin, a leasing agent for a Van Nuys commercial landlord who repeatedly 
sued a Kovoloff firm for unpaid rent. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the odd tale of Brown & Williamson's campaign to promote its brands 
in films that has brought Kovoloff's bumpy career into focus. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 1983 audit, B & W said canceled checks and other records showed that 
Associated had used the tobacco company's funds to buy, among other things, a 
$42,307 automobile for Newman, a $22,047 car for Clint Eastwood and $12,715 in 
jewelry for Sean Connery. 
</P>
<P>
 To support the claimed gift to Newman, Associated apparently showed B & W's 
auditors a canceled check for $42,307 written to Auto Stiegler Inc., an Encino 
car dealership. But John Stiegler Jr., a spokesman for the dealership, said 
last week that a Mercedes convertible at that price was delivered to Kovoloff, 
not Newman. Kovoloff subsequently acknowledged he got the car. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kovoloff also acknowledged, Associated did not buy Clint Eastwood a car 
from Auto Stiegler, either, despite the audit record. Selling "a car to a 
celebrity . . . is a big thing to us," Stiegler said. "I would have known if 
there was any car going to Clint Eastwood."  
</P>
<P>
 As for Connery, his attorney stated that the actor did not receive any kind of 
payment for the placement of tobacco products in movies in which he performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another audit entry listed a payment of $13,000 to David Levy, described as 
"assistant producer" of the movie "Tank." But according to the filmmakers and 
credits, "Tank" did not have an assistant producer -- nor any involvement by a 
David Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the purported payment, however, Associated did pay $13,000 to a 
David L. Levy -- a real estate man who had nothing to do with the film. The 
money was for a security deposit and two months rent of a West Los Angeles 
office and warehouse building owned by Levy. The payment was cited in court 
papers in a lawsuit against Associated -- one of several Levy wound up filing 
for unpaid rent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lW documents also included an April 28, 1983, letter to Kovoloff from 
Sylvester Stallone, in which Stallone agreed for a fee of $500,000 to "use 
Brown & Williamson tobacco products in no less than five feature films." 
</P>
<P>
 The B & W audit, prepared several months later, said Associated had received 
$300,000 of the funds for disbursement to Stallone. Stallone's representatives 
have declined to discuss the matter, and it is unclear where the money wound 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 B & W canceled its contract with Associated Film in 1984. Internal memos show 
the firm was disturbed by Associated's record-keeping practices and didn't 
think it was getting its money's worth. Moreover, the cigarette maker had just 
been hammered by bad publicity over the showing of a Kool cigarette commercial 
in a Massachusetts theater featuring the G-rated movie "Snow White." 
</P>
<P>
 A memo said Kovoloff and Associated Film Senior Vice President James F. 
Ripslinger were told the deal "was being terminated because of a corporate 
policy decision." 
</P>
<P>
 B & W's parting was more amicable than that of some Kovoloff clients, who sued 
but were unable to collect their judgments. Collection was stymied by 
Kovoloff's 1992 bankruptcy, which wiped out debts of more than than $1.5 
million to nearly 100 creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his seemingly dire financial straits, though, Kovoloff maintained some 
trappings of the high life. 
</P>
<P>
 At a court hearing in November, 1990, involving an unpaid legal judgment, 
Kovoloff said he and his wife "have nothing. . . . We are as broke as two 
people can be." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged, however, that his wife was driving a Range Rover. His car? A 
Jaguar.

BOY'S TROUBLED ODYSSEY RAISES MORAL, LEGAL DOUBTS; JUVENILES: AT 12, HE SAID HE 
WANTED OUT OF GANG LIFE. BUT COURTS AND SOCIAL AGENCIES HAVE SENT HIM BACK AND 
FORTH. 
</P>

<P>
 Scarred by Los Angeles gang tattoos on his neck and a man-sized chip on his 
shoulder, 12-year-old Luis (Mousie) Fernandez embodied this town's worst fears. 
</P>
<P>
 He had returned to his birthplace -- the largest of the bucolic settlements 
along the irrigated fruit-basket of the upper Columbia River -- saying he 
wanted to start over, that the accidental shooting death of his older brother 
at the hands of a North Hills gang member made him want to escape gang life. 
</P>
<P>
 But this difficult child, damaged by neglect and street life, was seen as an 
interloper bringing the threat of violence to this rural paradise, which, like 
so many other towns across America, is struggling to preserve its isolation and 
serenity. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is perhaps understandable that Wenatchee's 23,000 residents did not 
throw out the welcome mat for this boy, who fought with other children, 
intimidated adults and bragged of his gang exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful town officials not only expelled him from school, they obtained a 
unique court order making it a crime for him to even play with other 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids like that, when they get to Wenatchee, stick out like a sore thumb," 
said John Gordon, assistant superintendent of the town's school district. "And 
we don't have the ability to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 With Luis' attempt at a new life in Washington crumbling, a state child 
protective services caseworker flew the boy back to Los Angeles, turning him 
over to a Sun Valley rehabilitation house for adult gang members, recovering 
alcoholics and drug addicts -- even though he has never been accused of a 
serious crime and does not have a substance abuse problem. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services got word of his 
situation, Luis was picked up again and taken to MacLaren Hall, the county's 
large home for abused and neglected children. Today a Juvenile Court judge will 
conduct a hearing to determine who should have custody of Luis and where he 
should live. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how we can not get involved" in the situation, said Alfonso 
Garcia, head of the Latino Family Preservation project for the Children's 
Services Department. "We would just be doing the same thing that Washington is 
doing, washing our hands of him." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has raised a number of difficult questions about the legal and moral 
responsibility a society has to educate its children, especially those who are 
troubled and seem unresponsive to help. It also calls into doubt the 
oft-repeated belief that small towns offer both a haven and a salve for young 
gang members influenced by harsh urban environments. 
</P>
<P>
 School and court officials in Washington said they tried their best to help 
the slight, dark-eyed boy but admit that they were confounded by a child whose 
needs seemed completely out of proportion to the services they could offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Tiffany, the editor of a Spanish-language weekly newspaper in Wenatchee, 
said the story of Luis is simple. "This kid scared us all and we didn't know 
what to do with him so we kicked him out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although born in Wenatchee, Luis moved with his father and four siblings to 
the North Hills area of the San Fernando Valley almost three years ago after 
his father and mother separated. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood could not have been more different from Wenatchee. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every wall, gate, garage door and fence around Columbus Street is 
scrawled with graffiti marking it as gang territory. Many of the streets are 
barricaded to combat open drug sales. Gunfire is common. Gang members take over 
vacant apartments.  
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Luis' brother Vincent, 15, was shot in the family's living room 
by a gang member playing with a gun.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every day I think about you and I feel sad," Luis wrote in a note to his 
brother just after Vincent's death. "I'm going to take my tattoos off my neck 
and I'm not going to be with Columbus no more because I don't want to get 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The death of his oldest son drove Jose Fernandez, 54, to return to Wenatchee.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, in part, that . . . there wouldn't be the violence and the air 
would be cleaner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he admitted, Luis continued to hang out on the streets in Wenatchee, as 
he had in Los Angeles, sometimes drinking wine with older youths and not coming 
home at night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wenatchee is as rural as North Hills is urban.  
</P>
<P>
 The graffiti on the walking bridge that connects Wenatchee with East Wenatchee 
memorializes teen-age love rather than gang feuds. And the video arcade in 
town, which is supposed to be the gang hot spot, on one recent evening had only 
a couple of dozen well-behaved youths feeding machines with quarters. If there 
is drug dealing in town -- and police say there is, although it is not 
organized -- it is done secretly, not out in the open. 
</P>
<P>
 But many residents fear that growing ranks of newcomers are threatening the 
isolation they cherish. Blessed with clean air, stunning vistas of the Cascades 
to the west and cheap housing prices, Wenatchee is now attracting not only 
retirees and urban refugees but also Latino farm workers, such as Luis' father, 
who are choosing to collect unemployment during the off season or get out of 
the orchards altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The tripling during the 1980s of the Latino population in this still mostly 
white region -- where right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh's midday program 
attracts an enthusiastic audience -- has touched off bitter town meetings at 
which residents have argued for mass roundups of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hispanic community . . . has grown so fast that Wenatchee . . . didn't 
see it coming and they don't like it," said Ruben Ruelas, a state unemployment 
office worker who co-chairs the mayor's advisory group in town. "They say, 'Why 
should we make it any easier or provide any extra services for these people?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wenatchee residents, he said, equate young Latinos, especially those who 
have moved from Southern California, with gang members. There has never been a 
drive-by shooting here, and police have identified only about 100 gang 
"wanna-bes." 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a scribble on the wall and we say the Mexican gangs are coming to take 
over the community," said Tiffany, the editor, who resigned from the town's 
anti-gang committee because he thought its approach was repressive rather than 
supportive of kids heading for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 D. Ty Duhamel, directing attorney for Evergreen Legal Services, a poverty law 
agency in Wenatchee, said what happened to Luis is not unusual in the region. 
He has sued several school districts for expelling Latino students simply 
because they were thought to be gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, he said, is one of perception. Administrators' fears "make them 
assume the worst and think of Hispanics as someone to be excluded instead of 
someone to be given the benefits of what they want for their own children," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis, who defied authorities in court hearings and classrooms, "fit the 
stereotype," said Ruelas. Rather than trying to belie those fears, the 
youngster immediately began testing the town's patience as well as its 
resources for helping a troubled child reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6,300-student Wenatchee school system, for example, is the largest in the 
area but did not offer Luis a home study program that would have allowed him to 
keep up in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did the Wenatchee schools or the probation department provide him with 
one-on-one counseling to help him control the rage that teachers said would 
suddenly erupt as if from a deep, dark place. Once last winter, for example, he 
returned to Robert E. Lee School in East Wenatchee with a double-edged ax that 
he used to destroy a snow fort that other students had made. 
</P>
<P>
 He was expelled soon after, five weeks after he had enrolled. Principal Cathie 
West said she had done everything from letting Luis tutor other students to 
build his self-esteem to giving him a chance to earn new clothing with good 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went the extra mile for this child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis' father said he had told judges in court hearings in Wenatchee that he 
could not control his children or keep them off the street. But he said he got 
no help. He tried to get Luis admitted to school in Wenatchee itself but his 
request was rejected, without an appeal. Instead, Wenatchee school officials 
headed for Chelan County District Court to get a legal weapon to keep Luis 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 9, after a hearing at which Luis represented himself, the district was 
given an anti-harassment order against Luis and another boy; they were said to 
have been threatening students. The district later acknowledged that a school 
administrator who testified at that hearing had been confused and that some of 
what she said to get the order was untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert Graham's order is far broader than the temporary order that an 
Orange County school district asked for last month to allow a kindergarten 
student to be moved into a special education class. Officials there were later 
told to allow the student into a regular class. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a minor cannot be sued in the state of Washington, Graham said he 
went along because he "wasn't attempting to imprison the kid or fine him or 
anything else." His order barred Luis from campuses and from associating with 
other kids. Violating it would subject him to criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham also acknowledged that, although Luis' father was present, he might 
have erred in not appointing a guardian or securing an attorney for the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing came up suddenly and we did it," Graham said in an interview.  
</P>
<P>
 Graham said he was saddened by the sight of Luis, a child who during breaks in 
the hearing played with his 4-year-old niece. But he issued the order anyway, 
he said, to try to get the boy's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Folks around here are pretty malleable," he said. "They would give every 
break to a youngster who was trying to go right." 
</P>
<P>
 During the eight months or so that he lived in Wenatchee, Luis also appeared 
before Peter Young, the Juvenile Court commissioner for Chelan County, at 
hearings in which he was convicted of breaking a window, fighting and 
shoplifting some candy from a grocery store.  
</P>
<P>
 "He seems to retain this arrogance and defiance. . . . In this small community 
we get concerned that we're not going to change him and, instead, he's going to 
change us and pull in the other 11-year-olds," said Young. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Luis was barred from the local schools, his father began searching for a 
place to help his son. For a brief time last fall, Luis had stayed with 
families from Victory Outreach, a church in the San Fernando Valley, and 
Fernandez decided to send him back there. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor David Martinez, who heads the church, said the group reluctantly agreed 
to let Luis stay at its drug and alcohol recovery house and tutor him until he 
could get into a Christian school. That, however, may make Luis truant, county 
probation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said he does not believe that Luis needs anything more than love, 
attention and structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just that he's used to being out there with the street kids," he said. 
"We're trying to settle him back down and get his mind back into church." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last Thursday, he was taken away.  
</P>
<P>
 Paula Rangel, a North Hills apartment manager who took Luis in after his 
brother's death last summer, was angry at how he has been treated. "No one 
wants to help this kid," she said. "No one wants to say, 'We're going to take 
the responsibility.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The day Luis flew into Los Angeles, he got one more look at his Columbus 
Street neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 He broke a window at Victory Outreach and managed to make it from Sun Valley 
to North Hills. When he showed up on the street, he was met with shouts of 
welcome and hugs, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few hours, until two carloads of Victory Outreach workers tracked him 
down at a park near Columbus Street, he was back home.

WILSON DEEPENS BUDGET CUTBACKS; FINANCES: GOVERNOR PROPOSES $1 BILLION IN 
DEFICIT SPENDING. HE CONCEDES THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN'T BE COUNTED ON TO 
REIMBURSE STATE COSTS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Conceding for the first time that the federal government cannot be counted on 
to bail California out of its fiscal mess, Gov. Pete Wilson offered a revised 
budget Monday that calls for deeper cuts in health, welfare and higher 
education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's spending plan, released just two days before the Legislature's 
deadline for enacting a new budget, also proposes more than $1 billion in 
deficit spending. This is the second consecutive year Wilson has endorsed the 
tactic he once decried as irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor flatly ruled out a tax increase but also abandoned hope for his 
proposed middle-income tax cut and a tax credit for companies that create new 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything else, Wilson's new plan delays most of the difficult budget 
decisions until next year, when the governor will be safely reelected or out of 
office. Without changes in state and federal law, the governor or his successor 
in January will be staring at another potential deficit of at least $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wilson characterized his proposal as a bare-bones offering made 
necessary by Washington's refusal to pay its share of immigration costs imposed 
on California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, California will collect enough revenue to cover all of its own 
bills," Wilson said. "But we cannot afford to pay the federal government's 
bills as well without reducing services for the legal residents of California. 
And that is exactly what we are being . . . forced to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's plan now goes to the Legislature, where Democratic lawmakers are 
expected to push for fewer cuts and more deficit spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, the Santa Clara Democrat who is chairman of the 
budget-writing Ways and Means Committee, criticized Wilson for boosting 
spending on the Corrections Department while proposing deeper cuts in services 
for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a budget for the prisons and the privileged," Vasconcellos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's Democratic rival, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, also 
criticized the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson's June (revision) is more of the same -- more lies, more finger 
pointing, more playing politics," said Brown's press secretary, John 
Whitehurst. "Instead of facing up to the fiscal truths, he's punting, putting 
off until tomorrow what we must face up to today." 
</P>
<P>
 The key to Wilson's plan is his concession that the federal government will 
not give California $1.7 billion that the governor says it costs to educate 
illegal immigrants in the public schools, as mandated by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Wilson still is counting on more aid from Washington than is 
generally considered possible. 
</P>
<P>
 His budget relies on $356 million from the federal government for 
incarcerating illegal immigrants convicted of felonies, but the Clinton 
Administration has proposed only $350 million for this purpose nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wilson's budget projects that Congress will fully reimburse the state for 
the $400-million annual cost of providing emergency health care to illegal 
immigrants, an unlikely prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the governor's two-year budget recovery plan assumes that the 
federal government will come through with the full $2.5 billion in federal 
reimbursements in the 1995-96 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with these rosy assumptions, the governor is proposing $1.3 billion in 
reductions in a roughly $40-billion general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of Wilson's cuts are those he earlier proposed in health and 
welfare programs. These include his proposal to cut welfare grants 10% 
immediately and another 15% after six months for able-bodied recipients still 
in the program. The governor also is still pushing for the elimination of 
certain Medi-Cal benefits, including dental care for adults. The Legislature 
repeatedly has rejected these proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 New cuts were also proposed Monday in services for the poor. Wilson said he 
wants to shift $285 million in county health care funds to the state, putting 
pressure on public hospitals to cut services. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed said the state 
budget proposal would cost Los Angeles at least $200 million in revenue in the 
coming budget year, and could cost as much as $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would mean a dramatic reconsideration of our budget proposal," Reed said. 
"We could well be revisiting everything we had proposed," with new 
across-the-board cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Los Angeles County is facing a $186-million deficit, despite cuts to 
many departments, including libraries, parks, museums and the assessor's 
office. In a new round of cuts, the sheriff's, district attorney's, probation, 
health and welfare departments would also suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also proposed ending health and welfare services for legal immigrants 
who have been here less than five years and who entered the country on grounds 
that a sponsor, either an individual or private charity, would look after their 
needs. This could affect more than 15,000 immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor suggested trimming the cost of pharmaceuticals in the Medi-Cal 
program by reducing the dispensing fee paid to pharmacists by 25% and by 
limiting to six the number of prescriptions that doctors can write each month 
without obtaining approval in advance from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are cuts I don't think anyone wants to make," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson proposed reducing a planned budget boost for higher education, 
he stuck to his pledge not to cut funding for kindergarten through 12th grade, 
which is calculated per student. That practice allows schools to keep pace with 
enrollment, but they still lose ground to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson proposed $1 billion in deficit spending. He would stretch repayment of 
the state's debt over two budget years, rather than paying it off all at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling the state's debt over into the next fiscal year is something that 
Wilson adamantly opposed until last year. He now says the tactic is permissible 
as long as the state does not plan to spend more than it takes in for a 
12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rollover is something you do as a last resort," Wilson said. "It is a 
tolerable expedient . . . to avoid deeper cuts than anyone wants to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Wilson's plan, the state would pay back, by the spring of 1996, the $1 
billion he proposes to borrow. 
</P>
<P>
 If the full federal funds for immigration do not materialize by then, a Wilson 
aide said, the debt -- which is in the form of notes sold to private investors 
-- would be paid off by borrowing from independent, internal state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did not rule out increasing the size of the rollover, an action that 
would reduce the need for program reductions. But he said he was not eager to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can only go so far with it," he said. "I don't think you can roll over 
very much without totally blowing your credit and your credibility." 
</P>

Proposed Cuts 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a summary of the spending cuts Gov. Pete Wilson proposed Monday, when 
he acknowledged that the federal government will not meet his demand for $2.5 
billion to pay for the cost of services for illegal immigrants: 
</P>
<P>
 * Welfare -- Cut grants 10% immediately and another 15% for able-bodied adults 
still on the rolls in six months. End additional payments to women who have 
children after they are on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medi-Cal -- Eliminate certain health care services provided to the poor, 
including dental care for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 * Immigrants -- Eliminate prenatal care for pregnant illegal immigrants. 
Births still would be covered under Medi-Cal, as required by federal law. 
Eliminate welfare and health services to "sponsored" legal immigrants for their 
first five years in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * Disability -- Deny supplemental Social Security grants and general 
assistance welfare payments to convicted drug offenders. This applies to 
recipients of aid for the aged, blind and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fraud -- Permanently disqualify for all public assistance programs those 
found to have committed welfare fraud. Current law disqualifies recipients 
after their third offense and only within the program they defrauded. 
</P>
<P>
 * Colleges -- Reduce growth in University of California and California State 
University budgets, which could increase pressure on those institutions to 
raise fees.

 A frustrated Mayor Richard Riordan announced Monday that the city will declare 
an impasse in police contract negotiations today unless an eleventh-hour deal 
is reached, a move that would empower the city to impose a contract on 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pessimistic that an agreement could be hammered out, city officials were set 
to inform the state Employee Relations Board this morning that they could not 
reach agreement with the Police Protective League despite intensive talks in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response to the city's good-faith efforts by some of the police union 
leadership has been exasperating," Riordan said. "They have resorted to 
name-calling and intimidation tactics rather than sticking to the tough job of 
finding a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, who was surrounded by seven City Council members at an afternoon news 
conference, invited the union to meet with the mediator and city 
representatives throughout the night Monday to try to reach a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But union officials refused to say whether they would take Riordan up on his 
offer. Declining to comment on the day's developments, the union said it would 
make a statement this morning, when officers plan to march to City Hall en 
masse to show their discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 An impasse would send the labor dispute, which stretches back nearly two 
years, into a fact-finding process in which a state official will hear both 
sides in a courtroom-like setting and rule on a fair deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would have the upper hand once an impasse is declared because it 
could decide to accept the fact finder's recommendation or impose its own last 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakdown in talks came after a contentious weekend. Several sources in 
the dispute said Friday that mediator John M. Caraway had recommended pay 
increases totaling 9% over the next 18 months, along with $1,000 "signing 
bonuses" and stipends for officers who work patrol. City officials angrily 
accused the union of violating the confidentiality of the talks, and Caraway 
issued a statement Saturday denying that he had made any "formal 
recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal attributed to Caraway was far above the city's last offer -- a 6% pay 
raise over two years with a 2% bonus for patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, union leaders said they may call for an investigation of Riordan by 
the state attorney general's office because of a telephone call he made to 
Caraway over the weekend. The union accused the mayor of putting "tremendous 
personal pressure" on Caraway to rescind his "recommendation," which the union 
said is "tantamount to jury tampering." 
</P>
<P>
 Before agreeing to declare an impasse, city officials considered the 
likelihood that such a decision might prompt more angry protests from officers. 
Officers have threatened a job action during the World Cup soccer tournament, 
which begins here Saturday, to embarrass the city in the eyes of the 
international media. But in the end, city officials decided that the talks 
ought to come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few weeks, officers have angrily interrupted a speech by Riordan, 
staged a mass sickout and threatened to publicize embarrassing information on 
city leaders to pressure them into a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In a confidential memo obtained by The Times, the city attorney's office 
sharply criticized the union's threats to disseminate personal information. 
Senior Assistant City Atty. Frederick N. Merkin said the threats alone may have 
violated several laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attempted intimidation of elected government officials puts in jeopardy 
their civil rights and places at risk the integrity of representative 
government,' Merkin wrote to council members. 
</P>
<P>
 He made three recommendations to city leaders: Demand an apology from the 
union, pursue civil litigation or refer the matter for criminal prosecution to 
the district attorney's office or the U. S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 At Riordan's news conference Monday, the mayor denied that he improperly tried 
to twist the mediator's arm and said it is the union that has engaged in "a 
sustained pattern of irresponsible public statements." 
</P>
<P>
 While condemning the union's tactics, Riordan and other city officials took 
pains to praise the Police Department. But officials said fiscal constraints 
make it impossible to give LAPD officers everything they want. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to work with them and we want to give them a raise . . . but they 
have to understand that there is more than just the Police Department to 
running the city," council President John Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that police officers who have families want the recreational 
facilities for their children to play and want the libraries for their children 
to use," Ferraro said. "There are a lot of things the city must provide." 
</P>
<P>
 The city had come close to declaring an impasse last week, even preparing an 
official statement for Riordan to read at a news conference. But at the last 
minute, the union agreed to the city's request to bring in an outside mediator. 
That process lasted several days before Monday's breakdown.

CLINTON GREETS EMPEROR, CITES TIES TO JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton formally welcomed Japanese Emperor Akihito to the White 
House on Monday, saying that in the half-century since the end of World War II, 
the two nations have supplanted the "misunderstanding and even ignorance" that 
divided them with a deep, lasting friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 The youthful, aggressively informal President presided over a formal welcoming 
ceremony for the emperor and empress with full military honors, including 
21-gun salutes and a fife-and-drum corps in Revolutionary War regalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Akihito, in his remarks, also alluded to World War II and expressed gratitude 
that the United States and Japan had overcome the "deplorable rupture" caused 
by it. While Japanese leaders have acknowledged some aggression and atrocities 
during the Pacific war, they have not admitted starting it and have given only 
guarded apologies for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The emperor quickly moved off the subject, offering praise for America's 
generous treatment in rebuilding Japan's shattered economy and demoralized 
society after 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese people will not forget the generosity of the support which the 
United States extended to my country after World War II in providing material 
support, as well as in caring for the next generations of Japanese by accepting 
exchange students and other means," said Akihito, 60. "Nor will they forget the 
indispensable role played by the United States in ensuring Japan's security and 
world peace for the past half-century." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton towered over Akihito and his wife, Empress Michiko, as he greeted them 
at an elaborate ceremony on the White House South Lawn. Akihito arrived in a 
black Cadillac limousine exactly on time at 10 a.m. and, in a break with the 
tradition practiced in Japan, shook hands with Clinton and First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The more formal, deferential Japanese would never touch the emperor, occupant 
of the Chrysanthemum Throne, the oldest monarchal seat on Earth. But Akihito 
decided to adopt American practices during his 11-day sojourn here; it was 
handshakes all around Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders reviewed troops from all branches of the U.S. military in 
wilting heat and gave brief welcoming remarks that dragged on because of 
translation. The 4,000 dignitaries and schoolchildren fanned themselves with 
programs and wiped their brows with handkerchiefs as the 40-minute ceremony 
went on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton recalled that when Akihito first visited the United States as crown 
prince in 1953, "nations were rebuilding from the devastation of war and vivid 
memories of that conflict divided our two people." But much has changed since 
then in both societies, and now the world's two largest economies are 
"inextricably linked," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons later met the royal couple in the White House Green Room, a 
protocol signal that their talks were social and ceremonial, not political. 
Substantive talks with foreign dignitaries generally occur in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
 The emperor and empress arrived Friday in Atlanta and will travel across the 
country with stops including Tarrytown, N.Y., St. Louis, Denver, Los Angeles 
and Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, where they arrived Sunday afternoon, the couple toured the 
Japanese collections at the Freer Gallery and laid a wreath at the Tomb of the 
Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery. They are scheduled to visit a Japanese 
language program at a school in Great Falls, Va., and to tour the Library of 
Congress today. 
</P>
<P>
 The imperial couple were guests of honor Monday night at the first 
full-fledged white-tie state dinner of the Clinton Administration in an 
air-conditioned tent constructed over the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 170 guests from the worlds of government, business, publishing 
and entertainment included Oprah Winfrey, Barbra Streisand, retiring Supreme 
Court Justice Harry Blackmun and former Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner, the guests moved to the East Room, where they were entertained 
by cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, the soon-to-be-retired conductor of the 
National Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, several hundred Asian Americans protested the emperor's visit, 
massing in Lafayette Square across the street from the White House and calling 
on the Japanese government to atone for wartime barbarism. Shouting "Japan 
apologize," the protesters compared Japan's aggression in World War II to that 
of the Nazis and demanded that Japan pay reparations to war survivors.

NORTH KOREA QUITS NUCLEAR AGENCY, EXPELS INSPECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE and JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea escalated its confrontation with the West over its alleged nuclear 
weapons program Monday, saying it is withdrawing from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency and expelling the agency's weapons inspectors from its territory. 
</P>
<P>
 It also renewed threats -- this time in a formal statement by its Foreign 
Ministry -- to go to war against South Korea and its allies if the United 
Nations imposes punitive sanctions, as the United States is urging it to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pyongyang technically remains a signatory to the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, its withdrawal from the international agency marks a 
further act of defiance against the United States and its allies and is likely 
to intensify sentiment for U.N. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, Western analysts expressed apprehension that North 
Korea's decision might enable Pyongyang to develop a nuclear weapons program 
without fear of serious monitoring by the West. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton is expected to approve a draft resolution today or Wednesday 
calling for the gradual phasing in of economic and political restrictions. The 
step-by-step sanctions would be designed to give Pyongyang time to comply with 
inspections before a full-scale embargo takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday that 
she hopes to begin outlining details of the plan almost immediately to members 
of the U.N. Security Council. Officials said that final Security Council action 
could come by the month's end. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials here said Monday's developments could delay final approval of 
the U.S. proposal, at least until Administration policy-makers can review the 
situation and decide how to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's withdrawal from the 120-country agency ostensibly is in 
retaliation for the IAEA decision Friday to withhold $250,000 in technical aid 
to Pyongyang as a result of its refusal to allow inspectors to take samplings 
of spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will immediately withdraw from the IAEA," the country's Foreign Ministry 
said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency. It said 
that international inspectors "now will have nothing to do any further in our 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. reaction to the North Korean announcement was muted -- partly because, 
except for the statement carried by the news agency, Pyongyang still has not 
formally notified the United Nations or the Vienna-based atomic energy agency 
of its decision. The agency had already closed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said Pyongyang's move would dash allied hopes that North Korea's 
nuclear program could be monitored satisfactorily. Pyongyang already has 
destroyed virtually all past evidence that could point to any manufacture of 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for political affairs, said 
Monday that a North Korean withdrawal -- and expulsion of agency weapons 
inspectors -- would be "a very, very serious development for the worse." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang's statement Monday was accompanied by a renewed warning from the 
Foreign Ministry that any imposition of U.N. sanctions would be "regarded 
immediately as a declaration of war." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no indication how soon, if at all, North Korea might also withdraw 
from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Pyongyang withdrew from the treaty 
briefly last year but "suspended" its decision under pressure from the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts are divided over the implications of such a move. While some argue 
that the West would no longer have a legal basis for imposing sanctions against 
Pyongyang, U.S. officials said that the United Nations still could act to 
preserve "international peace and security." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials cautioned that the Administration's draft sanctions resolution still 
has not won full approval from U.S. allies. For example, although Tokyo has 
agreed to block North Koreans in Japan from sending money home, key details are 
still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 One version of the resolution would allow Japan to postpone any restrictions 
on sending money to North Korea until the later phases of the sanctions plan. 
In another, Japan would block such remittances immediately but only if they 
exceed a specific amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House declined to provide further details on the sanctions, which it 
has described as relatively mild in initial stages, intensifying to a 
full-scale embargo.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, South Korean newspapers quoted officials there as saying the United 
States is considering "doubling" the combat capability of U.S. forces in the 
country and bringing in more Patriot air defense batteries. The Pentagon 
declined to comment. But Defense Department officials said they are continuing 
to bolster U.S. forces in South Korea gradually. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also called Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin on Monday, partly to 
talk about North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Clinton also had hoped to call 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin but was unable to do so because of what the White 
House called scheduling problems. Others said that Jiang preferred not to 
conduct diplomacy by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Both countries are important to passage of a sanctions resolution because, as 
permanent members of the Security Council, they have the power to veto any such 
measure.  
</P>
<P>
 Separately, former President Jimmy Carter arrived in Seoul on Monday on the 
first stop of a trip to South and North Korea. Although he is technically 
traveling as a private citizen, he has been briefed by the White House on U.S. 
policy.

ERIK MENENDEZ SIGNALS SPLIT WITH BROTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marking their first public split, Erik Menendez has asserted that he was 
afraid of his brother, Lyle, the night they killed their wealthy parents, and 
the younger brother's lawyer wants the two tried separately, according to legal 
papers filed by prosecutors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Signaling that Erik Menendez may be turning on his older brother, prosecutors 
quoted a brief filed in April by lawyers for the younger brother saying it was 
crucial to his defense to prove the "theory that Erik was fearful of Lyle at 
the time of the alleged crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense filed the legal papers to bolster Erik's bid for a separate trial. 
According to prosecutors who quoted from the brief, the defense contends that 
Erik was afraid because Lyle had threatened him. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Abramson, Erik's lead attorney, could not be reached for comment. The 
brief that she filed in April has never been made public and could not be 
obtained Monday. Terri Towery, one of Lyle's defense lawyers, declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, who could not be reached for comment, are seeking a joint trial 
and said in legal papers that they filed Monday that the defense position is in 
sharp contrast to the united stand that Lyle, 26, and Erik, 23, offered at 
their lengthy first trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution's legal papers ridiculed the notion that Erik "might portray 
Lyle Menendez as the mastermind who dominated him," saying that was in "direct 
conflict" with the brothers' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first trial, which ended in January, both brothers testified that they 
killed their parents in self-defense rooted in a deep fear of Jose Menendez, 
45, and Kitty Menendez, 47. Wielding shotguns, the sons killed the parents in 
the TV room of the family's Beverly Hills estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the brothers said they lashed out after a lifetime of physical, 
psychological and sexual abuse. Not once in 10 days on the stand did Erik say 
he feared his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contended that the brothers killed out of hatred and greed. The 
first trial ended in January when separate juries deadlocked between murder and 
lesser manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg is due June 27 to set a date 
for the new trial. Weisberg is also due at that hearing to decide whether to 
conduct the retrial with one jury or two, or to have separate trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Both brothers remain in County Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the appearance of solidarity that Lyle and Erik presented in the 
courtroom, the allegation that the younger brother feared not only the parents 
but the older brother was apparently entertained as a defense strategy point 
even before the first trial, according to the legal papers filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegation was originally made in a brief that was filed by defense 
attorneys before the first trial, prosecutors disclosed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That defense brief, however, was filed under seal, meaning it was never 
available for inspection -- and the allegation never became publicly known. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, Abramson quietly filed a defense brief asking for separate 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegation that the younger brother feared the older did not surface until 
Monday, however, and then only in the brief filed by prosecutors, who said they 
had to respond to it -- and quoted from the brief filed in April by Abramson. 
</P>
<P>
 Court clerks confirmed Monday that the motion was filed in April but said it 
could not be located at the Van Nuys courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first trial, the "most remarkable aspect of the defenses actually 
presented (was) how entirely harmonious they were, down to the smallest 
detail," prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Urging Weisberg to conduct the second trial with one jury for both brothers, 
prosecutors added that the two "thought alike and acted alike at all times, and 
they agreed upon the role each played in the commission of the crime." 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another brief filed Monday on behalf of Erik, Abramson and co-counsel 
Marcia Morrissey did not touch on the issue of fear. But they contended that 
Erik could only get fair treatment with a separate trial, or at least a 
separate jury. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, the lawyers said, that was because of potentially harmful evidence 
involving Lyle that might carry a "prejudicial spillover" and taint the younger 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Among that evidence, the defense lawyers said, was a new allegation -- 
disclosed first last month by the prosecution -- that in discussions with a 
family friend, Lyle "appeared to have considered various defenses before he 
opted for the one he finally advanced at trial." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution contends those conversations took place before Lyle testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger brother's lawyers retorted Monday that the conversations occurred 
after the testimony of both brothers and thus do not tend to show 
"consciousness of guilt, fabrication of evidence or fabrication of a defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Other potentially damaging evidence, Erik's lawyers said Monday, includes 
Lyle's "attempt to suborn perjury, his arrogance, lack of remorse and 
extravagant spending after the death of his parents and his formulation of 
plans to escape from the county jail." 
</P>
<P>
 The "attempt to suborn perjury" involves two of Lyle's ex-girlfriends. One has 
testified that he offered to bribe her to lie for him at the trial. He 
purportedly wrote another with explicit instructions on how to testify, 
prosecutors contend. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "escape plans" were among papers seized by sheriff's deputies 
from Lyle in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The "plans" feature handwritten comments that include "What financial security 
will we have in the future" and "Can we blend in, how?"

SUPREME COURT OKS RETROACTIVE TAX COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court on Monday gave Congress and state lawmakers virtually 
unlimited power to collect taxes retroactively, even when a taxpayer is 
penalized for taking a legal deduction that is later repealed.  
</P>
<P>
 The 9-0 ruling upholds a 1987 move by Congress to apply tax changes 
retroactively to returns that were filed in 1986. It is a defeat for a Newport 
Beach estate tax lawyer who lost $630,000 in estate money when he sold stocks 
in 1986 to take advantage of a newly created tax deduction.  
</P>
<P>
 A year later, when Congress repealed the new deduction, the Internal Revenue 
Service demanded that the estate pay an extra $2.5 million in taxes. The case 
came to the high court as a test of how far the government could go in imposing 
tax changes retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tax legislation is not a promise, and a taxpayer has no vested right in the 
Internal Revenue Code," said Justice Harry A. Blackmun for the court. So long 
as Congress acts with "a legitimate legislative purpose" in mind, its tax laws, 
even retroactive ones, are constitutional, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a concurring opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia derided the government for 
"bait-and-switch taxation," but he nonetheless voted to uphold the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitution itself bars ex post facto laws. Since 1798, the Supreme Court 
has said that limit applies only to criminal laws, not civil measures.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, since the 1930s, the high court repeatedly has upheld retroactive tax 
changes. But some tax experts had hoped that a conservative-dominated court 
would be more protective of the rights of taxpayers. Instead, Monday's ruling 
(United States vs. Carlton, 92-1941) offers another stark example of a 
conservative court handing down a defeat to a cause championed by political 
conservatives.  
</P>
<P>
 The decision probably deals a fatal blow to a similar lawsuit challenging 
retroactive tax increases in the 1993 Clinton tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Republicans in Congress argued that the Democratic majority was 
acting unconstitutionally when it raised tax rates on the estates of people who 
died in the months before the new tax bill became law. On Aug. 10, 1993, 
President Clinton signed into law the higher tax rates for estates and for 
upper-income people. Those new rates were applied retroactively to Jan. 1, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the National Taxpayers Union and the Landmark Legal Foundation 
filed a lawsuit in federal court here seeking to have those retroactive changes 
invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative members of the high court, led by Scalia and Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist, long have insisted on giving wide latitude to elected 
lawmakers. Whether the issues are contraception and abortion or rent control 
and retroactive taxes, these two conservatives have largely voted to uphold 
federal and state laws.  
</P>
<P>
 In his concurring opinion, Scalia lectured the liberals for "picking and 
choosing among the various rights to be accorded (special) protection," citing 
the Roe vs. Wade decision that made abortion legal as an example. In his view, 
the court should uphold state laws banning abortion, just as it upheld a law 
Monday that imposed retroactive taxes. Justice Clarence Thomas joined Scalia's 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Carlton, the Newport Beach tax lawyer who lost in Monday's ruling, said 
that he found the decision "scary. As I read it, it says the government can 
say: 'I have a social goal. Help me accomplish it.' But after you do it, they 
can say: 'Sorry! Just kidding.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The social goal in this instance was encouraging employee stock ownership 
programs, or ESOPs. Former Sen. Russell Long (D-La.) believed that workers 
should own more of a company's stock and he wrote into law tax incentives to 
achieve that goal.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Tax Reform Act of 1986, he sponsored a change that gave a deduction to 
estate executors who sell stock to an employee stock ownership plan. The idea 
was that the deduction would encourage sales at a discount.  
</P>
<P>
 Carlton, the executor of the estate of oil heiress Willametta Keck Day, bought 
$11.2 million in MCI stock and sold it two days later to the company ESOP for 
$10.57 million. Though he lost $631,000 on the stock transaction, the estate 
got a tax deduction valued at $2.5 million when he filed her return on Dec. 29, 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But IRS officials, alarmed at estimates that the new deduction could cost $7 
billion over five years, announced in January, 1987, that they would seek a 
change in the law. In December, 1987, Congress passed an amendment limiting the 
deduction to estates that owned the stock before death.  
</P>
<P>
 The IRS then sought a $2.5-million refund from the Day's estate. After the tax 
was paid, Carlton challenged the action as a violation of due process of law.

COLUMN ONE; LIFE AFTER THE REBBE A PUZZLE; CHABAD'S FUTURE IS CLOUDED BY THE 
DEATH OF THE MAN SOME THOUGHT WAS THE MESSIAH. HOW IT COPES WITHOUT ITS LEADER 
WILL SHAPE FATE OF THE ORTHODOX JEWISH SECT AND ITS VAST FUND-RAISING AND 
SOCIAL SERVICE NETWORK.

 "Can Chabad Outlive the Rebbe?" asked the headline in a recent edition of a 
leading Jewish journal, as the 92-year-old leader of one of Judaism's most 
aggressive and charismatic sects lay comatose in a New York hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 After the death Sunday of Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh leader, or 
rebbe , of the Chabad Lubavitch movement, that question is at hand. At stake is 
the future of an organization that Schneerson personally transformed in his 44 
years of leadership from a provincial sect into what Allen Nadler, an expert on 
the group's activities, describes as the "most famous and powerful movement in 
contemporary Orthodox Judaism." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinging on the future ideological and political course of the movement is the 
exploitation of millions of dollars in real estate holdings and the fate of an 
extensive network of schools, synagogues and such social programs as drug 
rehabilitation centers. What happens may depend on how Chabad as a whole comes 
to terms with Schneerson's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Chabad claims more than 250,000 members in more than 30 countries, although 
outside observers call that an overstatement and place the number of adherents 
at as little as 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of non-members contribute to Chabad programs, including a highly 
publicized annual telethon in Los Angeles, worship at its synagogues and 
support its political and social initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has played a significant role in recent Israeli politics and lobbies 
forcefully in Washington on behalf of its social welfare activities. 
Schneerson's speeches and sermons are the core of an enormous recorded library 
and are regularly broadcast across the globe on radio and satellite TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Chabad also sponsors a large fund-raising network whose benefactors include 
leading Jewish families and business people, smaller contributors and 
government programs. Its annual budget for charitable enterprises and 
missionary activities among fellow Jews has been estimated at $100 million. The 
budget for its Los Angeles outpost alone is more than $16 million, according to 
its leader, Schneerson disciple Rabbi Boruch Shlomo Cunin. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rebbe's illness -- he suffered a stroke in 1992 and spent the last few 
months in a coma -- provoked a major crisis within the sect as its other top 
leaders split over issues ranging from the proper medical care due Schneerson 
to the movement's theological direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sources say the resulting uncertainty has cut substantially into the 
group's charitable receipts. But Chabad's problems are rooted in the 
increasingly Messianic character the sect assumed in recent years, with many 
adherents going so far as to identify Schneerson himself as the Messiah -- and 
thus possibly immortal. 
</P>
<P>
 This belief not only conflicted with mainstream Jewish views of the nature of 
the Messiah, but established an obvious hurdle for the organization's 
continuity after his death. By Chabad practice, only Schneerson could appoint a 
successor, as he was appointed in 1951 by his father-in-law, the previous rebbe 
. He died without naming an heir, although many believe that he has left a 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebbe 's passing without his revelation as the Messiah would be "such a 
devastating blow that a majority of people would never recover," Rabbi Shlomo 
Schwartz, a former Chabad chaplain at UCLA who broke with Cunin's organization 
but not with Chabad, said in an interview shortly before Schneerson's death. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only appropriate successor would have to be "somebody with unbelievable 
talent to have the allegiance of 200,000 people -- doctors, lawyers, Indian 
chiefs, people in the entertainment industry," Schwartz said. "There's no one 
who has all his facets in one person." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Monday, Cunin himself gave no indication that his faith has 
been rocked by Schneerson's death. "We believe the Messiah is coming any day," 
he said. "We believe the dead will come back to life. Our belief in both of 
these is completely in place. The rebbe has his people in charge all over the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if a successor would be named, Cunin said: "No, not from the way I see 
it. He's still with us." 
</P>
<P>
 But other observers say that even if it survives in some form, Chabad cannot 
help but be seriously shaken by the passing of its charismatic leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people will leave the movement, maybe even a majority, but some will 
become more dedicated," said Menachem Friedman, an expert in ultra-Orthodox 
sects at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. "One can't be sure to which side the 
future belongs. But death is never a major obstacle to dedicated believers in a 
Messiah; see Christianity."  
</P>
<P>
 For all that, Schneerson's leadership -- even critics acknowledged his 
charisma and strong personal presence -- was key to the group's growth and 
influence. He gave the organization its mission of preserving and glorifying 
Jewish identity in the face of modern pressure to assimilate -- a message with 
appeal even to the assimilated, whose contributions help fill the coffers of 
Chabad Lubavitch. 
</P>
<P>
 ("Chabad" is an acronym from the Hebrew for wisdom, understanding and 
knowledge; Lubavitch is the Lithuanian hamlet where the sect began.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Until the last crisis (of the rebbe 's illness), they found getting financing 
easy among people concerned about intermarriage and the possibility of 
Jewishness disappearing from the modern American world," said Friedman. "Chabad 
was fighting that much better than any other Jewish organization, so people 
concerned about it were donating to Chabad." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, he said, Chabad was unique among Orthodox groups in its 
willingness to broadcast its message over the very technological advances that 
characterized the menacing modern world, including satellite television. 
Adherents, supporters, or the merely curious could engage Chabad members over 
the Internet, the global network of computer users.  
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, the Jewish Messiah ushers in a new era of universal peace and 
knowledge of God, rebuilds the Temple in Jerusalem, and restores exiles to 
Israel," said Allen Nadler, an expert in Jewish orthodoxy at the Yivo Institute 
in New York. "Chabad's Messianism shows a lot of American Christian influences. 
In fact, the very way the Lubavitchers deliver their message is very similar in 
technique and form to our fundamentalist and evangelical Christians in their 
use of TV, brochures and missionaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Schneerson and his followers and supporters rarely shrank from 
employing his tremendous authority on behalf of their goals in politics.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the group's most controversial steps was its agitation in support of a 
change in Israel's Law of Return, which grants citizenship to all Jews 
returning to the country. Chabad in 1989 tried to force an amendment to the law 
denying citizenship to those who had been converted by rabbis in the 
Conservative and Reform movements.  
</P>
<P>
 The campaign eventually failed, although it has remained a source of 
resentment among Reform and Conservative Jews. Schneerson, who never visited 
Israel himself, also spoke out against the Camp David peace accords and against 
Israeli government policies he interpreted as relinquishing Israeli territory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion his authority was pressed into service for other ends. Last year, 
Australian and American securities regulators suspended trading in shares of 
Great Central Mines, an Australian gold and diamond mining concern, amid 
indications that the rebbe himself was indirectly behind the stock's tripling 
in price -- to $14, from just under $5 -- in the month after its debut in U.S. 
trading.  
</P>
<P>
 The company's chairman, Joseph L. Gutnick, a major contributor to Chabad, used 
a video featuring Schneerson as part of his pitch to new American investors. 
The video showed the rebbe apparently pointing to a map of the Greater Nabberu 
region of Australia, where Gutnick contended the company was about to make a 
major strike. Gutnick also said publicly that the rebbe had "assured" him "both 
publicly and privately that I will be involved with major discoveries in both 
gold and diamonds."  
</P>
<P>
 But Great Central's own joint venture partner on the Nabberu mine downplayed 
its potential. In the end, the company itself withdrew from all diamond mining 
in the region, and the stock price settled down. It closed Monday at $7.125 in 
NASDAQ trading. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Schneerson's potent personal authority that gave Chabad followers a 
strength of conviction that critics said sometimes has manifested itself as an 
inclination to run roughshod over opponents -- an end-justifies-the-means 
approach to everything from proselytizing to fund-raising.  
</P>
<P>
 Chabad branches have been at the center of courthouse fights over their 
determination to erect Chanukah menorahs and other religious symbols on public 
lands. Some financial supporters have said that they have been asked to lend 
money to local Chabad organizations, only to run into later difficulty 
collecting repayment. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Chabad's structure every local group owes nominal allegiance to 
headquarters at 770 Eastern Parkway in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn -- 
a place known among adherents simply as "770" -- but they remain legally and 
financially autonomous. 
</P>
<P>
 That provided the organization room to maneuver when financial problems 
enveloped Chabad of Irvine, a branch founded in 1979 by Rabbi Mendel Duchman. 
Duchman resigned his post in 1991, leaving his congregation burdened by debts 
of some $1.2 million and three lawsuits filed by former members and a local 
bank. The members charged that Duchman persuaded them to co-sign loans for 
Chabad by misrepresenting the terms and alleged that he defaulted on the loans 
and left them to pay the creditors. The congregation later was reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
 By most accounts, Cunin is one of Schneerson's most vigorous and successful 
disciples. Since coming west 27 years ago on Schneerson's injunction, "Go -- 
California is yours," Cunin has built Chabad here into one of the group's most 
active centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chabad operates a drug rehabilitation program in Los Angeles and Chabad 
Houses, or educational centers, near several colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cunin has become a familiar figure via Chabad of California's annual 
telethon, on which he has shared the stage for 13 years with such Hollywood 
celebrities as Jon Voight and Shelley Winters. The telethon reportedly raises 
more than $3 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cunin's rise has not come without controversy. At one point, Chabad of 
California owed $18 million to 40 banks and 18 individuals -- "and all of it 
(secured by) my beard," as Cunin put it in a 1990 interview with The Times. All 
the creditors were eventually paid off, he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 While seeking contributions to fund the deficit, Cunin met Beverly Hills 
matron Hermine J. Weinberg, who gave him a $1,000 contribution and later, 
without the knowledge of her husband or children, rewrote her will to cut off 
her closest relatives in favor of the Westwood Chabad House. She completed the 
change just days before taking her own life in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 William Weinberg and his children sued to overturn the bequest, charging that 
Chabad officials took advantage of a woman with a history of mental problems, a 
charge Cunin denied. The case was settled in 1988 with an agreement that 
awarded about $21 million to Chabad, a sum Cunin later called "the Weinberg 
miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few years that money was depleted, according to Jerry Weintraub, the 
producer of "The Karate Kid" and other Hollywood movies, who acts as a co-host 
of the annual telethon and a major fund-raiser and informal financial adviser 
to Cunin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their finances are a mess," Weintraub said last week, adding that Cunin's 
determination to accede to most of the charitable requests crossing his desk 
confounded efforts to stabilize Chabad of California by creating an endowment 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, branches such as Cunin's are faced with the task of carrying on without 
their leader's physical presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all in inner turmoil," observed Weintraub in an interview shortly 
before the rebbe 's death. "Yet they try to carry on. I think when they close 
the door at night, they're frightened."

FINAL ARGUMENTS PAINT CONFLICTING VIEWS OF SEN. HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors at state Sen. Frank Hill's political corruption trial on Monday were 
painted two sharply contrasting portraits of the veteran Whittier Republican -- 
one a crooked politician willing to shake down a contributor, the other an 
honorable lawmaker misled by an aide. 
</P>
<P>
 In summing up his case on the trial's 16th day, Assistant U.S. Atty. John 
Vincent portrayed Hill as knowingly taking an illegal $2,500 payoff from an 
undercover FBI agent at a meeting in a hotel suite across from the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 On a grainy black-and-white video secretly taped in 1988 by the FBI and played 
to jurors on Monday, Hill told the agent that he would do everything he could 
to help get then-Gov. George Deukmejian to sign legislation that would benefit 
a shrimp company seeking to locate near Sacramento. In effect, Vincent said, 
Hill was telling the agent: "I'll do what you want me to do, what you paid me 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stephen D. Miller, Hill's lawyer, countered that Hill never entered into 
"an agreement to exchange money for official action. . . . That didn't happen 
in this orchestrated FBI sting." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Miller noted, the day after Hill received the "honorarium" -- 
normally a speaking fee -- the FBI agent posing as a businessman sought to 
clearly spell out the link between the money and the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank Hill firmly but politely declined," Miller reminded the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial resumed Monday after a weeklong vacation recess. 
</P>
<P>
 Both prosecutors and defense lawyers sought to spice up final arguments by 
displaying charts and chronologies and playing audio and video tapes to 
buttress their contentions. The arguments, which continue today, were made 
before a packed courtroom, including at least two of Hill's Republican 
legislative colleagues and Hill's family and other supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 40, is the first GOP lawmaker to stand trial in an ongoing series of 
cases stemming from an elaborate FBI undercover sting focused on public 
corruption in state government. Hill is charged with extortion, conspiracy and 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contend that he engaged in a conspiracy with former Republican 
Assembly Leader Pat Nolan, Nolan's special assistant Karin Watson and Senate 
Democratic aide Terry Frost. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan and Watson have pleaded guilty to corruption charges. Nolan is now 
serving a 33-month prison term, and Watson, the star witness against Hill, is 
awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, 44, is standing trial with Hill on one count of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In his final argument, Miller maintained that Hill was a victim of Watson's 
efforts to boost her position as a legislative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller cited a secretly recorded 1988 telephone conversation in which Watson 
proposes that then-Assemblyman Hill receive an honorarium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't I talk to Hill about doing something with George (the undercover 
FBI agent) and we'll do it as an honorarium," Watson is quoted as saying to an 
undercover informant, also part of the FBI sting. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutor Vincent argued that Watson, who worked directly for Hill in the 
mid-1980s, was doing exactly what Nolan and Hill wanted her to do. 
</P>
<P>
 As he periodically froze frames of the videotape, Vincent put his spin on 
Hill's acceptance of the $2,500 honorarium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Karin Watson and Frank Hill look like employees responding to their boss," he 
said, not public servants on the taxpayer payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent also questioned the reliability of a series of Hill's witnesses, 
including Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy. Vincent said that Maddy, who 
carried the shrimp bill on the Senate floor, and his aides "were not telling 
you everything they knew" in an effort to distance themselves from the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Frost, Vincent said his conversations were constantly laced with 
references linking money with official acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing secretly taped conversations during which Frost talked about money 
needed to win passage of the legislation, Vincent shook his head and said: "I 
don't want to be melodramatic, but it makes you sick to your stomach."

THE TIMES POLL; LITTLE SAIGON IS BIG IN HEARTS OF VIETNAMESE; THE WESTMINSTER 
ENCLAVE HAS BECOME A CULTURAL CENTER FOR THOUSANDS WHO FLED THEIR WAR-TORN 
NATION TO SETTLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT NOW HAS MORE THAN 1,600 ASIAN-RUN 
BUSINESSES.

<P>
 Every Saturday is market day for Thanh Tran. 
</P>
<P>
 The term loses some of its meaning when translated from Vietnamese, because 
the 65-year-old Anaheim woman does more than merely shop for groceries on this 
designated day. 
</P>
<P>
 Her routine starts at a food stand for an early morning breakfast of sweet, 
sticky rice and jasmine tea. It ends in the evening with dinner at a storefront 
restaurant that specializes in pho , the rice noodle soup that is as popular 
among Vietnamese as hamburgers are among Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Between breakfast and dinner, Tran idles away the hours browsing through shops 
specializing in Chinese teas and herbs, bakeries, fabric marts and, yes, 
supermarkets on the stretch of Bolsa Avenue that is Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't come to buy things," Tran said one Saturday afternoon, standing in 
front of a pastry shop, sipping iced sugar cane juice. "I come to see people, 
strangers mostly, who come . . . to do ordinary, everyday things, but in an 
environment where, because of the familiarity of faces and language, we never 
feel out of place." 
</P>
<P>
 For Tran, as for the vast majority of Vietnamese living in Southern 
California, the Little Saigon area of Westminster has become a cultural magnet 
-- a place for all things Vietnamese, from the food they eat to the sundries 
they need, to simply mingling with people who speak their language. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times poll found that almost half the Vietnamese in Southern 
California -- 47% -- consider Little Saigon their community's "most important" 
business, cultural and social center, while another 23% rated it "important."  
</P>
<P>
 The Times poll of 861 Vietnamese residents, conducted from March 28 through 
April 19 in Southern California, has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 
percentage points. The Times Poll is directed by John Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the people surveyed, 5% said it was not important at all, and only 2% said 
they had never heard of Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm surprised that those 2% even exist," said a 39-year-old Fullerton 
poll respondent who asked that his name not be used. "If Vietnamese from as far 
away as Vietnam, France and Australia know about this section (of Westminster), 
how could the ones here not know? Little Saigon is a big chunk of the history 
of Vietnamese in America." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is a history that is still recounted with pride, and more than a little 
incredulity, by city officials and ad-hoc planners responsible for Little 
Saigon's unambitious beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 It originated in the late 1970s in a blue-collar section of Westminster, where 
scattered bottling plants and flower warehouses, half-empty shopping centers 
and expansive bean and strawberry fields covered most of the landscape. Only 
four Vietnamese-run businesses -- a grocery store carrying mostly Asian food, 
an insurance office, a pharmacy and a restaurant -- dotted the area. 
</P>
<P>
 An astute businessman, Harry Wu, sold an idea to developer Frank Jao, who 
rounded up investors to buy up some relatively inexpensive Westminster property 
that would house businesses catering to the newly arriving Southeast Asian 
refugees, who were journeying 40 miles north to Los Angeles' Chinatown for 
ethnic groceries and food. 
</P>
<P>
 Khu Bon Sa, or Bolsa district as local Vietnamese called it, became almost 
immediately a hub for the refugees who would eventually number 70,500 in Orange 
County, making it the largest concentration of Vietnamese outside Vietnam. 
(Local Vietnamese leaders maintain that the actual population, with new and 
undeclared immigrants, is double the 70,572 counted by the 1990 U.S. Census.) 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the smoke-filled coffeehouses, bakeries, boutiques and restaurants -- 
all reminiscent of the fallen capital of the former South Vietnam -- beckoned 
to the expatriates who, in their hearts, still yearned for the tastes and 
textures of their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Khu Bon Sa eventually came to be known as "Little Saigon" as more than 700 
predominantly Vietnamese businesses sprouted in the area. In 1988, the 
quotation marks disappeared and the designation became official when the 
Westminster City Council proclaimed the district a social and cultural center 
for Vietnamese Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely knew Little Saigon would one day be an ethnic center for 
Southeast Asians," said developer Jao, who was and still is one of the main 
architects of the area. Jao's Asian Village and Asian Garden Mall have anchored 
the business district of mostly strip malls and family-owned operations for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't have the imagination to believe that it would be as big as it 
has become," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon may look 99% business. But for the older Vietnamese immigrants, 
it is 100% cultural and social. While members of other ethnic communities in 
the United States can freely make return visits to their homelands without fear 
of persecution, the Vietnamese here, most of whom had ties to the Saigon 
regime, believe they cannot do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, Little Saigon is their only reminder of, if not their only link to, 
the hometowns of their past, however Americanized it may be. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Little Saigon has between 1,600 and 2,000 Asian-run businesses, and has 
come to symbolize an immigrant success story. Its fame has also reached its 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Nguyen Ngoc Ha, president of the Committee for Vietnamese Residents Abroad 
in Ho Chi Minh City, the original Saigon, said, "of course we all know -- and 
it is with pride -- of the place called Little Saigon. In Paris, London, New 
York City, San Francisco, there are a number of Chinatowns. But there is only 
one place called Little Saigon, and for many Vietnamese not in Vietnam, it is 
like their second home." 
</P>
<P>
 The internationally known area is not without its problems and critics. And 
even its most ardent supporters have concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Public investment in the area became a political issue in the recent and 
unsuccessful campaign to recall some Westminster City Council members. The 
Westminster Citizens for a Responsible Government, in its campaign literature, 
alleged that the city was spending too much money to promote and develop Little 
Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese community leaders counter that those spearheading the recall 
campaign are trying to stoke the prejudice and fears of local residents. Also, 
the about $500,000 in annual tax revenues the district generates for the city 
has more than repaid its cost in development, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon has also been plagued with crime in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only go to Little Saigon in the daytime," said poll respondent Tam Tran, 
39, of Garden Grove. "There have just been too many stories of shootings, 
fistfights, purse-snatchings lately for my peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The public relations problems do not stop there. 
</P>
<P>
 A small number of non-Asians complain that an insular ethnic community like 
Little Saigon prevents some Vietnamese from successfully assimilating into 
mainstream, Western culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Dung Le, 27, a computer programmer from San Diego, dismisses such claims, 
which he calls "unfair and inaccurate." 
</P>
<P>
 "How could anyone begrudge the Vietnamese, or people of any other ethnicity, 
who want to spend some time in a place they feel culturally theirs," said Le, 
of San Diego, who visits Little Saigon once a month. "Plus, most of us don't 
live in Little Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, only 12% of Orange County Vietnamese residents actually reside in 
Little Saigon, according to the Times survey. In fact, just 11% of Vietnamese 
Americans in Southern California -- and 18% in Orange County -- say they live 
in predominantly Vietnamese areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But The Times Poll also found that while Southern California's Vietnamese 
immigrants have established their homes in neighborhoods that are ethnically 
heterogeneous, they have maintained their strongest bonds of friendship with 
other Vietnamese -- not unlike the patterns detected in an earlier Times Poll 
of Koreans. Only 33% of the Vietnamese said they have close friends who are 
non-Vietnamese, while 46% volunteered that their close friends were Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon's popularity transcends the generation gap too. The poll found 
that 49% of the younger generation of Vietnamese think of the area as the 
community's most important cultural asset, while 55% of those over 50 rated it 
that way.

<P>
 "I have my own life and other things to do, but I always come back" to Little 
Saigon, said Trina Vo, a 21-year-old Santa Ana resident and UCLA student. On 
this day, she was sitting with a group of friends, Vietnamese and white, on a 
bench outside a sandwich shop. All were enjoying their banh mi thit nguoi, a 
spicy Vietnamese version of a hoagie. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where my roots are," said Vo, "where I can practice my Vietnamese, 
where I can get authentic Vietnamese food." 
</P>
<P>
 But poll respondent Julie Nguyen, 23, of Gardena predicts that the area's 
popularity among the younger generation will fade. "The younger generation . . 
. (prefers) to shop in big malls like South Coast Plaza. By the time it comes 
to the third generation (of Vietnamese Americans), Little Saigon will have lost 
its significance to most of us," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract even more youths and non-Asian tourists, Vietnamese leaders say 
they hope to build a cultural center that would include a performing arts 
center, a museum, and art and Vietnamese history displays that would enhance 
what is a largely commercial district now. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the economy permits, I think all that would be possible in the next five 
years," said Westminster Councilman Tony Lam, who also was a major figure in 
the development of Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is studying recommendations of the ad-hoc Bolsa Corridor 
Citizen Advisory Committee, which outlined some long-range plans to make Little 
Saigon a tourist center for non-Asian visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations include landscaping, installing ornamental lighting on the 
district's streets, providing shuttle services and tours in the area, and 
building a visitor center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to market Little Saigon locally first and internationally later," 
said Frank Zellner, executive director of the Westminster Chamber of Commerce 
and a member of the advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Some developers, such as Jao, have plans to continue expanding the area. Jao 
has introduced the blueprints of Temple Village, a plaza with the ambience of 
the original Saigon, containing a pagoda and French Colonial buildings where 
business owners can live above their retail shops, restaurants or offices -- 
similar to the mixed residential-commercial development that exists in the 
cities of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Co Pham, president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, hopes Little Saigon 
will one day establish a lucrative trade with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all still in the distant future, of course, but why should we stop now," 
Pham said. "Little Saigon has come a long way in a relatively short period of 
time. We still have a lot of room to grow and a lot of dreams and plans to 
build on." Los Angeles Times Poll: An Ethnic Center of Gravity 
</P>
<P>
 The Little Saigon area of Westminster is generally viewed by the Southern 
California Vietnamese as a cultural center to which they throng for Asian 
products, food and the companionship of their countrymen. For the most part, 
they have established their homes in ethnically mixed neighborhoods and have 
more Vietnamese than non-Vietnamese friends.

 Source: Los Angeles Times Poll How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 861 adult Vietnamese residents of Los Angeles, 
Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties by telephone 
from March 28 through April 19, 1994. The questions were developed in 
consultation with Duong Pham, a visiting lecturer at UC Irvine and UCLA, and 
Khao Luu, president of the Assn. of Former Vietnamese Educators Overseas. The 
interviewing was conducted in Vietnamese and English by Vietnamese American 
interviewers at Interviewing Services of America Inc. of Van Nuys. A list of 
Vietnamese surnames was used to draw the samples from phone directories in the 
six counties. Results were adjusted slightly so that the sample conforms with 
census information about sex, age and education. Vietnamese residents of Orange 
County were oversampled and a total of 502 interviews were conducted there; 359 
were conducted in the other five counties.  
</P>
<P>
 Where Southern California results are cited, the Orange County sample is 
weighted to its proper proportion in the sample. The margin of sampling error 
for the entire sample is plus or minus 4 percentage points. For the Orange 
County sample, the error is plus or minus 5 percentage points and for the rest 
of the region it is plus or minus 7 points. The sampling error for other 
subgroups may vary. In addition to sampling error, poll results can be affected 
by other factors such as question wording and the order in which questions are 
presented. Additionally, surname samples of this type do not allow for the 
sampling of people with unlisted telephone numbers and Vietnamese residents who 
do not have Vietnamese surnames.

MACARTHUR GRANTS GO TO 4 CALIFORNIANS; HONORS: UCLA PROFESSOR, FOUNDER OF 
BILINGUAL RADIO STATION, STANFORD POET AND SAN FRANCISCO BOYS CLUB DIRECTOR ARE 
AMONG 20 RECIPIENTS OF THE PRESTIGIOUS FELLOWSHIPS. 
</P>

 A UCLA professor who is studying the effects of Eastern European nationalism 
on new immigrant populations and a Harvard University law school graduate who 
began the state's first bilingual radio station were among four Californians 
who received prestigious fellowships Monday from the John D. and Catherine T. 
MacArthur Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Other California winners included a former Stanford University poet and 
essayist, and the director of San Francisco's Omega Boys Club, which has 
implemented a violence- and drug-prevention program for inner-city youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The four were among 20 people nationwide who were given unrestricted, 
so-called genius grants worth between $235,000 and $375,000 over five years by 
the Chicago-based foundation. MacArthur fellows, chosen for their creativity 
and promise, cannot apply for the awards but are selected after their names are 
forwarded by anonymous nominators around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his home in Budapest, Hungary, where he is on sabbatical, UCLA 
assistant sociology professor Rogers Brubaker said Monday he was stunned by his 
award -- $245,000, which will be paid out over five years. He said the money 
will allow him to return to Hungary much sooner, after teaching several courses 
at UCLA this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Brubaker said he is trying to document the political and social tensions new 
Eastern European nations are experiencing as they deal with the 25 million 
Russians who were made expatriates overnight by the fall of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a potentially dangerous situation," Brubaker, 38, said about newly 
minted immigrants, whom he described as being caught in a triangle between 
their new countries and ethnic homelands. "It's already proven explosive in 
Yugoslavia and it's potentially explosive in certain parts of the Soviet 
Union," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation gave a $280,000 grant to Hugo Morales, the 1975 Harvard law 
grad who returned to the San Joaquin Valley and helped found Radio Bilingue in 
Fresno. It was the state's first bilingual radio station run by migrant workers 
for migrant workers; in 1992, its Spanish programming became available 
nationwide via a 24-hour satellite network. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Californians selected by the foundation included poet and feminist 
essayist Adrienne Rich, who will receive $374,000. Rich, 65, lives in Santa 
Cruz after retiring last year from teaching English and feminist studies at 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Her works have been translated into 10 languages, including Japanese and 
Ukrainian, and she won the National Book Award in 1974. Her latest collection 
of poems, "An Atlas of the Difficult World," was published in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph E. Marshall, 47, received $290,000 for his work as community organizer 
and executive director of the Omega Boys Club. Marshall's weekly San Francisco 
radio broadcast, "Street Soldiers," is part of his club's effort to divert 
vulnerable inner-city youth from lives of violence and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners included Arthur Mitchell, founder and artistic director of the 
Dance Theatre of Harlem; photographer Robert Adams of Longmont, Colo., known 
for his black-and-white images of the Western frontier; Sam-Ang Sam, director 
of the Cambodian Network Council in Washington, D.C., for his work to preserve 
the Khmer performing arts; and Willie Reale, founder and artistic director of 
the 52nd Street Project in New York City, which brings economically 
disadvantaged children together with professional actors and playwrights.

BOY, 3, RECOVERING AFTER 5 DAYS IN CAR WITH DEAD MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 3-year-old boy is recovering after spending five days next to his dead 
mother's body in a wrecked car off U.S. 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Skubish was suffering from dehydration and hypothermia and had turned 
blue when a deputy found him Saturday on the passenger seat next to the body of 
his mother, Christene Skubish. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to make it," said Dave Stautzenbach, the child's grandfather. 
"Right now, he's real weak, but he's eating. He's a super, tough kid." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was naked and curled in a fetal position when El Dorado County Deputy 
Rich Strasser discovered the wreckage on Saturday morning. Strasser said he 
assumed the child was dead, but checked for vital signs and found he was 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was taken to the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. By late 
Sunday, his condition was upgraded from critical to fair, and his release is 
expected within days.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nicky's starting to remember things," said Karen Nichols-Daniels, a 
great-aunt. "He said there was a tree lying on his mommy and he said he 
couldn't open the door." 
</P>
<P>
 The car plunged off the highway east of Sacramento and wound up at the bottom 
of a 40-foot embankment. The roof was torn off. 
</P>
<P>
 Strasser said that Christene Skubish probably died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was covered with scratches and had blisters from exposure to poison 
oak, Nichols-Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strasser had spotted the boy's tennis shoe on the side of the highway 
Saturday, and then found the car. He believes the boy at some point climbed 
from the car to the highway, and then returned to the car. That is the only 
explanation for the shoe being on the road, Strasser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain mysteries remain about the case. Police were initially alerted by a 
motorist's report of a naked woman on U.S. 50. But no such woman was found. 
However, the boy was nude. His clothing was in the car, Strasser said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; MEXICO UNEASE RISES WITH REJECTION; NEGOTIATIONS: CHIAPAS 
REBELS' REFUSAL TO ACCEPT GOVERNMENT PEACE PLAN FUELS SENSE OF NATIONAL 
INSTABILITY. THE CASE OF A MURDERED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS FAR FROM 
RESOLVED, AND DRUG-RELATED VIOLENCE CONTINUES. 
</P>

<P>
 Just two months before the Mexican presidential election, the Indian rebels' 
weekend rejection of the government's peace offer has added another element of 
uncertainty to an increasingly unstable atmosphere here, analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides failing to resolve the uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, the 
government appears further than ever from concluding its investigation into the 
assassination of ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
Officials have been unable to halt narcotics-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one more element of uncertainty, violence and difficulty that piles 
onto what there already is," political analyst Jorge Castaneda said. "That 
can't be good." 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda recently hosted a controversial luncheon for 40 political and 
intellectual leaders here to discuss ways to avert the mounting threat of 
general instability and possible violence in connection with Mexico's Aug. 21 
federal elections. His efforts, and others, are occurring even as a sense of 
unease is growing that the government cannot adequately deal with the nation's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, a car bomb exploded outside a major hotel in Guadalajara -- 
Mexico's second-largest city and narcotics center -- where a family linked to 
drug dealers celebrated a teen-ager's birthday with a party for 200 guests. At 
the party, police found place cards with names of individuals related to 
convicted drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero. 
</P>
<P>
 Police blamed the bombing, which killed at least two people, on a rival drug 
gang, making it the latest in a series of narcotics-related incidents across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Diana Laura Riojas, Colosio's widow, last week appointed her own 
lawyer to participate in the trial of her husband's alleged assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 This move has been widely perceived to indicate that she lacks confidence in 
the floundering investigation of her husband's killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims' families have standing in Mexican courts equal to that of the 
prosecutor and defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter published in the independent magazine Proceso, Riojas asked the 
special prosecutor to consider a third theory about her husband's murder: that 
he was killed neither by a conspiracy, as authorities had originally said, nor 
by a lone gunman, as the chief investigator now contends. 
</P>
<P>
 She suggested that a mastermind may have used Mario Aburto Martinez, now 
jailed and awaiting trial on charges he killed Colosio, as a weapon against her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans have widely rejected the theory that Aburto, a 23-year-old factory 
worker, acted alone when he killed Colosio after a campaign rally in a 
working-class Tijuana neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Chiapas situation, some observers believe the rebels have 
recognized that Mexicans increasingly distrust the government. The rebels, 
accordingly, have decided that approving official peace proposals would make 
them appear to be taking the side of a failing administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be like offering political backing to a regime that is in its 
weakest moment," political analyst Sergio Sarmiento wrote in El Financiero 
business newspaper. "They are sending a message to the government of 
(President) Carlos Salinas (de Gortari) that they will not accept a peace 
proposal that could end the regime's political worries" and they now have 
something to hang over the president and his party's handpicked candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Ernesto Zedillo -- now the candidate of the party that has 
ruled Mexico for 65 years -- reacted angrily to the rebels' rejection of the 
peace proposal. "This has been a great disillusionment," he told backers in 
Villahermosa, a city near the Chiapas border. "We were sure that the 
negotiations had been a success. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcela Lombardo, the presidential candidate of the tiny, leftist Popular 
Socialist Party, called the rebels' action an attempt to cloud the election. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zedillo's nearest rival -- Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the right-center 
National Action Party -- said he expected the "confusing" plan would be 
rejected.

SOCIAL PROGRAMS; CLINTON'S WELFARE REFORMS SHAPED BY PREDECESSORS' FRUSTRATED 
EFFORTS; THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN SHARES SIMILARITIES WITH OTHER ATTEMPTS. BUT IT 
DIFFERS IN WAYS THAT REFLECT CHANGING ATTITUDES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Nixon promised "total welfare reform -- the transformation of a system 
frozen in failure." Jimmy Carter asked Congress "to abolish our existing 
welfare system." Ronald Reagan called for "real and lasting emancipation" from 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Bill Clinton, who will release a reform plan in Kansas City today 
that is intended to redeem his promise "to end welfare as we know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Like his predecessors', Clinton's plan begins with the assumption that the 
welfare system has failed both the taxpaying public and those it is intended to 
help. But, in both its ambitions and its modesty, Clinton's plan has been 
shaped by the frustrations that these earlier reform efforts left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The most ambitious aspects of Clinton's plan attempt to distill into social 
policy a widening public consensus around both the importance of work and the 
urgency of reversing the growing trend toward out-of-wedlock births and 
single-parent families. In the plan, Clinton will require even the mothers of 
very young children to accept work after two years on the rolls, and launch 
several controversial initiatives to discourage illegitimacy -- ideas almost 
entirely absent in the earlier reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The times have changed and today's debate reflects the changed times," says 
Richard P. Nathan, who directed Nixon's welfare reform effort. "The centrist 
Democrats today are further to the right than Nixon and the centrist 
Republicans were in the 1970s." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, Clinton's plan envisions much more incremental change in the welfare 
system than the sweeping reforms Nixon and Carter offered. Constrained by the 
budget deficit and faced with public skepticism over the government's ability 
to manage large-scale public works programs, Clinton will cautiously phase-in 
his two-year time limit by imposing it only on recipients born after 1971. That 
will keep down the plan's cost to $9.3 billion over five years -- but will mean 
that only half the caseload will face the work requirement by then, a prospect 
that has led critics to call the plan "marginal tinkering." 
</P>
<P>
 What Clinton's plan shares most prominently with its predecessors is uncertain 
prospects in a Congress polarized over how to reform a system that has proved 
remarkably resistant to meaningful change. "What's the same is that this city 
has the ability to take the best reform ideas, wherever they are coming from, 
and ultimately turn them into mush," says Gary Bauer, Reagan's domestic policy 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Nixon's "Family Assistance Plan" and Carter's "Program for Better Jobs 
and Income" fell into a valley of disdain between liberals and conservatives 
and failed to clear Congress -- although each offered more generous aid 
packages than anything under consideration today. The Nixon plan offered a 
guaranteed minimum income to all families with children, conditioned in most 
cases on accepting work; Carter's would have created a vast public employment 
plan for welfare recipients and the jobless, broadening eligibility to include 
childless couples and single adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Reagan, Congress in 1988 finally approved a major reform: the Family 
Support Act. But inadequate funding and delays in implementation have diluted 
its impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's call for requiring work after two years echoes the goals of these 
plans. In the first decades after Congress federalized the welfare program in 
1935, women generally were expected to stay at home to rear their children, 
observes University of Wisconsin historian Linda Gordon in her forthcoming book 
"Pitied But Not Entitled: Single Mothers and the History of Welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the percentage of women with children working outside the home 
increased, so did demands that welfare recipients work. In response to those 
shifting attitudes, the plans developed under Nixon, Carter and Reagan each 
sought the same balance: increasing the availability of child care and job 
training for welfare recipients, and then requiring more of them to work. 
Clinton's plan shares that approach, but differs in ways that illuminate 
changing attitudes toward the family and government alike. 
</P>
<P>
 * Under Nixon's plan, mothers with children 6 years old and younger were 
exempt from work requirements; Carter's plan exempted women with children up to 
age 7. Even the Family Support Act in 1988 exempted women with children under 
age 3. Clinton's plan will exempt from work only women with children 1 year old 
or younger -- and provide subsequent exemptions of only 12 weeks for children 
conceived while their mothers were on welfare, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton's plan also reflects the eroding confidence in government's capacity 
to design and administer massive new programs -- as well as the increasing 
strain on its purse. The Carter plan would have created as many as 1.4 million 
public sector jobs. Clinton's calls for government to fund about 400,000 jobs 
for welfare recipients five years after implementation -- and even many of 
those would be subsidized private-sector work, rather than public employment.  
</P>
<P>
 The increased emphasis on values -- particularly deterring out-of-wedlock 
births -- constitutes an even sharper break between Clinton's effort and its 
recent predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, this renewed focus on personal behavior echoes the welfare 
system's priorities in the first half of the century, when case workers 
aggressively policed the behavior of welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 That intrusive moral inspection faded after World War II, and appeared in 
complete retreat even after the illegitimate birth rate started rising after 
1960. The defining moment came in 1965 when Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then an 
assistant secretary of labor, wrote a paper warning that the black community 
was imperiled by a growing rate of out-of-wedlock births -- then almost 1 in 4 
of all births to African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan was roundly and ferociously denounced. In a typical response, civil 
rights leader Bayard Rustin said: "What may seem to be a disease to the white 
middle class may be a healthy adaptation to the Negro lower class." 
</P>
<P>
 Such arguments are still part of the political dialogue, but they have been 
largely marginalized at a time when 30% of all births, and two-thirds of black 
births, occur outside of marriage. With the public, there is now "a consensus 
that you ought to discourage out-of-wedlock births," says political pollster 
Geoff Garin, who has extensively examined public attitudes toward welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 That consensus rests on a different foundation than the fears of "immorality" 
that dominated welfare policy in the first half of this century. Today, what's 
primarily driving the anxiety over births outside marriage are practical fears 
that family disintegration is contributing to crime, urban disorder and a cycle 
of dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the question of how to reverse the trend remains enormously controversial, 
with most Americans hesitant about any programs that "punish innocent 
children," as Garin says. 
</P>

 In his plan, Clinton will propose a nationwide campaign to discourage teen-age 
pregnancy -- including efforts to encourage abstinence, requirements that 
teen-agers receiving welfare live at home or with other responsible adults and, 
most controversially, giving blanket approval for states to deny recipients 
additional benefits for children conceived while they are already on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals denounce that "family cap" as punitive and ineffective and are 
mobilizing against it. But with illegitimacy fused in the public mind to the 
issue of crime, Clinton's biggest problem may be preventing the debate from 
careening further to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Already ideas to deter illegitimacy are proliferating that are far tougher 
than his. Conservative social policy theorist Charles Murray has found a wide 
Republican audience for his proposal to cut off all welfare for women who bear 
children out of wedlock; a handful of other policy analysts, led by 
criminologists James Q. Wilson and John J. DiIulio Jr., are attracting 
increasing notice with calls for encouraging (or requiring) more unmarried 
mothers to place their children in orphanages and foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
 If some worry that unhappiness with the present system will produce change 
that is too radical, the most common fear is the opposite: that Congress will 
be unable to reach enough consensus to launch a significant departure. The same 
sort of left-right cross-fire that sank Nixon's and Carter's efforts is already 
pounding at Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take all of Clinton's political skills to avoid his predecessors' 
frustration. "It is," says Nathan, "a very delicate balancing act to try to get 
a coalition to reform welfare." More Families on Welfare 
</P>
<P>
 The President's proposal focuses on Aid to Families With Dependent Children. 
The number of families receiving such assistance more than doubled from 1970 to 
1990, a period when the U.S. population rose by 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY ELEMENTS OF THE CLINTON PLAN 
</P>
<P>
 * 2-YEAR LIMIT: A 24-month lifetime limit on cash benefits for anyone over the 
age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
 * PUBLIC-SECTOR JOBS: Subsidized private-sector jobs or community service, at 
minimum wage, for those who exhaust two-year cash benefits and have not found a 
job of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 * CHILD SUPPORT: New penalties for those who refuse to pay, and a national 
child support clearinghouse to track payments and catch parents who flee across 
state lines to avoid paying. 
</P>
<P>
 Families receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children, in millions: 1970: 
1.90 1975: 3.34 1980: 3.64 1985: 3.69 1990: 3.97

NEWS ANALYSIS; STUNNING EU PARLIAMENT OUTCOME REVERBERATES THROUGH A CONTINENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Direct elections to the European Parliament are barely 15 years old and have 
been of only marginal importance. But results of Sunday's voting for the 
567-seat house have sent political shock waves rumbling through the Continent's 
Western half. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the election had greater significance because the stakes are higher: 
Not only is Europe in the midst of its greatest transition since it was first 
divided by the Cold War more than four decades ago, but the European Parliament 
has also begun to assume some genuine power. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, however, the importance was not only that moderate, mainstream 
parties managed to keep control of the remote Strasbourg, France-based 
Parliament, which serves as the European Union's legislature, at a time when 
Western Europe has again begun flirting with political extremes. It also 
quickly became clear that the effect of Sunday's election results on the 
national political landscapes of the 12 member countries was considerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he wasn't even a candidate for the Parliament, the biggest single 
winner may have been German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, now in the midst of a tough 
Bundestag reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys in recent weeks had indicated that Kohl's Christian Democrats were 
gaining ground on the front-running opposition Social Democrats. But the extent 
of his party's strength in winning almost half of Germany's 99 seats in the 
European Parliament was largely unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 The chancellor, who a few short months ago hardly seemed to have a chance at 
reelection, suddenly faced the problem Monday of dampening the euphoria of 
excited supporters. "Yesterday's victory doesn't mean we can relax," Kohl said. 
"We have to fight for every vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Only the abysmal showing of Kohl's junior coalition partner, the Free 
Democrats, provided cause for worry. The Free Democrats -- the party of Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel and his predecessor, Hans-Dietrich Genscher -- won fewer 
votes than the retooled East German Communist Party and failed to get the 5% 
necessary under German law to win any seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a shock for a party that has been in every Bonn government 
since 1969; it left the chancellor's supporters concerned, because without the 
Free Democrats, Kohl's own party would find it extremely difficult to build a 
majority coalition in October. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for Kohl's turnaround seem twofold and have little to do with his 
party's European policies:  
</P>
<P>
 * Germany's gradual emergence from its deepest recession since the 
Wirtschaftswunder -- Germany's miraculous postwar ascension to economic power 
-- has revived confidence in his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 * A series of campaign blunders by the Social Democrats. These include a 
damaging internal feud in the party's platform-drafting committee last April 
and comments by party leader Rudolf Scharping that made him appear a poor loser 
after last month's presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Another definite winner in Monday's election was Italy's new premier, Silvo 
Berlusconi, and his Forza Italia (Go Italy), a party that is less than a year 
old but already the bulwark of the government and a magnet for discontented 
voters. With Berlusconi heading the ticket, Forza Italia won 30.6% of the 
European Parliament votes, an increase of almost 50% over its winning general 
election performance in March. His controversial coalition allies, the federal 
Northern League (6.6%) and the neo-fascist National Alliance (12.5%), both lost 
ground compared with their showings in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian vote gave a powerful endorsement to Berlusconi's search for 
free-market change and government efficiency. It also reaffirmed the Democratic 
Party of the Left, the former Communist Party, as the strongest opposition 
force with 19.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Achille Occhetto had led the Democratic Party of the Left to a new name and a 
new image but proved unable to overcome its also-ran status. On Monday, he 
quit, acknowledging that the party needs new leadership to remain a viable 
alternative to conservative rule. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Kohl and Berlusconi were winners, the biggest losers in Sunday's 
election were easily British Prime Minister John Major and his Spanish 
counterpart, Felipe Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 In an admittedly low turnout, Major's Conservative Party managed to gather 
only 28% of the vote, the worst Tory showing in nationwide polling since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 The results left Labor as the largest single national party represented in the 
Strasbourg Parliament, with 62 of Britain's 87 seats. The Conservatives will 
have 18 seats. "The fact is," said acting Labor Party leader Margaret Beckett, 
"that last night's results showed the mantle of trust has passed firmly to 
Labor." 
</P>
<P>
 Spain's Gonzalez had limped to a new term in elections a year ago by 
outpointing Popular Party conservatives headed by Jose Maria Aznar. On Sunday, 
voters sent Gonzalez -- who has been in power for a dozen years -- an 
unmistakable message, sending Conservatives to Strasbourg by a 4-3 margin. 
Observers in Madrid say the conservative victory could force early elections in 
Spain, either this fall or next spring.

DEFENSE CHIEF SAYS HE'LL CUT RUSSIAN TROOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rebuffed by the president and Parliament in an appeal for a bigger budget, 
Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev said Monday that he will cut Russia's armed 
forces from 2.2 million to 1.9 million personnel by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned retrenchment would mean an army with 200,000 fewer members than 
the force that Grachev defined six months ago as the minimum Russia needed to 
guarantee its security. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev reported the planned cuts in brief remarks to the Russian news agency 
Interfax. He said they would hit officers as well as soldiers and that 270 out 
of 2,050 positions on the armed forces' general staff would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense minister, an army general, suffered two setbacks last week in his 
public campaign to raise the 1994 military budget from $19 billion (37 trillion 
rubles) to what he called a "subsistence level" of $28.2 billion. As it stands, 
he said, the budget can cover only the salaries of service people and other 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the intense lobbying, the Duma, or lower house of Parliament, 
voted Wednesday to raise spending on the armed forces to $20.5 billion -- a 
defeat for Grachev. Two days later, President Boris N. Yeltsin sided with the 
Duma and rebuked his minister in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The army should be more active in cutting the number of servicemen," Yeltsin 
said in a nationally televised news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The president offered the military an extra $512 million in off-budget funds, 
such as revenue from the sale of jet fighters abroad. But he rejected a 
wholesale increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending on the armed forces accounts for about 20% of the budget, but critics 
of the military say hidden defense outlays bring the total to more than half of 
all government spending.

ACCUSED PALESTINIAN KILLER SAYS HE BLEW UP FLIGHT 103; TERRORISM: FOLLOWER OF 
ABU NIDAL STUNS COURT WITH CLAIM HE PLANTED BOMB ON PAN AM JET IN 1988. EXPERTS 
ARE SKEPTICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An accused Palestinian assassin confessed Monday to the murder of 270 people, 
stunning a Beirut courtroom with an unsubstantiated claim that in 1988, he 
personally blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanese prosecutors said they will investigate Youssef Shaaban's claim but 
stressed that they doubted his confession. It reportedly came after the 
29-year-old follower of terrorist leader Abu Nidal denied charges that he shot 
and killed a Jordanian diplomat near the diplomat's Beirut home in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lockerbie bombing, one of the bloodiest terrorist attacks in recent years, 
remains a major international political issue. The American and British 
governments initially blamed Iran for the crime, then Syria, and finally 
insisted that two suspected senior Libyan intelligence agents were behind the 
bombing. They persuaded the U.N. Security Council to punish Libya with 
international sanctions in an attempt to force it to turn over the two men to 
stand trial in the United States or Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the lawyer for the two Libyan suspects -- Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi 
and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah -- applauded Shaaban's confession in Beirut, asserting 
it proved his clients' innocence. But British and American officials insisted 
that Libya still bears the blame for a bombing that stunned the world. 
</P>
<P>
 American counterterrorism officials said Monday that they had never ruled out 
a role by others besides the Libyans. "We're going to follow up very hard on 
all leads, including this one, just to make sure we've left nothing unturned," 
a senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But counterterrorism experts, public and private, expressed deep suspicions. 
"There are enough inconsistencies to make us doubt him," a senior U.S. official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaaban would have been only 23 at the time of the 1988 bombing. "That's 
fairly young to have put together a complicated bomb and such a complicated 
operation all by himself," the official added. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Shaaban's claim does not conform with Abu Nidal's usual tactics. "He 
never went in for aviation terrorism, especially anything as sophisticated as 
this," said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism specialist at the RAND Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials and terrorism specialists suggest that Shaaban's claim may 
be part of a Libyan campaign to shift the blame from the two Libyans indicted 
by the United States and Scotland and, in turn, to get painful international 
economic sanctions lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of an operation. It's deliberately exploiting the use of someone 
already going down for another crime -- in this case the assassination of a 
Jordanian diplomat -- to accept responsibility for something that he could not 
possibly have done," said Vince Cannistraro, a former CIA terrorism specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of the bombing victims were skeptical as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Swire -- chief spokesman and activist for families of British passengers 
killed when the Pan Am Boeing 747 exploded en route to New York over the 
Scottish village, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 more on the ground -- 
said Shaaban's assertion "should be regarded with grave suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be that he is seeking to attract what terrorists might regard as 
kudos for the Abu Nidal organization," Swire said, referring to the 
Revolutionary Council of Fatah founded by the Palestinian activist.  
</P>
<P>
 Shaaban's remarks -- which the judge ordered stricken as irrelevant to the 
case, according to Reuters news service -- reportedly came after Shaaban denied 
gunning down Jordan's second-ranking diplomat in Beirut on Jan. 29. Shaaban's 
public trial has become the centerpiece of a Lebanese government campaign to 
prove that Beirut's decades of lawlessness are at an end.

BLACK LEADERS VOW UNITED FRONT TO TACKLE PROBLEMS; CIVIL RIGHTS: PLANNED 
ALLIANCE WILL TARGET YOUTH, URBAN ILLS. FARRAKHAN TONES DOWN HIS RHETORIC AT 
THREE-DAY SUMMIT ORGANIZED BY THE NAACP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rare show of unity, a host of African American leaders, ranging from the 
controversial Louis Farrakhan to the mainstream Jesse Jackson, pledged to form 
a coalition Monday to seek solutions to some of the problems that bedevil black 
youths and black urban communities. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve this unity, Nation of Islam leader Farrakhan, denounced often by 
outsiders for a drumbeat of what seems like anti-Semitism and anti-white 
sentiment in his speeches, spoke in somewhat conciliatory tones and effusively 
praised the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People for convening 
the three-day National African-American Leadership Summit, which closes today. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that many outsiders had objected to the invitation extended to him by 
the NAACP, Farrakhan said: "This is a family matter, and I am a member of our 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a meeting in Dunbar Community High School in Baltimore that was 
televised nationally by Black Entertainment Television, Farrakhan said: "The 
NAACP is the oldest, most credible civil rights organization in this country. 
I'm a life member of the NAACP . . . So I don't believe I'm a stranger. I've 
been invited into a house that belongs, in part, to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Alluding to threats to boycott the NAACP for inviting him, Farrakhan said: 
"You cannot punish us for coming together as a family . . . If anyone threatens 
us because we are coming together, then we will deal with it at the appropriate 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who has campaigned in the past for the Democratic Party nomination 
for President, looked uncomfortable with some of the rhetoric in the auditorium 
and tried to temper it from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson objected when John Henry Clark, a popular historian, called on African 
Americans to help stamp out white power in South Africa. Clark told the 
audience that President Nelson Mandela does not really rule South Africa 
because its economy and infrastructure were still in the hands of the whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Africa will be free in the only way it can be free," Clark said to 
thunderous applause. "People spilled your blood to take your country. You're 
going to have to spill the blood to take it back." 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not accept his conclusion," Jackson said. " . . . I believe an eye for 
an eye, a tooth for a tooth and a life for a life leaves you blind, disfigured 
and dead. Someone has to stop the killing." 
</P>
<P>
 But there were few conflicts like this in the two-hour meeting that included 
statements from a dozen African American leaders and a few questions from 
viewers and members of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., the NAACP executive director who conceived the idea of 
the summit, said that the leaders had already decided that the coalition would 
continue after the summit and would meet again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the meetings were closed to the news media, Chavis said that the 
leaders had been discussing empowerment of black youth, economic development of 
black communities and spiritual uplift. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must develop African American businesses and support them when they are 
developed," Chavis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders may offer more details about their goals when the summit closes.

CLINTONS QUESTIONED IN WHITEWATER PROBE; INQUIRY: THE FIRST COUPLE ARE 
INTERVIEWED UNDER OATH BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. HE IS EXPECTED TO RELEASE HIS 
PRELIMINARY REPORT SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were questioned under 
oath at the White House Sunday by special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. about 
matters related to the Whitewater investigation, including the apparent suicide 
of presidential aide Vincent W. Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewing the Clintons was understood to be one of Fiske's last tasks 
before he issues a preliminary report dealing with the circumstances behind 
Foster's death last summer, the subsequent decision of White House aides to 
remove some files from Foster's office and contacts between the White House and 
Treasury Department related to the Whitewater inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 By agreement with Fiske, Congress has been waiting until it receives his 
preliminary report before it conducts hearings on Whitewater. Republicans are 
anxious to investigate White House contacts with Treasury officials and other 
government employees responsible for investigating savings and loan owner James 
B. McDougal, who was a business partner with the Clintons in the Whitewater 
real estate development in the Ozark Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler disclosed the 
barest details of the meeting between Fiske and the Clintons. Cutler said the 
Clintons' willingness to answer questions under oath is consistent with their 
pledge to cooperate with the special counsel's inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Clinton and his wife were 
interviewed separately -- the President for about 90 minutes and the First Lady 
for about an hour. She indicated that the pair answered all questions put to 
them without invoking the 5th Amendment or executive privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is still considered unusual for a President to submit to 
questioning under oath in legal inquiries, several recent chief executives have 
done so. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Richard Nixon was never interviewed under oath about the 
Watergate scandal. But his successor, Gerald R. Ford, testified under oath at a 
congressional hearing about his 1974 pardon of Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Jimmy Carter gave a sworn deposition while President when Bert 
Lance, his former budget director, was under investigation for financial 
malfeasance. Ronald Reagan answered questions about the Iran-Contra scandal, 
but did not testify under oath until after leaving the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And George Bush was interviewed about Iran-Contra while he was vice president 
and again while he was President but after he had been defeated for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler indicated that the Clintons were interviewed only about Foster's death 
and the Treasury-White House contacts during the government's investigation of 
McDougal's Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, a former law partner of Mrs. Clinton, was found dead in a suburban 
Virginia park more than a year ago with a bullet wound in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Foster's death was ruled a suicide, Clinton's political critics 
called for an investigation when it was learned that files relating to the 
Whitewater development had been removed from his office shortly after his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rambling note found in shreds at the bottom of Foster's briefcase, he 
said: "The public will never believe the innocence of the Clintons and their 
loyal staff." It was not clear what he meant. 
</P>
<P>
 Following its investigation of the collapse of Madison, the Resolution Trust 
Corp. sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department suggesting that some 
of the money from the thrift may have been diverted to the Whitewater 
development jointly owned by McDougal and the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, White House officials were accused of making improper contacts 
about the investigation with Treasury, which oversees the RTC. As a result of 
his role in these contacts and in ordering files removed from Foster's office, 
former White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Whitewater allegations were not raised with the Clintons, according to 
Cutler. As a result, Fiske and his investigative team are expected to seek yet 
another interview with the Clintons to question them about their relationship 
with McDougal and allegations that their partnership in Whitewater was designed 
as a way to compensate them for political favors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Fiske, others present at the interviews of the Clintons were 
Cutler, Clinton lawyer Donald Kendall, an associate of Fiske and a 
stenographer.

HIGH COURT OKS HOMEOWNER'S RIGHT TO DISPLAY PROTEST SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, upholding a homeowner's right to protest the Persian Gulf 
War from her front lawn, ruled Monday that city officials may not enforce a 
total ban on signs and billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Even an affluent suburb's desire to preserve its natural, woodsy appearance 
does not justify barring an individual from putting a protest sign outside her 
home, the court said in a 9-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The free-speech guarantee in the 1st Amendment prohibits officials from 
"almost completely foreclosing a venerable means of communication," such as 
displaying a sign or billboard, wrote Justice John Paul Stevens. While 
officials certainly can regulate the size and location of signs, they may not 
forbid them entirely, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision follows a long line of court rulings that have said activities 
such as soliciting and picketing can be regulated but not forbidden altogether. 
For example, the court in 1987 struck down an ordinance barring the 
distribution of leaflets and soliciting in the Los Angeles International 
Airport terminal. Five years later, however, the justices upheld other airport 
ordinances that restricted the locations where advocates could distribute 
leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's ruling is a victory for Margaret P. Gilleo, a homeowner in Ladue, 
Mo., a wealthy suburb of St. Louis. In December, 1990, she irked her neighbors 
by erecting on her front lawn a 2-by-3-foot sign that declared: "Say No to War 
in the Persian Gulf. Call Congress Now." When vandals stole the sign, she put a 
similar sign in her second-story window.  
</P>
<P>
 But city officials then informed her that her signs, including the smaller one 
in the window, were illegal. A city ordinance prohibited the display of nearly 
all signs, with but a few exceptions. These included foot-square signs to 
identify a residence or to announce that a property was for sale or rent. 
Identifying signs for schools, business and churches also were allowed.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that they feared "a proliferation of an unlimited number 
of signs (which) would create ugliness, visual blight and clutter." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilleo filed a suit in which she contended that enforcing the ordinance 
against her violated the 1st Amendment. A federal judge agreed and the U.S. 
appeals court in St. Louis affirmed the decision on grounds that the city law 
discriminated in favor of real estate signs and against political signs.  
</P>
<P>
 In October, the high court agreed to hear the case (Ladue vs. Gilleo, 
92-1856), possibly to reconsider the notion that the 1st Amendment forbids laws 
that discriminate among types of expression. This approach has caused some 
confusion because it suggests, for example, that Ladue's ordinance would be 
constitutional if it also banned building identifications and for sale signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of trying to clarify that doctrine, the justices unanimously agreed 
that Ladue officials could not stop Gilleo from displaying her political sign.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is common ground that governments may regulate the physical 
characteristics of signs, within reasonable bounds and absent censorial 
purpose," Stevens wrote. "We are confident that more temperate measures could 
in large part satisfy Ladue's state regulatory needs without harm to the 1st 
Amendment rights of its citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 In a second ruling (Ibanez vs. Florida, 93-639) upholding rights under the 1st 
Amendment, the justices said that Florida officials may not punish an attorney 
for truthfully advertising that she is also a certified public accountant and a 
financial planner.

QUICK HOUSE VOTE SOUGHT ON REGULATION OF TOBACCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Three key congressional tobacco foes said Monday that they will try to get a 
quick House vote on legislation that would require the Food and Drug 
Administration to regulate tobacco but would forbid the agency to ban 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps.Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), Mike Synar (D-Okla.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) 
said that they have asked the Rules Committee to allow the amendment to be 
attached to the agriculture appropriations bill so that it could be put on a 
fast track to a House vote. Usually, legislation cannot be attached to a 
spending bill but the Rules Committee can waive that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision by the Rules Committee could come today or Wednesday and the House 
could take up the measure later this week. The lawmakers made it clear that the 
amendment was not meant to imply that the FDA does not already have the 
authority to regulate tobacco products. But they said that it would allow 
Congress to vote on specific aspects of tobacco regulation that the FDA should 
address. It "would ensure that the FDA regulates tobacco in certain areas while 
guaranteeing that cigarettes will not be banned," they said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA already believes that it has the authority to regulate cigarettes as 
drugs because of the addictive nature of nicotine and has been working in 
recent months to build a case for such regulation. Nevertheless, FDA 
Commissioner David A. Kessler has asked for direction from Congress before 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, said that the industry 
has "a longstanding opposition to the FDA's regulation of a product that is not 
a food, not a drug and not a cosmetic." Passage of the amendment would usher in 
"a new era of prohibition," he added.

TREATMENT CALLED BEST WAY TO CUT COCAINE USE; HEALTH: RAND STUDY SAYS PROGRAMS 
TO CONTROL ADDICTION ARE SEVEN TIMES MORE COST-EFFECTIVE THAN LAW ENFORCEMENT 
METHODS IN REDUCING CONSUMPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Drug treatment programs are seven times more economical than law enforcement 
efforts in reducing the use of cocaine and appear to be the most effective 
method of all, according to a major study released Monday by the RAND think 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Making such programs available to all heavy cocaine users would reduce 
consumption of the drug by a third, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the work by Santa Monica-based RAND tends to support the treatment-based 
approach to drug addiction favored by the Clinton Administration, it raises 
questions about another Administration policy -- trying to stem the flow of 
drugs from the countries that process and distribute them. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, based on research by C. Peter Rydell and Susan S. Everingham, was 
said to be the first of its kind to compare the cost-effectiveness of various 
cocaine control programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred W. Garcia, a deputy director in the White House national drug control 
policy office, which helped fund the $340,000 study, hailed the conclusion on 
the relative value of treatment. But he was less enthusiastic about evidence 
that the least effective programs are those designed to control cocaine at its 
source -- primarily in Peru, Bolivia and Colombia.  
</P>
<P>
 He said that the study did not take into account other objectives of 
international drug strategy -- such as strengthening U.S. national security, 
"promoting the development of democratic institutions and the rule of law and 
fostering economic security and growth."  
</P>
<P>
 The number of cocaine users in the United States has dropped from 9 million in 
the early 1980s to a little more than 7 million today. Nonetheless, overall 
consumption stands at its mid-1980s peak because the number of "light users" 
has declined while "heavy users" have increased, according to the study. Heavy 
users accounted for more than two-thirds of cocaine demand, up from less than 
half in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The study defined heavy use as once a week or more and light use as at least 
once a year, but not as often as weekly. At the end of 1992, the nation had 5.6 
million light users and 1.7 million heavy users, RAND found. 
</P>
<P>
 Using 1992 data, the study said that federal, state, local and private sources 
spent a total of $13 billion for four types of cocaine control programs 
examined by the study. Domestic enforcement -- drug arrests, jails and prisons 
-- accounted for 73% of the cost. Interdiction (trying to stop the drugs from 
entering the country) accounted for 13% of the cost, and treatment and 
source-country control, 7% each. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment was defined in the study as a mixture of relatively inexpensive 
outpatient and relatively expensive residential programs designed to treat both 
the physical and psychological reasons for addiction. Their average cost was 
estimated at $1,740 per patient. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In finding that treatment for heavy users was seven times more cost-effective 
in reducing cocaine consumption than domestic enforcement, the study said that 
annual consumption could be cut 1% if $34 million more were spent on treatment, 
while $246 million would be needed to achieve the same reduction through 
domestic enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Interdiction would need $366 million of additional spending to do the job, 
while source-country control would require $783 million.

HASIDIC MOVEMENT BEGAN 200 YEARS AGO IN EASTERN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hasidism -- a popular religious movement marked by ecstasy, mass enthusiasm 
and charismatic leadership -- has survived the attacks of mainstream rabbis, 
the spread of Western culture and the ravages of Nazism to emerge as one of the 
most influential strains of modern Judaism. While not the largest, Chabad 
Lubavitch is the best known Hasidic sect today. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasidism started as a persecuted group of followers of an itinerant healer 
known as the Master of the Good Name. It preached joy in song and dance over 
dusty scholarship, although followers today are as devoted as any Talmudic 
scholars to the details of religious law. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement was born and flourished amid the chaos of the late 18th Century, 
when the Jewish masses of Eastern Europe were buffeted by pogroms, border 
changes and disappointment at the unmasking of Shabtai Tzvi, a phenomenally 
popular self-proclaimed Messiah who converted to Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1830s "it had become the way of life and leadership structure of the 
majority of Jews" across much of what is now Ukraine, Poland, Belarus, 
Lithuania and Hungary, according to the Jewish Encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
 The tzaddik, or righteous leader, plays a central role in Hasidism. He is 
believed by his followers to be a wonder-worker, confessor, moral instructor 
and practical adviser, powered by an extra measure of the spark of creation and 
serving as a two-way channel of divine grace. Menachem Mendel Schneerson played 
this role in Chabad for 44 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With the large-scale emigration of modern times, followers of Hasidism spread 
to Western Europe, Israel and the United States, where they make up a 
significant proportion of the estimated 10% of Jews who are strictly observant 
of religious law and tradition.  
</P>
<P>
 Chabad's aggressive outreach program has seen emissaries, dressed in garb that 
would not have looked out of place in 18th-Century Poland, spread across the 
world. Its largest community centers on its Brooklyn headquarters, where 
Lubavitchers have sometimes lived uneasily with their Caribbean-American and 
other neighbors. Tensions erupted in rioting in August, 1991, after a car in 
the rebbe 's motorcade struck and killed a 7-year-old. MATHIS CHAZANOV

FIRE AT BLACK FAMILY'S HOME NOT ARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire investigators said Monday that a blaze that destroyed the home of a black 
family last week was not arson but an accident, despite family members' 
contentions that their Oak View home was deliberately torched. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no crime," said Fire Investigator Peter Cronk of the swift-moving 
blaze that displaced 10 people and injured three.A full report on the fire is 
expected to be released Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rummaging through the gutted house last Tuesday, fire officials said the 
pre-dawn blaze was either an arson or an accident. Because one of the Stanford 
children, Shuwana, 13, had withdrawn from school as a result of alleged racial 
harassment, some family members speculated that the blaze may have been 
purposely set and racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 But after several days of investigation, fire and sheriff's officials said 
there was no evidence to suggest arson. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no physical evidence to support a crime," Lt. Craig Husband of the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department's major crimes division said Monday. "It's 
not an arson, at least not an arson where anything was thrown into the house."

OXNARD PAPER TO CALL IT QUITS THURSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 95-year-old Oxnard Press-Courier will publish its last edition Thursday, 
making it the third newspaper to cease publication in Ventura County in the 
past 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the state's troubled economy and the county's competitive newspaper 
market, newspaper officials announced Monday that the Press-Courier could no 
longer afford to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto-based Thomson Newspapers, which owns the Press-Courier, is also 
publisher of the San Gabriel Valley Newspapers in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Press-Courier, the Camarillo Daily News and the Santa Paula 
Chronicle have ceased publishing recently, the result of what Editor & 
Publisher magazine calls one of the hottest newspaper wars in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times launched its daily Ventura County Edition in 1990, after 
operating a weekly Ventura County section.  
</P>
<P>
 E. W. Scripps Co., which had purchased the Camarillo Daily News last year and 
began publishing a zoned edition of the Ventura-based Star-Free Press in 
Camarillo, also publishes three other daily newspapers in the county.

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; TUTORS REACH OUT TO 
CHILDREN OF THE STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

 Once it took a tutor half an hour to convey to an 11-year-old homeless girl 
who had never been in school the concept that "B-L-U-E," four letters on a 
page, meant "blue," the color, Fran Chalin remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a life of bitter reality, the girl had no room in her life for learning 
abstract concepts that had nothing to do with where to find a meal or a place 
to sleep. Chalin said the 11-year-old may also have been the oldest child in 
the family, which meant that she had the added responsibility of caring for her 
siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 But then a tutor from the Women Helping Children program, run by the National 
Council of Jewish Women in Los Angeles, sat down with the girl at the Valley 
Shelter in North Hollywood, to try to break into her world of hopelessness and 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that their parents don't care about education," said Chalin, the 
director of the program, which targets at-risk youths in homeless shelters and 
group homes, as well as teen-age mothers. However, Chalin added, homeless 
families have few options about their children's educations as they shuttle 
from homeless shelter to living in a car or a basement or a church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District tracks about 1,500 homeless students, 
who each can drift to as many as 15 schools in a year as their "residences" 
change. A three-month stretch in a shelter -- the time limit by which most 
families have to leave -- is about the most security a homeless family can look 
forward to. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, homeless children are two to five years behind other children their 
age in education, Chalin said. Math and reading skills especially suffer 
because one lesson builds on the other. Also, Chalin said, homeless children 
are 20 times more likely to develop depression as they shuttle from school to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The tutoring program recently has added a new feature, working with the Museum 
of Contemporary Art, in which homeless children are being taught art skills. 
Along with an education, the art lessons may help break the cycle of poverty in 
a family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that there is a life outside the life they know," Chalin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Not only is it that the children never have had a chance to create art, but 
neither have their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the parents come in and start coloring," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the one-on-one attention given by a tutor is also what leaves a lasting 
impression on the children, especially in knowing that volunteers are giving up 
time of their own to be with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids see that these are people who want to be here," Chalin said.  
</P>
<P>
 The fact that someone is willing to help them learn underscores to the 
children that education must be important, she said. "These kids love the 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Tutors also help children living in six group homes in Canoga Park who have 
many of the same emotional issues and problems of self-esteem as homeless 
children. Children in the homes are assigned there by the courts because of 
drugs or violence in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both homeless children and those from dysfunctional families need consistent, 
non-judgmental attention from a tutor, Chalin said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has seen success in the program, Chalin said, especially on days like one 
recently when a tutor introduced a 14-year-old girl to the classic play "Romeo 
and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
 "She had never been to a play," said Chalin. "She didn't even know what a play 
was. But, now she has gone from this to trying to write a play herself." 
</P>
<P>
 National Council of Jewish Women volunteers also help tutor teen-age mothers 
trying to complete their high school education at the El Nido Family Care 
Center in Pacoima.  
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers must join the coalition, and membership is not limited by sex or 
religion. The membership fee is $40, less for those who cannot afford it. To 
become a volunteer, call the council at (213) 651-2930.

contractors, has been working with the company trying to buy the district and 
its assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the California-American Water Co. of Chula Vista confirmed 
Monday that Walter W. (Bill) Knitz was hired as a consultant by the private 
firm that recently announced it was seeking to purchase the district for more 
than $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Jones Jr., the company's president, disclosed that Knitz was hired through 
his new employer, Florian Martinez Associates, a landscape architectural 
company in Tustin. Knitz conducted an engineering analysis of the water 
district that took several months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did do some work on a consulting basis," Jones said. "He did some analysis 
for us and helped us to understand operational issues. His name was referenced 
to us as someone who knew a lot about the district. We had (limited) access to 
financial data and, as you can imagine, we were trying to understand how an 
operation like this would work. He gave us some . . . advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he didn't know exactly how much Florian Martinez had been paid for 
Knitz's consulting work, but a source familiar with the arrangement said it was 
a $50,000 contract. Officials with Florian Martinez had no comment Monday. 
Jones said he believes Knitz has completed the work for which he was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was aware of the criminal charges against Knitz, Jones said he 
didn't think it made a difference when it came to hiring the former general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had nothing to do with what happened in the past, and we have already 
stated that if we were successful (in the takeover), we would employ the 
current employees of the district," he said. "We have no intention of having 
Mr. Knitz work for us if we ran the district. It's never been an issue, and 
never a subject of discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Knitz was charged with 23 criminal misdemeanor counts stemming from 
his failure to disclose gifts from companies he recommended for district 
contracts. Knitz's assistant general manager, Michael P. Lord, faces 15 similar 
misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office learned about Knitz's 
relationship with California-American Water Co. when The Times sought a 
prosecutor's reaction last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marc Kelly, who is handling the criminal cases against 
Knitz and Lord, said he is working out plea bargain arrangements with both men 
and will take the new revelations about Knitz into consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are aware of the allegations," Kelly said. "Right now, we are in the midst 
of settlement discussions, and I cannot comment on the details. However, we 
will take a look at all circumstances in this case to determine a fair 
disposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz was expected to plead guilty to the charges at a scheduled pretrial 
hearing last Friday in Orange County Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel. But 
Kelly postponed the proceedings until June 27 because the exact terms of the 
plea bargain could not be agreed upon. It is possible that Kelly could force 
Knitz, as a condition of the plea agreement, to refrain from all dealings with 
California-American or the Santa Margarita Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Knitz agreed on a plea Friday -- and his involvement with 
California-American not been disclosed -- the result could have been an 
embarrassing replay of what happened in the case of former Orange County 
Supervisor Don R. Roth. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his plea agreement in March, 1993, Roth pledged to avoid lobbying 
officials under the framework of the state's Political Reform Act. But that law 
applies only to the lobbying of state officials, leaving Roth free to lobby 
officials with county agencies, many of whom he had been instrumental in hiring 
or promoting. After The Times raised the issue, the district attorney's office 
struck a new deal with Roth that banned local lobbying for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Knitz nor his attorney, Marshall M. Schulman, would talk about the 
proposed plea arrangement nor Knitz's association with California-American. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather not comment about who he is or is not working for," Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The news that Knitz was once again involved with the Santa Margarita Water 
District, just a year after he retired in disgrace, stunned the new board of 
directors, all of whom were appointed or approved by voters after the scandal 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the problems with this district are due to him," said Betty Olson, a 
UC Irvine professor of environmental science who was appointed to the board in 
March. "The new board is making progress, and here comes Bill Knitz again." 
</P>
<P>
 Said board member Bob Lay: "I'm surprised. I would think (California-American) 
would have better sense. This whole thing has taken on a shady feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz joined the district in 1975, after being recommended by then-board 
Chairman Thomas C. Blum, who served for years as executive vice president of 
the Santa Margarita Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-year-old Knitz announced his early retirement from the district, where 
he had worked more than 17 years, following revelations in The Times that he 
and Lord billed the district for tens of thousands of dollars in questionable 
expenses while accepting $60,000 in meals, entertainment and gifts from 
companies they had recommended for millions of dollars in contracts. Lord, 50, 
announced his retirement the day after Knitz said he was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Former board chairman Don B. Schone resigned in January -- following stories 
that he failed to report trips to Mexico paid by an engineering firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Since all of the other board members had been replaced in elections last 
November, the all-new board thought they could proceed with correcting a number 
of problems in the district without obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 But in late May, California-American announced it was trying to buy the 
district, a proposed action that took the district's general manager and board 
of directors by surprise. California-American is a subsidiary of the New 
Jersey-based American Water Works Co., the largest investor-owned water utility 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If a deal could be worked out, company officials said, California-American 
would assume the district's $370-million debt. Water and sewer rates would be 
frozen for three years and could only be raised with the approval of the 
state's Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials say that approval for the sale must come from the Local 
Agency Formation Commission, the agency which oversees special district 
takeovers, and the Public Utilities Commission. But officials of the Santa 
Margarita Water District say that the 80,000 people whom the district serves 
should be allowed to vote on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this issue is important enough that the landowners should have a say 
whether it's required by law or not," said general manager John J. Schatz. "It 
would show a good-faith effort on the company's part."

HIGH COURT OKS HOMEOWNER'S RIGHT TO DISPLAY PROTEST SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, upholding a homeowner's right to protest the Persian Gulf 
War from her front lawn, ruled Monday that city officials may not enforce a 
total ban on signs and billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Even an affluent suburb's desire to preserve its natural, woodsy appearance 
does not justify barring an individual from putting a protest sign outside her 
home, the court said in a 9-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The free-speech guarantee in the 1st Amendment prohibits officials from 
"almost completely foreclosing a venerable means of communication," such as 
displaying a sign or billboard, wrote Justice John Paul Stevens. While 
officials certainly can regulate the size and location of signs, they may not 
forbid them entirely, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City attorneys in Orange County weren't surprised by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 If the homeowner were using a sign on the lawn to advertise a business, "that 
would be another story," said Santa Ana Assistant City Atty. Robert Wheeler. 
"But political and religious speech usually enjoy higher protection under the 
First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, a city known for its tough business-sign laws, City Atty. Joel D. 
Kuperberg said anyone can place a sign on residential property without city 
regulation, as long as it is not a safety risk. But members of homeowners 
associations, Kuperberg noted, legally may be asked by their associations to 
abide by self-imposed rules barring signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court's decision follows a long line of court rulings that have 
said activities such as soliciting and picketing can be regulated but not 
forbidden altogether. For example, the court in 1987 struck down an ordinance 
barring the distribution of leaflets and soliciting in the Los Angeles 
International Airport terminal. Five years later, however, the justices upheld 
other airport ordinances that restricted the locations where advocates could 
distribute leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's ruling is a victory for Margaret P. Gilleo, a homeowner in Ladue, 
Mo., a wealthy suburb of St. Louis. In December, 1990, she irked her neighbors 
by erecting on her front lawn a 2-by-3-foot sign that declared: "Say No to War 
in the Persian Gulf. Call Congress Now." When vandals stole the sign, she put a 
similar sign in her second-story window.  
</P>
<P>
 But city officials then informed her that her signs, including the smaller one 
in the window, were illegal. A city ordinance prohibited the display of nearly 
all signs, with but a few exceptions. These included identifying signs for 
schools, business and churches and foot-square signs to identify a residence or 
to announce that a property was for sale or rent.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that they feared "a proliferation of an unlimited number 
of signs (which) would create ugliness, visual blight and clutter." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilleo filed a suit in which she contended that enforcing the ordinance 
against her violated the 1st Amendment. A federal judge agreed and the U.S. 
appeals court in St. Louis affirmed the decision on grounds that the city law 
discriminated in favor of real estate signs and against political signs.  
</P>
<P>
 In October, the high court agreed to hear the case (Ladue vs. Gilleo, 
92-1856), possibly to reconsider the notion that the 1st Amendment forbids laws 
that discriminate among types of expression. This approach has caused some 
confusion because it suggests, for example, that Ladue's ordinance would be 
constitutional if it also banned building identifications and for sale signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of trying to clarify that doctrine, the justices unanimously agreed 
that Ladue officials could not stop Gilleo from displaying her political sign.

WILSON SEEKS BREAKS FOR TACO BELL, OTHER FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson proposed Monday that $110 million be set aside in the state's 
deficit-strapped budget for tax credits to keep Orange County-based Taco Bell 
and other corporations from fleeing the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also predicted that legislation carried by Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown to allow the business incentives, though snubbed by a Senate committee 
last month, would ultimately win approval by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said the tax breaks would go far to keep the long-awaited 
California economic comeback from hitting the skids. Efforts to keep Taco Bell 
have also taken on particular weight in this election year because the company 
represents the sort of environmentally clean, profitable industry state leaders 
want to retain. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Taco Bell, which has been considering moving its Irvine 
headquarters to Texas, said they were pleased by the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a step in the right direction for California's continued 
economic recovery," said Jonathan D. Blum, vice president at Taco Bell Corp. 
"We'd like to wait and see specifically what it is that's being proposed. But 
we're encouraged by this development." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson proposed $45 million for tax credits in the 1994-95 fiscal year, which 
begins July 1, and $65 million for 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the money can be allocated, the Legislature must approve a bill 
authorizing the tax credits.  
</P>
<P>
 Brown, meanwhile, has promised to revive his bill, which would provide a 6% 
investment tax credit for companies locating or expanding their headquarters in 
California. The tax breaks yielded by Brown's bill would have been close to the 
$10 million in incentives being offered Taco Bell by Texas, making the move out 
of state no longer worth the expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-food company has been looking for a new, larger site for its 
headquarters for nearly a year. Three months ago, it narrowed its search to 
Orange County and the Dallas-Ft. Worth area.

DISCLOSURE A RISK, BUT HE PLAYS ON; JAZZ: RARE AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES, FRED 
HERSCH ACKNOWLEDGED HIS HIV STATUS AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION. OPPORTUNITIES 
FOLLOWED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Hersch doesn't have a lot of time for self-pity these days. With no less 
than seven albums on the market that include his participation as piano 
soloist, producer or composer, his 20-year career in the jazz business has 
suddenly begun to take off. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the increased attention is, in some measure at least, related to 
his announcement last year that he is HIV-positive and gay -- the first such 
public revelation by a well-known jazz performer. Perhaps more than any other 
area of the entertainment world, jazz has avoided addressing the issues of 
sexual orientation and AIDS. And for Hersch, 38, a Grammy-nominated performer 
(for his album "Dancing in the Dark" on Chesky Records), the disclosure may 
well be a double-edged sword, enhancing his visibility while potentially 
risking his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few of the gay jazz musicians I know are out of the closet," says 
Hersch, who lives in New York. "Gary Burton, I kind of pushed out of the 
closet, and now he's come out, publicly, on National Public Radio." 
</P>
<P>
 Burton, a vibraphonist, responds, "Fred was one of the first persons I called 
when I decided to come out. I didn't actually know him at the time, but he was 
the only other jazz musician I knew of who had announced he was gay." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a longer list than you might think," says Hersch, "and nine out of 10 
are still in the closet. So I decided it was time for somebody to break the 
mold a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Hersch, who has been AIDS asymptomatic since 1986, has underscored his 
determination to "break the mold" by producing an all-star jazz album, "Last 
Night When We Were Young: The Ballad Album," as an AIDS fund-raiser for 
Classical Action: Performing Arts Against AIDS. It includes 13 ballad 
renderings by a lineup of performers both gay and heterosexual that ranges from 
Burton, Hersch, alto saxophonist Bobby Watson, harmonica player Toots 
Thielemans and pianist George Shearing to singers Mark Murphy, Janis Siegel and 
Andy Bey. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the many highlights are "Little Prayer," featuring the excellent if 
little-known Texas pianist Dave Catney, now ill with full-blown AIDS and also a 
gay jazz musician who has gone public. Other superb moments in this gorgeously 
atmospheric collection include Thielemans' passionate reading of "Estate," 
Brazilian pop star Leny Andrade's "Quiet Nights (Corcovado)," Siegel's "More 
Than You Know" and Murphy's almost painfully moving interpretation of the title 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear 'Last Night When We Were Young' in this context, it really has 
a poignant quality," says Hersch. "I think Mark's reading kind of sums up the 
whole project." 
</P>
<P>
 The album has been out for about a month. Initial reviews have been excellent, 
and sales have begun to gather momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the distinction of the music and the impressive name value of the 
participants, Hersch thus far has been unsuccessful in placing the album with a 
major record company. At the moment, it can be obtained only by phone orders, 
(800) 321-AIDS. Broadway Cares, the agency that initiated the red-ribbon AIDS 
program, is administering sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought for sure that I would have no problem at all placing it (with a 
major label)," Hersch says. "A lot of labels said, 'We love it, it's a 
beautiful record, with great artists, and it's a great concept. But, hey, if 
we're going to do something like this, we'd rather do it in-house with our own 
artists.' But, of course, they're not doing it. And I was handing them what I 
already had done, for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Does he feel there has been undue reluctance on the part of major jazz labels 
to deal with an AIDS fund-raising recording? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say that. After all, there have been some successful AIDS 
fund-raising albums. 'Red Hot & Blue' and 'Red Hot & Dance' did pretty well. I 
think there's a country one, too. But the only one that I really know about in 
the jazz area was something on GRP Records that came and went quickly a year or 
so ago called, I think, 'We're All in This Together.' " 
</P>
<P>
 GRP spokesman Michael Bloom confirmed that the record was released in 1993 and 
contains classic tracks from Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and John Coltrane 
as well as tunes from Patti Austin, David Benoit, Dave Grusin and others. The 
company plans to release another AIDS benefit album titled "Red, Hot & Jazz" in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just hoping," Hersch says, "that now that (the 'Ballad Album') is getting 
reviews and radio play, that it eventually will find the right home with a 
major distributor. All we can do is hope that people will use the toll-free 
number until we make other arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
 Hersch did not reach his decision to go public with his sexual orientation 
easily. The jazz world has long held on to the myth of the macho, 
self-destructive male musician, as Hersch was well aware when he moved to New 
York from his Cincinnati home in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first and most important goal at the time was that I really wanted to make 
it in jazz," he recalls. "I came to New York to play with the best people I 
could play with, and I wasn't going to let anything stop me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hersch was "so ambitious" and "so driven" that he felt compelled to suppress 
who he was, terrified of the consequences if the jazz legends he was working 
with were to discover his sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, I knew no other gay jazz musicians," he says, "so I led a kind 
of dual existence -- gay friends on one side, musician friends on the other, 
but never the same. And the funny thing is that the feeling of isolation I 
experienced in the jazz community wasn't really all that unfamiliar to me, 
because that's how gay people often feel throughout their childhood. You 
realize that you're attracted to members of your same sex, and there's nobody 
to talk about it with. The others are always talking about the opposite sex." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the "Ballad Album," Hersch has a new solo release on Concord 
("Fred Hersch at Maybeck"), a trio album on Chesky ("The Fred Hersch Trio Plays 
. . . "), several compositions on two other AIDS benefit albums ("The AIDS 
Quilt Songbook" on Harmonia Mundi/Nightingale and "Memento Bittersweet" on 
BMG/Catalyst) and has produced and played on albums for Andrade and cabaret 
singer Mary Cleere Haran. 
</P>
<P>
 But he worries that his expanded visibility may be countered by a hesitation 
on the part of promoters to book him for future dates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, the simple fact is that I'd like to work more," he says. "I'd like to 
work as much as I possibly can. When you're facing the clock, you just sort of 
say, 'Well, what's important to me?' And making music is important. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I know there are some people out there who are going to say, 'I'd like to 
book Fred next summer, but I don't know if I want to risk a booking. Maybe he 
won't be here.' I can't control that kind of ignorance. Of course, it's true, I 
might not be here. But that could apply to anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very weird. If you have cancer, you can look at it on a CAT scan and 
say, 'Well, there it is.' But this is more mysterious. It's like you're a 
little kid, and it's at night, and your parents have gone to sleep. The closet 
door is open a little bit, and you imagine there's some monster in there that's 
going to come out, but you don't know what it's going to look like or what it's 
going to do. It's pretty strange." 
</P>
<P>
 But "the main thing for me is what it's always been -- to keep growing as a 
musician, to keep trying new things, to keep stretching by playing with people 
with whom I can be myself and to keep challenging myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I wish I wasn't HIV-positive. But that's just the way it is. I wish 
there was no war and no cancer, too, but it just doesn't work out that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen some people with AIDS go through amazing transformations, with 
great realizations. It's ironic that they sometimes don't get it together until 
the last years of their lives. But as long as you get there, it really doesn't 
matter when it is. There's a line from George Eliot that says it all: 'It's 
never too late to be what you might have been.' "

BACK ON HOME 'TURF'; POP MUSIC: FOLK ARTIST LUKA BLOOM'S THIRD ALBUM REPRESENTS 
AN ATTEMPT TO 'GET REATTACHED TO MY FAMILY AND TO IRELAND.' HIS FIRST TOUR 
SINCE 1992 BRINGS HIM TO THE COACH HOUSE THIS EVENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One man, one guitar, and an album's worth of good songs. 
</P>
<P>
 It works for Johnny Cash on his acclaimed new release, "American Recordings." 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Luka Bloom with a strong Irish version of music-making at its 
simplest and most emotionally direct. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom's album is titled "Turf," and like Cash's, it is meant to affirm the 
singer's connection to his national roots. Pausing last week as he packed for 
his return to the road after a long layoff, Bloom said that his third album 
grew out of a deliberate attempt to get off the career merry-go-round and spend 
time renewing his ties to his native turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I had detached myself from Ireland to pursue my work," he said from 
his house in central Dublin, where he was up late packing for a transatlantic 
flight the following morning (Bloom's first tour since 1992 brings him to the 
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano tonight and the Troubadour in West Hollywood 
on Thursday). 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I had to get reattached to my family and to Ireland," Bloom said. 
"Being on the road, you lose touch after a couple of years with the progress of 
other people's lives, and you become so completely self-absorbed you're 
transported into this unreality, or maybe a different reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come from a large, close family (which includes his 10-year-old son), and I 
didn't feel good about being away from them for five years," he said. "I wanted 
to acquaint myself in the development and progress in their lives, particularly 
the younger ones. I needed to be quiet and be still." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom's roving began in 1986, when he felt his attempts to launch himself as a 
singer-songwriter in Ireland had stalled. The erstwhile Barry Moore decided to 
try his luck in a new place, New York City, with a new name that spliced the 
title of a Suzanne Vega hit set in New York with the surname of the hero of 
James Joyce's Dublin epic, "Ulysses." 
</P>
<P>
 The change of venue helped Bloom get out from under the shadow of his older 
brother, Christy Moore, long a leading figure in Irish folk music. It also 
eventually led to touring and recordings that showcased his impassioned, 
sturdy-voiced singing and his aggressive, hard-strumming take on the folkie 
idiom. 
</P>
<P>
 After the death of his mother two years ago, Bloom decided it was time to step 
back from his work for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes something even as major as the death of a parent can't stop you in 
your tracks because you're so driven," Bloom said. "I'm glad I stopped and 
allowed this major event in a person's life to be absorbed. It allowed me an 
ongoing relationship with my mother despite her passing." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom, 39, gives an account of his grieving in "Sanctuary," the closing song 
on "Turf." He says it was important to absorb the loss and experience it as a 
son before he tried to address it as a songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really write songs in order to come to terms with anything," he said. 
"I don't see it as a form of therapy for me. I generally try to come to terms 
with things before I write the songs. I'm basically sharing something I 
experienced, and that I think everybody experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to trace the lines of direct experience in songs like "Cold 
Comfort," an account of Bloom's struggles while attempting to establish himself 
on the New York City music scene, or in songs of parting and separation -- 
staple themes of Irish traditional music that have been played out in his own 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Cash, Bloom has a couple of memorable prison songs to his credit -- "This 
Is for Life," from his 1990 debut album, "Riverside," and "I Did Time," one of 
the new album's highlights.  
</P>
<P>
 "I met this guy on the street in Dublin; he'd just come out of prison after 
five years," Bloom recalled. "I said, 'Five years of your life! What did you 
do, man?' He just looked at me and said, 'I did time.' I realized how precious 
time is. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason I identify with people who were in prison, even though I 
never was in prison myself," he explained. "Whether it's a prisoner of habit or 
of something they can't work through, I think everybody has that experience of 
being trapped in something they can't get out of. I find myself without too 
great difficulty capturing a feeling of what it's like to have my freedom taken 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 While Cash is the Man in Black, Bloom is the man who sees blue -- at least in 
his songwriting imagination. Having broached the hue in "Exploring the Blue," 
from his 1992 release, "The Acoustic Motorbike," Bloom has added the new 
numbers "True Blue" and "Blue to Begin" to his catalogue. In none of them is 
"blue" an emblem for sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue is always a very warm color for me," he said. "Maybe that's because the 
first album I really fell in love listening to was 'Blue' by Joni Mitchell. I 
was trying to seduce a French au pair in Ireland, in a house where the only 
recordings that existed were a bunch of Irish rebel ballads. The only other one 
in the pile was 'Blue' by Joni Mitchell, for which I'm eternally grateful."  
</P>
<P>
 Bloom recalls that first love, along with the blossoming of his artistic 
imagination, in "Blue to Begin," which comes with a dedication to Mitchell. He 
admits it's a shameless bid to meet one of his musical heroines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom's previous albums were hardly massive production jobs, but he decided to 
reduce "Turf" to barest basics because he felt he was most powerful playing on 
stage in solo shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason I wanted to make this a solo album is that I've gotten to the 
point where I crave clarity and simplicity," Bloom said. "People are bludgeoned 
with information, not only in the news, but in entertainment. The fast-edit 
videos, the fast-edit everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find most of the songs I'm listening to are songs (rendered) very directly, 
whether it's Chet Baker or Nina Simone or Bob Marley," he said. "The way these 
people communicate to me is very direct. If something can be said beautifully 
and simply, let it be." 
</P>

SURROGATE MOTHER'S CLAIM UPHELD; RULING: COURT OF APPEAL REAFFIRMS HER PARENTAL 
RIGHTS, GAINED IN LANDMARK DECISION, BUT ORDERS LOWER COURT TO DECIDE WHO HAS 
PRIMARY CUSTODY OF CHILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An appeals court Monday reaffirmed a surrogate mother's parental rights but 
ordered a lower court to once again decide who will get primary custody of a 
now 4-year-old girl named Marissa. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrogate mother Elvira Jordan and biological father Robert P. Moschetta have 
shared parental responsibilities since an Orange County Superior Court judge in 
September, 1991, granted joint custody -- a landmark ruling believed to be the 
first of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Moschetta appealed, but Monday's decision by the 4th District Court of Appeal 
in Santa Ana upheld Jordan's claim to Marissa Jordan Moschetta, the child she 
bore after being artificially inseminated with Moschetta's sperm. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question of biological parenthood to settle," the panel of three 
justices unanimously concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 But the justices said a new hearing on custody was needed because Robert 
Moschetta was unfairly penalized when Judge Nancy Weiben Stock considered his 
"aggressive litigation" and other factors when deciding custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very happy," said Nancy Bunn, Moschetta's attorney, who said she 
hopes her client will gain sole custody during a rehearing. "It's tough to have 
joint custody in a case where people have never married." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Richard C. Gilbert, who represents Jordan, said his client was 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, she's happy that the court recognizes that she is the mother, but 
she is not happy about having to go through this all over again," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is markedly different from another high-profile surrogacy case 
decided last year by the California Supreme Court, which held that contracts in 
which a woman agrees to serve as a surrogate mother are valid in California 
despite an absence of laws governing such arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, the court ruled that surrogate mother Anna Johnson had no 
maternal right to a child she bore for biological parents Mark and Crispina 
Calvert. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Jordan case, the surrogate mother had agreed to bear a child for Robert 
and Cynthia Moschetta but changed her mind when the couple began experiencing 
marital problems before the baby's birth in May, 1990. The couple later 
divorced, and all three adults battled for custody of the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Moschetta was stripped of any legal right to the child but has since 
developed a close relationship with Jordan and the little girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney John L. Dodd, who represents the child, said he believes joint 
custody is in the child's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd said the appellate decision essentially applies adoption law to such 
surrogacy cases, specifically that a woman cannot be forced to give up her 
child. The opinion also calls on the state Legislature to draft laws governing 
surrogate contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The different outcomes in the Johnson and Jordan cases can be traced at least 
in part to money, according to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Wealthy parents who can afford the complicated in vitro fertilization 
procedure used in the Calvert case are likely to receive custody of the child 
if the surrogate changes her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples who cannot afford such procedures or have to rely on more traditional 
methods of surrogacy have no assurance their intentions will be honored in a 
court of law.  
</P>
<P>
 "For them and the child, biology is destiny," the court said. "The result is 
disquieting."

NO LAYOFFS, JAIL CLOSURES IN COUNTY BUDGET; GOVERNMENT: BUT CAO ERNIE SCHNEIDER 
HAS A CAVEAT: THINGS DEPEND ON HOW THE STATE RESOLVES ITS OWN $4.7-BILLION 
SHORTFALL. A $9-MILLION HOLE IN THE LIBRARY SYSTEM'S PROGRAM IS A PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in three years, Orange County government officials are 
proposing a budget that does not include layoffs or jail closures. 
</P>
<P>
 But as in previous years, County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider warned 
Monday that the county's financial health will ultimately depend on how the 
state resolves its estimated $4.7-billion budget shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a little better off this year than in previous budgets but there are 
still too many unknowns," Schneider said of the 1994-95 budget proposal 
distributed to county officials Monday. "I think we've come to a point where it 
would be difficult to cut any more. We're not talking about putting people out 
on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said the county will plan to provide about the same level of funding 
it did in last year's $3.5-billion budget and hope that additional revenue can 
be found to fill a projected $9-million hole in the county library system's 
spending program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no denying that the libraries are in deep trouble again," Schneider 
said. "We either raise more revenues or we cut services. But there is time to 
find more money." 
</P>
<P>
 Possible answers to the library funding problems are expected to be presented 
within the next several weeks in a report from a special library task force 
created earlier this year to deal with program shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 While preserving the 27-branch library system appears to be the county's most 
critical budget concern, the trouble does not compare with money problems last 
year when Sheriff Brad Gates threatened to close the James A. Musick Branch 
Jail and the County Fire Department faced a 50% reduction in staffing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although those public safety concerns were later resolved without budget 
reductions in the fire or sheriff's departments, the state did take $148 
million from Orange County in a shift of local property tax revenues to plug 
state government's own budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift is permanent and leaves Orange County with only $108 million in 
available property tax revenue next year, a 58% reduction from the county's 
1992-93 budget year. 
</P>
<P>
 That loss, however, will be partially offset in 1994-95 by a stunning $84 
million increase in projected interest earnings by county investments over last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 County Treasurer/Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who manages the county 
investment portfolio, was sharply criticized by his political opponent before 
his reelection last week for pursuing overly aggressive investment strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we had a pretty successful year, no matter what anybody else says," 
Citron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said the investment earnings essentially filled the hole created by 
the loss of property tax funds and will help keep other programs on pace with 
last year's level of funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how much longer we can count on (Citron) to manipulate the 
market like he does," Schneider said. "We owe him a big 'thank you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 With the gains in interest earnings and other revenues holding steady, 
Schneider said there are no immediate plans to continue a series of staff 
reductions which sliced about 2,000 positions from various county departments 
in the past three years. Only about 100 of the job cuts required layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the permanent loss in property tax revenue and continued problems with 
library funding, Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said Monday that 
the budget proposal offered some long-term financial hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are signs that we're beginning to recover," Riley said. "We're 
trying new things to retain businesses and there seems to be more building 
activity going on. They are all signs that things are trying to be improved." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said she would reserve judgment until the 
state resolves its own deficit. She said the county needs to be prepared in the 
event the state looks to local government again to solve its budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find things encouraging, but we're not home free yet," she said.

PAROLED RAPIST IS INDICTED ON MURDER CHARGE; COURTS: HE FACES POSSIBLE DEATH 
PENALTY IF CONVICTED. OTHER CHARGES INCLUDE KIDNAPING AND SEXUAL ASSAULT OF 
WOMAN, 23. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury indicted a paroled rapist Monday on kidnaping, 
sexual assault and murder charges in the death of a young Huntington Beach 
woman witnesses say he met in an Orange nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Patrick Morgan Jr., 28, will be arraigned next Tuesday on the charges, 
which include allegations that the May 20 slaying of Leanora Annette Wong, 23, 
took place during a kidnaping and sexual assault. The allegations make Morgan 
eligible for the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Lewis R. Rosenblum said for the first time Monday that Wong was 
kidnaped shortly before her battered body was found in a parking lot across the 
street from the Australian Beach Restaurant & Nightclub. She had been raped 
with a foreign object, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grand jury saw evidence that Ms. Wong was abducted before she was 
murdered," said Rosenblum, who declined to elaborate. Rosenblum said he would 
not discuss whether video cameras in the parking lot captured portions of the 
alleged kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan had pleaded not guilty Friday to the original charges of murder and 
sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said he sought the indictment to bring Morgan to trial as soon 
as possible. The indictment process bypasses a preliminary hearing in Orange 
County Municipal Court scheduled for later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's case focused scrutiny on the Orange County district attorney's office 
after it was learned that Morgan had been accused of raping four young Orange 
County women in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In all but one of the cases, however, the district attorney's office either 
declined to prosecute or allowed Morgan to plead guilty to less serious 
charges. Prosecutors say the credibility of the victims posed a problem in 
those cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last case, prosecutors allowed Morgan to be sent back to prison for one 
year for parole violation instead of seeking a rape conviction that could have 
sent him to prison for nearly a decade. Morgan had been released after serving 
his time on the parole violation when Wong was slain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of criticism that prosecutors were too easy on Morgan, his defense 
attorney said he fears prosecutors will try to compensate by seeking the death 
penalty even if the case does not warrant the harshest punishment under law. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Stephen J. Biskar did not return phone calls Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenblum said the decision whether to seek the death penalty will be decided 
solely on the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong was seen talking to Morgan at the nightclub on the night of the slaying, 
authorities say.

DIPLOMAS AND DIAPERS; IN AN EMOTIONAL CEREMONY, YOUNG MOTHERS GRADUATE HIGH 
SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There was pomp, and there were Pampers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional ceremony punctuated by whimpers, cries and the patter of 
little feet, 20 young women were honored Monday morning for earning high school 
diplomas despite becoming pregnant along the way. Cheerful tears flowed over 
wide lipsticked smiles as the graduates of Santa Ana Unified's Teen Parent 
Program thanked their teachers for helping them stay in school and learn skills 
crucial to jobs and child-rearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, when I got pregnant, I thought I was never going to finish 
school. I was so disappointed in myself and I was desperate," sobbed Graciela 
Trigueros from the podium, her voice giving way to tears that made her unable 
to complete her speech. "I will always treasure this program because it has 
been a big part of my life and always will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Trigueros and her classmates -- a couple in their final days of pregnancy, 
many with toddlers in tow and one who gave birth just last week -- will 
officially receive their diplomas from Santa Ana's four high schools Wednesday. 
Meanwhile, graduations from public high schools throughout Orange County begin 
today and will continue over the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, at an informal gathering with homemade cookies and punch, the girls 
each received a carnation, a poem and a strong hug from program administrator 
Harriet Dohrmann. 
</P>
<P>
 Dohrmann, 71, retires this week from the program she founded 23 years ago and 
has run ever since. Mother of three, grandmother of three and matron saint of 
325 girls who have completed the program over the years, Dohrmann has also 
authored four books on educating teen mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a friend, a counselor, a teacher. She's like a mother! We're her 
children, you know?" said 19-year-old Lupe Brito, who has two young sons of her 
own and spent five years in Dohrmann's program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared. I'm scared to go out into the different world," admitted Brito, 
who has already enrolled at Rancho Santiago College and hopes to become a 
registered nurse. "Here, my teachers were my friends. When I had a problem, 
they were there. This is like my home, my second home. I'll miss it." 
</P>
<P>
 The cozy program opened Feb. 1, 1971, with only three students. Now there are 
100. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Dohrmann cooked breakfast and lunch for the girls every day -- 
"teen-age girls, their nutrition isn't the best," she explained. But soon, "we 
had to drop the lunch because it cut into academics," Dohrmann said. "With 
50-60 plates, we were washing dishes when we should have been doing history. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I still talk a lot about nutrition," she added. "It's important." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's is one of Orange County's oldest, largest and most comprehensive 
programs of its kind, but nearly every local school district has some services 
for teen parents. Since 1980, Orange County's teen pregnancy rate has doubled: 
in 1992, the most recent year available, 1,736 babies were born to girls ages 
10 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 And pregnancy is the No. 1 reason girls drop out of high school, according to 
the Coalition for Children, Adolescents and Parents, an Orange County nonprofit 
education organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure that I could have been in school if I had all the problems these 
girls have," Dohrmann said. "I just hope that I have helped someone, that's my 
whole thing. And I probably shouldn't say this, but I think I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Students said Dohrmann's program removes any stigma from being young and 
pregnant, provides flexibility for emergency doctor appointments or other 
baby-related needs, and makes school relevant to teens more concerned about 
birthing methods and colic than sports and parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, they said, in the Teen Parent Program, everybody understands each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun being here because you get to share all your experiences, all your 
problems are the same," said Ana Vaglienty, 18, who has been married for three 
years and has a 2 1/2-year-old son, Angel. "If you come late to school, they 
understand, the baby might have gotten sick. If you really have to call your 
house, they let you use the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 Snapshots of the students' children decorate every wall of the five-room 
schoolhouse. In the central area, which serves as Dohrmann's child 
development/family life/home economics classroom, there is a one collage 
listing each girl's due date, another listing every baby's birth weight, and a 
third titled "Love Makes Children Bloom," with pictures of the infants. 
</P>
<P>
 If a student is in labor, throngs gather at Dohrmann's desk whenever the phone 
rings. Upon returning to school, new mothers tell about their deliveries. Even 
at Monday's graduation, back-row chatter before the ceremony concerned 
ultrasound tests and baby food. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's a day that we don't talk about it," Dohrmann said. "The 
girls are a good support to one another. Some girl may have some terrible pain, 
and she'll tell about it in class and someone else will say, 'I had that!' It's 
reassuring." 
</P>
<P>
 School runs from 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. each day, and students complete the 
district's regular curriculum. There are only four teachers, so each handles 
several subjects, with extra attention given to child-development and business 
courses in which the girls learn accounting and computer skills essential to 
entry-level jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Raya, 37, graduated from the Teen Parent Program in 1974. Her daughter, 
18-year-old Lisa Marie Aguilar, finished this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They taught me how to drive, they taught me how to type, they encouraged me 
to go to college," Raya, who now works for the City of Santa Ana, said Monday 
as she played with her grandson, Ubaldo Mendoza. "They taught me everything 
about being a mom, how to sew, how to clean and bathe them. Everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Lupe, who was 13 when she first got pregnant, followed an abusive boyfriend to 
Mexico and back, dropping out of a private Catholic school and skipping classes 
for nearly a year. She finished eighth grade at the Teen Parent Program, then 
tried Valley High for ninth grade. At Valley, she lasted only one semester, 
getting all Fs. 
</P>
<P>
 So she returned to the program, where "Mrs. Dohrmann always pushed me around, 
saying, 'Lupe, hurry up, get your credits,' " the girl explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a future for my two kids -- it's not just for me now," Lupe said. "If 
I would have dropped out, later they would say, 'Why should we go to school 
when you didn't go?' 
</P>
<P>
 "So many teen-age girls who get pregnant at a young age, we don't make it. I 
passed through so much, it's hard," she sighed. "But we made it."

PROPOSED HIKE IN BUS FARE PROMPTS A FAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 15 days as buses have rumbled by, Jose Mendoza has staged a hunger strike 
on an Echo Park bus bench to protest a proposed 25-cent fare increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza is determined to go without food at least until Saturday, when the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority will hold a public hearing on its 
proposed budget, which includes the fare hike. Eustasio Castro, a fellow 
activist, joined Mendoza in the hunger strike for 13 days until he was 
hospitalized Saturday after becoming nauseated and disoriented. Now Mendoza is 
going it alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not doing this to get any notoriety," said Mendoza, 37, spokesman for 
Grupo Latino Echo Park. "I'm doing this for the people, for the community -- 
Latinos, blacks, Asians, whites." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to balance its budget, the MTA last month recommended increasing bus 
fares for the first time in six years from $1.10 to $1.35. But the proposal, 
which may be decided later this month, has triggered vehement opposition. At 
one hearing, 200 protesters became so unruly that authorities summoned transit 
police -- many toting riot gear -- to keep order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Real people are now getting desperate," said Eric Mann, director of the Labor 
Community Strategy Center. "As the reality of policies becomes more clear, 
those directly affected are going to take more direct and more militant 
reactions." 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza, who has lost seven pounds since he started the fast May 30, spends 
his days reading and praying that he will be strong enough to keep fasting. He 
drinks only fluids, such as Gatorade. He said he has used public transit for 
the past 10 years, riding buses three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other members of Grupo Latino, Mendoza wants the proposed 25-cent 
fare increase reduced to no more than a dime. The group is also opposed to 
cutbacks in bus services, which have also been suggested by MTA officials to 
meet a $126-million shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Grupo Latino, which formed a year ago to protest MTA bus drivers' alleged 
mistreatment of passengers, has expanded into a community action group that 
addresses school and social issues. President and founder Barbara Gonzales said 
the group of 250 plans to hold a demonstration today outside the MTA offices. 
</P>

 "We're going to put (up) some signs to say, 'Hey, you have to get conscious 
that there is a human being's life at stake,' " said Gonzales. "I think that 
they're going to listen to us. They're going to think about it real hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza, who is self-employed, and Castro, who is unemployed, started their 
fast at a bus bench on Sunset Boulevard at Echo Park Avenue. During the days, 
the two men would talk to fellow bus riders, explaining what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
 They spent their first two nights inside a tent a few blocks south in Echo 
Park, but were evicted by park rangers. Finally, the pair ended up sleeping in 
their cars. But this past Saturday, Castro -- a father of three -- was too 
weakened to continue fasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said he plans to keep the strike going as long as it takes to get the 
MTA to back down. He hopes, too, that he will be able to speak at Saturday's 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he continues his vigil, keeping a diary of his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hot in the car," said one entry. "This is now the ninth day, going 
to 10th. No food at all. . . . I thought I won't make it. God willing (I am)."

FIRST FAMILIES; PRIZED EXHIBIT ON JAPAN IMMIGRANTS TO END 2-YEAR RUN

 Alien hardships Made bearable by the hope I hold for my children . -- Katsuko 
(pen name of an issei) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two years and 100,000 visitors later, an acclaimed exhibition depicting the 
stirring but forgotten saga of the issei, the first generation of Japanese 
settlers in the United States, is closing -- much to the chagrin of many in the 
Japanese American community  
</P>
<P>
 They are saddened at the prospect of not being able to walk into the Japanese 
American National Museum and view the exhibit after next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel so emotional about it," said Robert Uragami, 65, whose father's 1916 
letter to his future bride is prominently displayed in the exhibit. "I wish we 
could have a permanent exhibit honoring our parents." 
</P>
<P>
 "Issei Pioneers: Hawaii and the Mainland, 1885-1924," closes to the public 
next Tuesday and will be viewed the following day by Japanese Emperor Akihito 
and Empress Michiko as part of their Los Angeles visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Even from a practical standpoint, the display will be missed, said Uragami's 
wife, Rumi, a volunteer who has guided hundreds of schoolchildren and other 
visitors through the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to show what an issei looks like when we explain to kids," she said. 
"If you don't have something visual to point to, it's so hard to explain." 
</P>
<P>
 For younger Japanese Americans, the display has been a vehicle for learning 
more about their own families, and for others, it has contributed to better 
understanding of the place of Japanese Americans in U.S. history. Many viewers 
have been astounded to learn that Japanese immigrants have been in the United 
States for 120 years or that they were interned in camps during World War II 
solely because of their ancestry, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most agree about the exhibit's importance, but there is simply no room at the 
museum to continue the display and have capacity for upcoming shows. Come July 
9, an exhibit about a creative Japanese American family in Berkeley will occupy 
the space. Officials will put the issei exhibit in storage in the hope that it 
can be remounted when the museum is able to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 In the display are bits and pieces of early settlers' lives that had been 
tucked away inside dusty wicker trunks and in boxes in garages, gathered during 
the 10 years of planning and fund raising. The exhibit includes clothing, 
tools, photographs, letters, poetry, documents and home movies that were part 
of the lives of 300,000 early Japanese immigrants who helped build the West. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The impeccably planned opening event, on April 30, 1992, was overshadowed by 
the Los Angeles riots, which began the previous night. Because of the timing, 
that defining moment for the Japanese American community received scant 
coverage in the mainstream media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Issei Pioneers" documents Japanese immigrants as they made America their new 
home with the single-minded purpose of properly raising their children. Most 
issei arrived here between 1885 and 1924, when the U.S. government banned 
immigration from Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit was both a way for second-generation Japanese Americans -- the 
nisei -- to honor their parents and a way to make their history part of the 
American legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Uragami's father, Eji, came in 1902, working first as a migrant farmer, then 
engaging in a variety of occupations, including selling typewriters and running 
a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was time for him to marry, he wrote his parents, like other bachelors, 
for a bride. But unlike most, who sent glowing descriptions of America to lure 
prospective brides, Eji Uragami, was candid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contrary to what you hear, gold does not grow on every tree in America," he 
wrote his future bride, selected by his family. "Life is tough in America." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter did not deter his "picture bride," who came to join him in Los 
Angeles two years later. Together, Eji and Kinuyo Uragami worked, often side by 
side, raising a family of three sons and a daughter, all of whom went to 
college or trade school. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Uragamis told their American-born children to become "good 
Americans." They also brought them up on old-country beliefs and customs. 
Guiding precepts in the home were gaman , perseverance without complaining, and 
shikataga-nai, acceptance of a misfortune without rancor, as something that 
can't be helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time I remember Mother being upset was when my sister complained 
that her closet was small," Robert Uragami said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with about 120,000 other people of Japanese ancestry, the Uragamis lost 
everything during World War II when they were ordered out of their home and 
business in Los Angeles on a moment's notice and sent to Granada Relocation 
Camp in Colorado. But when they returned, everyone pitched in to get back on 
their feet, practicing gaman and shikataga-nai.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike her husband's family, Rumi Uragami's parents, Toyone and Gengoro Tonai, 
came to Los Angeles in 1920 as newlyweds after her father's family business 
failed in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother was ahead of her time, Uragami remembered recently at the museum 
with her husband, a retired engineer, and another museum volunteer, David 
Masuoka, a retired research scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother had completed two years of college in Japan and even managed to 
learn a little English, at a time when girls were supposed to stay home quietly 
and prepare for marriage. And she loved singing so much that she found a way to 
engage in her hobby over her parents' objections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mother went to a Methodist church so she could sing," Rumi Uragami said. She 
never became a Christian, but she went to church and sang to her heart's 
content. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in America, Rumi's mother promptly traded in her kimono for a Western 
dress, worked alongside her husband and made sure her American-born offspring 
-- two daughters and three sons -- had a better life than she. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents told us we had to be better than anybody -- to be equal," Rumi 
Uragami said. 
</P>
<P>
 Remembering her parents, she said: "There are so many things I want to ask 
them, but it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
 With a tinge of sadness and regret in her voice, she said that by the time one 
is old enough to appreciate one's parents and family history, they are not 
around anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The history of the issei is so compelling that she and her husband have been 
driving into Little Tokyo several times a week from their home in Costa Mesa to 
volunteer at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures taken by David Masuoka's father, Naoichi, a pioneer photographer, 
record many activities of a close-knit Los Angeles Japanese community where the 
immigrants sought refuge from the hostile world that surrounded them. In Los 
Angeles, many early Japanese settlers lived in Little Tokyo, San Pedro and what 
today is Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Masuoka's gigantic photos show pioneers at work and play. He 
recorded such proud moments as the opening of a Japanese hospital, as well as 
carefree moments such as church picnics and other community activities. 
</P>
<P>
 He even took pictures of prospective bridegrooms who wanted to pose in front 
of his car (a Maxwell) to send to prospective brides, his son said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Masuoka says he has an abiding respect for the issei and the legacy they 
left to their progeny. They were courageous and persevering, he said. "Imagine 
the courage of people coming to a strange country without knowing the language 
and customs." 
</P>
<P>
 "The issei were extraordinary people," said Rumi Uragami, adding that they 
make good role models not only for today's Japanese Americans but for other 
people too.

COUNTY'S FIRST '3 STRIKES' CASE ENDS IN MISTRIAL; COURTS: JURORS DEADLOCK OVER 
THE BURGLARY DEFENDANT, WHO COULD HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED FOR LIFE. A NEW TRIAL IS 
ORDERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first "three-strikes" case to go to trial in Los Angeles County ended 
Monday in a mistrial, sparing the defendant -- at least for now -- the 
possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison for a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating 2 1/2 days, jurors in the case against Gregory Joe Bellamy, 
43, deadlocked 9 to 3 in favor of convicting him in the March 13 break-in at a 
home near Hollywood. Some of the jurors who voted to convict him complained 
afterward that the three jurors who favored acquittal harbored racial loyalties 
toward Bellamy because they, like the defendant, are black. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge J. Stephen Czuleger ordered Bellamy to be retried. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state's 3-month-old "three-strikes" law, defendants previously 
convicted of two serious or violent felonies must be sentenced to 25 years to 
life imprisonment if they are convicted of a third felony of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellamy has five prior serious felony convictions, including an unarmed 
robbery, attempted sodomy and a residential burglary with the use of a gun, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Keri De Santis. 
</P>
<P>
 After jurors were dismissed Monday, De Santis told them she was concerned that 
they had been affected by knowing that Bellamy would have received a 
25-years-to-life sentence had he been convicted. However, the jurors said they 
were unaware of that stipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't even know it was a 'three-strikes' case until we walked out the 
(courtroom) door," one juror said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to trial testimony, Bellamy was arrested less than two blocks away 
from the burglarized home eight minutes after the homeowner, William Davidson, 
awakened to a noise and called police. An officer testified that a watch and a 
ring that belonged to Davidson were found in a fanny pack worn by Bellamy. 
</P>
<P>
 The three jurors who stuck to not guilty votes said they were not convinced 
that Davidson had adequately identified Bellamy. His description to police of a 
6-foot-tall black man with bold features was too vague, they said. Bellamy 
testified that police planted Davidson's belongings on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other jurors accused the three holdouts of sympathizing with 
Bellamy's testimony and comparing the circumstances of his arrest to the Rodney 
G. King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellamy told the jury that police, while arresting him, ground his face in the 
dirt, struck him without reason and turned a police dog on a nearby man. 
</P>
<P>
 The three holdouts denied that their votes were swayed by race or the King 
case and said the other jurors -- one African American, one Latino, one Asian 
American and the rest white -- had made remarks about Bellamy during 
deliberations that were racially tinged and inappropriate.

L.A. SCHOOLS TO HOLD LOTTERIES FOR OPEN SPOTS; EDUCATION: WAITING LISTS ARE 
LIKELY AT CAMPUSES WHERE APPLICATIONS BY STUDENTS FROM OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS 
EXCEED AVAILABLE SPACES OR THREATEN ETHNIC AND RACIAL BALANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles schools with too many open enrollment applications and not enough 
space geared up to hold lotteries today to determine which students will be 
allowed to attend the campuses of their choice this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District schools -- many in the west San 
Fernando Valley -- will randomly draw students' names and create waiting lists 
for potential openings under the new state-ordered open enrollment program. For 
the first time, students will be allowed to transfer to schools outside their 
neighborhoods if space is available and the campuses' ethnic/racial balances 
will not substantially change. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials did not have the total number of lotteries or the 
numbers of applications for individual schools Monday. But officials said the 
number of applicants may not reflect how many students will enroll at a school 
because some families applied at different campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we know that parents are shopping and applying at more than one 
school, we won't get a real handle on this until they actually enroll in 
September," said Bruce Takeguma, a specialist in the district office that is 
coordinating the program. "It's real hard to say now because the numbers are 
artificially high." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, school administrators and attendance clerks counted applications, 
set up lottery schedules and analyzed racial balances Monday, the application 
deadline. Up to 22,000 spaces were up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 An informal survey of schools across the district showed that students 
primarily are applying to campuses near their homes, and that applications were 
not as numerous as some administrators expected. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there have been more applications from students now attending private 
schools than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, administrators said they believe that many parents were reluctant to 
send their children to distant schools. "I really think it's a question of 
convenience rather than academics," said Barbara Garry, assistant principal at 
San Fernando High. "There are very few students who are going to drive across 
the Valley to a Taft or El Camino." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, high schools such as Taft and El Camino received large numbers of 
applications -- Taft got 459 and El Camino got 200 -- but those came 
predominantly from students who live in the West Valley. Taft had space for 
600, and El Camino had space for just 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the district did not guarantee bus transportation, officials said 
students might have been deterred from applying. 
</P>
<P>
 At Marshall High in Los Feliz, which received about 200 applications for 300 
openings, most of the students live in the neighboring Belmont High or 
Hollywood High attendance areas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Welby Way Elementary in West Hills, which got about 120 applications for 15 
slots, officials said many of the students live just outside the school 
boundaries or have siblings in the magnet center located on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrienne Serviss, who lives in West Hills and wants her first-grade son to 
attend Welby Way rather than her local Nevada Street Elementary, said she 
believes that the open enrollment policy is ideal for parents who do not want 
their children to travel long distances to school. "People are probably just 
shopping for the best school in their area," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The open enrollment period began in May, setting off a flurry of activity by 
schools seeking to attract students. Grant High School teachers took out a 
newspaper ad and dozens of other schools produced short videos that aired on 
the district's television channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Lappin, principal of Foshay Middle School in South-Central Los Angeles, 
said he received about 140 applications for 175 slots mainly because of his 
advertisements and through word of mouth in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response is really gratifying," Lappin said. "We do a lot of work in the 
community and I'm real pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Some campuses, such as Grant, have sufficient space but will hold lotteries to 
ensure that the student body meets district integration guidelines. Grant 
received 160 applications and has space for 300. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is the integration guidelines have to be followed," said 
Takeguma. "We have to make sure we don't swing it one way ethnically." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of students appear to be applying for the lowest grade levels at 
the schools: kindergarten or first grade at the elementary schools, sixth or 
seventh grade at the middle schools, and ninth or 10th grade at the high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, people are more interested in establishing their children in a new 
school in the early grades," said Diana Lorenz, the principal at Mt. Washington 
Elementary, which will hold a lottery. The school received 60 applications for 
15 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Some administrators said the new program did not generate the kind of 
large-scale attendance shifts that they expected. "I expected a lot of 
applicants," said Norma Danyo, the assistant principal at Garfield High, which 
received 51 applications for 150 openings. "It's too bad -- they're not as high 
as we would expect. During the year, we get a lot of inquiries about our 
school." School Lotteries 
</P>
<P>
 Today is lottery day at Los Angeles Unified School District campuses that have 
more requests than space for open enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a public session at each school, a committee of three will select 
applicants' names from a box. The principal will be responsible for supervising 
the drawing procedures and for selecting the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * After the number of applicants necessary to fill the openings have been 
selected, the remaining names will be drawn and placed on a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 * When one sibling's name is drawn and accepted, other siblings also will be 
allowed to attend the school. The number of open enrollment slots will be 
increased to allow for siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents should check with the schools to find out whether lotteries will be 
held and at what time. All are scheduled for today.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; FIRST FIRE ENGINE MAY VANISH, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City firefighters had seen it only in faded black-and-white photos, a 1928 
American La France fire engine that was the first major purchase made by the 
volunteer department shortly after the city's incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last year, in a gleaming red-and-chrome flash, this ghost from the city's 
past became a reality when a Thousand Oaks collector unexpectedly stepped 
forward to offer the antique fire engine -- in pristine shape -- back to the 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, city firefighters who paid $8,000 out of their own pockets to buy the 
truck may see the vintage fire engine disappear along with the San Celemente 
Fire Department itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the city decided to have the county take over fire services, 
effectively disbanding both the city Fire Department and the San Clemente 
Firemen's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the firefighters will be rehired by the county, their employee group, 
which owns the historic engine, will be history beginning in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is tough. But we have no choice but to sell it because they're breaking 
us up," said Firefighter Kurt Bidinger, the unofficial Fire Department 
historian. "We'd love to sell it to someone who lives in San Clemente, but the 
bottom line is that we have to sell it." 
</P>
<P>
 The dismantling of the Fire Department -- done for economic reasons -- and the 
possible loss of the city's original fire engine has dismayed current and 
former residents including 78-year-old Merton Hackett, the city's first paid 
fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't they just un-incorporate and have the county take over everything?" 
said Hackett, who now lives in Hutto, Tex. "This isn't good for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 For the city's first 20 years, the 1928 engine served as the city's only 
firetruck. As San Clemente grew, more fire engines were purchased, and the old 
war horse was sold for $500 in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we bought the American La France, the city used a cart with about 200 
or 300 feet of hose that we hooked to the hydrants," Hackett said. "Sometimes 
the (water) pressure was sufficient, sometimes it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 "The American La France was just about as good as anything that was available 
at that time," Hackett said. "Sometimes the hand-crank siren wouldn't get 
started until we got to the fire, but the American La France always did the 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 The truck was sold to a land developer to decorate a park, then eventually 
wound up in a Los Angeles junkyard, where Thousand Oaks collector Robert 
Schmidt found it. 
</P>
<P>
 He painstakingly restored the old engine, even locating lost original 
equipment, like the vehicle's headlamps.  
</P>
<P>
 Bidinger said Schmidt offered the truck back to the city "because he said he 
was getting on in years and wanted us to have it."  
</P>
<P>
 Almost to a man, the fireman's union jumped at the chance to reclaim part of 
the city's heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our first truck, and not many fire departments can say they still have 
their first one," Bidinger said. "It says a lot about the hometown attitude and 
heritage of San Clemente, and we were happy to purchase it out of our own 
pockets. It'll be sad to see it go." 
</P>
<P>
 Hackett happened to be in San Clemente last year when the truck was unveiled 
to the public for the first time in about 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got kind of melancholy when I got behind the high seat where I drove that 
truck for many years," Hackett said. "The American La France looks exactly like 
it did back then. It certainly brought back a lot of memories." FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; WORKER BURNED IN FACTORY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 42-year-old Garden Grove man suffered facial burns Sunday night when flames 
erupted inside a building where wooden mini-blinds are manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
 Trong Van Dang, an employee of Travis Industries, had second-degree burns to 
the side of his face from the 9:33 p.m. fire and was taken to Anaheim Medical 
Center, Anaheim Battalion Chief Roger Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim firefighters, assisted by an Orange County Fire Department unit, put 
out the blaze within minutes. The fire started in the lacquering section of the 
plant on East Leaverton Court. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no damage to the structure and only minor damage to equipment, Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were still looking into the cause of the fire Monday. No damage 
estimate was available.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; MAN WHO 
THREATENED TO SET FIRES IS SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys man was sentenced Monday to three years and four months in prison 
for writing letters under the alias "Fedbuster" that threatened to set fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lee Larsen pleaded guilty in January to six counts of sending the 
threatening letters to fire stations, most in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen has not been charged with setting any fires, but federal authorities 
said Monday they have not ruled him out as an arson suspect in the 
investigation into brush fires that devastated the Southland last fall.  
</P>
<P>
 At a sentencing hearing in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Larsen 
apologized for the pain he may have caused the recipients of his letters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so sorry," he said. "I wish I could take back that one day last year 
when everything went collapsing in on me and I sent the letters out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kick myself everyday. Why didn't I just let things go from the past?" 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen, a convicted child molester with a long criminal history, wrote in his 
Fedbuster letters that he was upset about property that had been seized from 
him. He also demanded an apology from the prosecutors, judges and agents who he 
claimed were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-seven of the letters, which went to Southern California residents as 
well as fire stations, were sent last August.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN CONVICTED OF 
HELPING ROOMMATE COMMIT SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Tujunga man was convicted Monday on felony charges of helping his roommate 
commit suicide by handing him a loaded shotgun and urging him to "Just do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The guilty verdict in the trial of Alex Coventry may be the first conviction 
in the state under a rarely used, 121-year-old assisted suicide law that 
prohibits aiding, advising or encouraging a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of deliberations, a Van Nuys Superior Court jury determined 
that Coventry, a 44-year-old recovering alcoholic, was criminally liable in the 
July 2, 1993, suicide of Leonard Medina, a 42-year-old unemployed man. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews after the conviction, jurors said they focused on Coventry's 
actions and the state law, ignoring any parallels with Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the 
retired Michigan pathologist who has admitted helping 20 terminally ill 
patients to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understood this wasn't a Kevorkian case and we weren't here to judge 
whether suicide was right or wrong," said juror Gregory Brown of Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ronald S. Coen is expected to sentence Coventry this morning. He faces 
up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of drinking with Linda McDowell, Coventry's girlfriend, at the 
Tujunga apartment the three shared, Medina was despondent over an eviction 
notice and his bleak financial situation, according to testimony. He threatened 
to kill himself, as he had many times in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry admitted to police that he handed his roommate a loaded shotgun and 
told him to "stop talking about it." Although he did not testify on his own 
behalf, Coventry maintained during a tape-recorded police interview that he had 
no idea Medina would actually put the gun to his chest and pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry should have known Medina was serious about his threat because his 
friend had previously attempted to kill himself, jurors said. McDowell told 
police the shotgun was hidden out of fear that Medina would use it on himself.  
</P>
<P>
 Coventry "had choices, he had options, he didn't have to contribute to the 
whole act," said jury foreman Bart McPhail of Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think ultimately we all believed that Alex was truly sorry after the fact . 
. . but we couldn't ignore that it was after the fact," McPhail said. THOM

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; RESIDENTS PROTEST PROPOSED BIKINI BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 75 angry residents confronted businessman Steve Smith on Monday to 
protest his plan to open a bikini bar in a local shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to attract scum if you bring this bar here!" Sharon Zapata 
yelled in front of the closed Discount 99 1/2 Cent Store that Smith hopes to 
convert into "La Habra Polo Grounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the proposed bar, on the northeast corner of the intersection of La 
Habra and Harbor boulevards, would feature female dancers wearing bikinis and 
cater to nonsmoking men 18 years old and older. "It'll be an upscale, real hip 
business," he said. "The dancers will be dressed no different than women on the 
beach." 
</P>
<P>
 The bikini bar cannot open without city approval. City officials said the 
Planning Commission is scheduled to vote on whether to grant Smith an operating 
license at a meeting June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the site, residents hurled fierce remarks at Smith. They shouted, 
"Pervert!" and "Pick a different town!" and "We don't want no go-go bar!" 
</P>
<P>
 Some held "anti-go-go bar" and "I'd rather have a prison" signs while loudly 
chanting, "Not in our town!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Men will come out of here all hot and that will attract prostitutes to the 
area," said Diana Giles, who lives 100 feet away from the proposed bar. "It 
will bring in an element of people we don't want in La Habra." 
</P>
<P>
 Others agreed with Giles. They said that hundreds of homes, two elementary 
schools, a middle school and a high school are within a mile of the proposed 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a family place," Shelly Zeyen said. "We don't want our children 
exposed to this type of business. If this opens, I will no longer shop in this 
center because I don't want my kids to see the trash." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said petitions urging the city to deny Smith a business 
license are circulating at Ladera Palma and Sierra Vista elementary schools and 
at Washington Middle School. More than 500 signatures have been collected, 
residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the kind of business we need in La Habra," Miguel Mungaray told 
Smith. "It will bring sex, drugs, loitering, urination in the streets, loud 
noise and will disturb everybody in the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents argued that a bikini bar would be "morally wrong" and contended that 
Smith does not care about the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith countered: "Moral standards are the individual's choice. . . . And it 
(the bar) will absolutely pose no threat to children." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Zona Neighbors said that if the bar opens, "it will mark the 
beginning of sleaze in La Habra. This city is already decaying and it'll just 
turn into a total vice city." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's confrontation did not jar Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will only help my business when it opens because everyone will know 
about it and I'll get a lot of customers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that if the Planning Commission refuses him a permit, he will sue 
the city rather than appeal the decision to the City Council. He said he first 
applied for a permit last November, and charged that the city is deliberately 
delaying his request. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the bar would serve as a training facility for the 60 dancers he hopes 
to hire so they can become topless dancers elsewhere. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; BOY IN FAIR CONDITION AFTER MONORAIL FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward Paolello, the youth who suffered serious injuries in a fall from a 
monorail platform at Disneyland over the weekend, was reported in fair 
condition Monday after surgery to repair a broken right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing very well," said Fran Tardiff, a spokeswoman for UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, where the 15-year-old boy was being treated."He's awake and 
responding and expected to make a complete recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Paolello, from Santa Maria, broke his elbow, left wrist and pelvis early 
Sunday after falling 20 feet from a monorail platform at the Disneyland Hotel 
in the first serious accident since the train ride opened in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the youth was apparently accidentally pushed over a short wall 
and off the platform by a surge of passengers as they left the monorail. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland officials said Monday that the ride was still open, although their 
investigation into the incident was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "To my knowledge, nothing like this has ever happened before," spokesman John 
McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials, meanwhile, echoed those sentiments, describing Disneyland's 
safety record as "impeccable." 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounded to me as if it was a complete accident," city spokesman Bret 
Colson said of Sunday's incident. "We are comfortable with the level of safety 
that currently exists over there. Disney has an outstanding safety record, so 
I'm sure that this is just an isolated incident." DAVID HALDANE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; FINAL VOTE TOTALS IN CLOSE RACE EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Final results are expected today in the close City Council race where only 81 
votes separate the top four finishers. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday, it appeared Toni Gallagher, incumbent Karen Lloreda and Harold 
R. Kaufman have been elected to the three open seats on the five-member 
council, but 2,300 ballots countywide remain to be counted, said Cathy Catlett, 
the assistant city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest tallies show Gallagher and Lloreda in a dead heat with 2,787 votes 
each, Kaufman with 2,754 votes and Ernest Nelson with 2,706 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 In fifth place and apparently out of the race is Bill Shepherd with 2,623 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining uncounted votes include absentee ballots turned in at polling 
places, provisional ballots, ballots that had write-in candidates and ballots 
that were damaged by the counting machines or ones that had to be duplicated 
for a variety of reasons, said Rosalyn Lever, the county's assistant registrar 
of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lever could not estimate how many of the uncounted ballots belonged to Dana 
Point voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials believe there are certain to be some local votes outstand 
ing because Dana Point resident Bonnie Streeter ran a write-in campaign for 
county sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows exactly how many Dana Point votes are left," Catlett said. "Our 
numbers could change a little, change drastically or not change at all." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar situation in the 1992 Dana Point council election ultimately cost 
then-Councilman Bill Bamattre his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 After all the straggling votes were tallied, current Councilman William L. 
Ossenmacher had nudged Bamattre aside for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, now the trailer for the final seat by 48 votes, remains hopeful 
today's count might still help him win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are quite a few people in Dana Point who did different 
write-ins," Nelson said. "We could still be in pretty good shape. It just 
depends on how many there are." LEN HALL

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN MARINO; $20,000 
REWARD OFFERED IN SLAYINGS OF 2 AT PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $20,000 reward has been established for information leading to the arrest 
and conviction of the intruders responsible for the June 5 shooting deaths of 
two teen-agers at a San Marino party celebrating the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The reward fund was announced Monday by the city of San Marino and the San 
Marino Chinese Club, each of which put up $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 David Heng, 15, of San Marino, and Dennis Buan, 18, of South Pasadena were 
killed and several other party-goers were injured in the 1 a.m. attack, which 
came after a group of alleged gang members was asked to leave the event. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino Police Lt. Timothy Harrigan said detectives are searching for three 
vehicles used by the attackers to flee the party, which had been advertised 
with flyers. The vehicles were described as a red 1990 or 1991 Honda Civic 
hatchback with tinted windows, lowered suspension and black bumpers; a gray 
1990 or 1991 Honda Civic four-door that may be damaged on the left side, and a 
white 1985 Mitsubishi Tredia four-door. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the assailants, possibly a male and female of Filipino or other Asian 
ethnicity, were believed to be in their late teens or early 20s. Money not used 
for rewards will go to setting up a hot line for reporting gang or drug 
problems, a gang awareness program and a campaign to spread information about 
the dangers of so-called flyer parties, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information can call the San Marino police at (818) 300-0720.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH BAY; SKULL IN 
TRASH CAN WAS STOLEN FROM 1928 CRYPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A human skull found in a trash can in Lennox on June 2 was that of a woman 
entombed at Inglewood Park Cemetery in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood police said the skull apparently was stolen by thieves who broke 
into a 10-foot-square family crypt, smashed the marble slab that covered the 
woman's coffin and took the skull and neck bones.Inglewood Police Capt. Jack 
Frazier said cemetery officials are going through records to try to determine 
who the woman was. The crypt, which contained six other sets of remains, bore 
only the family name of Richards. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier said cemetery officials discovered the break-in the day after the 
skull was found and notified police. How the skull wound up in the trash can in 
Lennox is not known, Frazier said. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea why anyone would want to do this," Frazier said. He added that 
a ring on the woman's finger and other jewelry in the coffin were not taken in 
the grave robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday a county coroner's office pathologist took the skull to the cemetery 
and matched it to the body of the long-dead woman. The skull was placed back in 
the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Cemetery officials declined comment.

 Two sheriff's deputies patrolling the Metro Rail Blue Line shortly after 
midnight Monday were fired on during a traffic stop, but no one was injured, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Larry Lincoln said the deputies had stopped a car for minor 
traffic violations at Nadeau Street and Central Avenue in South Los Angeles at 
12:25 a.m. when the car's occupants opened fire.

 As one of the deputies returned the fire, the car sped off, he said. 
Authorities searched throughout the night for the vehicle and its three 
occupants, and by late Monday two suspects were being held. However, no weapons 
were recovered and no arrests had been made.

OKS $25 MILLION IN BONDS FOR QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council decided Friday to issue $25 million in tax-exempt bonds to 
fund loans for repairs of quake-damaged apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond issue will serve as a pool for banks to tap when making loans for 
reconstruction projects. Housing Department officials expect to seek approval 
for the bond sale in July.  
</P>
<P>
 The bond issue will help make up for Gov. Pete Wilson's cancellation of a 
massive state lending program for the restoration of nearly 20,000 apartments 
left vacant after the Jan. 17 quake.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; DISNEYLAND GREETS WORLD CUP PLAYERS

<P>
 With Mickey Mouse as their escort, members of the Romanian World Cup soccer 
team waved and gave the thumbs-up sign Monday as they paraded down Disneyland's 
Main Street U.S.A. atop a float decorated with soccer balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney characters led the parade -- including Winnie the Pooh and Tigger 
carrying a soccer ball -- while park guests lined the street and gave the 
22-member team a warm welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing red, white and blue soccer uniforms, the Romanian players were the 
first World Cup soccer team to take up Disneyland's invitation to visit the 
Magic Kingdom, said Scott Swan, a park spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good, and I like it very much," goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea said about 
his first visit to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The players have been in Orange County since June 3 and will play their first 
official game Saturday at the Rose Bowl against Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup tournament begins Friday with 24 teams playing in matches in 
stadiums across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 During their stay here, the Romanians have also visited Balboa Island, said 
Radu Timofte,the team's press official. 
</P>
<P>
 Team member Florin Raducioiu, who plays soccer professionally and lives in 
Italy, said he was enjoying his visit and called America the "land of the 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Timofte said the team was excited to visit the theme park. "We hear a lot of 
things about Disneyland," he said. "We are all children living with some 
adventure for Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 Parade onlooker and soccer fan Kim Petersen, 35, of Brea, hailed the park's 
gesture of rolling out the welcome mat for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire world knows about Disneyland," she said. "They'll probably have 
more memories of the parade at Disneyland than of the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 After the parade, the team rode on attractions that included the Matterhorn 
bobsled ride and the whirling teacups. 
</P>
<P>
 Park guests treated players like celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 With their Disney autograph books in hand, David Wilson, 10, and his brother 
Michael, 7, sons of Graham and Elaine Wilson of Papua, New Guinea, asked 
Raducioiu and Ovidiu Stinga for their autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that made our day!" said Elaine Wilson, whose husband, a fan of 
Ireland's team, plans to attend Sunday's tournament at the Rose Bowl. DEBRA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; MAN STABBED TRYING TO AID CRIME VICTIM

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 31-year-old man was stabbed in the arm late Sunday while trying to help 
another man who was being robbed and beaten by several suspected gang members, 
police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The stabbing victim was treated at Huntington Beach Medical Center for a wound 
to his right forearm after the assault in the 17400 block of Queens Lane, Sgt. 
Mike Willett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident started at 11:10 p.m. when Augustine Martinez, 25, who was 
walking along the street, was beaten to the ground and robbed of his wallet by 
five to seven young men, Willett said. The wallet contained only a small amount 
of cash.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; PARADE TO MARK FLAG DAY FESTIVITIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Children dressed in costumes from around the world will march in a parade 
today as part of the celebration of the annual Flag Day at the Civic Center 
Sunken Gardens on Westminster Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of this year's event is "Many Nations -- One Flag." 
</P>
<P>
 Festivities will begin at 11:45 a.m. with the Willis Warner Middle School band 
playing a medley of patriotic songs. The Musical Variations, a popular local 
senior group, also will perform. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the event will help heal the wounds from the recent 
unsuccessful recall drive against Mayor Charles V. Smith and council members 
Craig Schweisinger, Charmayne S. Bohman and Tony Lam. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that the event will help honor the various cultures that have 
strengthened the city and the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers, firefighters and members of local veteran organizations also 
will participate in the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade will begin at noon at the police station near the Clock Tower, and 
participants will walk the short distance to the Sunken Gardens behind the 
Council Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are encouraged to participate and bring their own flags during the 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Boy Scouts of America, Orange County Council, is providing free 
pamphlets on the history, use and care of the U.S. flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies are available today at the Scout Service Center, 3590 Harbor Gateway 
North in Costa Mesa, near Harbor and MacArthur boulevards. Those who want 
copies mailed to them should call (714) 546-4990. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; WOMAN RAPED IN HER HOME BY INTRUDER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police said they are investigating an early morning rape Monday in the 
Westpark section of the city and the attempted break-in of two nearby houses. 
</P>
<P>
 A 26-year-old woman, who was alone in her home, called police about 7:30 a.m. 
to report that she had been awakened in her second floor bedroom and raped by a 
man who had broken into her home. 
</P>
<P>
 She was being treated at a local hospital, Police Lt. Sam Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacker apparently entered the single-family residence by forcing open a 
laundry room window, Allevato said. He ransacked the first floor before 
entering the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman told police that the man did not display a weapon during the attack, 
but he threatened her and told her not to call police, Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other homes on an adjoining street had signs of attempted forced entry, 
Allevato said. At one of the homes, a garage was entered and a car ransacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Through April of this year, there have been four reported rapes in the city, 
Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no other recent break-ins reported in the Westpark area, he 
said. MARK I. PINSKY

CONFESSIONS IN CHOIRMASTER KILLING LEAD TO 4 ARRESTS; CRIME: THE VICTIM WAS 
ALLEGEDLY SLAIN BY 15-YEAR-OLD BOY DURING AN ATTEMPTED ROBBERY AT STORE. HE HAD 
BEEN ON HIS WAY HOME FROM PRACTICE AT ST. JAMES EPISCOPAL CHURCH. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly two months after the slaying of a popular choirmaster at a Hancock Park 
church, four teen-age gang members were arrested Monday on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Joe Berumen of the Los Angeles Police Department said the arrests 
were based on confessions by two of the youths, who told police that David John 
Falconer, the choirmaster at St. James Episcopal Church and School, had been 
shot by a 15-year-old boy during an attempted robbery at a Los Feliz 
convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests came just days after the City Council posted a $15,000 reward for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of Falconer's killers. 
However, Berumen said, the reward turned out to be irrelevant; the break in the 
case came when one of the alleged robbers volunteered information to police in 
an attempt to soften his punishment for a parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Falconer, 40, was gunned down April 21 about 10 p.m. when three men confronted 
him outside the store, police said. The teacher and musician, beloved by 
hundreds of students and colleagues, had been on his way home from a choir 
practice and had stopped to pick up a can of beer, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leads in the case were scant until last Thursday, when a 16-year-old Los Feliz 
youth went to the LAPD's Hollenbeck Division offering information about the 
Falconer murder and another killing, Berumen said. The youth was a repeat 
offender who had been arrested on a gun-related crime while on parole, Berumen 
said. The teen-ager, he said, had offered the information in the hope of 
avoiding a return to the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Berumen said a second youth was arrested the next day. Upon questioning, the 
17-year-old from Hollywood tearfully confessed that he, his 15-year-old brother 
and their 16-year-old friend had killed Falconer during a robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The brother, who was identified as the gunman, already was in custody, Berumen 
added. About five days after the Falconer slaying, he had been arrested for 
brandishing a gun on the sidewalk outside a business near Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The last of the four believed to have been involved in the killing was 
arrested Monday morning when police spotted a red Mazda GLC hatchback that 
witnesses had described as the killers' getaway car, Berumen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrestee, a 19-year-old Hollywood man, is believed to have driven the 
other three from the scene. But Berumen said police will not release his name 
until formal charges have been filed against him by the district attorney's 
office. The other three suspects were not named because they are juveniles.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY BUDGET REFLECTS SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sign that the city's financial picture is improving slightly, city 
officials tonight will present the 1994-95 fiscal budget that balances the 
city's books without eliminating jobs or raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed budget would also put $3 million in the city's reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's brightening, although it is a meager brightening," City Manager Paul O. 
Brady Jr. said of Irvine's fiscal health. "What we have now we will have next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 The lingering recession combined with a slow-down in residential development 
has hit City Hall hard in recent years, reducing tax and fee revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But the situation has improved in recent months, Brady said, reducing the need 
for a new round of cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the City Council approved the elimination of 70 jobs in an effort 
to close a $4.5-million shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers were laid off, while many others decided to take early 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Another set of cuts occurred last October, when the council voted to lay off 
eight workers and reduce the number of out-of-town conventions for officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady said making the cuts throughout the year when deficits were identified 
prevented massive budget slashing now. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has cut more than 100 jobs over the three years at a savings of more 
than $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady said the $59-million general fund budget for 1994-95 avoids tax 
increases or significant cuts in city services. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will review the budget tonight. After making modifications 
and seeking public input, the council is set to take a final vote on the budget 
later this summer. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; MEETING TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives from the Police Department, school district and the city will 
attend a neighborhood meeting Wednesday organized by a resident of east Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty Baugh, an Albert Place homeowner for seven years, said she has become 
concerned about neighborhood safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have just been changing," Baugh said. "There are extra adults 
wandering the streets in the daytime that weren't there before. I don't know 
where they came from. It makes me nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Community Relations Officer Sue Crouse, who plans to speak Wednesday about 
crime prevention, said police have not noticed an increase in crime in the east 
side, but vigilance will help keep the neighborhood safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are becoming more aware," Crouse said. "I think you're seeing more 
people becoming involved in the neighborhood. Their eyes are opening up, but we 
haven't seen an increase in crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Baugh has invited gang detail officers and Roy Alvarado, a gang prevention 
counselor, to help educate people. 
</P>
<P>
 Baugh serves on the board of directors of the Eastside Homeowners Assn., which 
she said represents about 20,000 homes east of Newport Boulevard and south of 
Mesa Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, code enforcement officers will talk about rules governing 
yard sales -- which are sometimes held more often than the two times the city 
allows yearly, Baugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these laws and codes aren't enforced, but I think if we bother (city 
workers), then the laws are enforced," Baugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 She praised Mac Bernd, supervisor of the Newport Mesa Unified School District, 
for agreeing to attend, and said she received help from Crouse and other city 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the Mesa Consolidated Water District, neighborhood watch 
groups, the animal control department and the housing and community development 
department also will appear at the meeting, Baugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held at 7 p.m. at Kaiser Elementary School, 2130 Santa Ana 
Ave. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; PIER COULD REOPEN BY END OF THE MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's pier, which has been closed since a May 21 fire, could reopen by 
the end of the month, city officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are now finishing up a first round of fixes to the wood boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Once those repairs are done, a temporary covering will be placed over the 
damaged portion of the pier and it will be reopened to the public through the 
busy summer tourist season, Mayor George Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second and final set of repairs will take place sometime this fall when the 
lumber needed for the job is acquired, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had originally hoped to complete both phases of the repairs at 
one time. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have had trouble securing lumber, which must be treated with a 
fire-retardant coating before being attached to the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which temporarily stranded more than 100 people at the end of the 
boardwalk, burned several wood crossbeams and supports. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators believe the blaze was caused when charcoals from a 
makeshift barbecue fell below the pier and ignited a gas line. It caused 
$350,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance will cover the repairs, but the city will still have to pay a 
$100,000 deductible -- as it did in 1992 when another fire struck the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear exactly what effect the fire will have on the city's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said city officials are now preparing the 1994-95 budget and should 
present it to the council within the next month.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; CITY WATER RATES MAY RISE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Water rates are likely to go up again as the City Council considers the city's 
1994-95 fiscal year budget. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal to hike the water rates by 5.9% will go before the council today as 
part of a package of service cuts and fee increases intended to balance the 
city's $25.5-million general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, water rates would increase by seven cents to $1.24 for every 748 
gallons of water used, boosting the water bill of the average Westminster 
household to about $24 a month, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The water rates have increased every year for the last five years, triggering 
bitter political disputes, including a failed recall effort against three 
council members who supported rate increases in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Director Brian Mayhew said the new round of increases is needed to 
provide for water purchases from the Metropolitan Water District, 
water-treatment expenses and repayment of funds borrowed to improve the water 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-income households would not be affected by the rate increase if the 
council approves a plan to extend subsidies for households with incomes of 
$18,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, households earning $12,000 a year or less pay a reduced rate, about 
82 cents for 748 gallons of water. That rate would not change significantly 
even if the increases are approved, Mayhew said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the water rate increases, the council will consider a proposal 
to charge higher fees for city permits, inspections by code enforcement 
officials, and police responses to false alarms or disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the council will consider eliminating 11 positions, including four in 
the Police Department and three in the Fire Department, that have been vacant 
for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts would save the city about $400,000 a year, officials said, enough to 
cover the expected shortfall in revenue this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said that since last year, the city has reduced its work 
force by about 6% and cannot afford to continue the cuts without lowering the 
level of services provided to residents. BERT ELJERA

PARENTS' TRIAL IN DEATH OF CHILD BITTEN BY RAT NEARS END; COURTS: HOMELESS PAIR 
IS ACCUSED OF LETTING PET RODENT KILL INFANT IN TRASH-FILLED CAR. DEFENSE TELLS 
JURY THEY WERE GUILTY ONLY OF BAD JUDGMENT, NOT MANSLAUGHTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A defense attorney for a homeless couple accused of letting a pet rat kill 
their infant son told an Orange County Superior Court jury during closing 
arguments Monday that the parents were guilty of "bad judgment" but not 
involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a freak case," attorney Sal Ciulla said. "It's so ridiculously wild 
that no one has ever heard of this before. . . . The parents never in a million 
years thought this could happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Ciulla and his co-counsel, William Watson, told the jury that Kathyleen and 
Steven Giguere Sr. may not have been the best parents around, but neither were 
they criminally culpable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an unforeseen event," Watson said. "In its worst case, it's an 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty Jim Tanizaki, told the jury that the 
Gigueres had plenty of warning that the rat, which was living with them and 
roaming free in the family's trash filled station wagon, was vicious and a 
presented a danger to their 4-month-old son Steven Jr. and 3-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution alleges that Steven Jr. bled to death after the starving rat, 
known to the family as Homer, bit the boy more than 100 times. The couple are 
on trial for involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment and face up to six 
years if convicted in the August, 1993, incident. To prove the charges, the 
prosecution must show that the parents acted negligently, could reasonably have 
foreseen the danger, and disregarded it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanizaki told the jury the rat had a history of biting people and the Gigueres 
were well aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were warning their friends of the danger," Tanizaki said. "They were 
more concerned about their friends than the safety of their own children. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . This case is not about remorse. . . . I know they feel bad," Tanizaki 
told the jury. "We're not looking at post-mortem grief. . . . This case is 
about parents' responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor added that the couple was also negligent in allowing their two 
children to live in a car that was strewn with rotten food, soiled diapers and 
rat feces and was infested with gnats, flies and roaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was every kind of filth imaginable," Tanizaki said. "It was like living 
in a trash bin. At least if you're in a trash bin, it's emptied every once in a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys conceded that the living arrangement for the Gigueres was 
extremely dirty, but said it never got to the point where they were negligent 
parents. A social worker checked out the couple's living situation but took no 
action, the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kids were healthy," Ciulla said. "They were well fed, well nourished . 
. . well clothed." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorneys also disputed that Steven Jr. bled to death because of 
the rat bites. They contend the boy died of sudden infant death syndrome prior 
to the attack by the rat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question in this case is when did the rat bite baby Steven," Watson said. 
He added that there was ample evidence from defense experts that the infant was 
dead before the rat began biting his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing arguments are expected to conclude this morning, with the jury 
starting its deliberations in the afternoon.

$4.8 MILLION SOUGHT IN O.C. TAX APPEALS; REVENUE: SUPERVISORS ARE EXPECTED TO 
SET ASIDE FUNDS TODAY TO MEET CLAIMS FILED BY SOME OF THE COUNTY'S BIGGEST 
COMPANIES ON GROUNDS OF DECLINING PROPERTY VALUES.

<P>
 Orange County officials are expected to set aside $4.8 million today to settle 
property tax disputes brought by some of the county's biggest corporate 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell International and Hughes Aircraft Co. are seeking the largest refunds 
-- totaling $2.1 million -- from taxes paid by the companies this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax claims have almost become annual rites of spring during the last four 
years in Orange County, which -- like the rest of California -- has suffered 
continuing declines in the value of commercial and residential properties. 
During that time, thousands of businesses and residents have filed appeals with 
the county seeking corresponding reductions on their property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the county Board of Supervisors will decide whether to reserve the $4.8 
million for payment of the pending appeals filed by 18 local firms, which also 
include the Irvine Co., Hyundai Motor America and the Marriott Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The money to be placed on reserve this year is about $8 million less than last 
year, when county officials were deluged with property tax appeals, reflecting 
the lowest point of the local real estate bust. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Grimes, the county auditor-controller's general accounting manager, said 
this year's decrease in settlement claims is probably due to mass revaluations 
of local properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs was urged by county supervisors to 
respond more quickly to the concerns of businesses and residents about the 
declining real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the number of property value adjustments are catching up and have 
made for less disputes in the current year," Grimes said.

BREA'S HISTORIC-DISTRICT PLAN GOES BACK TO DRAWING BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed zoning change designed to encourage historic preservation in Brea 
has been sent back to the city attorney's office for reworking. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council and the public are concerned that buildings would be 
designated historic against the wishes of property owners. Under the proposal 
considered by the council last week, a historic district would be approved if 
at least 65% of the owners favored the designation. 
</P>
<P>
 After discussing the matter, council members instructed the city attorney's 
office to remove all references to historic districts in the zoning ordinance 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to find a way to make it voluntary," Mayor Glenn G. Parker 
said of preservation efforts. "But there are a lot of issues to be dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those opposing historic districts is Redwood Avenue resident John 
Mynes. He told the council that making repairs or alterations to his home would 
be more costly if the building was designated as having historical value. Mynes 
also expressed concern about being required to obtain city approval to work on 
his home's exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in favor of the original ordinance was Brea Historical Society 
President Jane O'Brien. "This is not something that is being pushed down 
everybody's throat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed ordinance, owners of historic buildings could receive 
incentives for preserving their buildings. Incentives could include grants and 
loans for rehabilitation, property tax relief, and technical assistance from 
the city's Development Services Department and from preservation experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Brea Historical Society and the council-appointed Brea 
Historical Committee have compiled a preliminary list of local buildings and 
landmarks considered to have historic significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the buildings on the list are the old City Hall and police station, 
several churches and schools, the city swimming pool and some homes in the 
Redwood Avenue area near Brea Mall.

TEACHER PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN SHOOTING OF 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County high school teacher pleaded not guilty Monday to two counts 
of attempted murder in the June 1 shooting of her ex-lover and another woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Ruth Greene entered the pleas at her arraignment in Citrus Municipal 
Court in West Covina. Greene, 51, a physical education teacher and former 
Teacher of the Year at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, is accused of 
shooting her ex-lover, Loretta Coller, 62, of Glendora and Coller's companion, 
Martha Pereida, 49, of Alhambra. The shooting may have left Coller permanently 
paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene is being held at the Sybil Brand Institute for Women in Los Angeles on 
$300,000 bail. Her preliminary hearing is set Aug. 5.

DIAMOND CAN BE GIRLS' BEST FRIEND; ON THE FIELDS OF ORANGE COUNTY AND THE 
NATION, FAST-PITCH SOFTBALL HAS BECOME THE DOMAIN OF GIRLS -- THOUSANDS OF 
ATHLETES WHO MEAN BUSINESS. AND ON THE SIDELINES ARE NOT JUST PROUD PARENTS BUT 
ALSO PROFESSIONAL COACHES AND COLLEGE SCOUTS.

<P>
 Another Saturday morning, and 11-year-old Laura Miklos, her blond hair tied 
atop her head, is standing in a Tustin schoolyard looking like a Norman 
Rockwell cover. 
</P>
<P>
 But then she starts to move, and the cuteness dissolves. Staring ahead 
intensely, she leans forward and down, almost into a crouch. As she starts to 
step forward and uncoil, she cocks her right arm backward slightly, then 
windmills it forward. It accelerates up, over, behind, then forward again, 
whipping a seven-ounce, leather-covered warhead toward the girl standing 37 
feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 The softball, traveling a good 45 m.p.h., rises over the swinging bat, above 
the catcher's mitt and hits the backstop planks with a tremendous whack. This 
is not cute. This is strike two. 
</P>
<P>
 This is girls' softball in Tustin -- and for that matter, in Irvine, Lake 
Forest, Mission Viejo, Huntington Beach, Yorba Linda, Brea and hundreds of 
other cities in Southern California and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-pitch softball, once the pastime of strong-armed factory workers and 
their sons, has by and large been abandoned to the girls. "The men are playing 
slow-pitch now because there are so few pitchers, and the boys are playing 
baseball," says Bill Redmer, editor of FastPitchWorld magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 And the girls are playing it for real. Backed by parents willing to hire 
professional coaches and travel to distant tournaments, enticed by full-ride 
athletic scholarships from major universities, girls are playing softball the 
way boys have played baseball, basketball and football: all-out, with an eye to 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "When girls were given the right to equal opportunities in sports (with the 
1972 passage of Title IX, a federal law forbidding sex discrimination in 
education programs), fast-pitch softball was one of the sports that really took 
off," Redmer says. "Softball is probably the most prominent example of where 
women have made dramatic gain." The National Federation of State High School 
Assns. estimated two years ago there were 270,000 girls playing on high-school 
teams nationwide, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain that has existed for so long in boys' sports now has formed around 
girls' softball. High school coaches scout the youth leagues. Colleges scout 
the high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we go to tournaments now in Southern California, it's not unusual to 
have scouts from 80 different colleges there," says Judi Garman, the 
Hall-of-Fame coach of the traditionally powerful Cal State Fullerton women's 
softball team. "We could have a coach's convention at every tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 They come, Garman says, "because the good ball players are in Southern 
California." They're good, she says, because the serious ones have been well 
coached and have played 120 games or so a year, all year, in leagues, in 
tournaments and on tour, since they were in elementary school. "By the time we 
get them, they're really seasoned ballplayers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They start as young as 5. The Amateur Softball Assn. of America, national 
governing body of the sport, claims to have 2,000 girls teams in Orange County 
alone. Independent leagues may have more. One of the largest, Bobby Sox 
Softball, was formed in Buena Park in 1963 and now has an estimated 40,000 
players in Hawaii, California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 The talented ones, and the ones with enthusiastic and well-heeled parents, 
soon turn to professional coaches. "There are literally hundreds of guys in 
Southern California alone," Redmer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Guys like Richard Hickey of Irvine. On this particular Friday he was seated 
inside a long net enclosure at a Laguna Hills shopping center watching Laura 
Miklos whirl the softball toward a white canvas rectangle 43 feet away. Every 
hit represented a strike. "She throws way more strikes than balls," Hickey 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickey's advice costs $25 per half hour. That and hitting lessons for Laura 
and her 13-year-old sister Jenny cost her parents $65 a week. That's about the 
limit right now, says her CPA father, Steve Miklos. Nine-year-old Kimmy, who 
also plays Bobby Sox, will have to wait for lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickey has been coaching Laura for three years, and "I definitely know she has 
it," he says. "I'm working 15 to 20 lessons a day, five days a week, and you 
pretty much know when you've got a hot prospect. With the family backing and 
with her desire and drive, there's not much that can stop her. Especially when 
she has Big Sister to motivate her." 
</P>
<P>
 Big Sister's motivation takes the form of standing at the plate during 
pitching practice and whacking any pitch that comes in a little too fat. Big 
Sister can hit, "and when Laura pitches to her, she knows she's got to be on or 
she gets the ball back real fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura can deliver a drop ball, a change-up and a 45-m.p.h. fastball, and she's 
begun working on softball's supreme pitch, the riser. That's good for her age, 
but she will have to improve considerably, Hickey says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen years ago, we had primarily male students, but then the girls' 
scholarships came in. At that time a high-school pitcher throwing 55 m.p.h. 
could go to any university if her grades were up. We had girls throwing 50 or 
52 and getting full rides in Oregon and New Mexico. Now we have 12- and 
15-year-olds throwing better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just how good the girls can become was demonstrated in the mid 1980s in 
Placentia. Michele Granger, tall and long-limbed, pitched 36 no-hitters for 
Valencia High School with a fastball that eventually reached 70 m.p.h. during 
her adult years at UC Berkeley. At that speed, the ball arrives at the plate in 
0.42 of a second. (A 90-m.p.h. major-league fastball arrives in 0.46 of a 
second.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now married and living in Alaska, Granger is a hot prospect for the U.S. team 
in 1996, when women's softball becomes a full-fledged Olympic sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "She brought a lot of interest to the game," says Don Sarno of Brea, her 
longtime pitching tutor and himself a Hall of Fame pitcher. He is pitching 
coach for the U.S. team in next month's world championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was in the papers and People magazine a lot. She drew big crowds. Kids 
see that and want to be like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Such players were bound to emerge once the little-girl leagues took root, 
Sarno says. "The game was played primarily by adult women in the '60s. The 
Lionettes in Orange (first an amateur team, then professional) was probably one 
of the greatest teams ever assembled. The girls' teams started growing in the 
'70s and really took off in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That is when the Miklos family joined up, and it has become a way of life. 
Call them when they're not home and the answering machine answers, "Strike one, 
strike two, strike three, we're out!"  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Miklos, a college baseball player until he quit to concentrate on his 
studies, is president of Tustin Bobby Sox and coaches Laura's team. Wife Janet 
Miklos, who played baseball with her brothers and disliked the tamer girl's 
sports of her high-school days, manages Jenny's team. All three daughters play. 
Laura and Kimmy are on the same team this year to reduced the time three 
separate practice and game schedules require. 
</P>
<P>
 Miklos, the ex-jock, says he couldn't be happier. "People would say, 'Poor 
Steve, he doesn't have any sons.' That's a laugh," says Janet Miklos. Those 
days are virtually dead, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest change in girls' sport is that it's now accepted by boys," says 
Redmer. "They expect the girls to be athletic." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think boys recognize the girls as equal athletes -- a lot of them, anyway," 
Hickey says. "You don't see a lot of difference between a boy and girl at 11 
years old. It's really amazing. You put the two up together, they could play on 
the same team. A lot of dads won't agree with you if they have sons, but it's 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 Attitudes that girls must be protected from hard physical competition still 
persist, in the South especially, Redmer says. For years there, girls have been 
allowed to play only slow-pitch softball, in which pitches are lofted toward 
the plate rather than thrown hard and fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, parents viewing fast-pitch softball as a road to a free 
college degree demanded that high schools provide fast-pitch teams for their 
daughters, and the Kentucky legislature passed an enabling law. Florida had 
passed similar legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still a lot of people afraid to see little girls run and jump and 
slide and be athletically active," Redmer says. "As soon as these dinosaurs 
fade away, girls will have the opportunity to succeed and fail." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those days are long gone in Southern California, Garman says. Back in 1971 she 
was hired to coach at Golden West College in Huntington Beach because the 
athletic director "was frustrated at the lack of opportunity for his daughter. 
He saw boys in uniforms and on good fields and saw the girls playing on park 
fields with throw-down bases being told 'just go play.' " Today's girls' 
leagues and tournaments with able coaches and good facilities "has been a long 
time coming," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, many doubted that women's professional tennis would command 
the attention it does today. Will the same thing happen to women's softball? 
</P>
<P>
 "We all cross our fingers and hope," says Garman, "because it's frustrating to 
see the great players, who if they were just a different sex, would be pulling 
in millions of dollars." Special Deliveries: Tale of Two Tosses 
</P>
<P>
 The basic difference in pitching style between fast-pitch softball and 
baseball is the overhand-versus-underhand delivery. Both types of balls can be 
thrown at more than 100 m.p.h. Shown is the process for right-handers; reverse 
if you're left-handed) Fast-Pitch Softball 1. Raise right hand over head, bend 
left knee 2. Swinging right arm from overhead to behind back, shift weight to 
right side 3. Using pitcher's plate for leverage, push weight back to left side 
4. Thrust pitching arm forward; release ball 5. Follow through with right arm 
high on right side. Baseball 1. Lean backward and transfer weight onto left 
side while raising both hands 2. Shifting weight to right side, lower arms and 
curl left knee to chest 3. Cock right arm and, using pitching rubber for 
leverage, push weight to left side 4. Snap right arm forward; release ball 5. 
Follow through across body to left side Notebook * More than 2.5 million girls 
play fast-pitch softball nationwide. * In Orange County, about 3,000 high 
school girls play fast-pitch softball each year. * Average speed fast-pitch for 
high school starting pitcher: 53 m.p.h. Softball Material: Cork core with layer 
of fiber matting covered with cowhide Circumference: 12 inches Weight: Six to 
seven ounces Baseball Material: Layers of cork, rubber and woolen yarn covered 
with cowhide Circumference: Nine inches Weight: Five ounces

SMOKE GETS IN HIS EYES (AND ON HIS NERVES)

 Let me tell you about the tyranny of secondhand smoke. I cough every morning 
for about two hours just to get my lungs open. Lately, I have a constant need 
to clear my throat and chest, which takes the form of a loud and guttural grunt 
not unlike the noises heard during war sequences of Kurosawa movies. It can be 
a social handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 I quit smoking (puffing, not inhaling, occasional cigars) in 1980. I had no 
congestion problem; it just seemed like a smart thing to do. Then, as the 
decade progressed, I noticed a nagging congestion that worsened, year by year. 
By 1986, allergy seasons were hellish periods when I would stay awake all 
night, drinking hot water, breathing steam and coughing up phlegm, just to 
recover some lung capacity. A doctor diagnosed my condition as "mild asthma" 
and gave me an inhaler. I threw it away (yes, it was denial) and opted for 
improving my diet and increasing exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, I sniffed out the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 I had always noticed that my 50-year-old apartment building smelled musty. I 
stupidly attributed this to "old building smell" -- that is, until a friend 
identified the odor as the acrid stench of secondhand cigarettes. No, I didn't 
live above a bar, but I might as well have. 
</P>
<P>
 My downstairs neighbor, you see, was an elderly woman whose life centered 
around listening to the Dodgers and sucking on generic-brand cigarettes. She 
sat in her apartment, all day and often all night, chain smoking. The smoke 
would accumulate to the point that it would literally pump out of her opened 
front door, through her windows, and up into my apartment -- entering through 
my door, windows and, most insidiously, through the gas heater vent. I suddenly 
realized I had spent about 10 years being poisoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Good lungs don't run in my family. My mother, a heavy smoker, died of 
congestive heart failure. My father was plagued by occasional lung infections 
and pneumonia. My grandfather, an immigrant coal miner in Ohio, suffered from 
black lung. You guessed it -- I am rather frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 My secondhand-smoke allergy has reached a point where the slightest whiff 
causes congestion, wheezing, chest tightness, discomfort. Prolonged exposure 
gives me sharp pains, and leaves me short of breath. I have a constant odd 
sensation in my bronchial tubes -- they feel sort of stiff, as if they are made 
of balsa wood. Many have been the nights when I have awakened at 3 a.m. gasping 
for breath because my downstairs neighbor had decided to puff away her 
insomnia. I have begun most days with a sore throat. 
</P>
<P>
 My neighbor -- call her Mrs. Butts, in honor of the Doonesbury character -- 
and I have always had a cordial relationship. In fact, because she was elderly 
and alone, I have gone to great lengths to be kind to her. I have shopped for 
her (sometimes at my own expense), picked up prescriptions for her, bought her 
pumpkin pies at Thanksgiving, driven her to the bus station and back when she 
goes to visit relatives, changed her light bulbs, moved her furniture, fitted 
her toilet with a special seat. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, I phoned her in the hospital when she had her hip replaced, and 
after she was struck by a car and left with a broken arm. I gave her many pep 
talks. I spent hours listening to her prattle, out of pity. I drove her to the 
hospital and back during several medical emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 On one especially memorable hospital trip, Mrs. Butts lost control of her . . 
. uh . . . bodily functions . . . in the front seat of my car while we were 
stuck on the freeway during a heat wave. "Don't worry," I advised, "happens to 
the best of us!" 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of the earthquake, I wrapped her in a blanket, gave her my 
radio, calmed her down and persuaded her to phone her grandson and leave the 
crippled building for the day. I once argued against a neighbor who wanted to 
persuade authorities that the woman was too old to care for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, I never even liked Mrs. Butts. I was just trying to be a decent guy. 
</P>
<P>
 The smoke pouring into my home was so powerful that even my clothes and hair 
smelled of cigarettes. Move, friends advised. I considered it. But even with 
rent control, on my glorious income as a free-lance writer I might have 
afforded a pretty good place Downtown -- say, around 2nd and Main. Instead, I 
bought an air purifier and two smokeless ashtrays for Mrs. Butts (one for her 
occasionally visiting, chain-smoking son.) It didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 The short version of this story is that naughty Mrs. Butts fibbed about using 
the ashtrays, ultimately took to sneering at me, laughing snidely at my claims 
that her smoke was affecting me ("Oh, how does it get in your apartment!"), and 
telling cigarette-addicted neighbors things like, "Look out! Oh God, don't 
light that cigarette! Here comes Rip!" 
</P>
<P>
 My last, and always doggedly polite, written request imploring her to use the 
smokeless ashtrays -- in which I detailed my health problems and suggested that 
it's entirely possible that my life has been shortened by her secondhand smoke 
-- elicited no response. Just increased smoke. She and her son seemed to take 
sport in attempting to smoke me right out of my home. 
</P>
<P>
 That was it. She had no apparent respect for my privacy or my health. I opted 
to follow a similar policy. I changed my lifestyle from being an extremely 
quiet neighbor to doing pretty much whatever I damned well pleased. This 
included setting up my drums, which I play very poorly, and practicing about an 
hour a day. 
</P>
<P>
 She complained to the landlord, who gently asked her to use the ashtrays. Her 
response: "I've smoked since I was 17. I'll never stop! I don't like those 
ashtrays! They make noise!" (They contain tiny fans.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now when I mentioned the tyranny of smoke, I was also referring to its hold on 
the smoker. The lady's humanity was held hostage by the little white tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Mrs. Butts is one of those people who takes the attitude that 
smoking is an act of death-defiance -- that smokers are cavalier, philosophical 
souls who are showing the world they aren't afraid to die. 
</P>
<P>
 I've noticed that many media commentators adopt this same attitude -- and in a 
not entirely tongue-in-cheek manner. One recent commentary in this newspaper 
took that very position -- that smokers are to be celebrated for being "the 
only ones prepared to tell the truth about the inevitability of life and 
death," as opposed to those who have, as the commentator put it, replaced 
holiness with health. 
</P>
<P>
 (I submit that this sophomoric and insensitive notion is also inaccurate. 
Nonsmokers -- especially those with lung problems -- are so acutely aware of 
death that they are trying to legislate secondhand smoke out of existence.) 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the point that Mrs. Butts, and all the commentators and the tobacco 
companies who scoff at nonsmokers battling to breathe smoke-free air either 
ignore or do not understand: Not everybody has leather lungs like Mrs. Butts, 
who has lived into her 80s. The smoke that might not bother you might, in fact, 
send an asthmatic scurrying in mortal terror. The vast increase in asthma in 
this country has been widely reported. There are a whole lot of people with 
lung problems, and a whole lot of people who don't want lung problems. I'll 
just bet they constitute a majority. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Mrs. Butts, well, she has moved far away. Never thanked me for all the 
years of watching out for her, the kindness, never said goodby. Left her home 
of 40-plus years to live with her son in nicotine Nirvana. Presumably, they are 
now smoking themselves silly.

<P>
 And as I sit in my apartment, freely breathing that great fresh mixture of 
combustion-engine particulate matter and oxygen known as Los Angeles air, I 
have a wish to convey to Mrs. Butts, her son and to the smokers' rights 
commentators, and especially to the tobacco industry, which is bitterly 
campaigning to convince people that the dangers of secondhand smoke are so much 
hot air. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's my wish: 
</P>
<P>
 May you all wind up in that place where the smoke billows thick and strong for 
all eternity. With nary a lozenge in sight.

TEACHING LIFE LESSONS; IT'S A BOOK ABOUT SUICIDE, SEX AND TEEN-AGE PAIN. BUT 
DESPITE THE FUSS IT'S CAUSING, 'ORDINARY PEOPLE' HELPS KIDS OPEN UP.

 Giggles. That's what she gets for uttering the F-word. Naturally. Hands on the 
hips of her faded jeans, her lipsticked smile starting to crack, Lucy Swindell 
is perched casually at the podium, calling the swim coach " a damn, picky 
bastard ," making snide comments about the new girl's butt. She saunters 
around, ticking off a string of forbidden phrases -- words that rhyme with 
"class," "spit," "witch" and, of course, "luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the teen-agers are laughing out loud, trying to swallow nervous snickers 
as this 51-year-old woman -- their teacher, for God's sake -- forges ahead: " 
It wasn't exactly an orgy of pleasure for me, you dumb. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly the vocabulary expected from a high school English teacher, but 
Swindell is just reading aloud from the assigned text, Judith Guest's novel 
"Ordinary People." 
</P>
<P>
 Swindell has been teaching from this book at Kennedy High in La Palma, an 
Orange County suburb, for more than a decade. For just as long, people have 
been telling her -- and teachers across the nation -- not to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ordinary People" is among the most frequently challenged books nationwide, 
says the Washington-based constitutional liberties defense group People for the 
American Way. Last year, California led the nation with more censorship 
struggles than any other state -- one of them concerning "Ordinary People" 
occurred in the Anaheim Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 To delve beneath the political debate, The Times spent a month studying the 
book alongside Swindell's students. A reporter watched classroom sessions, then 
read students' personal reflections in daily journals, formal essays, and poems 
exploring the characters' feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Published in 1976 and later made into a film that won an Academy Award for 
best picture, "Ordinary People" is a 263-page bestseller about 17-year-old 
Conrad Jarrett, who grew up pampered in suburban Chicago then lost his big 
brother, Buck, in a boating accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Racked with guilt over Buck's death, the teen-ager slits his wrist and is 
committed to a psychiatric hospital. Despite problems in communicating with his 
harried tax attorney father and self-centered socialite mother, the boy 
survives. But it remains unclear whether the family will. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the big fuss? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there's the frank talk about suicide. Fights between parent and child, 
including some harsh back talk; musings about masturbation and premarital 
intercourse between Con and his girlfriend. Plus, the teen-agers in the book 
talk like teen-agers, which means slang and swearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Swindell says she teaches the book to help build cross-generational discussion 
of dysfunctional families and teen-age estrangement. That's just what keeps it 
on the firing line. Critics dislike Guest's portrayal of teen-age and family 
life and fear that reading about the Jarretts' inability to communicate will 
stifle dialogue between teen-agers and parents rather than foster it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has no place in a teen-ager's hands in an English class," said Treva Brown 
of Anaheim, a single mother of four who led the local protest against the 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown lists 26 reasons "Ordinary People" doesn't belong on district- and 
state-approved reading lists. Language, sexuality and suicide are her top 
concerns, but she also contends that the story is boring, the author is 
unimportant and the vocabulary is too simple to merit inclusion in the 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I raised (my) kid to be a fine young man who doesn't curse, who doesn't 
swear, who believes that sex before marriage is wrong," Brown said. "I put him 
in the public school system expecting them to go beyond what I had given him, 
and they give him this nonsense. It was a slap in my face and a slap in my 
son's face." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim school board and the state Department of Education have rejected 
Brown's request to ban the book, and a recall movement against several Anaheim 
school board members failed in April. But the controversy continues, with Brown 
promising to revive the issue in next fall's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, "Ordinary People" is still being taught. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Swindell's sophomore English classes sit in a four-row horseshoe, surrounded 
by posters praising racial unity, world peace and environmentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 One front-row seat contains Sean Temple, a hockey lover whose writing shows 
sharp wit and intellect. Nearby is Mike Caira, who flirts a lot with the girls 
behind him, then flirts with Swindell to escape punishment by detention. Then 
there's Brian Castles, a bright boy whose father also teaches English at 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristen Vetica is quiet and seems unmoved by "Ordinary People," but her 
journal reveals something else. 
</P>
<P>
 Swindell's yearlong syllabus includes the requisite Shakespeare, "Julius 
Caesar"; the classic English-class tomes "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Lord of 
the Flies"; "Fahrenheit 451," Ray Bradbury's futuristic tale of book burning; 
Lorraine Hansbury's play "A Raisin in the Sun"; and "Ordinary People." 
</P>
<P>
 Some books are there for lessons in literary structure, vocabulary, character 
development, metaphor and narrative style. "Ordinary People," she says, 
provides life lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 They begin with the title. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we're going to determine in this novel is that there is no 
such thing as ordinary people," the teacher says. "We're all ordinary, but 
we're all extraordinary in one way." 
</P>
<P>
 Swindell knows that relatively few teen-agers will lose a sibling to tragedy, 
but that most have trouble talking to their parents. Only a handful ever step 
inside a psychiatric hospital, but all of them shudder before their first date 
and stress out over extracurricular activities. Some, like Conrad, are in 
therapy. Even more, like Conrad, have fistfights with former friends. They've 
lied to their parents, kept secrets and worried about the changes in their 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning, Swindell takes a poll: What are teen-agers' biggest problems? 
</P>
<P>
 Of 33 students in one class, 17 name drugs as their No. 1 worry. Eleven say 
sex. Five: parents. Three: violence. Four: depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peer pressure?" Swindell suggests. They all nod. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, writing in the journals Swindell requires them to keep all year, the 
students list their personal troubles. Too young to drive; too poor to afford 
auto insurance. There are divorce survivors, and veterans of switching schools 
-- or switching countries. 
</P>
<P>
 One boy lives here; his parents work in Taiwan. A girl has an alcoholic 
stepfather. Another's mother "works two jobs and when she comes home she 
sleeps. We don't have time for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 A white student's mother won't allow her to date blacks. Another student's 
father doesn't allow dating at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The students are lost in the opening pages. 
</P>
<P>
 To have a reason to get up in the morning, it is necessary to posses s a 
guiding principle. A belief of some kind. A bumper sticker, if you will. People 
in cars on busy freeways call to each other Boycott Grapes , comfort each other 
Honk If You Love Jesus , joke with each other Be Kind to Animals -- Kiss a 
Beaver . They identify, they summarize, they antagonize with statements of 
faith.  
</P>
<P>
 Guest confuses them by alternating narrators, switching between Conrad and his 
father from one chapter to the next. They hate Conrad's stream-of-consciousness 
blabber. Many of the cultural references seem dated -- they don't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 A week passes, and half the class hasn't cracked a page; the assignment 
calendar says they should be through Chapter 15, but the students admit they 
are on Chapter 3, maybe Chapter 4. There aren't enough books for everyone, so 
Swindell offers 25 bonus points to people who bring their own, and keeps 
begging the district for more copies. She keeps reading aloud, and devotes a 
class to silent reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Arms folded across his book bag, Sean is silent, but not reading. Sean is an 
"A" student, but "Ordinary People" strikes him as, well, kind of ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's worth reading, but I don't know if anybody in this class really 
wants to read (anything)," he said. "Most people are probably thinking it's 
kind of lame." 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, Con is a very troubled boy, stuck in a complicated life. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed final exams getting shock therapy in the hospital, so now he's stuck 
in junior classes -- his friends are all seniors. He can't stand his 
once-beloved swim team; it reminds him of his dead brother. Worst of all, 
Conrad thinks his mother wishes he had died instead of Buck when the boys got 
caught in a storm while sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 In class, Swindell focuses on the family relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning, the students sit with markers and white paper, brainstorming in 
groups, making lists of "things that tear us apart as a family" and "what holds 
us together." Another day, the groups prepare skits depicting a typical day in 
the life of various stereotypical families. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first major writing project in connection with the novel, each student 
interviews a relative, then writes an autobiographical family history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to learn more about your family," Swindell says. "I want you to learn 
more about your family." 
</P>
<P>
 For many, it is the first time in a while they have spoken to their parents 
about school -- or about anything, really, beyond negotiating curfew or 
borrowing the car. 
</P>
<P>
 A boy who failed English in the fall is the first to turn in the essay; his 
mother calls Swindell, jubilant, saying: "My son actually talked to me about an 
assignment!" Another student writes 28 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin Jondle and Ronnie Ellison usually stride into class together, 
sometimes grab a smooch before the bell rings, then sit side by side in the 
back row. As the teacher talks, they hold hands across desks. She leans her 
head on his shoulder and fiddles with his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their smiling eyes lock whenever Swindell talks about Conrad and his 
girlfriend, Jeanine, whenever the classroom discussion turns to dating and 
romance and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad's head is on his arm, one hand curved around her breast. . . . His 
heart floats inside his chest. His skin feels branded everywhere that she has 
touched him . . . . Swindell reads from Chapter 30 as the nervous laughter and 
snickers begin anew. Gently, he asks her, because now he is her protector 
against the world, "Did I hurt you?"  
</P>
<P>
 Kristin and Ronnie have been dating about a year, and have not gone all the 
way. Since reading "Ordinary People," they've been bugging Swindell and her 
boyfriend to join them on a double date. And the book has helped the young 
couple discuss sex in a new way, Kristin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need sex out in the open. Teen-agers these days are more explorative," 
she writes in her journal. "Parents don't want to talk about it, so books or 
magazines are teen-agers' only source." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Suicide," a student calls out, "is a permanent solution to a temporary 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 They've finished the book, and psychologist Sharon Garrett is visiting class 
for the day, trying to debunk some common myths. Like the notion that if 
somebody says they want to commit suicide, they're probably not serious. Or 
that once people try to kill themselves, they never get over suicidal feelings. 
Or that suicide is random, arising without warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried so many different things. Starvation, a blade, and other stuff, too," 
one student writes in her journal, recalling her own suicide attempts several 
years before. "I even tried to overdose on Tylenol. I guess I just wanted 
attention and I couldn't get any because of my attitude problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "To even think about it now I feel so stupid. I'm glad I didn't kill myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad seems glad, too, until he reads in the newspaper that a friend from the 
psychiatric hospital has actually killed herself. Reeling with pain, the boy's 
thoughts race back to the boat accident, his bloody suicide attempt, and his 
long hospital stay. 
</P>
<P>
 He walks swiftly, without direction. To calm himself. To get away from dreams, 
because there are worse ones and he doesn't want to remember them, doesn't want 
to think at all, less intense, less intense, but how to do it?  
</P>
<P>
 Kristen Vetica, a 15-year-old basketball star, gets glassy-eyed as Swindell 
reads the frightful passage. She's thinking of her own friend, who shot himself 
to death while Kristen was reading the novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will always be somebody that was going to commit suicide and there's 
nothing that anybody can do about it," she sighs. "If you don't talk to anyone 
and tell what's going on then no one's ever going to know how you're feeling 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden, the students have gotten into it. They bring in anecdotes of 
their own family life, their own alienation, their own curiosities about 
growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally a book we can relate to," one girl says. "A book to help us 
understand we're not alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, things get sticky. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike, a precocious student who gets good grades but doesn't like to pay 
attention, asks permission one morning to use profanity for a classroom 
exercise about family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to," the boy says. "Just a little bit, to get our point across." 
Holding up the book, Mike reminds the teacher how Guest employs racy language 
to make her characters more real, her story come alive. "How come they can but 
we can't?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now Swindell is giggling, like the class did that first day when she read the 
text aloud. "There's a difference," she says, shaking her head in a firm "no" 
to Mike's request, "between using it in a literary piece of work and using 
profanity to put people down." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 20 years after it was published, author Guest is surprised "Ordinary 
People" is still making headlines, especially for the language. 
</P>
<P>
 "The themes in the book are way more threatening than the language," Guest 
said of the book that earned an award for best first novel of 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process of (Conrad's) recovery is also the story of his autonomy, 
learning that neither of his parents are perfect, and learning that he can't 
keep living by these rules that he doesn't believe in," Guest said. "That is 
the kind of material that some people think is subversive and threatening -- 
you can cover that all by complaining about the language."

IN THE WORDS OF THE STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In class, Lucy Swindell did most of the talking. But each day, her students 
opened up to their journals, responding to the novel and relating its many 
themes to their lives. A page, a paragraph -- sometimes only a few lines -- the 
writing was stark, honest, and sometimes silly. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the biggest problems teen-agers face? Why do people want to ban this 
book? Do you find the language in the book offensive? Is life fair? What is a 
dysfunctional family? What did you learn from the novel? 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tidbits of the students' reflections: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers get pressure everywhere they go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate other stories that always use the same formula. They don't use the 
'normal language.' They stop when the story reaches the bad side of society or 
human beings. I don't think that is a good way to write the story. The world is 
not perfect. We do not need to cover up the bad side because we want to have a 
perfect world. Maybe the language is not necessary, but we cannot cancel all 
the bad language." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Most teen-agers have something to do with drugs or sex and the ones that 
don't want to do or talk about either subject end up being laughed at or losing 
friendships because they choose to say no. . . . We are going through a period 
of time when a lot of pressure is put on us about just anything people can 
think of and this pressure doesn't always come from adults but from our own 
peers. It's a very confusing time because you're stuck in between being a kid 
and an adult and you don't know which way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I do find this novel rather strange and stumbling. Too much profanity for my 
taste. And I don't understand where they are or where they came from. But I 
guess I will have to read more and understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers don't like to read fairy tales, they like to read the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The book is confusing because what is Ordinary People. I have never heard the 
words ordinary people before. What is an ordinary person? Is there really an 
ordinary person? I hope to answer this question when I read the novel . . . 
maybe!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all families are considered dysfunctional nowadays. No family is 
perfect. Because I know my family is dysfunctional. Actually, I don't know a 
functional family. But I think they should change the rating so that normal 
family with normal problems should be considered functional." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Sex becomes a big factor in your life at this age. You want to be able to 
brag about it to your friends and to rub it in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When do they think we should hear about teen-age suicide? When we are adults 
it will be too late! And the same with teen-age sex. It's very important that 
we talk about it before we do things we might regret, which many kids have. 
Also, most teen-agers are having or thinking about sex." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that there is no such thing as an 'ordinary' family. Everyone 
experiences problems and deals with them in their own way. Every family has 
feelings of guilt, loneliness, depression. Almost everyone experiences lack of 
communication, selfishness, family problems. I also learned you can't hold in 
everything, you have to communicate with others because it will come back in 
your face or it will keep haunting you. Suicide is not something to joke about. 
You should take it like it's really going to happen. It's the safer 
assumption." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that parents don't understand teen-agers. It's like they were 
born parents and never were teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "One important element in keeping a family together is communication. Not only 
do families have to communicate, but they also have to get along and respect 
each other. If the members of a family don't respect each other then obviously 
they would not get along, which would eventually lead to not communicating." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A good family is like the Brady Bunch, that is a perfect family. The Bundys 
are a dysfunctional family. My family is an in between, nice and not nice, I am 
a Brady Bunch/Bundy family." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This book has my full attention. I feel that I can feel what Con feels. I can 
relate to how he feels, thinking that nobody cares about him. At the same time, 
I feel extremely sorry for him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I am a survivor. If something went wrong in my life I do feel I would 
be able to handle it. If there was a death in my family of course I would be 
sad and not know what to do. But some way, I know, I would still be able to go 
on and be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually when I face a problem I will try to avoid it first. Then, sooner or 
later, I will find out there is no way to avoid it unless the problem 
disappears or I disappear. The both are impossible, so there is only one way 
left -- face the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "From this novel I learned that my own life isn't as bad as I thought it was."

BODY WATCH; TO HEEL OR NOT TO HEEL; SPIKY PUMPS CAN LIFT THE SOUL AS WELL AS 
THE SOLES. SHE'LL RISK HER FEET FOR A FEW EXTRA INCHES.

<TEXT>
<P>
 You don't need to walk a mile in my high heels to know me. I'll make it easy: 
I am a 5-foot-5 brunette who believes 5-foot-8 blondes live on greener grass. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried being blond once -- with a wig -- and was glad I hadn't used bleach. 
But standing taller is another issue, one that I won't abandon as long as there 
are friends like Manolo, Roger, Kenneth, Sam, Libby, Joan and David. 
</P>
<P>
 They haven't crippled my feet, ruined my back or broken my legs. And I don't 
want to be saved from my modest addiction by medical mumbo jumbo. (I am sure, 
as with most things medical, that someday some health journal will report that 
elevation is good for your soles.) 
</P>
<P>
 True, I know more about Pedro Almodovar than podiatry. I have never invested 
in a foot fix, but I did pay good money to see Almodovar's "High Heels." I was 
disappointed. I had expected to watch sexy stilettos and the like clicking 
metaphorically all over Madrid. Instead there were a lot of shots of Chanel 
jackets, necklaces and handbags. 
</P>
<P>
 I think Henry Jaglom is the man for the job -- and the double-entendre. He 
could call the movie "Heel Talk" and plant his usual female corps in front of 
the camera to expound extemporaneously on heels -- the ones they have worn and 
the ones that have worn them to a frazzle.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, men have their own high-heel doublespeak. Theirs is a love-love 
relationship: They love to see women in them and they love to make snide 
remarks about them, poking fun at imaginary squished toes, tortoise-speeds and 
altitude-related nose bleeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they're angry because they lost a sexy accessory. You've probably 
forgotten that men once wore heels, prancing to minuets in splendid 
surroundings with mistresses in every corner. But it's a good thing the shoe is 
on the other foot now. Can you imagine the fate of "The Seven Year Itch" if it 
had been Tom Ewell instead of Marilyn Monroe standing over the subway grate in 
sling backs?  
</P>
<P>
 And what if Marilyn had worn flats? Not exactly the stuff movie history is 
made of. 
</P>
<P>
 Women need high heels. They don't need them all the time and most are smart 
enough to know when to come down to Earth for a rest. But believe me, on a bad 
hair-face-figure day, heels come in handy. They also double as exercise 
equipment, working out the calves and posterior -- if you remember to squeeze 
that rear while in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 I can run, walk and climb in heels. But I do object to the cinematic 
ridiculous. You know, women thrown from airplanes and cars into dire straits, 
walking for miles, sometimes for days, in high heels. Screenwriters need to 
think about this heel issue. Maybe the heroines could get lucky and find 
sneakers. Then again, maybe they could just get smart and break off the heels. 
</P>
<P>
 If podiatrists and others were really worried about freaky footwear, they 
would point to pointe shoes. A ballerina's feet are not a pretty sight. Of 
course, that's considered suffering for art's sake. But fine shoes are art. 
Just look at Mary Trasko's book "Heavenly Soles," or the Ferragamos exhibited 
in museums, or Dorothy's ruby slippers -- for which an anonymous bidder paid 
$165,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings to mind dancer-actresses such as Ginger Rogers and Cyd Charisse, 
gliding effortlessly across the screen in high heels. And what about those 
chorus lines of women tap-dancing in top hats and heels? Maybe that's the 
trouble -- no one makes movies like that anymore. High heels aren't getting the 
treatment they deserve. They need old Hollywood and a new grass-roots 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be called HHISS: High Heel Information Service Society. There could 
be a monthly newsletter, a Washington lobby, celebrity fund-raisers and grants 
for research at prestigious universities. Famous designers could create the 
miniature mouse (a.k.a. mini mouse) shoes needed for the rodent experiments. 
The results would end years of high-heel hysteria. They would prove once and 
for all that mice that wear heels live longer and happier lives than mice that 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate would be over. The anti-heel movement would vanish. "No High Heels" 
signs would be removed from podiatrists' waiting rooms. And women would be free 
at last to walk as they wish.

BODY WATCH; TO HEEL OR NOT TO HEEL; STYLISH SHOES TAKE A TOLL ON TOES AND 
BACKS. A DOCTOR ASKS WHY WOMEN ENDURE SUCH TORTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.W. BALKIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Dr. S.W. Balkin is a faculty member, 
department of orthopedics, podiatry section, at County-USC Medical Center.

<TEXT>
<P>
 After 1,000 years, this century saw an end to the custom of binding infant 
girls' feet. So why is it that countless women engage in another form of 
torture -- wearing high heels? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the numbers:  
</P>
<P>
 * Because they wear high heels, women outnumber men in chronic foot disorders. 
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, women have twice the 
number of ingrown toenails, three times as many corns and calluses, and nine 
times more bunions. 
</P>
<P>
 * High heels contribute to double the number of back problems found in women 
than in men. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pointed toe boxes cause far more painful nerve tumors (neuromas) and 
deformed toes in women than in men. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, these problems often need lifelong care or surgery, and considering the 
numbers involved, the costs are staggering. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the American Podiatric Medical Assn., in 1991 an estimated $5.25 
billion was paid to podiatrists, orthopedists and other physicians and health 
providers for foot care. (This did not include hospital charges in cases of 
surgery or the $381 million for over-the-counter foot products purchased by 47 
million Americans.) 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years of private practice leads me to believe that a significant amount 
of this expense is associated with stylish shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thin soles, coupled with high heels, dramatically increase forefoot pressure, 
leading to another common and painfully disabling condition: irreversible loss 
of shock absorbing fatty tissue. Unwanted fat accumulates on our bellies and 
derriere but is lost over the sole -- where it is critically needed for walking 
the average 100,000 miles over a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Adolescents and women in their 20s and early 30s are not easily alerted to 
complications because high fashion shoes can be slowly deforming devices that 
take years before the effects appear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shoe-fitting problems start early in life. A United Kingdom study of 
9-year-old children found that 25% of girls -- compared to 1% of boys -- wore 
unsuitable shoes, notably a narrow toe box. The ill-fitting process continues 
into adulthood with 80% of women consistently wearing shoes that are too small, 
as reported in a study by female members of the American Orthopaedic Foot and 
Ankle Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as cigarettes carry a warning label, perhaps, too, should some shoes. 
Maybe there could be a conference of manufacturers, designers, and podiatric 
and orthopedic specialists to determine an acceptable range of styles and set 
standards. Shoes not meeting basic requirements could be labeled with a 
cautionary note. 
</P>
<P>
 More attention should also be given to the social, psychological and sexual 
factors embedded in the male and female psyches. Women seem compelled to be 
sexually appealing to men. It is regrettable that they accept a form of 
self-disfigurement as a consequence. 
</P>
<P>
 Corsets worn within the past 200 years accentuated breasts and buttocks but 
also put women at risk for injury because space for internal organs was 
severely diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 A definite change for the better began about 25 years ago, perhaps 
coincidentally, when more women started wearing pants and so-called walking or 
athletic shoes. Never before had women dared to challenge males in such a way. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic increase in sales of these shoes is possibly the best thing to 
happen to women's feet. The U.S. Department of Commerce reports that of 1.2 
billion pairs of shoes sold in 1993, one-third were in the walking-shoe 
category -- an extraordinary 30% increase since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 This healthy trend continues as shown in a recent Roper Poll, which found a 
drop from 40% in 1985 to 25% in 1993 of adult women who wore high heels at 
least twice weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 Time will tell whether this march toward healthier feet will continue. But be 
aware that no matter how appealing -- or appalling -- fashion shoes appear, in 
time they cause chronic disabling pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Women, it remains your battle and your choice. By taking greater 
responsibility, you can prevent needless misery for yourselves and future 
generations.

BODY WATCH; MYTH BUSTERS; DON'T BE BUGGED BY DRAFTS -- VIRUSES CAUSE COLDS

 It was the kind of health information you never questioned. After all, it came 
from an authority -- not your doctor, but from your mom, your grandpa or maybe 
even your pal who once dated a med student.  
</P>
<P>
 From time to time, we'll look at these long-held health "facts" and answer the 
question -- sorry, Mom -- true or false.

 "Sitting in a drafty room increases your chance of catching cold." 
</P>
<P>
 "False," says Elliot Dick, professor of preventive medicine at the University 
of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, and a longtime researcher of the cold 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The draft would have to contain a virus that went up your nose and attached 
to a mucosal cell," he says. In other words, a draft doesn't give you a cold, a 
virus does. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you have a cold, drafts don't make them worse, he adds, citing research 
by colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Get out of those wet clothes before you catch your death." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget it, Dick says. "Wet clothes don't increase the risk of a cold, either." 
</P>

 "Cranberry juice will cure a urinary tract infection." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. and 
funded by Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc., suggests cranberry juice can reduce 
bacteria in the urine. The Harvard researchers, who led the study, aren't 
certain how the juice might work, but speculate a chemical in it might deserve 
the credit. The researchers suggest more research. 
</P>
<P>
 Until more data is in, cranberry juice probably can't hurt, says Dr. Eila 
Skinner, USC assistant professor of urology. But it won't necessarily rule out 
the need to see a doctor, she adds: "In adult women with symptoms of urinary 
tract infection, 50% will clear without treatment, usually by drinking lots of 
fluid -- and if it happens to be cranberry juice, great. Any liquid helps get 
out the bacteria. If symptoms don't clear in two or three days, though, see a 
doctor." Antibiotics might be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Infections in men and children can be associated with potentially serious 
disorders, so they should always see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "If a man isn't bald by age 30, he probably never will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Not true. "Some people start balding later," says Dr. Bernard Raskin, a 
Valencia dermatologist and UCLA assistant clinical professor of 
medicine/dermatology. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who start balding earlier tend to lose more hair and become bald 
earlier," he says. "People who lose hair later tend to lose it more slowly. If 
they do become bald, it occurs at a later age." 
</P>
<P>
 Raskin is often asked if baldness passed through the mother's side of the 
family. His answer? No. Laying to rest another misconception, he adds: "There 
is no relationship between baldness and sexual potency, sterility or 
fertility."

DRIVER WAS INTENTIONALLY WEAVING BEFORE FATAL CRASH; ACCIDENT: TEEN-AGE 
SURVIVOR SAYS FRIEND KILLED IN COLLISION WAS TRYING TO AMUSE 3-YEAR-OLD 
PASSENGER, WHO ALSO DIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A survivor of a crash that killed three friends has told authorities that at 
the time of the incident, the 15-year-old driver was intentionally weaving her 
car back and forth to amuse a 3-year-old passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Acevedo, 14, gave police an account that provides an explanation for 
the accident that fits with the statements of other witnesses and victims, who 
said they saw the youths' car weaving before the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Acevedo "told me that (the driver) was swerving left and right to amuse the 
kid . . . to make the kid laugh," said Deputy Mark Slater of the Santa Clarita 
Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Acevedo described the driver, JoKema Du Bois, 15, as "wired" after eating 
pizza and drinking soda at church, said Du Bois' grandmother and guardian, Mary 
McWilliams. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams said her granddaughter suffered from low blood-sugar levels, and 
consuming sugar could make her excessively active and then drowsy. Du Bois and 
two others, including the 3-year-old, died in the crash June 1 on Seco Canyon 
Road as they were returning from a Canyon Country church youth group meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing Alicia told me is that JoKema was wired, and I said, 'Uh-oh,' 
" McWilliams said. "She knew she couldn't eat sugar, soda, or any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Some details of Acevedo's recollection appear to be incorrect, according to 
Slater. For example, the teen-ager said she was holding 3-year-old Jesika Noell 
on her lap when the collision occurred, but a deputy who arrived at the site of 
the collision moments after it occurred found the toddler in a seat belt in the 
back seat of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think due to her head injury she is in some confusion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noell, Du Bois and Gena Watkinson, 15, died in the crash. Acevedo is in stable 
condition and Du Bois' sister, Barbara, 14, is in critical condition at 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center, said Deborah Moore, a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams said Barbara Du Bois has remained in a coma since the accident and 
has a 50% chance of survival, up from 10% when the accident occurred. Du Bois 
underwent a six-hour surgery Monday to put pins in both of her legs and a 
breathing tube in her throat. More surgery may be required. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us it was dangerous to do surgery on her, but it was more dangerous 
not to because she is in so much pain," McWilliams said. 
</P>
<P>
 JoKema Du Bois, who was not licensed to drive, took the car without 
permission, according to her grandmother. Slater said Acevedo claims to have 
ridden with Du Bois before and stated, "She's a good driver." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence collected by investigators concludes that Du Bois was driving at 43 
m.p.h. when the collision occurred, Slater said. The speed limit on the street 
is 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are still waiting for the results of an autopsy to determine if 
other factors, such as alcohol or drugs, may have played a role in the 
accident, Slater said. He said Acevedo has "emphatically" denied Du Bois was 
driving under the influence of drugs or other substances.

MAN CONVICTED OF ENCOURAGING ROOMMATE TO COMMIT SUICIDE; CRIME: VERDICT AGAINST 
ALEX COVENTRY OF TUJUNGA MAY BE THE STATE'S FIRST UNDER A RARELY USED, 
121-YEAR-OLD LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Tujunga man was convicted Monday on felony charges of helping his roommate 
commit suicide by handing him a loaded shotgun and telling him, "Just do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The guilty verdict in the trial of Alex Coventry may represent the first 
conviction in the state under a rarely used, 121-year-old law that prohibits 
aiding, advising or encouraging someone to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of deliberations, a Van Nuys Superior Court jury determined 
that Coventry, a 44-year-old recovering alcoholic, was criminally liable in the 
July 2, 1993, suicide of Leonard Medina, a 42-year-old unemployed man. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews following the conviction, jurors said they focused on Coventry's 
actions and the state law, ignoring any parallels with Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the 
retired Michigan pathologist who has admitted assisting 20 terminally ill 
patients end their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understood this wasn't a Kevorkian case and we weren't here to judge 
whether suicide was right or wrong, but just whether a crime was committed in 
assisting someone in a suicide," said juror Gregory Brown of Tujunga. "The fact 
was this person wasn't terminally ill." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing statements he made throughout the trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew R. 
Flier distanced this case from those linked to Kevorkian. "If you set aside 
your actual viewpoints on this particular and sensitive issue, and you listen 
to the cold, hard facts, you see he violated" the law, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ronald S. Coen is expected to sentence Coventry this morning. He faces a 
maximum of three years in state prison, but Coventry's attorney is hoping his 
client will be placed on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, Medina was despondent over an eviction notice and his 
bleak financial situation after a day of drinking with Coventry's live-in 
girlfriend at the Tujunga apartment the trio shared. He threatened to kill 
himself, as he had many times before. 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry admitted to police that he handed his roommate a loaded shotgun and 
told him to "stop talking about it." Although he did not testify on his own 
behalf, Coventry maintained during a tape-recorded police interview that he had 
no idea Medina would put the gun to his chest and pull the trigger, blowing a 
four-inch hole in his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors reported that Coventry's statement to police and another taped 
interview with his girlfriend, Linda McDowell, were at the center of their 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry should have known Medina was serious about his threat because his 
friend had previously attempted to kill himself, jurors said. McDowell told 
police the shotgun was hidden out of fear that Medina would use it on himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the one thing that got a lot of us was the fact that he knowingly 
handed him the shotgun, and it was knowingly loaded, and he knew the person had 
suicidal tendencies," said juror Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Agreeing that Medina was ultimately accountable for his own death, the panel 
of 10 men and two women felt Coventry's actions clearly encouraged his 
depressed friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry "had choices, he had options, he didn't have to contribute to the 
whole act," said jury foreman Bart McPhail of Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think ultimately we all believed that Alex was truly sorry after the fact . 
. . but we couldn't ignore that it was after the fact," McPhail said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Kenneth P. Lezin said he interpreted his client's taped 
statement differently. "My belief from the tape is it showed so clearly that he 
didn't intend for Leonard to die," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry told police he was shocked when Medina shot himself. He also 
suggested that the shooting may have been accidental, reasoning that Medina may 
not have known that the gun was actually loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, they wouldn't accept that," Lezin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they were unaware of any other convictions under California's 
assisted-suicide law. The Shasta County district attorney's office reportedly 
declined to file charges recently against a physician in the assisted suicide 
of a terminally ill AIDS patient.

LOTTERIES TO SETTLE OPEN-ENROLLMENT OVERFLOW TODAY; EDUCATION: APPLICANT TOTALS 
ARE LOWER THAN SOME ADMINISTRATORS EXPECTED. STUDENTS APPARENTLY FAVORED 
CAMPUSES NEAR THEIR HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles schools with too many open-enrollment applications and not enough 
space geared up to hold lotteries today to determine which students will be 
allowed to attend the campuses of their choice this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools -- primarily in the west San Fernando Valley -- will randomly draw 
students' names for enrollment and create waiting lists for potential openings 
under the Los Angeles Unified School District's new state-ordered 
open-enrollment policy. For the first time, students can transfer to schools 
outside their neighborhoods as long as space is available and the campuses' 
ethnic balances remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials did not know the total number of lotteries or the 
number of applications for individual schools on Monday. But officials said the 
number of applications will not reflect how many students will enroll at a 
school because many may have applied at several different campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we know that parents are shopping and applying at more than one 
school, we won't get a real handle on this until they actually enroll in 
September," said Bruce Takeguma, a specialist in the district office 
coordinating the program. "It's real hard to say now because the numbers are 
artificially high." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, school administrators and attendance clerks counted applications, 
set up lottery schedules and analyzed racial balances on Monday, the deadline 
for applications. 
</P>
<P>
 An informal survey of schools across the district showed that students 
primarily applied to campuses near their homes and that applications were not 
as high as some administrators expected.  
</P>
<P>
 However, there have been more applications than expected from students 
currently attending private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, administrators said they believe parents are reluctant to send their 
children to schools across the sprawling district. "I really think it's a 
question of convenience rather than academics," said Barbara Garry, assistant 
principal at San Fernando High. "There are very few students who are going to 
drive across the Valley to a Taft or El Camino." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, schools such as Taft High and El Camino High, both in Woodland 
Hills, received large numbers of applications -- Taft got 459 and El Camino 200 
-- but those came predominantly from students who live in the West Valley. 
Taft, however, had space for 600 and El Camino had space for just 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the district does not guarantee bus transportation, students might 
have been deterred from applying, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Marshall High School in Los Feliz, which received about 200 applications 
for 300 openings, most of the students live in neighboring Belmont or Hollywood 
high school attendance areas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Welby Way Elementary School in West Hills, which got about 120 applications 
for 15 slots, officials said many of the students live just outside the school 
boundaries or have siblings in the magnet center that is located on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrienne Serviss, who lives in West Hills and wants her first-grade son to 
attend Welby Way rather than her local campus, Nevada Street Elementary, said 
she believes the open-enrollment policy is ideal for parents who don't want 
their children to travel long distances to school. "People are probably just 
shopping for the best school in their area," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The open-enrollment season began in May, setting off a flurry of activity by 
schools seeking to attract students. Grant, in fact, took out a newspaper ad, 
and dozens of other schools produced short videos that aired on the school 
district's television station. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Lappin, the principal at Foshay Middle School in South-Central Los 
Angeles, said he received about 140 applications for 175 slots mainly because 
of his advertisements and through word-of-mouth in the community. "The response 
is really gratifying," Lappin said. "We do a lot of work in the community, and 
I'm real pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Some campuses, such as Grant High School in Van Nuys, will hold lotteries 
simply because of concerns over racial diversity. Grant received 160 
applications and has space for 300, but the school must maintain specific 
integration ratios. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is the integration guidelines have to be followed," said 
Takeguma. "We have to make sure we don't swing it one way ethnically." 
</P>
<P>
 At some schools, the numbers of students applying and the number leaving were 
about the same. At Canoga Park High, for example, about 20 applied and 27 
checked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep telling the kids they're better off in a smaller school where everyone 
knows them," said Sandra Benavidez, the assistant principal, who tried to talk 
some students into staying. "The kids will just become numbers" at other 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of students appear to have applied for the lowest grade levels at 
the schools: kindergarten or first grade at the elementary schools, sixth or 
seventh grade at the middle schools, and ninth or 10th grade at the high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, people are more interested in establishing their children in a new 
school in the early grades," said Diana Lorenz, principal at Mount Washington 
Elementary, which will be holding a lottery. The school received 60 
applications for 15 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Some administrators said the new program did not generate the kind of 
large-scale attendance shifts they expected. "I expected a lot of applicants," 
said Norma Danyo, the assistant principal at Garfield High School, which 
received 51 applications for 150 openings. "It's too bad -- they're not as high 
as we would expect. During the year, we get a lot of inquiries about our 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 But many students might just be happy where they are, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe people are more content where they are than people realize," said Eve 
Sherman, principal at Grant. "Schools are trying, and we're all working really 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 There were more than 22,000 spaces available districtwide, and about 9,100 in 
the Valley. Enrollment Lotteries: The Fine Print 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles schools that received more applications for open-enrollment 
transfers than there is space available will be holding lotteries today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District's open-enrollment policy allows 
students to transfer to schools of their choice as long as space is available 
and the campuses' ethnic balances remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents should check with the schools to find out whether lotteries will be 
held and at what time. District officials said all drawings will be completed 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Under district guidelines, a committee of three people will select applicants' 
names from a box. The principal will be responsible for supervising the drawing 
procedures and selecting the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The school secretary or office manager willrecord the names in the order 
drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 When one sibling's name is drawn and accepted, other siblings also will be 
allowed to attend the school. The number of open-enrollment slots will be 
increased to allow for siblings to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 After the required number of applicants has been selected, the remaining names 
will be drawn and placed on a waiting list in the order chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Open-enrollment transfers will be granted to students on the waiting list only 
to replace original applicants who have either withdrawn their applications or

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; SUPERINTENDENT ENDS TURBULENT TENURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a month, Arthur N. Pierce will step down from his sometimes stormy but 
accomplished seven-year tenure as the superintendent of the Burbank Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 He leaves behind a school district of 12,755 students that is wrestling with 
issues such as increasing ethnic diversity, overcrowding in elementary schools 
and the deteriorating physical condition of many school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging over his head -- even as he spends the summer relaxing at a family 
cottage on an island near Maine -- is a lawsuit filed recently by the former 
principal of Burbank High School, which charged the district with racial and 
sex discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Many say Pierce helped guide the district through its most troubling financial 
times by cutting mostly administrative positions instead of teaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 That strategy helped patch up the antagonistic relations between district 
administrators and teachers, whose last pay raise was 1.25% three years ago, 
according to the Burbank Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, 58, said he is resigning from the school district to be closer to his 
grown children, and is hopeful about finding another job on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members have not begun the search for a new district head, but 
they expect to have the position filled by September. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce's biggest regret has been the district's inability to repair and 
refurbish its aging facilities. A $100-million bond measure intended to do just 
that failed in April, but many in Burbank do not blame the superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce considers one of his biggest accomplishments to be balancing the 
district's budget. In 1987, he said, Burbank schools were faced with a deficit 
of about $500,000. But for the fiscal year ending this month, the district 
expects to be in the black by $1.6 million, primarily because Pierce slashed 
about 40 jobs between 1989 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Pierce helped turn Burbank's junior high schools into middle schools, 
a process that pushed ninth-graders into high school and sixth-graders into 
middle school, and resulted in readjusting the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were difficult decisions to be made relative to budget cuts, but he 
made the needs of students a priority," said school board president Denise Lioy 
Wilcox. 
</P>
<P>
 Even one of the most visible critics of the district, Keiko Hentell, had kind 
words for Pierce. Hentell filed a lawsuit against the district in May, claiming 
she was demoted from her job as principal of Burbank High School as the result 
of her work with minority groups on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling for him is very positive," said Hentell, who is Japanese American. 
"I think he brought the district through a number of trying things. He also 
used budget cuts as an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truly, his keeping budget cuts as far away from the classroom is an extremely 
difficult thing to do for a superintendent, and he did it." VIVIEN LOU CHEN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CAR RACE ADDS ZIP TO MATH, SCIENCE LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The countdown is reminiscent of a space shuttle launch as San Fernando Middle 
School exploring technology teacher David B. Nagel intones over the portable 
loudspeaker system "five, four, three, two, one, ignition!"  
</P>
<P>
 Then, two seven-inch pine-wood racers, solid rocket fuel pellets ablaze, race 
down a 75-foot dual-lane raceway in two seconds. It is race day in Nagel's 
specialized science lab. 
</P>
<P>
 In a program that in 16 years has gone from gravity racing (such as putting 
race cars on a slanted board) to computerized rocket-fuel ignition, Nagel has 
been able to hold the interest and imagination of his students. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars are no longer blocks of wood with wheels stuck on them. Many are 
designed in the shape of drag racing's "funny cars" and "rail cars," with 
simulated wide rear-wheel "slicks" and tiny spoked front wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rear of each car is a small hole where the solid rocket cartridge is 
placed. Attached to the rocket are two wires that are the electrical ignition 
contacts.  
</P>
<P>
 When these are clipped to the computerized firing mechanism, they can be 
triggered so that both racers are set off at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagel said that each student spends about four to five weeks designing, 
building and testing his or her car in a wind tunnel in his classroom. "Here, 
they learn the basics of aerodynamics and physics," said Nagel. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 130 racers were entered in this year's race day, down from almost 300 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake really set a lot of kids back in their completion schedule," 
Nagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars are weighed before the race and are paired according to their weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagel said that race day is a collaboration of the technology, math and 
science programs. The classes complete work sheets using the results of each 
race to calculate speed in miles per hour, make computations and graph their 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Trophies for winners of the races will be awarded later this week, including 
best design, top speed and one for overall performance. BORIS YARO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; BUSINESSES CALL DAY LABORERS A NUISANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Crowds of day laborers that congregate outside the Home Depot store have 
caused businesses along the San Fernando Road corridor to lose customers, store 
owners said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven days a week, as many as 125 day laborers jam onto sidewalks, lounge 
under private landscaping, urinate into bushes and throw their trash onto 
private property, business representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers of a headset distribution company, a roller rink and a photography 
studio said they are fed up with laborers who whistle at female customers and 
run out into the street to solicit work, causing safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people feel intimidated and uncomfortable. I know I do," said Dominic 
Cangelosi, owner of the Moonlight Rollerway. 
</P>
<P>
 Cangelosi said that life in the southeastern part of Glendale around the 
44-year-old rink was quiet until Home Depot opened a year ago. Now, he said, 
laborers urinate in his bushes and food trucks block the entrance to the rink's 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Both business owners and city officials expressed frustration with the 
problem, saying laborers have a right to seek employment, but must not 
interfere with other business activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "On one hand, you want to encourage people to seek work, but you don't want 
that job search to interfere with other people's rights to use their property," 
said Mayor Eileen Givens. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Dave Ramsay said the problem has dogged the city for years, and 
officials have yet to find a solution that works. An attempt by the Police 
Department to pass out flyers to day laborers dictating acceptable behavior 
failed when new laborers who had not seen the flyers appeared on the scene.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most difficult problems that I have had to face -- it's a 
problem without a solution," Ramsay said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to review complaints received by the city and 
the Police Department from businesses today at its afternoon council meeting. 
Givens said the council will take no action on the day-laborer issue, but 
rather will ask city staff members about possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they are researching last month's decision by the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors to criminalize curbside job soliciting in 
unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafted by board Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, the controversial 
ordinance goes into effect in July and makes curbside job soliciting a 
misdemeanor punishable by six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant rights groups suggest that cities try to control problems with day 
laborers by enforcing current laws, rather than creating new laws that will 
increase the need for police and court resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to enforce laws that are currently on the books by arresting a few 
people for urinating in public or littering -- this is very effective in 
convincing the whole group to behave," said Robin Toma, staff attorney for the 
American Civil Liberties Union. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; SENIOR HOUSING OVER PARKING LOT OKD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has approved plans for a two-story apartment 
building for senior citizens to be built on top of a city-owned public parking 
lot on Dickens Street in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The low-income housing project will cost more than $10 million and include 83 
units over a three-level, 247-space public parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is expected to begin by the end of summer and be completed within 
a year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, approved Friday, is expected to create about 70 more parking 
spaces than currently exist on the lot near the corner of Ventura and Van Nuys 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development is funding about $7 
million of the costs, while the city is paying $1 million. The city also is 
providing a $2.5-million loan, which will be paid back before the project is 
completed. HUGO MARTIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: FIREFIGHTING AIRPLANE STILL ON WISH LIST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a canceled test run and opposition from state firefighters, 
Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Encino) said Monday he will push ahead with plans 
to acquire a water-scooping airplane to protect Southern Californians from 
urban wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's test in Malibu was supposed to highlight the CL-415's ability to 
scoop up 1,600 gallons of water from the ocean in 12 seconds, but low-lying 
clouds forced officials to scrub the mission. The Federal Aviation 
Administration does not allow tests to take place in cloudy weather. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane took off Monday from Van Nuys Airport, where it been headquartered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed we didn't have a chance to see it operate," Friedman said, 
"but it was not a failure. We're working closely with Sen. (Barbara) Boxer and 
Congressman (Anthony) Beilenson to find a source of federal funds to lease the 
planes." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the devastation of last year's wildfires in Malibu, Calabasas and 
Laguna Beach, Friedman has proposed leasing the airplane for a two-year, 
$1.7-million pilot program. The state Assembly has already approved the 
project, which will go before the Senate on June 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadair, maker of the CL-415, says its twin turbo engine plane has the 
ability to skim water from oceans, lakes, reservoirs and rivers. The amphibious 
aircraft has been used as a firefighting tool in France, Italy, Greece and 
other European countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Some state firefighters have withheld support of Friedman's proposal, saying 
that the $1.7 million could be better spent on acquiring several smaller 
aircraft or helicopters that could reach fires before they spread beyond a few 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Dan Young of the Orange County Fire Department said he would welcome the 
Super Scooper concept as long as federal resources paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of a fire department that could afford one on its own," said 
Young. "But if the feds were able to have one available for red-flag 
conditions, when we get high winds, it would be a valuable resource." JEFF

<P>
 Nine San Fernando Valley veterans have brought home medals from the Veterans 
Golden Age Games in a competition that included more than 400 athletes from 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Held this year at Edward Hines Jr.Veterans Administration Hospital in Lisle, 
Ill., the six-day event, which ended Saturday, included more than a dozen 
events for military veterans age 55 and older who receive care from the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The games, which matched competitors according to age and ability, included 
swimming, table tennis, bowling, bicycling and even checkers. The event is 
co-sponsored by the Veterans Administration and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley medal winners, who represented Sepulveda VA Hospital in North Hills, 
were as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 World War II Navy veterans Thomas Palmer of Van Nuys, 71, a gold medal in the 
pentathlon and two silvers in bicycling, and Jack Hoffner, 69, of Reseda, gold 
in table tennis and bronze in checkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean War veteran Frank Ellis, 61, an Air Force veteran from Van Nuys, a gold 
and a bronze in swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 World War II Army veterans Milo Hastings, 71, of Reseda, four gold medals in 
swimming; Sherman Schwartz, 74, of Sylmar, a silver and a gold in swimming; 
Martin Fishman, 75, of Van Nuys, a gold in bowling, and Murray Proper, 72, of 
North Hollywood, a bronze medal in swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 World War II Air Force veterans Abe Englander, 76, of North Hollywood, a gold, 
two silvers and a bronze in swimming, and Charles Snowden, 71, of Granada 
Hills, two silvers and a bronze in swimming. JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: UNITED WAY GRANTS FUND AIDS SERVICES

<P>
 In an effort to improve care to families, preschool children and people with 
HIV/AIDS in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, the United Way of 
Greater Los Angeles has awarded a total of $580,000 to 12 nonprofit agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants, which range from $6,000 to $75,000, mark the culmination of a 
two-year process by the United Way's North Angeles Region that began with a 
comprehensive needs assessment.  
</P>
<P>
 In the study, 300 United Way volunteers identified three groups in the region 
as high-priority candidates for services: families, preschool-age children and 
people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome or the human immunodeficiency 
virus, which is believed to cause AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would've taken millions of dollars to do something for every group," said 
Sally Hoover, senior planner for the North Angeles region. "We wanted to really 
make a significant difference with the money we had." 
</P>
<P>
 Four organizations were selected for their innovative plans to improve care to 
people with HIV/AIDS. The Northeast Valley Health Corp. will coordinate in-home 
child care for AIDS patients who must leave their children during frequent 
visits to doctors or lawyers.  
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Community Clinic in North Hollywood will promote coordination among 
San Fernando Valley service providers offering HIV/AIDS education and services. 
AIDS Project Los Angeles will offer preventive education about HIV/AIDS for 
Latino youths in the Valley and the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community 
Services Center will improve the access and quality of information about 
HIV/AIDS through a computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding also will boost service to families and preschool children with 
programs such as pediatric dental care, infant day care, parent education and 
family counseling through organizations including the El Nido Family Centers, 
Big Sisters of Los Angeles, Glendale Family Service, the Child Care Resource 
Center and the Santa Clarita-area Foundation for Children's Dental Health.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN SIGN LANGUAGE PROGRAM GETS GRANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A unique program to train sign language interpreters at Cal State Northridge 
has been awarded $125,000 in federal grants in the final year of a five-year 
program that uses mentorships to boost the skill level of trainees. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other training programs that rely on workshops and classroom lessons to 
teach how to interpret for the hearing-impaired, the Regional Interpreter 
Training Consortium, housed in the deaf studies program at CSUN, pairs trainees 
with professional mentors. 
</P>
<P>
 People with hearing impairments use interpreters in numerous situations, from 
court appearances to doctors' appointments, from work to school to the opera.  
</P>
<P>
 In the last two decades, Tracy Clark, program coordinator for the center, 
which is one of 10 regional training centers in the United States, said the 
need for skilled sign language interpreters has increased markedly.  
</P>
<P>
 A federal act in the 1970s mainstreamed students with hearing impairments into 
elementary and secondary schools, and the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act 
guaranteed equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past few years there has been a shortage of interpreters and a 
shortage of qualified interpreters," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 students have been trained in the first four years of the CSUN 
program, and regional centers elsewhere in the country have already begun to 
copy the program, Clark said. SUSAN BYRNES

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CAAN FACES HEARING ON BRANDISHING GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor James Caan, who allegedly brandished a gun "in a threatening manner" 
during a parking-lot argument in North Hollywood last March, will be questioned 
about the incident next month by a city attorney's hearing officer, authorities 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing officer will then recommend whether Caan should stand trial on a 
misdemeanor gun charge, said Mike Qualls, a spokesman for the city attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 After the July 6 hearing at the city attorney's office in Van Nuys, the 
hearing officer also could recommend rejecting the case or "taking it off 
calendar," meaning Caan would be on informal probation for a year, during which 
the charges could be filed at any time "if there is a resumption of problems," 
Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision on whether to prosecute will be made by the deputy city 
attorney handling the case. Caan, 52, faces a maximum of six months in County 
Jail if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Caan was arrested after a confrontation in the parking lot of the apartment 
complex, in which a rap musician accused him of pulling a gun during an 
argument. Caan was there to visit his brother, who lived at the complex at the 
time, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was scheduled, Deputy City Atty. Rick Schmidt said, because there 
have been conflicts in the statements of a number of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be an investigative hearing, where we try to separate the wheat and 
the chaff," said Schmidt, supervising attorney at the Van Nuys office.  
</P>
<P>
 An authority close to the case said the conflicts among witness statements 
focus on the manner in which Caan displayed the gun and whether he had a right 
to brandish it, conceivably in defense of another person. JOSH MEYER

 In the anguished hours after the Northridge earthquake, many who were 
fortunate enough to reach stores and gas stations found themselves paying 
inflated prices for the items they desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples include $300 for a $100 sheet of plywood, $10 for a $1.59 pack of 
batteries, $12.15 for a liter of water and $850 to replace one foot of pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill that would outlaw such price gouging in the wake of such a natural 
disaster passed the Assembly on Monday and is expected to breeze through the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 One of a series of fix-it bills that stemmed from lessons learned in the Jan. 
17 temblor, the legislation by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) met with 
little resistance, except for some Republicans grumbling over price-fixing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone supports the free enterprise system," said Katz, "but I think 
everyone understands it's reprehensible to take advantage of a disaster to rip 
people off." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city of Los Angeles already has such a law in place, pockets of 
the hard-hit quake zone, such as the city of San Fernando, were unprotected. 
The new measure, if passed by the Senate and signed into law by Gov. Pete 
Wilson, would apply statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill makes it a misdemeanor to raise prices on critical goods and services 
after a calamity that results in the declaring of a state of emergency by 
either the governor or the president. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints of price gouging seemed to come in waves after the Northridge quake 
as consumers called a county hot line, said Pastor Herrara Jr., director of the 
Los Angeles County Department of Consumer Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first several days, convenience stores and gas stations ranked among 
the worst violators, Herrara said. Then, as rebuilding began, victims fingered 
hardware stores for jacking up plywood prices, contractors for overcharging in 
clearing debris and plumbers for increasing fees to connect water heaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the hot line gets a lot of calls about landlords who refuse to turn 
over renters' security deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 Resolving these cases has proved challenging, Herrara said, because building 
owners are stretched financially after the quake's devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, about 1,400 complaints have been registered on the county's hot line, 
a figure that some community activists say reflects only a fraction of the true 
number of cases that occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there were more than that," said the Rev. Tom Rush, of Mary 
Immaculate Church in Pacoima and a member of the Valley-based grass-roots group 
VOICE. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush witnessed the problem firsthand as he and others demonstrated on a street 
corner near a gas station that increased fuel prices after the quake. As the 
group protested, motorists pulled up to report they were overcharged even as 
the demonstration took place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very destructive and it's not what our community is all about," Rush 
said. "Merchants and the community should have a sense of pulling together 
after a tragedy. When it doesn't happen, it creates a lot of rifts." 
</P>
<P>
 Rush and other VOICE members went store to store, trying to talk owners out of 
inflating prices. "We just hope that when there's a disaster in the future, 
this new legislation will help keep things in line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the governor will sign the bill into law if it passes the Senate was 
unclear Monday. Wilson's office said he rarely takes a position before a bill 
has passed both houses of the Legislature.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; WINNING JUDGE WALLERSTEIN DEMURRED IN COURTING THE ELECTORATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than a decade in Van Nuys Municipal Court, Judge Robert H. 
Wallerstein found himself challenged for the first time in last week's 
election. It was an experience he did not enjoy. Though his opponent was a 
political novice who had not practiced law full time in many years, Wallerstein 
said, he nonetheless felt obliged to hire a high-powered political consultant, 
send mailers and raise about $42,000 in campaign contributions to foot the 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, most Superior Court and Municipal Court judges are appointed by 
the governor, and elections are held only when the incumbent is challenged or 
the seat remains vacant. Contested races are so rare that "it's like being 
struck by lightning," said Rex Heinke, chairman of the Los Angeles County Bar 
Assn.'s Judicial Evaluation Committee. Wallerstein's was the only contested 
position among 45 Municipal Court judges whose terms expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're unfortunate enough to be challenged, you think, 'Why me?' and 'How 
am I going to do it?' " Heinke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallerstein was appointed in 1983 by then-Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. and 
was reelected unopposed for a second, six-year-term. This time he was 
challenged by Norman B. Goldberg, a 52-year-old attorney-turned-businessman who 
Wallerstein believes was still angry over losing a case in his courtroom three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said his campaign "did not arise out of bitterness." He said 
Wallerstein's treatment of him in court led him to ask other lawyers if they 
had had bad experiences with the judge. Speaking of his own case, he said, "I 
ran because by virtue of that happening, I became aware of what I perceived as 
judicial misconduct" in other cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallerstein retained his seat with 75% of the vote. But the process of seeking 
endorsements and glad-handing did not sit well with the 67-year-old resident of 
Sherman Oaks, who believes judges should not participate in campaigns on their 
own behalf. He was interviewed by Times staff writer Leslie Berger the morning 
after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You won the election . What's your beef?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I was active in a few people's campaigns many years ago, and I saw the 
effects of it and consciously made up my mind I would never want to run for 
political office because I didn't like what it requires. 
</P>
<P>
 It requires, first of all, asking people for money and asking people to vote 
for you and for their support. You find yourself in the position of doing 
something very distasteful. I mean, it's OK to ask my mother to vote for me. 
But if I ask you, I don't know who you are and I don't know why you should vote 
for me. Why should you care or know if you never go to court? 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who are judges for the most part don't want to get involved in the 
political process. That's not to say we don't have political views. But it 
seems to me that there's a vast difference between supporting someone 
politically and asking someone for support for a political reason. 
</P>
<P>
 When you sit down with someone whom you may be philosophically opposed to and 
you're trying to solicit their support, whether financial or voting support, 
it's not pleasant. The political process is one that judges are very reticent 
about and very reluctant and very unhappy having to be involved in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did you find particularly demeaning about campaigning?  
</P>
<P>
 A. (Laugh) When you win, nothing is demeaning. The problem was that in the 
process of doing it, I found myself having to smile more than I'd like to. I 
got tired of smiling and shaking hands. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that I don't like people -- I love people and I love the work I do 
because it involves people. But I just do not like the process of campaigning 
for this office. I certainly would never try to run for this office as an 
attorney had I not been appointed. When forced into this process, it is a 
totally alien position for us. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What were you most afraid of -- being asked to return a political favor in 
the courtroom?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I was never concerned about that. One of the attorneys who regularly 
appears in my courtroom, the company he represents, gave me a very generous 
contribution to my campaign. The instant they did that, I immediately 
transferred their cases to another judge because I felt it would compromise me 
and possibly give the appearance of impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever there was a close issue, I would transfer the case. If an attorney 
said he was going to vote for me and came into the courtroom with another 
attorney, I'd say to the other side that Mr. or Miss So-and-So is supporting me 
in the election, and if you wish to go to another judge, I'd be happy to 
transfer the case. On a couple of occasions, there were people that wanted to 
be transferred, and I could understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you were afraid of tarnishing the mantle of impartiality?  
</P>
<P>
 A. That's all a judge has to offer. There's very few of us who are true 
geniuses. For the most part we are people who are very sincere about what we 
do, and the only thing we have to deliver to the community is our ability to be 
fair and impartial, and to appear fair and impartial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you do anything you regret now or would consider beneath your position? 
 
</P>
<P>
 A. No. Oh, no. And I would not compromise my integrity on the bench. But it's 
just like having to be nice to an in-law you don't really care about. You don't 
really want to do it, but you have to. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Shouldn't anyone have a right to seek elected office?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Absolutely. I will say Mr. Goldberg didn't do anything. He only spent 
$1,000 to have his name put on the ballot next to mine, and that created the 
entire contest. He did very little else, maybe two ads in the paper after that. 
So for a very minimal amount of money, he challenged me. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's suppose my decision (against Goldberg's company) was incorrect -- and I 
feel it was correct. My question is, should a judge be challenged based upon 
one decision that he makes? And that's the whole problem I have with the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think Goldberg's purpose was to actually unseat you or just torment 
you?  
</P>
<P>
 A. He told my political consultant that he wanted me to throw up every night 
between the time he filed and the date of the election. He also said if I would 
print a retraction of my decision in the newspaper, he would withdraw his 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
 (Goldberg told The Times he did not tell Wallerstein's consultant that he 
wanted to make the judge sick.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If the idea of politics is so distasteful to you, then, and Goldberg's 
campaign so halfhearted, why go to the trouble of raising and spending $42,000? 
 
</P>
<P>
 A. Listen, I love what I do. I really like my job. I enjoy the work. I work 
hard. I'm here early in the morning. I leave at 5:30, 6 o'clock at night. I 
come in on Saturdays and not because I have to, but because I like what I do. 
Half the people don't like my decisions all the time, but if I wanted to be 
liked by everybody I probably would've been a rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
 I work hard, I like what I do and take my work seriously and if somebody 
challenged me for my job, I'm going to do everything I can to protect it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What alternative to the current process would you propose?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Oh, boy, I don't know. You know, I've racked my brain about it. You know, 
maybe that's one of the prices we pay for living in a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Should Municipal and Superior court judges be appointed for life?  
</P>
<P>
 A. No, because then I think nobody ever has a chance to challenge a judge who 
may not be doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 They talk about retention elections where a judge is appointed -- and that may 
be a good alternative, come to think of it -- where he runs unopposed but 
people can vote to oust him, and the governor gets to appoint somebody new. 
That might be my alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 That would eliminate the need for campaigning. The judge would have nothing at 
all to do with having to spend money or get on any slates because he would not 
have an opponent -- he's his own opponent.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN FOUND DEAD IN WRECK OF PICKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The body of an unidentified woman was found Monday in a pickup truck that had 
crashed in thick brush off the Ventura Freeway, but authorities do not know 
when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorist was discovered in the driver's seat about 8:30 a.m., said Brian 
Humphrey, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck was found in thick brush near the Woodman Avenue exit, and its 
engine was cold when rescuers arrived, Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may have been over the side a long time," Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic investigators believe the woman abruptly veered right from the second 
lane of traffic at about 65 m.p.h., a move that caused the vehicle to roll over 
as it went down the embankment, said Officer David King, a California Highway 
Patrol spokesman. King said there was no apparent reason as to why the woman 
turned the car so sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver's side of the truck hit a tree about eight to 10 inches in diameter 
as it continued to roll, and investigators believe that the impact of that 
collision may have caused the fatal injuries, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy will not take place until later this week, but the woman -- who 
appeared to be in her 30s -- suffered chest and neck injuries, Humphrey said. 
She was not wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on the westbound Ventura Freeway was backed up for several miles 
Monday morning while California Highway Patrol officers investigated the 
accident scene, authorities said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TRUCK THIEF ROLLS AWAY WITH LOAD OF BOWLING 
EQUIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities are trying to locate about 13 tons of bowling equipment and the 
truck being used to haul it after both were stolen during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck was headed from Orange to Springfield, Ore., when the driver stopped 
in Castaic on Saturday night, said Dave Selzler, president of the American 
Bowling Corp., which owns the equipment.Selzler said the bowling machines, 
bowling pins, paperwork and other items in the trailer cost about $50,000, but 
have little or no street value for the thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they either took it by mistake or they wanted something else," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report by Deputy Renee Dibb of the Santa Clarita Valley 
Sheriff's Station, the burglary occurred between 8 p.m. Saturday and 8 a.m. 
Sunday on the Lake Hughes Road overpass across the Golden State Freeway. The 
truck driver, David Shaver, 52, of Castaic told deputies the truck was legally 
parked and no debts were owed on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The big rig was worth about $39,500, the trailer $15,000, Dibb reported. 
Shaver said he had about $1,500 worth of personal items inside, including tools 
and a combined television/VCR machine.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SHERIFF'S STATION HIT BY TAGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A brazen tagger sprayed graffiti early Monday on an unlikely target -- the 
Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station -- and escaped detection by deputies working 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Bob Denham said it was the first time in recent memory that a tagger had 
blemished the Lancaster station at 1010 W. Ave. J. He said it was not 
surprising that the vandal was not seen because the damage occurred on the 
south side of the building, adjacent to a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an obscure location, with a lot of shrubs there," Denham said. "It was 
just a blank wall." 
</P>
<P>
 The vandalism, in which a gang nickname was sprayed in blue paint on a 
four-by-six-foot section of wall, apparently occurred before 1:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 City crews painted over the damage.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN KILLED WHEN PICKUP FLIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Saugus man died when he lost control of his pickup truck, which overturned 
on a two-lane road, striking a second car whose driver had to be hospitalized, 
a California Highway Patrol official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Ellis, 59, was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident, which 
occurred about 4:15 p.m. Sunday on Vasquez Canyon Road about one mile east of 
Bouquet Canyon Road, said Officer Wendy Moore.She said Ellis was driving a 1987 
Ford Ranger westbound at an unknown speed when his truck drifted onto the right 
dirt shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "He over-corrected and steered back into the westbound lane, and then into the 
eastbound lane," she added. "(Ellis) then swerved to the right, causing (it) to 
overturn." 
</P>
<P>
 The top portion of the truck's cab struck the front hood of an eastbound 1993 
Toyota Corolla driven by Charles Ferguson, 43, of Saugus, Moore said. Ferguson 
was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia with moderate 
injuries.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA WANTS PUBLIC'S IDEAS ON RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials announced plans Monday for a community survey and a series of 
hearings to gather public comment on a multimillion dollar recovery plan to be 
funded by future tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
 The council passed Santa Clarita's sweeping, 30-year Community Recovery Plan 
for earthquake repairs, disaster preparation, economic development and 
affordable housing after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also hope to gather suggestions from the public on additional 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council unanimously adopted the $1.1 billion plan in February, 
officials say it was a draft version and its construction projects are 
suggestions open to discussion. Some of the projects listed are: earthquake 
repairs, from public street maintenance to private property damage; future 
disaster preparation efforts, from road construction to added public transit; 
and economic development, from downtown revitalization to attracting new jobs. 
A half-dozen residents complained last month that the plan had been created 
without input from those it was supposed to help. Some citizens said the plan 
should focus specifically on the older community of Newhall, and one complained 
about having his neighborhood described as 'blighted' in order to qualify for 
redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception of the community is that we're rushing headlong into a 
decision," said Mayor George Pederson, who joined fellow council members in 
trying to reassure the public no decisions have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials Monday restated their message that the final plan is only now 
being assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do not have the public's input and assistance with this, it will fail," 
said Gail Foy, city public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has also been controversial in other quarters. The Castaic Lake Water 
Agency, a water wholesaler, has sued, saying it will lose revenue if the 
redevelopment agency is established. 
</P>
<P>
 The water agency has claimed the recovery plan goes beyond the normal scope of 
disaster programs and should be disallowed and forced to adhere to the same 
environmental reviews as other non-disaster projects. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the recovery plan is a legitimate response to a disaster 
and includes projects allowed by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do you draw the line between economic development and redevelopment and 
earthquake recovery?" said City Manager George Caravalho.  
</P>
<P>
 The meetings are scheduled at 7 a.m. Monday and July 11 and at 7:30 p.m. June 
27 and July 21, all in the City Hall council chambers, 23920 Valencia Blvd.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 MEN SOUGHT IN GUARD'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies were searching Monday for two men who shot a security guard 
while the guard was keeping an eye on a store's "parking lot sale" merchandise 
after the store had closed for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred at 1:30 a.m. Saturday outside the McMahan's Furniture 
store at 43422 10th St. West.The guard, a 60-year-old Lancaster resident whose 
name was withheld by authorities, remained in stable condition Monday at 
Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center, Deputy Marty Shearer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have not determined a motive for the shooting. Deputies said the 
guard was walking around the parking lot on his regular patrol when two men 
appeared from behind a block wall, yelled for the guard to stop, then started 
shooting at him.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: CU BANCORP TO ACQUIRE BAY CITIES NATIONAL BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CU Bancorp, the Encino-based parent of California United Bank, has signed a 
letter of intent to merge with the much-smaller Redondo Beach-based Bay Cities 
National Bank, the two institutions said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, CU Bancorp 
will issue common stock to shareholders of Bay Cities based upon the adjusted 
book value of the two institutions.Completion of the deal is subject to 
shareholder and regulatory approval, and the signing of a definitive agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Hartman, CU Bancorp's chief financial officer, said Bay Cities was in 
a good location and provided an opportunity for CU Bancorp to grow. Late last 
year, California United Bank opened a loan production center in the South Bay. 
For the first quarter, CU Bancorp had a profit of $578,000. Bay Cities National 
Bank, with assets of $64 million, posted a first-quarter profit of $104,000.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: COURT RULING A SETBACK FOR NEW IMAGE INDUSTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Bay Area federal court, granting a preliminary injunction in a 
patent-infringement lawsuit, has ordered New Image Industries Inc. of Canoga 
Park to stop making, using or selling its dental intra-oral camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's order came after High Tech Medical Instrumentation Inc. of Santa 
Rosa filed a lawsuit in November contending that certain features of New 
Image's AcuCam camera infringes a patent held by High Tech.The AcuCam is a 
pen-sized camera that is one of New Image's main products. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Leddington, New Image's chief executive officer, acknowledged that the 
court's order was a setback. But he said the company on Friday began shipment 
of the AcuCam camera with a redesigned handpiece to avoid the alleged patent 
infringement. At the same time, Leddington said New Image would continue to 
oppose the suit and that it has appealed the court's order.

OFF TO A SLOW START; LANCASTER, PALMDALE OFFER BIG INCENTIVES TO DRAW NEW 
BUSINESS, WITH LITTLE SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, city officials in Lancaster held a triumphant news conference to 
announce that ex-astronaut Gordon Cooper, enthused by a $300,000 gift from the 
city, was relocating his Van Nuys aviation business to the Antelope Valley, the 
first venture lured by a vigorous business recruitment program. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, however, Cooper was still unable to get additional private 
financing he needed to fund the venture, so he could not even make lease 
payments on a never-used hangar in Lancaster. So Cooper and a few associates 
brought a moving van to a Lancaster airport to pack up and close the office. 
</P>
<P>
 The stalled venture illustrates the tough first year Lancaster and Palmdale 
have had with their joint program, billed as the first of its kind in 
California, to offer at least $2,000 in various incentives for each 
manufacturing or corporate job that qualifying companies bring to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the incentive program began in April, 1993, few Southern California 
cities have been more aggressive in recruiting businesses than these two 
Antelope Valley communities. Thus far, the result has been a lot of interest -- 
but the program has produced only about 35 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough market. We've had a lot of people come and talk to us. But for a 
lot of different reasons, it didn't happen," said Lancaster redevelopment 
director Steve Dukett. Chief among them is the economic downturn that has 
continued to plague the region, Dukett said, noting that the program's main 
targets are companies in the San Fernando Valley and nearby areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, Dukett said the Lancaster City Council has approved only 
three incentive deals under the program. Two ventures, including Cooper's, have 
stalled and the third has yet to open. Palmdale officials said they have 
attracted only two new businesses under the program -- a machine shop and a 
small clothing importer -- totaling about 35 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest letdown, meanwhile, still looms. Palmdale officials concede it's 
increasingly unlikely they will succeed in landing computer-maker Packard Bell 
Electronics Inc., and its 1,350 local jobs, despite an incentive package worth 
more than $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer company, with headquarters in Westlake Village, also is mulling 
offers from Salt Lake City; Portland, Ore.; Long Beach, and other cities. 
Packard Bell was the fourth-largest PC maker in the United States last year. A 
spokesman said Packard Bell is in no rush to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the two high desert cities are renewing the $2,000-per-job incentive 
for a second year, and from now on both will offer employees of relocating 
companies 2.5% discounts on new home purchases and breaks on related services. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the incentive program at least seems to have put the two 
cities on the corporate map. "I think it's gotten a lot of companies to look at 
the area that probably wouldn't have in the past," said Laurel Shockley, who 
runs the state Trade and Commerce Agency's Los Angeles regional office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Financial incentives to attract businesses have become a common practice among 
California cities. But most such deals are negotiated individually, unlike the 
two cities' flat policy of offered inducements. Other states also offer 
individual lucrative deals. But California officials said the state is legally 
forbidden from making such huge giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2,000-per-job incentive offered by the two Antelope Valley cities can 
come through the waiver of city impact or processing fees or land write-downs. 
Or, as in Cooper's case, Lancaster gave him operating money equaling nearly 
five years in lease payments. The offer applies to companies that promise 25 or 
more new jobs for the area within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any program takes six to eight months to be publicized and understood," added 
Dolores Buddell-Teubner, Palmdale's economic development coordinator. "We're 
just getting to the point now where we're beginning to see some results." 
</P>
<P>
 In Lancaster, the results have hardly been what city officials expected. Their 
deal with astronaut Cooper's Galaxy Group Inc., now based near Van Nuys 
Airport, was supposed to have been a flagship for other companies to follow. 
Cooper's venture involved replacing piston engines in several popular models of 
twin-engine prop aircraft used by businesses with more efficient and powerful 
turbine models. For the firm's 25 promised jobs, the city's upfront $300,000 
payment amounted to a $12,000-per-job subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino resident Cooper, who flew 22 orbits in his 1963 Mercury mission, last 
fall took a five-year sublease on a hangar and office at the small William J. 
Fox Airfield in Lancaster. But after a private financing deal fell apart, 
Galaxy Group stopped paying on the sublease at the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, under threat of eviction, Cooper hired a moving company to put 
his office furnishings there into storage. Cooper said he is trying to obtain 
about $1 million in new financing. Even with that, Cooper said it then would be 
several additional months before he could get certification for the project 
from the Federal Aviation Administration, the other critical element for his 
venture to proceed. In the meantime, his small business remains in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster last month declared Galaxy in default of the agreement and demanded 
repayment of the $300,000, Dukett said. Cooper said he cannot repay the money 
unless he gets new financing. "Let's just say we are extremely upset about 
this," Dukett said, adding the city will now consider its legal options. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's second relocation deal, a $225,000 subsidy for Burbank-based Visual 
Instrumentation Corp., a manufacturer of high-speed photographic equipment, 
also has stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Only motor-home builder Rexhall Industries Inc., which received 10 acres of 
land worth $500,000, is still ready to relocate its 170 jobs from Santa Clarita 
to Lancaster. Rexhall needs room to expand, and plans to start construction 
soon on its larger Lancaster facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palmdale, city officials who have been pursuing Packard Bell since late 
last year are fuming because they have been unable to get a state enterprise 
zone designation. Without its tax breaks and other incentives, city officials 
said they have no chance of landing the company. 
</P>
<P>
 State-designated enterprise zones are supposed to target economically 
distressed areas, offering companies that operate there and hire underemployed 
residents a variety of state tax credits. For Packard Bell, Palmdale officials 
said, relocating to a state enterprise zone would yield a savings of about $1 
million a year. "Packard Bell has clearly said, 'If we can't go in an 
enterprise zone in California, we're out of here,' " said Al McCord, Palmdale's 
deputy city administrator for economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill to add new zones, giving Palmdale a chance, has been stalled in a state 
Assembly committee for months. Even if that bill is passed, any new 
designations probably would not occur before next March, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell officials have talked of wanting a 1-million-square-foot complex, 
much larger than their past facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Buddell-Teubner, Palmdale's offer includes 50 acres of land worth 
up to $7.5 million, a waiver of city fees valued at $1.5 million, $5 million in 
state worker training funds and the employee housing discounts. The proposal 
also includes low-interest financing assistance. Based on a 2,000-person work 
force, the subsidy exceeds $7,000 per employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the recession, several factors may have hurt the Antelope Valley's 
job recruitment. Some corporate leaders still think of the region, 60 miles 
northeast of downtown L.A., as too remote and isolated, said Shockley of the 
state trade agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Shockley and PHH Fantus, a Chicago-based consulting firm hired by Palmdale and 
Lancaster last year, cited a lack of large industrial buildings in the region 
for companies to lease. The PHH Fantus report noted that the area has low land 
and housing prices and a trained work force. But that was offset by limited 
freeway and commercial-air access, low high school test scores and no four-year 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is plain competition. Last year, a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch 
Cos. Inc., planning a $100-million can-manufacturing plant, looked at 
Lancaster, Palmdale and even the closed General Motors plant in Van Nuys among 
about 80 Southern California locations before deciding. 
</P>
<P>
 Their choice was the Mira Loma area of Riverside County, where county 
officials offered a tax rebate worth up to $4 million over 10 years for the 
plant. That is a subsidy of up to $30,000 for each of the plant's 130 expected 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victories are very few and far between," said Tom Alfano, the state trade 
agency staff member who was involved in the search and was particularly 
impressed by Lancaster's presentation. "Honestly, I think sometimes it's a 
matter of time and luck."

MAY HOME SALES RISE 38% FROM A YEAR AGO; REAL ESTATE: A TOTAL OF 1,127 
SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES CLOSED ESCROW LAST MONTH, SPURRED BY LOW INTEREST RATES 
AND FORECLOSURE BARGAINS. BUT PRICES FELL 11%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales of single-family houses in the San Fernando Valley continued their 
yearlong improvement in May, surging 38% from the same month a year earlier. 
But the average resale price of a house last month, while up slightly from a 
seven-year low in April, was 11% less than in May of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors said 1,127 single-family houses 
closed escrow last month, up from 818 sales a year earlier. Last month's sales 
were again spurred by low interest rates and plenty of foreclosure bargains, 
and marked the highest monthly sales in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The May sales were also 14% higher than the 987 single-family houses that 
changed hands in April, reflecting the traditional pickup in housing activity 
as summer approaches. Sales last month were exceptionally strong in Reseda and 
Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the average price of a single-family house sold in the Valley 
last month was $232,300, down 11% from $259,700 a year earlier. The median 
sales price sank further, down 14% to $177,000 in May, from $205,000 a year 
earlier. The median price is the point at which half of the houses sold for 
more than $177,000 and half sold for less than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Link, executive vice president of the Valley realty group, said the price 
drop was caused partly by homeowners selling their quake-damaged properties "as 
is" at a discount. The high number of foreclosures is another reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Link said he was heartened by the fact that housing prices rebounded in May 
from April, when single-family house prices had fallen to a seven-year low of 
$219,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Northridge earthquake continued to take a significant toll on the 
Valley's beleaguered condominium market, which has shown no signs of 
resurgence. Sales of condos last year were cannibalized by single-family 
houses, and the earthquake made things worse because many condos were toppled 
by the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Condo sales in May totaled just 134, down 16% from 159 sales in May, 1993. The 
average resale price of a condo sold was $124,100 -- down 11% from $139,600 a 
year earlier. And the median resale price sank 18% last month, to $117,000 from 
$143,000 in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In the condo market, Link said, "It may take several more months before all 
quake problems are solved and buyers can proceed with confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of the earthquake, active listings of houses and condos have 
been unusually low this year, and it dropped again in May. The inventory of 
houses and condos for sale totaled 8,091 in May, down 36% from a year earlier. 
Inventory usually climbs in the summer, but last month's supply actually 
thinned 2% from April. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ordinary market, the combination of declining inventory and rising sales 
usually pushes up prices. But brokers say the large supply of foreclosures, 
quake-damaged properties and low buyer confidence could keep prices at the 
bottom for months to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley realty group, the largest in California, has 7,800 members from 
North Hollywood to Calabasas. Its figures generally do not include sales of new 
homes. May Valley Home Sales 
</P>
<P>
 North Central - Average Price: $212,200. Sales: 147 North West - Average 
Price: $197,000. Sales: 53 North East - Average Price: $141,100. Sales: 158 
South Central - Average Price: $248,500. Sales: 217 South West - Average Price: 
$278,400. Sales: 329 South East - Average Price: $234,700. Sales: 223

 Micropolis Corp., a Chatsworth maker of computer disk drives and other

July 1 to be "significantly larger" than in its first quarter ended April 1, 
when it had a net loss of $9.76 million.

 The company declined to state a reason for the larger loss, other than to say 
that its second-quarter revenue and profit margins would shrink. It said that 
its cash position would be reduced to $72 million as of July 1 from $82 million 
on April 1.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: SALES UP, PRICES DOWN FOR HOMES IN SIMI, MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales of existing single-family houses in Simi Valley, Moorpark and Santa Rosa 
edged up 2% in April from a year earlier, but the average price dropped 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley-Moorpark Assn. of Realtors said 161 single-family houses 
changed hands in April, up from 131 in March and 158 in April, 1993. But the 
average price of a single-family house that was sold in April, 1994, was 
$210,586, down from $220,591 a year earlier. 
</P>

 Condominium sales in the Simi Valley and Moorpark area were flat in April, as 
18 condos closed escrow. In April the average sale price of condos fell 4%, to 
$130,179 from $135,492 a year earlier, the realty group said.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: MICOM CORP. SPUN OFF FROM PARENT IN $140-MILLION DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a deal valued at more than $140 million, Simi Valley-based Micom 
Communications Corp. has been spun off by its Pennsylvania parent and is now 
operating again as an independent, publicly held concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Micom, a market leader in providing computer networks that integrate data, 
voice and fax communications between companies' remote locations, thus goes 
public on its own for the second time. The firm was publicly held in the 1980s, 
then went private prior to being acquired by Pittsburgh-based MB Communications 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 MB decided to spin off the subsidiary to reduce its tax load and to allow the 
stock market to better evaluate the two companies' worth, reports Francine M. 
Good, Micom's vice president and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that MB's Black Box Corp. unit provides some products similar to 
those offered by Micom. "The feeling is that each company will now achieve its 
appropriate market value," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spinoff came in the form of a tax-free dividend distribution, with holders 
of every three shares of MB receiving two newly issued shares of Micom. Good 
said the formula created 10.8 million Micom common shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The new shares traded in the $13 range on NASDAQ last week, giving Micom a 
total paper value of more than $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Good said that Micom's president and chief executive, Barry Phelps, will 
continue in that position and that no policy or personnel changes are planned. 
"We operated with a great deal of independence before the spinoff; that should 
help make the transition smooth." 
</P>
<P>
 Micom has a payroll of 400, making it one of Simi Valley's largest employers. 
Good said the Simi Valley firm's revenues totaled $81 million in the year that 
ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Micom claims to be the world's leading provider of low-cost integrated 
networks for communication over wide areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Odyssey Partners, a New York limited partnership that is a major MB 
shareholder, became a large Micom shareholder as a result of the stock 
distribution, Good said.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: ROCKWELL EXTENDS PACT WITH VENTURA FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A contract renewal from industrial giant Rockwell International Corp. will 
allow a small Ventura firm, 1st Step Industrial & Filter Inc., to double its 
revenues in the coming year, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
 1st Step, which is owned and managed by three women, markets industrial 
filters for two leaders in that field, American Air Filter and Norgren 
Compressed Air Filter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura company has just won an extension through 1999 of a deal for 
Rockwell to use American Air and Norgren filters to clear the air at Rockwell 
installations worldwide. Rockwell also agreed to expand its use of the devices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our revenues totaled $1 million last year and, as a result of this contract, 
we expect that figure to double," said Shelene Robinson, 1st Step's sales 
manager and one of its owners. "And it could go much higher than that a few 
years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson credits government and company policies favoring women-owned and 
small concerns with helping the firm land the contract.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: CAMARILLO COMPANY OPENS TOKYO SUBSIDIARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is selling U. S. products in Japan really next to impossible? Interlink 
Electronics, a Camarillo maker of computer control pointers, doesn't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm has just established a Tokyo subsidiary, Interlink KK, with the goal 
of increasing its sales in that country. Company President E. Michael Thoben 
III isn't bashful about his plans, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Japanese customer base has grown over the last few years," he said. "This 
subsidiary will be expected to give Interlink Electronics a greater presence 
and visibility in Japan."

VERDICT ON VALDEZ COULD COST EXXON BILLIONS; ENVIRONMENT: JURY IN MASSIVE CIVIL 
SUIT FINDS THAT COMPANY AND TANKER'S SKIPPER ACTED RECKLESSLY. OIL SPILL WAS 
WORST IN U.S. HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a verdict that could cost Exxon Corp. billions of dollars, a jury found 
Monday that company executives and the skipper of the Exxon Valdez acted 
recklessly in the events leading to America's worst oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict came in a massive civil lawsuit brought by some 10,000 commercial 
fishermen, Native Americans, landowners and others harmed by the 1989 spill in 
Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs are seeking $1.5 billion in actual damages and a punitive award 
of $15 billion -- the amount their lawyers argue is needed to punish Exxon, one 
of the world's largest businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the most important part of the trial -- whether Exxon could be 
(ordered to pay) punitive damages," said Bernard J. Picchi, an oil industry 
analyst with Kidder Peabody in New York. "I can't imagine that the damages 
couldn't -- on a company this size -- be mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty about the potential for monetary damages sent Exxon's stock 
plunging $2.50 to $59.625 in New York Stock Exchange trading Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Adam E. Sieminski, an oil analyst in the Washington office of NatWest 
Securities, estimated that concern about the trial has cost Exxon $8 billion in 
market capital since March. "The problem is, what if the jury says the punitive 
damages amount to $15 billion?" he said. "Even for Exxon, that's a big number. 
That would be a big number for the Treasury Department." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-phase trial began May 2 and is expected to last through August. In 
the initial phase, the jury was asked to decide whether Exxon and Exxon Valdez 
Capt. Joseph Hazelwood were reckless and should therefore pay punitive damages. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase of the trial, to begin next week, will determine the amount 
of actual damages Exxon must pay. The company has admitted it was responsible 
for the accident, but it notes it has already paid some $3.5 billion in 
attempts to clean up the spill and settle lawsuits with the state and federal 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The final phase of the trial will determine the amount of punitive damages. 
The same jury -- nine women and three men -- will hear the entire case. 
</P>
<P>
 As the verdict was read Monday, a group of fishermen in the crowded courtroom 
cheered, drawing a scolding from U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the plaintiffs' lead attorney, Brian O'Neill of Minneapolis, said the 
decision is proof that "even with a company as big and powerful as Exxon Corp. 
is, our system brings them to justice." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill and other lawyers for the plaintiffs have asserted that Exxon must be 
punished to deter other companies from placing the environment at risk.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to cripple Exxon," O'Neill said. "We want to change Exxon. We 
want to make the Exxons of the world aware of the fact that they're 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon's lead attorney, Patrick Lynch of Los Angeles, said the firm has already 
been punished enough. "The actions that Exxon took from the day after the spill 
are exemplary of their citizenship and have obviously been an enormous burden 
on the corporation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony in the first civil trial resulting from the disaster has focused so 
far on whether the spill was merely an accident or the product of recklessness 
and corporate indifference. The oil-laden Exxon Valdez strayed from shipping 
lanes and ran aground on a charted reef, ripping open the hull and spewing 
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the evidence centered on the actions of Hazelwood, who had placed the 
tanker under the control of a less-experienced officer and was in his cabin 
when the ship ran aground. A criminal jury four years ago acquitted Hazelwood 
of operating the tanker while drunk.  
</P>
<P>
 Hazelwood did not speak at the criminal trial. But testifying in the civil 
case, he said last month that he lied to U.S. Coast Guard investigators when he 
told them he had had only one beer the night of the spill. In fact, he 
acknowledged, he had at least three double vodkas in the port city of Valdez 
that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs tried to show that company officials knew for years that 
Hazelwood had a serious drinking problem, arguing that the company should never 
have allowed him to operate tankers. Exxon executives testified that Hazelwood 
was closely monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 A turning point in the case may have been the testimony of former Exxon 
Chairman Lawrence Rawl, who recanted statements he made to two congressional 
committees and in the news media after the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Rawl testified that he was wrong when he told Congress that Hazelwood was 
drunk the night of the spill and that Exxon had made a mistake by allowing him 
to return to driving tankers after he was treated for alcohol abuse in 1985. 
Rawl told the jury the remarks were based on inaccurate information in the 
frenzied days immediately after the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a federal criminal indictment alleging environmental crimes, Exxon 
agreed in 1990 to pay the government $100 million in restitution and $150 
million in fines.  
</P>
<P>
 The next year it paid $900 million to settle state and federal civil damage 
claims. The Exxon Valdez Spill: a Chronology * March 24, 1989: The tanker runs 
aground in Prince William Sound, Alaska, spilling 10.8 million gallons of crude 
oil.

charges and convicted on a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil. He 
is sentenced to 1,000 hours of beach cleanup work and as much as $50,000 in 
restitution.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: CULTIVATING A CULT; GM'S SATURN UNIT PUSHES 
'RELATIONSHIP MARKETING' TO NEXT LEVEL WITH 2-DAY FETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Tylka is about to drive his motor home 2,058 miles so he can personally 
ask General Motors Corp. executives why he can't get two more inches of legroom 
in his Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
 This will probably surprise the folks at Saturn, who think that the Monrovia 
resident -- and nearly 25,000 other Saturn owners -- will start gathering in 
Spring Hill, Tenn., on June 24 to enjoy music and sunshine. A two-day festival, 
marketed as a "Saturn Homecoming," has been carefully orchestrated by the 
General Motors division to be a sort of blue-collar Woodstock-on-wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturn is trying to take "relationship marketing" to the next level. The 
premise is simple: Develop an ongoing dialogue with your customers, and they 
might stick around. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturn has striven to distance itself as much as possible from the cold, 
impersonal image of the behemoth General Motors. Its ads rarely mention the GM 
name. Instead, they are mostly tales about individual customers -- many of the 
stories suggested by Saturn owners themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 From the minute a customer buys a Saturn, the company tries to forge a bond by 
sending the entire dealership staff out to give a hardy cheer. Most Saturn 
buyers receive a Polaroid photograph of this ceremony. Some Saturn dealers host 
weekend barbecues and car care clinics. And after getting their cars serviced, 
most Saturn owners are sent detailed surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Saturn is trying to cement its relationship with current customers by 
throwing a bash that celebrates itself. It will spend an estimated $5 million 
to make sure everyone has a good ol' time.  
</P>
<P>
 The celebration -- complete with plant tours, child care and a day at country 
music's Opryland theme park -- will also feature country singer Wynonna Judd 
and Olympic champion Dan Jansen.  
</P>
<P>
 Although vehicle makers from Harley-Davidson to Volkswagen have hosted 
get-togethers for enthusiasts, Saturn is the first to so heavily promote such a 
gathering.  
</P>
<P>
 Saturn executives concede they've borrowed a page from Harley-Davidson. In 
fact, when the motorcycle maker hosted a massive get-together for more than 
100,000 owners in Milwaukee last year, executives from Saturn were there 
observing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a company the size of General Motors says they want to do what we do, we 
consider it a compliment," said Mike Keefe, director of marketing at 
Harley-Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
 All Saturn owners have been sent brochures and personalized letters promoting 
the event. Advance tickets to the two-day festival are $34 for adults and $17 
for kids.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you're wondering why we're holding the event," says the letter signed by 
Saturn President Skip LeFauve, "the answer is this: We wanted to show our 
appreciation for the special relationship we have with our customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone buys that logic. Although Saturn may have latched on to a very 
good idea, "there is a little too much turbocharging going on here" on Saturn's 
part, said Al Ries, chairman of the corporate identity firm Trout & Ries. "I 
sense a forcing of the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is a nation prone to car cults, and General Motors is trying 
to forge a cult of Saturn owners, said Jim Hillson, senior vice president of 
the Beverly Hills consulting firm Phase One. "This is certainly not a 
grass-roots movement. It is a GM promotion." 
</P>
<P>
 One academic offered even harsher words. "This is a contrived cult," said 
George Gerbner, professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania. "It 
defines people not by who they are, but by what they buy." 
</P>
<P>
 But executives at Saturn insist the upcoming wingding is merely a response to 
customer pleas.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it smacks of a marketing ploy, but this is purely the result of Saturn 
owners who wrote us and asked to see the plant," said Steve Shannon, director 
of marketing. "This is not a sales event. It's a genuine thank-you to the 
650,000 who have purchased Saturns." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Tylka, a retired Air Force colonel, isn't going just to 
celebrate. Ever since he bought his Saturn -- which he still says he likes 
better than his former Mercedes -- he has repeatedly phoned and written the 
company to help him get more legroom. But he's received no satisfaction. "All 
I'm asking for is two inches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturn is expecting more happy campers than sourpusses at its automotive 
extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival has recently been ballyhooed in Saturn TV spots. The ads feature 
bewildered park rangers at uncharacteristically deserted tourist spots such as 
Yellowstone National Park and Mt. Rushmore, presented as tourism's victims to 
the "Saturn Homecoming." 
</P>
<P>
 "Saturn owners are all part of a little family," said James Dalthorp, creative 
director at the San Francisco agency Hal Riney & Partners, which created the 
ads for Saturn. "It's as if Saturn fills a gap that people have in their own 
personal lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalthorp will be at the event -- along with an agency crew -- videotaping 
highlights. And some of what's captured on tape may be used in future marketing 
efforts. There is also speculation that Saturn will piece together an 
infomercial from the event. 
</P>
<P>
 One marketing expert says Saturn's efforts are a perfect strategy for reaching 
its target market.'From Day One, they've been trying to build brand loyalty 
among the one group that is least brand-loyal: baby boomers," said Susan 
Mitchell, editor of the Boomer Report. "They never let their customers stop 
thinking of themselves as anything but Saturn owners." 
</P>
<P>
 But while thousands of Saturn groupies gather in camaraderie next weekend, 
Saturn owner Michael Rushlow is content to remain at home in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my car," said Rushlow, a graphic artist who rates his Saturn a 10. But 
Rushlow is no fan of country music. And he's not about to spend his summer 
vacation on a trek to Spring Hill. Besides, he said, "I don't even know anyone 
else who owns a Saturn." Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles office of BBDO Worldwide has been fired from the estimated 
$10-million Blue Cross of California account. The Woodland Hills-based company 
said it is seeking a new agency. . . . The Los Angeles agency Mendelsohn/Zien 
has picked up the $2-million account for Long Beach-based Acapulco Restaurants. 
. . . Los Angeles-based Italia/Gal Advertising has picked up an advertising 
assignment for the Century 21 Commercial Investment Division. . . . Those "Get 
Fat" billboards all over town are promoting a new slogan for the Fatburger 
chain created by the Los Angeles agency Schroffel & Associates.

SUPREME COURT GIVES PROTECTION TO THIRD PARTIES IN S&L CASES; LAW: IN TWO 
RULINGS, JUSTICES MAKE IT HARDER FOR FEDERAL REGULATORS TO SUE LAWYERS AND 
ACCOUNTANTS FOR MALPRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court, in cases stemming from failed thrifts in Orange County 
and Texas, made it harder for federal regulators to sue lawyers and accountants 
on malpractice claims and cut off most lawsuits that are not filed within 
state-mandated deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's high court decided unanimously that state common law, not a small 
area of federal common law, should be used in most lawsuits brought by 
regulators against professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisions could wipe out pending cases seeking damages that, regulators 
said, "substantially exceed $1.5 billion" for alleged wrongdoing that led to 
the collapse of banks and thrifts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of these cases are big disappointments for us," said Jack Smith, deputy 
general counsel for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the professionals feeling the heat of regulators for more than five 
years, the Supreme Court has restored some balance that will allow them to 
continue rendering advice under long-established state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to make clear that whatever the state law is, it will be the 
law that is going to govern these cases," said Gregory A. Smith, a lawyer 
representing the Los Angeles law firm of O'Melveny & Myers, the main defendant 
in one case. 
</P>
<P>
 The other S&L decision denied the FDIC's appeal of a Texas case in which the 
agency filed suit alleging negligence against directors and officers after the 
filing deadline had passed. Banking regulators argue that deadlines often pass 
in these cases before they even seize the institutions and discover the 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the court's primary decision involved a $20-million claim against 
O'Melveny, California's fourth-largest law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators said they still want to take the malpractice case to trial so they 
can prove that lawyers were negligent in handling two real estate transactions 
for now-defunct American Diversified Savings Bank in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the 1980s debacle in the S&L industry, which is expected 
to cost taxpayers more than $100 billion, regulators have sought to hold an 
array of professionals -- lawyers, accountants, investment bankers, appraisers 
-- liable for negligence or more intentional wrongdoing, such as aiding and 
abetting frauds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Resolution Trust Corp., which liquidates failed thrifts, has recovered 
$184 million from lawyers and $492 million from accountants.  
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers and other professionals had mounted a counterattack to the aggressive 
efforts of the RTC and the FDIC and have recently seen their efforts pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the Supreme Court overturned half a century of legal precedents by 
ruling that defrauded investors cannot sue lawyers, accountants or other "third 
parties" who aided and abetted a fraud scheme. Monday's cases provided another 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators accused O'Melveny of negligence in preparing documents for two 
syndications put together by American Diversified's primary owner-operator, 
Ranbir S. Sahni. The documents did not reveal to investors the thrift's 
financial difficulties or any fraud on the part of American Diversified 
executives. The FDIC asserts that O'Melveny should have known about both. 
</P>
<P>
 After regulators seized the thrift in 1986, investors in the real estate 
partnerships demanded their money back. Regulators returned the money and later 
sued O'Melveny & Myers, as well as Sahni and other officers and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Melveny fought the suit, contending that it performed its work on two 
transactions diligently and was not required to determine if the institution 
was being operated fraudulently.

 The federal district court in Los Angeles agreed and threw the case out before 
trial. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, however, said the lower court 
should have based its decision on federal common law -- or case law -- instead 
of state common law. Now the Supreme Court has sent the case back to the 9th 
Circuit for a decision under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Monday, the Supreme Court let stand a ruling that an employer 
can be held liable for alleged sexual harassment even if the company has a 
policy barring such conduct and procedures to deal with any complaints. It also 
ruled that California violated a unionized worker's rights when it refused to 
handle a complaint she filed with state labor authorities about a pay dispute.

GM WINS APPEAL OVER SIDE-SADDLE GASOLINE TANKS; COURTS: JURY HAD AWARDED $105 
MILLION TO THE PARENTS OF A 17-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO BURNED TO DEATH IN TRAFFIC 
ACCIDENT. 
</P>

<P>
 A Georgia appeals court on Monday overturned a $105-million jury verdict 
against General Motors Corp., bolstering the auto maker's efforts to resist a 
safety recall of its pickup trucks with side-saddle fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by a three-judge panel sitting in Atlanta comes 17 months after a 
Fulton County State Court jury found GM liable for the death of 17-year-old 
Shannon Moseley in a fiery 1989 crash of his '85 GMC pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has drawn widespread attention because of the size of the jury award 
-- including $101 million in punitive damages -- to Moseley's parents and 
demands by safety advocates for a recall of the 4.7 million pickups still on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 GM, which was represented in the appeal by former U.S. Atty. Gen. Griffin 
Bell, says the vehicles are safe and refuses to recall them. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court ruled that the trial judge had "poisoned" the case by 
allowing the plaintiffs to make reference to 120 other lawsuits involving GM 
pickups. No evidence linking those cases to Moseley was presented to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a substantial victory for us," GM spokesman Ed Lechtzin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moseleys could not be reached at their home in Snellville, Ga., a suburb 
of Atlanta. Their attorney, James Butler, was also unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The case could be appealed to the full nine-member state appeals court or to 
the Georgia and U.S. Supreme courts. If those appeals fail, it will be sent 
back to the state court for a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety advocates have charged that the safety defect in the GM pickups is 
among the most egregious ever uncovered. The Center for Auto Safety estimates 
that 300 deaths have been caused by fires from erupting fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision comes amid growing speculation in Washington that the 
Transportation Department may drop its investigation of GM's 1973-1987 C/K 
pickups. Sources have indicated that Justice Department attorneys believe that 
GM would fight a forced recall and probably win in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, the National Highway Safety Transportation Administration asked 
GM to voluntarily recall the vehicles, which critics allege are prone to 
explosions because the fuel tanks are located outside the pickup's frame. 
</P>
<P>
 GM, however, rejected the request and instead offered $1,000 coupons to owners 
toward the purchase of a new vehicle. The company strongly argues the vehicles 
are as safe as its competitors' trucks and safer than most other vehicles on 
the road. It also points out that the vehicles met federal crash-safety 
standards in effect when built. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has languished in the last year as the NHTSA has operated without an 
administrator for more than a year. In the Moseley case, GM argued that he was 
killed on impact when his truck was struck by a drunken driver. But Butler said 
the youth survived the crash only to die when the fuel tank ruptured and the 
gasoline ignited. 
</P>
<P>
 References to others who allegedly were killed or injured because of pickup 
truck fuel-tank explosions were made throughout the trial. In a dramatic 
closing plea to the Fulton County State Court jury, Butler, clutching a charred 
fuel tank, warned that "more will die" if GM was not punished. 
</P>
<P>
 In an issue that could prove important if the case is retried, the court said 
the jury's award of punitive damages was not excessive. The court noted GM's 
size and the fact that so many of the trucks are in use.

HOUSE OKS UPDATED CREDIT REPORTING LEGISLATION; CONSUMERS: MEASURE WOULD 
ADDRESS ERRORS, MAKE SUPPLIERS OF DATA LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE. COMPROMISE WITH 
SENATE BILL IS NEXT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The House passed a major consumer protection bill Monday that would compel 
credit bureaus to correct errors in consumers' files within 30 days, and for 
the first time would make banks and retailers legally responsible for supplying 
erroneous information to credit agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would also give consumers the right to a free copy of their credit 
reports each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, approved by voice vote, "may be the most important consumer 
legislation considered by Congress this year," said Rep. Esteban E. Torres 
(D-La Puente), a key author of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate passed its version earlier this year, and a conference committee is 
expected to prepare a compromise version for signing by President Clinton 
during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The final product would reform and update the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 
passed 24 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our country has changed dramatically . . . and the present state of 
technology and the volume of credit transactions have rendered the (act) 
dangerously ill-equipped to meet the needs of today's consumer," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can no longer tolerate a system that denies employment to workers, 
prevents families from purchasing a mortgage or ruins thousands of credit 
histories because of errors in their files," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual credit reports, which now cost as much as $8 each, would be 
available once a year without charge under the House bill. The Senate version 
calls for a $3 charge for a report. 
</P>
<P>
 Both versions of the legislation would impose new controls on the widespread 
use of credit files by businesses to investigate current or prospective 
workers. An employer would be barred from using credit files to investigate a 
worker or job applicant without the person's written permission. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill also requires written approval by the consumer before a credit 
bureau can sell the consumer's records to companies engaged in direct marketing 
by mail. Firms in the credit card or catalogue business are anxious to get 
mailing lists of potential customers for their products. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill also imposes new obligations for accuracy on banks, department 
stores and other retailers who provide information to credit bureaus. It also 
requires credit bureaus to establish special toll-free phone lines to handle 
calls from consumers seeking to correct errors in their credit reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The House legislation represented a compromise acceptable to consumer groups 
as well as the industry, according to Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman 
of the House Banking Committee, and Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.), 
chairman of the consumer subcommittee that prepared the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reforms in this bill will provide financial peace of mind to millions of 
American consumers who get caught in reams of credit bureau red tape when they 
try to correct errors in their credit records," said Michelle Meier, Consumers 
Union's counsel for government affairs. A 1991 study by the organization found 
errors in 48% of a sampling of credit reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer groups were unhappy with the provision that would override state 
credit reporting laws, which are sometimes tougher than the national standards. 
The House bill preempts state laws for eight years, while the Senate version 
says the states could pass tougher laws in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The limited preemption periods in both versions were needed to assure 
bipartisan agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many like the idea of a uniform national standard; others want to keep state 
jurisdiction," said Rep. Al McCandless (R-La Quinta). "The compromise is 
acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats wanted to leave state laws in place, while Republicans favored 
preemption.

 T-Bill Rates Edge Up: The Treasury Department sold $12.1 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.16%, up from 4.15% last 
week. Another $12.1 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 4.55%, up from 4.53%.The three-month bill rate was the highest 
since they sold for 4.23% on May 31. The six-month bill rate was the highest 
since they averaged 4.67% the same day. The new discount rates understate the 
actual return to investors -- 4.26% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill 
selling for $9,894.80, and 4.72% for a six-month bill selling for $9,770. The 
discount rate reflects the price discount received when government securities 
are purchased at less than face value.

 AT&T Will Drop Ogilvy & Mather: The phone company said it will drop the big 
firm as one of its advertising agencies after International Business Machines 
Corp. decided last month to consolidate all its advertising business -- 
estimated at $500 million worth -- with Ogilvy.In pulling its estimated 
$100-million account, AT&T cited what it called Ogilvy's conflict of interest, 
the New York Times reported. The decision reflects in part the perceived 
convergence of computing and telecommunications. AT&T will split its former 
Ogilvy account among four other agencies: FCB Leber Katz, Ayer Inc., McCann 
Erickson and Young & Rubicam.

 IBM Moves to End 1956 Decree: International Business Machines Corp. filed a 
motion in U.S. District Court in New York seeking to terminate a consent decree 
the company says makes it difficult to compete in the computer services 
business. The decree requires that IBM operate its computer services business 
as a separate subsidiary, which must pay full retail price for computer 
equipment and software it buys from IBM and resells to its customers. In its 
filing, IBM says there have been significant changes in circumstances that 
warrant termination of the decree, and it argues that the decree imposes costly 
inefficiencies on the company and results in the loss of many millions of 
dollars annually in revenue.

predicted a "substantial reduction" in net income for the fourth quarter ending 
July 31 compared to the same quarter a year ago, when it was $25,686,000, or 
$1.04 a share. The company attributed the decline to "recent unusually large 
losses to a small number of long-term table game customers" in Nevada. The 
company estimated the losses to those customers at more than $18 million.

 Toyota Shifts U.S. Truck Production: Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. plans to move 
all production of its compact pickup trucks for the U.S. market to its joint 
venture plant in Fremont, Calif.New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the 
venture with General Motors, is scheduled to pick up the production of tens of 
thousands of the trucks from Hino Motors Ltd. in Japan, beginning with the 1995 
models. Toyota said the decision will help it avoid currency problems and U.S. 
tariffs, which total 25% on each pickup imported from Japan. A New United Motor 
spokeswoman said the plant is expected to produce between 125,000 and 150,000 
pickups next year.

MET LIFE REPORTEDLY TO MERGE WITH TRAVELERS INC. 
</P>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and Travelers Inc. are expected to announce as 
soon as today a merger that would create the nation's largest health care 
company, the New York Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies are expected to announce the merger of their health care 
businesses as well as the acquisition by Met Life of Travelers' group life and 
related businesses, the newspaper said in today's editions, citing people close 
to the negotiations whom it did not name. 
</P>
<P>
 Merging the two companies' health care businesses into a new joint venture 
would create a company with about 13 million customers, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company, whose name was not announced, would be owned equally by Met 
Life and Travelers. Met Life, which boasts more customers and a more profitable 
business, would contribute $280 million of capital, the Times said. Travelers 
would contribute $370 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Travelers' contribution would come from the sale to Met Life of its 
group insurance and related businesses for $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Met Life spokesman Charles Sahner, reached by the Associated Press on Monday 
night, refused to confirm the report. Attempts to reach a spokesman for 
Travelers at home were not successful.

PACKARD BELL TO UNVEIL PCS WITH TV, RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Packard Bell Electronics Inc. today will move mass-market personal computers 
another step toward being all-purpose information appliances by introducing PCs 
that also function as radios, televisions, voice mail systems and fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westlake Village-based company is also bringing a little fashion to the 
eggshell-dull computer world with removable plastic panels that can dress a 
machine in exotic hues such as teal or azure. 
</P>
<P>
 Although companies such as Compaq Computer Corp. have long combined computers, 
answering machines, faxes and CD-ROM players, privately held Packard Bell 
appears to be the first to bundle all that into a PC with TV and radio. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is unlikely that many people would choose a PC in place of a stereo 
or television, the Packard Bell machines give an early taste of what is likely 
to become common in the next decade: computer-based control and links to 
electronic devices throughout the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers range in price from $1,000 to $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell has become an increasingly strong force in the PC business as 
purchases by consumers have surged.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW MANAGES 9-POINT GAIN ON LISTLESS DAY; YIELDS RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Times Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue chip stocks rose Monday in a rally led by companies linked to the 
fortunes of the economy, but bond prices fell on fears that inflation may be on 
the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.67 points to 3,783.12. Advancing 
issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board 
volume came to 243.38 million shares, up from 222.61 million on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The market managed to rally despite a drop in the shares of Exxon Corp. A 
federal jury found that recklessness by the nation's largest oil company helped 
cause the worst U.S. oil spill and opened the company up to punitive damages. 
Exxon was off 2 1/2 at 59 5/8 in heavy trading of more than 3.5 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharply lower foreign stock prices helped set the day's negative tone, and 
major stock indexes traded in a narrow, mostly lower range. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index plunged 94.43 points, or 3.96%, to 2,291.12. It was 
the biggest one-day decline since April 20, when stocks fell 5.2% after a surge 
in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, stocks were apparently hurt by economic reports hinting at future 
inflation. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average fell 27.30 points to 2,105.78, 
while London's Financial Times 100-share average ended at 3,016.3, down 39.6 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in Tokyo, the key 225-share Nikkei average closed at a new 1994 high, 
finishing up 157.63 points at 21,552.81. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the Treasury bond market, yields traded higher, pushing prices 
lower. Treasuries, analysts said, responded in part to comments by Federal 
Reserve Board Gov. Susan Philips, who was quoted as saying inflationary 
pressures are emerging in commodity markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 7.35% from Friday's 7.31%, pushing its 
price, which moves in the opposite direction, down 15/32 point, or $4.69 per 
$1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors don't like to see interest rates rise, because that increases 
the cost of money to corporations and makes shares less attractive relative to 
interest-bearing investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market's listless," said Bill Allyn, managing director at Jefferies & Co. 
"Portfolio managers are pretty much where they want to be and are waiting for 
direction from earnings or economic news." 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors, analysts said, turned their attention to economic data due out 
this week, including today's report on consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor contributing to the relatively light volume, analysts said, was 
Friday's quarterly expiration of stock index options and futures and options on 
individual stocks. Trading is often light ahead of the portfolio adjustments, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors bought the stocks of companies that benefit most from an expanding 
economy, such as paper, autos and chemicals, and that buoyed the Dow 
industrials. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Alcoa rose 2 1/4 to 75 1/4, while UAL, the parent of United Airlines, rose 2 
3/8 to 119. 
</P>
<P>
 * PepsiCo rose 1/4 to 31 3/8 and Coca-Cola lost 7/8 to 39 3/8. Pepsi warned 
late last week of a cola price war and forecast second-quarter results that 
were below market expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among blue chip cyclicals, Caterpillar gained 7/8 to 106. DuPont added 1 1/8 
to 61 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quincy Savings rose 6 11/32 to 23 27/32 after a Royal Bank of Scotland unit 
said it would buy the company for $139.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks, also considered cyclicals, were strong for the second straight 
session. Ford climbed 1 3/4 to 58 7/8; General Motors finished up 3/4 to 52 
1/8; Chrysler climbed 1 1/2 to 48 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer giant IBM said it cut prices on some local area network servers. 
Its stock rose 1 1/8 to 63 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico dropped 2 1/8 to 58 3/4 along with other Mexican stocks 
in U.S. trading after Indian rebels in southern Mexico rejected a peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the currency market, the dollar slid as investors flocked to the 
German mark in the wake of a ruling-party victory in European parliamentary 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 1.647 German marks, down from 1.667 on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fetched 102.85 Japanese yen, down from 103.50 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, coffee prices soared close to levels last seen in the 
late 1980s after the government projected a decline in output. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee for July delivery jumped 13.10 cents to $1.383 a pound on the New York 
Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil futures surged to their highest levels in nearly eight months on the 
New York Merc, spurred by continued oil shortages in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Light, sweet crude for July delivery jumped 31 cents to $18.79 a barrel.

MEXICAN FIRM TO OVERHAUL CUBAN PHONE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced Monday that a Mexican 
investment company has signed a historic agreement to overhaul Cuba's decrepit 
telephone system. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas denounced the 3-decade-old U.S. trade embargo against Cuba as he 
confirmed the deal by a private group to obtain a 49% stake in the Cuban 
Telecommunications Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This blockade doesn't resolve anything," Salinas said at a news conference 
before he capped the six-hour trade mission and flew to Cartagena, Colombia, 
for a summit of Spanish-speaking nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas used the word blockade , which is favored by the Cubans, and not the 
milder term embargo used by the U.S. government in disclosing what he called a 
"major telecommunications contract" between Mexico and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas and Cuban trade officials refused to discuss specifics of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deal would mark Cuba's first major privatization since the 1959 
revolution led by Fidel Castro. Some Cuban telephone circuits date to the 
1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 An official with Grupo Domos International said the private Mexican investment 
group had arranged a $1.4-billion agreement that would also provide a shot at 
developing a potentially lucrative long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Key to the deal is telephone traffic with the U.S.," said Miguel Angel 
Thierry, an executive of Grupo Domos, based in Monterrey, Mexico.

WOMEN AT ACCOUNTING'S TOP LEVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just over one-quarter of all new partners at public accounting firms in the 
past three years were women, according to a study by the American Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants. Part of the reason more women aren't making it to 
partnership, the highest level in an accounting firm, is that there are still 
fewer women in the senior ranks from which new partners are drawn, and that, in 
part, is because turnover in those senior ranks is higher among women.The 
survey was conducted in December, with more than 1,700 firms participating. NEW 
PARTNERS WITHIN THE LAST THREE YEARS At all accounting firms, 26% of new 
partners during the last three years have been women. At smaller firms -- those 
with fewer than five employees -- the figure rises to 39%, while at firms with 
more than 20 employees, only 13% of new partners were women. GENDER IN THE TOP 
RANKS At accounting firms of all sizes, women make up about a quarter of the 
people in the top ranks. Source: American Institute of Certified Public

BEN & JERRY'S TAKES UNCONVENTIONAL FLAVOR FURTHER WITH SEARCH FOR CEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc. co-founder Ben Cohen said Monday that he will step 
aside as chief executive to concentrate on "fun stuff" such as new flavors and 
marketing ideas as the company seeks a chief executive with more business 
experience. Cohen will remain as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The folksy upstart ice cream company, which came out of nowhere to take 40% of 
the market for premium ice cream and frozen yogurt, has seen its stock price 
fall by almost half in the past 18 months. Its 1993 earnings were hurt by 
problems that included a delay in opening a $35-million packing plant. 
</P>
<P>
 After the announcement, Ben & Jerry's Class B shares rose 25 cents to close at 
$13.25 a share on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to recruit realistically, the board of the unconventional company 
voted to jettison its much-touted policy of paying no one more than seven times 
the salary and benefits of the lowest-paid employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the company is hiring an executive-search firm, it will also use 
store posters to launch an essay contest: "Why you should be Ben & Jerry's next 
CEO, in 100 words or fewer." The winner gets to be CEO. The runner-up gets free 
ice cream for life.

DOING BUSINESS IN RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are George Rose's tips for American entrepreneurs. * Plan to lose money 
on your venture for the first three to four years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buy political risk insurance and insurance that protects your investment 
from drastic fluctuations in the rate of currency exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you don't speak Russian, hire an experienced guide. It might be a local 
business person, a consultant or an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be obsessed with bringing your product or service to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for opportunities to try something over there that you can't do here. 
(For example, there are entire towns without telephone systems or ice cream 
shops.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Be patient. It may take 15 faxes to get one response. 
</P>
<P>
 * Realize that when a Russian says no, he or she may not mean it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Before you do anything, call the U.S. Department of Commerce for help: (202) 
482-4655. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Anne Palmieri said the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce spends 
about $12,000 a year on newsletters, database services and other information 
sources. In recent months, her staff has worked with companies trying to 
establish a Russian American television network and has worked to find 
financing for a Russian company that makes hydrofoils. She offers these tips. * 
Remember, you are dealing with a society in the midst of an absolutely 
earth-shattering transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be aware of the criminal underworld. 
</P>
<P>
 * Collect detailed information about your industry and specific business 
niche, including the geographical area you want to do business in. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find the right Russian business partner. Beware of inexperienced Russians 
who claim to have a lot of contacts but don't. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have a written "risk minimization plan" with specific scenarios outlining 
how you will deal with problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use all the support services that exist, including the Commerce Department's 
Washington-based Business Information Service for the Newly Independent States. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set up your own communications systems, including computer electronic mail 
or satellite telephone systems.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; BEGELMAN DOING YET ANOTHER RETAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Begelman is back . . . again. The veteran producer and studio executive, 
who's still best remembered for his starring role in the check-forging scandal 
that rocked Hollywood in the 1970s, is in advanced negotiations to secure 
financing for a new production company. 
</P>
<P>
 Begelman's partner would be Sidney Kimmel, a Pennsylvania-based clothing 
magnate who has dabbled in the movie business. Sources say the two and their 
representatives have spent weeks working out the details of the agreement, 
which is expected to be announced soon. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Kimmel deal is consummated, the 72-year-old Begelman will reaffirm his 
standing as the Energizer bunny of the Hollywood executive set. Despite being 
brought down by the Columbia Pictures check scandal more than 15 years ago, he 
just keeps going and going in the film business -- having headed two other 
studios and two independent production companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief interview Monday, Begelman confirmed that the discussions are under 
way. But he deferred to Kimmel, who could not be reached for comment, to 
elaborate on the plan. "The company is on the front burner, to use a cliche," 
Begelman said. "Some kind of announcement is fairly imminent. I'd exaggerate if 
I said days. It'll be more like weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say the biggest remaining complication is transferring some 
commitments from Begelman's old company, Gladden Entertainment, to his new one. 
Gladden last year said it signed a 10-picture, $150-million set of distribution 
deals with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Live Entertainment and Rank Film Distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources at MGM and Live confirmed that the companies are independently in 
discussions about transferring their distribution agreements. Rank could not be 
reached for comment, but Begelman said "it's likely" that all three will be on 
board when the new company comes together. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladden Entertainment was sent into involuntary bankruptcy by the major talent 
guilds in April for allegedly defaulting on $4.1 million in residuals. 
Begelman's new firm, Gladden Productions, was formed before the old one went 
out of business. He acknowledged that the similar names of the companies is 
confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company is a living, breathing entity, and we're in business to make 
movies," he said. "I've been chastened for choosing such an unimaginative name. 
But I had no idea about what would happen with Gladden Entertainment. My 
lawyers are moving to change the name." 
</P>
<P>
 Begelman owned 50% of Gladden. His former partner, Bruce McNall, will have no 
involvement in the new company. The former Los Angeles Kings owner recently 
filed for personal bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimmel is the chairman of Jones Apparel Group Inc. in Bristol, Pa. The son of 
a cabdriver and himself a college dropout, he made his fortune after taking the 
clothing company public in 1991. Kimmel recently made the Forbes magazine list 
of the 400 richest people in America. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear whether Kimmel plans to invest in the new movie venture through 
Jones or privately. In the past he's been casually involved in Hollywood, and 
was described by Begelman as one of Gladden's backers at the 1993 Cannes Film 
Festival. Kimmel's production credits include "The Clan of the Cave Bear," 
"Blame It on Rio" and the cult hit "9 1/2 Weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Begelman is one of the industry's most durable figures, having survived the 
1978 scandal in which he was found guilty of embezzling $40,000 from Columbia 
Pictures at a time when he served as studio chairman. The case spawned the 
best-selling book "Indecent Exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 After paying a $5,000 fine and completing a public service documentary, 
Begelman resurfaced as chairman of MGM in 1979. Short stints at United Artists 
and Sherwood Productions followed, before he co-founded Gladden in 1984. The 
company enjoyed some early success with "The Fabulous Baker Boys," "Weekend at 
Bernie's" and "Mannequin." But its fortunes soured in the 1990s when it 
released box office losers such as "Short Time" and "Mannequin II." 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for the talent guilds had no comment Monday on Begelman's plans to 
form a new company. In an April lawsuit, they said Gladden had failed to file 
quarterly residual reports for more than a year. Gladden disputed the amount 
allegedly owed and said the guilds should direct their claims to French bank 
Credit Lyonnais because the bank held a lien, which sources placed at $90 
million, on Gladden assets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 President and accounted for: It used to be said that Hollywood studios were 
overloaded with vice presidents of every description. There were senior vice 
presidents, executive vice presidents and even senior executive vice 
presidents. Now comes a similar glut of presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. confirmed Monday that Michael Layton is the new president of 
Hollywood Pictures. He reports to Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture President 
David Hoberman, who is under Walt Disney Studios President Richard Frank. 
Working with Layton are Donald De Line, president of production for Touchstone 
Pictures; David Vogel, president of Walt Disney Pictures, and Peter Schneider, 
president of feature animation. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sony Pictures, meanwhile, Fred Bernstein got the expected nod as president 
of its motion picture group. His colleagues include TriStar Pictures President 
Marc Platt, TriStar Production President Stacey Lassally and Columbia Pictures 
President Lisa Henson.

COMPANY TOWN; ANALYSIS; HYPERBOLE ON STUDIES SHOWS HOLLYWOOD STILL LIKES A MYTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood released two studies Monday showing that it is a bigger contributor 
to the state's economy than anyone realized -- generating 534,000 jobs directly 
and indirectly and spending $16.3 billion on payroll, goods and services in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the findings are the kind of ominous warnings heard so much 
lately: Don't chase us out of your neighborhood when we want to shoot there, 
and make it easier for us to get permits needed for our car chases, or more 
production will pick up and move to Texas, Arizona, Vancouver or Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's one problem with that tactic. Far from losing the battle with 
other states and countries, statistics show California is routing its 
competition, with more production work -- and a far bigger number of projects 
than ever before. So what's going on? 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the studies, jointly released by the Public Affairs Coalition of 
the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers, appears to be twofold: 
to convince the average Southern Californian that Hollywood is an increasingly 
important economic contributor, and by doing so to provide ammunition for the 
inevitable lobbying push for concessions to aid the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no shortage of hyperbole in the public statements accompanying the 
study's release. Mayor Richard Riordan called it his most important news 
conference. And in a real stretch, he linked everything from home prices in Los 
Angeles to the very salaries and jobs of the reporters covering the news 
conference to Hollywood's well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 Also speaking were such luminaries as MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg, 
Paramount Television Group Chairman Kerry McCluggage and Motion Picture Assn. 
of America President Jack Valenti. All echoed the singular theme that Hollywood 
is a $16.3-billion-a-year economic gorilla that needs to be nurtured instead of 
tripped up by regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 One who did not speak, however, was the author of one of the studies, 
economist David Friedman, who has an entirely different take on the threat to 
California's production industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman's statistics are in sharp contrast to the largely anecdotal evidence 
that California is losing much of its production. His figures show that the 
percentage of film starts in California has not declined at all and has 
actually grown from 51% in 1986 to 68% now. That's hardly the sign of an 
industry packing to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman disputes the notion that more jobs and paychecks are being lost. In 
most cases, he says, workers who go on location do so temporarily, continuing 
to cash their paychecks and spend their money at home in Southern California. 
As for jobs moving out of state, the actual number of out-of-state film 
industry jobs remains a small fraction of California's 164,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, film industry jobs total 20,000. The number is 7,600 in Illinois 
and 4,600 in Texas. As for the much-hyped production center of Florida, the 
number of film industry jobs is 3,200, a figure Friedman says is "probably less 
than the number in three square blocks of Mid-Wilshire." 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't to say that Friedman believes nothing should be done for the 
industry. Rather, he says, Hollywood and government officials would do well to 
junk the blackmail-like talk that is increasingly heard when Hollywood 
threatens to take its business elsewhere if the state climate does not improve. 
Entertainment executives were vague in describing whether there is a 
legislative agenda they will push, although a similar news conference set for 
today in Sacramento suggests there will be. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to why Hollywood came out with the study now probably lies in the 
fact that there have been a couple of high-profile battles that made Hollywood 
feel unappreciated as an economic force. 
</P>
<P>
 George Vradenburg, executive vice president at Fox Inc., acknowledged that two 
catalysts were Fox's own troubles in getting permission to expand and modernize 
its aging Westside studio and the high-profile opposition by some residents in 
Hermosa Beach to filming scenes there of TV show "Beverly Hills 90210." 
</P>
<P>
 But Friedman says the perception that the state is chasing away production 
just isn't based in fact. He hopes the studies will be used to shift the issue 
to how to take a hugely successful industry and make it even more so. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a perception of massive decline even though there hasn't been," 
Friedman said. "We need to take a home run for this state and turn it into a 
grand slam. We need to focus on expanding an already robust industry."

 Walt Disney Co. announced today that A-1 Animation, a New York animation 
gallery, and others have agreed to a preliminary injunction barring them from 
selling or offering for sale unauthorized artwork that infringes on Disney's 
copyrights and from representing artwork as an "authentic" Disney product when 
it is not. The injunction also requires the defendants to turn over to Disney 
all work in their possession, custody or control that infringes on the Disney 
copyright. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions stems from a suit initiated by Disney in U.S. District Court in 
New York. The suit -- which also names Indie Productions, Toon Publishing Group 
Ltd. and a number of individuals as defendants -- charged that the defendants 
had offered for sale works with forged signatures and unauthorized tracings of 
copyrighted drawings, as well as some materials taken from Disney premises 
without its permission. Disney has never done business with A-1 Animation, the 
court papers say.

NEWS ROUNDUP: COMPANY TOWN; TELEVISED EXECUTION

<P>
 North Carolina death-row inmate David Lawson and talk show host Phil Donahue 
were waiting Monday to see whether the U.S. Supreme Court would allow the 
killer's execution to be shown on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson, 38, is scheduled to be put to death by cyanide gas at 2 a.m. EDT 
Wednesday; Donahue wants to videotape the event and televise it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson has said he was suffering from depression when he broke into what he 
thought was empty house in 1980. As he was leaving, he set off an alarm and the 
homeowner rushed inside. Lawson fatally shot the owner. 
</P>
<P>
 The warden at Central Prison in Raleigh rejected the request to videotape 
Lawson's execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson says he wants Donahue to televise the execution in order to bring 
attention to the effects of depression and in the hope it will deter crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue's attorney argues that to bar TV broadcasts while allowing written 
coverage discriminates against the television industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the First Amendment says that if you invite a reporter to a 
governmental function that you cannot curtail how that reporter reports," said 
John Hasty, a Charlotte-based attorney who also represents Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Donahue ought to have the right to effectively report on the event, which 
means for a television journalist, the right to use his camera," Hasty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson will be the 17th person executed in the United States this year, 
according to the Death Penalty information Center in Washington. Most of the 
executions were concentrated in Southern states, with Texas already averaging 
one a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson was born in Michigan into a family that included an alcoholic and 
abusive father. His parents separated when he was two. 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager he was sent to reform school for his part in a burglary ring, 
where he served as the lookout. At about age 18, he came to North Carolina 
looking for his father. When he found him, the father was still drinking and 
continued to be abusive.

BOTTOM FISHERS CASTING FOR BARGAIN APARTMENTS; EARTHQUAKE: THE NORTHRIDGE 
TEMBLOR DEALT A BLOW TO THE ALREADY SHAKY MARKET IN MULTIFAMILY BUILDINGS. 
THAT'S BAD NEWS FOR MANY OWNERS, BUT GOOD NEWS FOR REHAB SPECIALISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The ad said a "red tag special," but the 77-unit Studio City apartment hardly 
looked inviting. A wing of the horseshoe-shaped complex had collapsed as a 
result of the Northridge earthquake. The rest of the structure was crooked, 
leaning six inches north, and two swimming pools contained cracked stucco, 
tattered clothes, broken furniture and glass. 
</P>
<P>
 But to rehab specialist Ron Bien, it looked like a bargain. Four years ago, 
the apartment was appraised at $5 million. The current owner, burdened by a big 
mortgage and not covered by earthquake insurance, agreed to sell it to Bien for 
$1.35 million. After the deal closes in July, Bien plans to repair the 
building, spruce it up with new archways and landscaping, and reopen it by 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If done properly, the returns will be substantial," said Bien, who owns RB 
Companies Inc., a Woodland Hills general contracting and real estate investment 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom fishers like Bien are finding bargain-basement prices for quake-ravaged 
apartments. "For the buyers, it's utopia now," said Bernard Haddigan, a 
managing director at the Marcus & Millichap brokerage in Encino, which 
specializes in apartment buildings. And for the previous apartment owners or 
sellers? "It's Armageddon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Haddigan's co-workers, broker Al Mozafar, recently listed a 16-unit 
apartment in Sherman Oaks that was badly damaged by the quake. It sold within a 
week to a Los Angeles contractor who paid $387,500 -- less than half the 
appraised value a couple of years ago. "He got an excellent price," Mozafar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Jan. 17 quake, apartment owners in the San Fernando Valley 
were struggling. Last year a surging total of apartment foreclosures -- caused 
by double-digit vacancy rates, declining rents and the local recession -- drove 
apartment values down to 1986 levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley apartment building sale prices have been falling 1% a month since 
mid-1990. On average, buyers paid $35,586 per apartment unit in the Valley last 
year, down 47% from $66,599 in 1990, according to Commercial Property 
Information Services in San Diego. Hardest hit have been apartments in North 
Hollywood, Van Nuys and Panorama City. Of the 444 apartment buildings sold in 
the Valley last year, about half were bank repossessions, COMPS said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, inspectors from the Los Angeles Department of Building 
and Safety posted red (unsafe) and yellow (limited entry) tags on more than 500 
apartment buildings in the Valley. Brokers said many of these will wind up in 
foreclosure, probably in the fall, since it takes several months for lenders to 
seize properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds of apartment owners are at the point of determining whether they 
have the staying power to hold on," said Bruce Hanes, owner of Hanes Investment 
Realty Inc., a Westlake Village commercial brokerage. Hanes, a 20-year broker 
in the region, is more pessimistic than most. He doesn't see apartment building 
prices in the Valley climbing out of the cellar until 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 One big apartment lender in the Valley, Glendale-based Fidelity Federal Bank, 
already saw an increase of $175 million in first-quarter loan delinquencies -- 
nearly all of it from apartment owners -- as a result of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is that only a fraction of apartments in the Valley were 
insured for earthquakes, analysts said. So apartment owners are finding it 
tough to get private or government loans for repairs because they have little 
or no equity in their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to owners' woes, voters last week rejected a state bond measure that 
would have enabled landlords without quake insurance to get special loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake has just pushed a lot of people over the brink," said James 
Boyle, a senior executive vice president at Coast Federal Bank of Los Angeles, 
which has about $200 million of outstanding loans to Valley apartment owners. 
Coast is trying to work out a solution with struggling borrowers, Boyle said, 
but "some apartment owners just can't or won't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford Meeks, owner of a 16-unit apartment in Van Nuys, sees no way out of 
his situation. Meeks' uninsured apartment had minor quake damage, but the 
bigger problem is his huge debt. Four years ago, the former Hughes engineer put 
a $280,000 down payment on the property, then valued at $1.1 million. Two weeks 
ago, the same property was appraised at $425,000, Meeks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks, 62, was turned down by his lender for a reduction in his mortgage 
principal, and now his building is in foreclosure proceedings. "I'm just a guy 
trying to build a little security for retirement," Meeks said, his voice 
wavering. 
</P>
<P>
 But trouble for some is opportunity for others -- especially for contractors 
and developers who have the cash to buy now, fix up properties and wait for 
things to get better. In effect, they are betting that the apartment market has 
finally hit bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just one week after the quake when Bien, the rehab specialist, spotted 
the dilapidated roof line of the Studio City apartment complex from his truck 
on the Hollywood Freeway. Bien got the address and tracked down the owner 
through title records. 
</P>
<P>
 Bien, 44, knew he wanted it on his first walk through the property. Despite 
the building's horrific appearance, Bien found that the 77 units inside were 
basically sound. On a recent afternoon he showed a visitor a second-floor 
apartment with crack-free walls and undamaged bathroom tiles. "You can move 
into this," he said. Bien also liked the property's location -- near a highway, 
across the street from a church and surrounded by a park. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Delava, finance director with ACF Property Management in Sherman Oaks, 
brokered the sale of the Studio City property for the owner. Delava ran ads in 
national and local newspapers listing the building for $1.3 million. In two 
weeks, Delava said, more than 100 people inquired, mostly Mom-and-Pop 
contractors in Los Angeles, but calls also came from big developers and 
syndicates from all over the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Delava received a dozen offers, but Bien will get the building for $1.35 
million, and the lender agreed to write off $2 million on the loan, enabling 
the current owner to walk away without a scar on his credit rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city inspectors estimated repairs for the Studio City apartment 
building at $4 million, Bien figures he can rebuild the place for $1.5 million. 
Bien has been rehabbing apartments for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With seven employees, Bien does some construction work and subcontracts out 
the rest. Using steel beams and hydraulic jacks, he has even lifted apartment 
buildings to reposition and transport them. In 1979, Bien bought a 
5,000-square-foot redwood house in Northridge, then hauled it, in four 
sections, to a knoll in Calabasas. He rehabbed the place and now lives there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would scare the typical contractor," Bien said of the run-down 
Studio City apartment complex. "But to me, it isn't a big deal. I've moved 
buildings across town. This building only moved six inches." 
</P>
<P>
 Bien owns and manages two dozen apartment buildings in Los Angeles, mostly in 
the inner city. Now Bien is shopping to buy an additional half-dozen 
quake-damaged properties and seeking a partner to help him finance the deals. 
"Opportunities are there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom fishers like Bien aren't betting on apartment values climbing anytime 
soon. Instead, they're buying apartments largely for the cash flow. Some 
brokers say that excluding debt payments, the cash flow on an apartment 
investment today can reach 15% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The returns are phenomenal," claimed Melinda Russell, an apartment specialist 
at Zugsmith-Thind in Encino, a commercial real estate brokerage. Last year 
Russell sold 22 apartment buildings, double her sales in 1992, and every one 
was a bank repossession. "There are people out there scavenging because they 
think they can fix it cheap," Russell said. "If they buy low enough, they can 
undercut their neighbor's rent." 
</P>
<P>
 That possibility is another worry for current apartment owners. Valley rents 
are already down in some areas as much as 40% from 1990. And competition for 
tenants has been fierce, due to high unemployment that has forced people to 
relocate out of state, move back in with their parents or double up. In recent 
years the vacancy rate of the Valley's apartment market has averaged in the low 
teens, brokers say. 
</P>
<P>
 With thousands of apartment units in the region lost in the quake, many 
expected intact Valley apartments to fill up. But that hasn't happened, said 
Boyle, the Coast Federal Bank executive. Instead, tenants have fled to 
Calabasas, Thousand Oaks and other areas less affected by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recent memory is still there, so those people won't be moving back" to 
the Valley, Boyle said. As a result, when quake-damaged properties like Bien's 
reopen later this year, he said, they will help keep Valley apartment rents low 
and vacancy rates high. "I don't see much change in the foreseeable future."

U.S. HIGH COURT MAKES IT HARD FOR REGULATORS TO SUE LAWYERS; JURISPRUDENCE: THE 
CASES STEMMED FROM FAILED THRIFTS IN ORANGE COUNTY AND TEXAS. SUITS MUST BE 
FILED WITHIN STATE LIMITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court, in cases stemming from failed thrifts in Orange County 
and Texas, made it harder for federal regulators to sue lawyers and accountants 
on malpractice claims and cut off most lawsuits that are not filed within 
state-mandated deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's high court decided unanimously that state common law, not a small 
area of federal common law, should be used in most lawsuits brought by 
regulators against professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisions could wipe out pending cases seeking damages that, regulators 
said, "substantially exceed $1.5 billion" for alleged wrongdoing that led to 
the collapse of banks and thrifts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of these cases are big disappointments for us," said Jack Smith, deputy 
general counsel for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the professionals feeling the heat of regulators for more than five 
years, the Supreme Court has restored some balance that will allow them to 
continue rendering advice under long-established state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to make clear that whatever the state law is, it will be the 
law that is going to govern these cases," said Gregory A. Smith, a lawyer 
representing the Los Angeles law firm of O'Melveny & Myers, the main defendant 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The other S&L decision denied the FDIC's appeal of a Texas case in which the 
agency filed suit alleging negligence against directors and officers after the 
filing deadline had passed. Banking regulators argue that deadlines often pass 
in these cases before they even seize the institutions and discover the 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the court's primary decision involved a $20-million claim against 
O'Melveny, California's fourth-largest law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators said that they will still want to take the malpractice case to 
trial so they can prove that lawyers were negligent in handling two real estate 
transactions for now-defunct American Diversified Savings Bank in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the 1980's debacle in the S&L industry, which is expected 
to cost taxpayers more than $100 billion, regulators have sought to hold an 
array of professionals -- lawyers, accountants, investment bankers, appraisers 
-- liable for negligence or more intentional wrongdoing, like aiding and 
abetting frauds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Resolution Trust Corp., which liquidates failed thrifts, has recovered 
$184 million from lawyers and $492 million from accountants through the end of 
March. Professionals in the fraud-riddled Lincoln Savings & Loan collapse paid 
most of those amounts, an RTC spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers and other professionals had mounted a counterattack to the aggressive 
efforts of the RTC and the FDIC, and have recently seen their efforts pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the Supreme Court overturned a half-century of legal precedents by 
ruling that defrauded investors cannot sue lawyers, accountants and other 
"third parties" who aided and abetted a fraud scheme. Monday's cases provided 
another victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators accused O'Melveny of negligence in preparing documents for two 
syndications put together by American Diversified's primary owner-operator, 
Ranbir S. Sahni. The documents did not reveal to investors the thrift's 
financial difficulties or any fraud on the part of American Diversified 
executives. The FDIC asserts that O'Melveny should have known about both. 
</P>
<P>
 After regulators seized the thrift in 1986, investors in the real estate 
partnerships demanded their money back. Regulators returned the money and later 
sued O'Melveny & Myers, as well as Sahni along with other officers and 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The syndications were only a small part of the labyrinthine structure of 
investments in a host of real estate deals, alternative energy ventures and 
other transactions that Sahni put together. Regulators spent months unraveling 
the deals and trying to determine who owned what. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators eventually closed American Diversified and refunded $1.14 billion 
to depositors, the biggest depositor refund ever. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Melveny fought the suit, contending that it performed its work on two 
transactions diligently and wasn't required to determine if the institution was 
being operated fraudulently. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal district court in Los Angeles agreed, and threw the case out 
before trial. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, however, said the lower 
court should have based its decision on federal common law -- or case law -- 
instead of state common law. Now, the Supreme Court has sent the case back to 
the 9th Circuit for a decision under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Monday, the Supreme Court let stand a ruling that an employer 
can be held liable for alleged sexual harassment even if the company has a 
policy barring such conduct and procedures to deal with any complaints. It also 
ruled that California violated a unionized worker's rights when it refused to 
handle a complaint she filed with state labor authorities about a pay dispute.

GROUP IS WORKING TO KEEP HUGHES IN FULLERTON; INDUSTRY: THE ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT TEAM HAS MET WITH AIRCRAFT COMPANY OFFICIALS IN THE HOPE OF HEADING 
OFF A MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Unwilling to wait passively for Hughes Aircraft Co.'s decision on whether it 
will close its giant Fullerton defense electronics plant in a major 
streamlining, an Orange County economic development group has begun meeting 
with officials of the aerospace company to promote this area's attractiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the first meeting, held in late May, are being kept secret. But Ken 
Moore, executive director of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, said the Hughes retention team has offered to assist in the 
development of cost-cutting methods at the plant, which employs 6,800 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is headed by Wayne Wedin, chairman of the Orange County Economic 
Development Consortium, and includes Moore, Fullerton City Manager James 
Armstrong, Fullerton Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin -- who was recalled by voters 
last week over unrelated issues -- and Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton). A 
representative of the state Trade and Commerce Department also attended the 
meeting. Catlin, who has not left office yet, will probably be replaced after a 
new Fullerton mayor is seated. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore characterized the session as the opening round in what the group expects 
to be a series of meetings. Wedin said he has spoken with Hughes officials by 
telephone several times since the face-to-face meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes said last month that it is conducting a streamlining study and that 
layoffs would probably be part of the final plan. Michael Smith, Hughes vice 
chairman, said in an employee newsletter that four of the company's California 
sites, including the Fullerton defense electronics plant, are involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the options believed to be under study are the shutdown of one or more 
of the facilities; scaling back operations and laying off workers at one or 
more sites, or consolidating several of the plants at one existing site. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County retention group hopes to persuade Hughes that it makes most 
sense to use the 350-acre Fullerton site as a campus for relocation of other 
operations -- an alternative that would probably result in Hughes' Orange 
County employment growing. 
</P>
<P>
 The other sites involved in the Hughes streamlining study are two defense 
plants in El Segundo, with a total of 8,000 employees, and a communications and 
logistics equipment factory in Long Beach with 970 workers. Altogether, the 
company has 34,000 employees in California, including 8,100 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hughes spokesman said Smith viewed the effort by the Orange County group "as 
a very positive move" and that it was the first effort by any group in 
California to try to work with the company as it seeks to trim costs. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hughes could decide to close the Fullerton campus and relocate jobs 
there to other plants in Los Angeles and Virginia, the Orange County group 
wants the company to consider the under-used site as viable location to which 
other Hughes operations could be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about two-thirds of the space available at the Fullerton site is now in 
use, Hughes has said. At its peak in 1986, 14,500 people worked there. The 
company is considering a plan to obtain new zoning for some of the property so 
it could be sold to a developer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hughes streamlining report is being prepared by an executive group led by 
Smith, who heads the company's new Hughes Aerospace & Electronics Co. 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hughes team's recommendations are expected to be complete by late July, to 
be forwarded to Hughes Chairman Michael Armstrong. A final decision is expected 
by late fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said the Orange County group expects to meet in person with Smith and 
other Hughes officials again before the recommendations are prepared.

 AST Research likes to think that in its own small way, it helped bring about 
democracy in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because 400 of its Premmia personal computers were used by that 
nation's Independent Electoral Commission to register voters leading up to last 
month's elections.The Irvine-based company produced the computers that were 
used to log the names and other information for temporary voter cards to keep 
the elections free and fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The voting resulted in the election of President Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are delighted with the decision of the IEC to base this electoral reform 
on the AST Premmia" line of computers, AST Chairman Safi Qureshey said in a 
statement. "More importantly, we are glad to be able to contribute with 
information technology that leads to political change for the better." 
</P>
<P>
 AST is the world's fifth largest computer maker and has extensive overseas 
sales. It is the top-selling brand of personal computer in China and throughout 
much of the rest of the Far East.

NEWPORT BEACH REIT GETS BIG CREDIT LINE; ACQUISITIONS: PACIFIC GULF PROPERTIES 
SAYS IT WILL USE FUNDS TO BUY PROPERTY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, THE NORTHWEST 
AND TEXAS.

 Pacific Gulf Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust, has secured a 
$50-million credit line from Bank of America to buy new properties, including a 
625,000-square-foot industrial center in Baldwin Park, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds from the three-year credit line will be used to purchase apartments and 
industrial properties in Southern California, the Pacific Northwest and Texas, 
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This enables us to embark immediately on our acquisition program," said Glen 
Carpenter, chief executive officer with Pacific Gulf. "The bank saw there was 
value in our management team and in the quality of our portfolio." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Gulf REIT in Newport Beach is a spinoff of apartments and 
industrial property owned by Santa Anita Realty Enterprises Inc., an REIT based 
in Arcadia. The new REIT was an attempt by Santa Anita to reduce debt and 
increase value for shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Gulf currently owns 11 apartment complexes with 2,850 units and six 
industrial buildings totaling 1.4 million square feet of space. 
</P>
<P>
 The company went public Feb. 10 with a $121-million offering priced at $18.25 
a share. Pacific's stock was down 12.5 cents Monday, closing at $17 a share on 
the American Stock Exchange. A real estate investment trust raises money by 
selling stock to investors and then investing in real estate or mortgages. 
These securities' higher rates of return of about 12% annually have attracted 
investors in recent years, according to Green St. Advisors, a Newport Beach 
company that researches REITs.

FHP, TAKECARE HOLDERS OK $1-BILLION MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As expected, shareholders of FHP International Corp., the Orange County-based 
health maintenance organization, and those of its Northern California 
competitor TakeCare Inc. have approved a $1-billion plan to merge the companies 
into the state's third-largest HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, FHP in Fountain Valley will acquire TakeCare of Concord for 
about $1.03 billion, or about $80 a share.Both groups of shareholders voted 
June 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Slated to be completed by Friday, the merger will make FHP the fifth largest 
managed care provider in the nation, covering 1.7 million people in 11 western 
and southwestern states. The company will have annual revenue of about $3.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has some real advantages for FHP," said Thomas Hodapp, an analyst with 
Robertson Stephens & Co. in San Francisco. "They are going to face a 
challenging year of merging with a very big company, but this makes them a 
leader in two large markets, Colorado and Northern California." 
</P>
<P>
 FHP stock closed unchanged at $24.62 a share Monday in Nasdaq trading. 
TakeCare's stock was up 43.7 cents to close at $76.81 a share in Nasdaq 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, both companies agreed to an acquisition price of about $800 
million, or about $62 a share. Major TakeCare shareholders filed suit, claiming 
the price was too low, and asked the board to reopen the bidding process. Three 
other bids were received, and the companies finally agreed on a deal involving 
a combination of cash, common stock and new convertible preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company will have about 14,000 employees and there are no major 
layoffs planned, said an FHP spokeswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we are looking at individual departments on a case-by-case basis," 
said Ria Carlson, spokeswoman for FHP. "There's very little overlap, so there 
are no sweeping layoffs planned."

 Denmark Bound: The Burlington Air Express name is headed for Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based freight forwarder has signed a deal that will result in Inter 
Express, a Copenhagen-based freight firm, using the Burlington name and 
handling the network's Danish freight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burlington seeks out high-profile, service-oriented companies to join its 
global network of over 490 offices," said Ray Wilson, Burlington's chief 
operating officer in the Atlantic region. "Inter Express more than meets our 
criteria for a quality partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 Inter Express has operated for 25 years and is one of the 10 largest freight 
forwarders in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development for Burlington, the company announced that it has won a 
$2.6-million contract to haul freight for Conner Peripherals Inc., a maker of 
computer tape and disc drives. Based in San Jose, Conner purchased tape drive 
maker Archive Corp. of Costa Mesa last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington will ship the company's products from factories in the Far East to 
distribution centers in Costa Mesa and Glasgow, Scotland.

TOBACCO PITCHMAN AGREES STARS DID NOT RECEIVE GIFTS; CIGARETTES: BROWN & 
WILLIAMSON DOCUMENTS OUTLINED PAYMENTS. MIDDLEMAN SAYS INFORMATION IS BOGUS.

<P>
 Paul Newman did not get a Mercedes. Bob Kovoloff did. 
</P>
<P>
 Kovoloff, of Encino, ran a nearly $1-million campaign in the early 1980s to 
place Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co. brands in feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 His Associated Film Promotions, then among Hollywood's most prominent 
product-placement firms, often eschewed written deals with studios, claiming to 
rely instead on lavish gifts to members of movie casts and crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on internal documents leaked from B & W to members of Congress and 
news organizations, The Times reported last month that Newman, Clint Eastwood, 
Sean Connery and Sylvester Stallone, among others, supposedly got expensive 
jewelry, cars and other items, purchased by Associated with B & W's money. 
</P>
<P>
 But those reports prompted indignant denials by some of the celebrities. And 
now, challenged on the details, Kovoloff -- a pioneer product pitchman who has 
faced dozens of lawsuits over his business dealings -- says that many of the 
goods never reached the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Connery "never got any jewelry," he said in a telephone interview last 
week. "Paul Newman never got a car. Sylvester Stallone never got a car. Clint 
Eastwood never got a car. They never got a thing from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a B & W audit in 1983 listing the gifts said it relied exclusively on 
records provided by Kovoloff's firm, Kovoloff last week called the listing 
bogus, denied furnishing the information and said he did not know where it came 
from. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion over how the money was spent was not his doing, Kovoloff insisted. 
"A lot of (stuff) could have been made up," he said. Kovoloff declined further 
comment, and did not return additional phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that Brown & Williamson set out -- years after Congress 
barred tobacco firms from advertising on television and radio -- to buy display 
for its products in motion pictures. But in selecting Kovoloff as its Hollywood 
pitchman, B & W got fewer results than it hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 The product-placement effort "in our view was a failure," acknowledged B & W 
spokesman Tom Fitzgerald. "It was not an effective use of our marketing 
dollars." Fitzgerald declined to comment on the audit -- conducted by B & W to 
ascertain how its money was being spent by Kovoloff's firm -- or on 
Associated's use of the tobacco firm's money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kovoloff, 57, is no stranger to disputes over property and money. During the 
1980s and early '90s, he and his companies faced a torrent of lawsuits from 
angry clients, landlords and employees -- a legal onslaught checked only by his 
bankruptcy filing in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * Former clients Nikon and Panasonic won court judgments of $70,000 and 
$349,000, respectively, over expensive photographic and electronic equipment 
loaned to Associated as movie props but never returned. In its defense, 
Associated claimed it was understood "that many of the products would not in 
fact be returned as that is the custom and practice in the motion picture 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 * After Pizza Inn Inc., paid a promotional fee of $100,000, the firm 
"instantly began to be unable to ever locate" Kovoloff, said Jeff Rogers, 
president of the Dallas-based chain, which was listed as a creditor in 
Kovoloff's bankruptcy filing.  
</P>
<P>
 * Florida Smoked Fish Co. filed suit against an ad agency over what it termed 
an unfulfilled promise of a movie scene in which famished patrons held hostage 
in a supermarket were to eat bagels and the company's fish products. The ad 
agency contracted for the placement with a Kovoloff firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Trumbull County Convention and Visitors Bureau in northeastern Ohio won 
a lawsuit over $35,000 it paid Associated to promote the area as a film 
location. "Nothing ever came of it. . . . We would write letters to him, place 
telephone calls, and there was no response," said Darlene Russo, administrative 
assistant for the visitors bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kovoloff and his companies also were sued repeatedly by landlords for unpaid 
rent on office space and luxury homes. "He's a deadbeat extraordinaire," said 
Ryan Martin, a leasing agent for a Van Nuys commercial landlord who repeatedly 
sued a Kovoloff firm for unpaid rent. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the odd tale of Brown & Williamson's campaign to promote its brands 
in films that has brought Kovoloff's bumpy career into focus. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 1983 audit, B & W said canceled checks and other records showed that 
Associated had used the tobacco company's funds to buy, among other things, a 
$42,307 automobile for Newman, a $22,047 car for Clint Eastwood and $12,715 in 
jewelry for Sean Connery. 
</P>
<P>
 To support the claimed gift to Newman, Associated apparently showed B & W's 
auditors a canceled check for $42,307 written to Auto Stiegler Inc., an Encino 
car dealership. But John Stiegler Jr., a spokesman for the dealership, said 
last week that a Mercedes convertible at that price was delivered to Kovoloff, 
not Newman. Kovoloff subsequently acknowledged he got the car. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kovoloff also acknowledged, Associated did not buy Clint Eastwood a car 
from Auto Stiegler, either, despite the audit record. Selling "a car to a 
celebrity . . . is a big thing to us," Stiegler said. "I would have known if 
there was any car going to Clint Eastwood."  
</P>
<P>
 As for Connery, his attorney stated that the actor did not receive any kind of 
payment for the placement of tobacco products in movies in which he performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another audit entry listed a payment of $13,000 to David Levy, described as 
"assistant producer" of the movie "Tank." But according to the filmmakers and 
credits, "Tank" did not have an assistant producer -- nor any involvement by a 
David Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the purported payment, however, Associated did pay $13,000 to a 
David L. Levy -- a real estate man who had nothing to do with the film. The 
money was for a security deposit and two months rent of a West Los Angeles 
office and warehouse building owned by Levy. The payment was cited in court 
papers in a lawsuit against Associated -- one of several Levy wound up filing 
for unpaid rent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lW documents also included an April 28, 1983, letter to Kovoloff from 
Sylvester Stallone, in which Stallone agreed for a fee of $500,000 to "use 
Brown & Williamson tobacco products in no less than five feature films." 
</P>
<P>
 The B & W audit, prepared several months later, said Associated had received 
$300,000 of the funds for disbursement to Stallone. Stallone's representatives 
have declined to discuss the matter, and it is unclear where the money wound 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 B & W canceled its contract with Associated Film in 1984. Internal memos show 
the firm was disturbed by Associated's record-keeping practices and didn't 
think it was getting its money's worth. Moreover, the cigarette maker had just 
been hammered by bad publicity over the showing of a Kool cigarette commercial 
in a Massachusetts theater featuring the G-rated movie "Snow White." 
</P>
<P>
 A memo said Kovoloff and Associated Film Senior Vice President James F. 
Ripslinger were told the deal "was being terminated because of a corporate 
policy decision." 
</P>
<P>
 B & W's parting was more amicable than that of some Kovoloff clients, who sued 
but were unable to collect their judgments. Collection was stymied by 
Kovoloff's 1992 bankruptcy, which wiped out debts of more than than $1.5 
million to nearly 100 creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his seemingly dire financial straits, though, Kovoloff maintained some 
trappings of the high life. 
</P>
<P>
 At a court hearing in November, 1990, involving an unpaid legal judgment, 
Kovoloff said he and his wife "have nothing. . . . We are as broke as two 
people can be." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged, however, that his wife was driving a Range Rover. His car? A 
Jaguar.

</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * Former clients Nikon and Panasonic won court judgments of $70,000 and 
$349,000, respectively, over expensive photographic and electronic equipment 
loaned to Associated as movie props but never returned. In its defense, 
Associated claimed it was understood "that many of the products would not in 
fact be returned as that is the custom and practice in the motion picture 
industry.' 
</P>
<P>
 * After Pizza Inn Inc., paid a promotional fee of $100,000, the firm 
'instantly began to be unable to ever locate" Kovoloff, said Jeff Rogers, 
president of the Dallas-based chain, which was listed as a creditor in 
Kovoloff's bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Florida Smoked Fish Co. filed suit against an ad agency over what it termed 
an unfulfilled promise of a movie scene in which famished patrons held hostage 
in a supermarket were to eat bagels and the company's fish products. The ad 
agency contracted for the placement with a Kovoloff firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Trumbull County Convention and Visitors Bureau in northeastern Ohio won 
a lawsuit over $35,000 it paid Associated to promote the area as a film 
location. "Nothing ever came of it. . . . We would write letters to him, place 
telephone calls, and there was no response," said Darlene Russo, administrative 
assistant for the visitors bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kovoloff and his companies also were sued repeatedly by landlords for unpaid 
rent on office space and luxury homes. "He's a deadbeat extraordinaire," said 
Ryan Martin, a leasing agent for a Van Nuys commercial landlord who repeatedly 
sued a Kovoloff firm for unpaid rent. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the odd tale of Brown & Williamson's campaign to promote its brands 
in films that has brought Kovoloff's bumpy career into focus. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 1983 audit, B & W said canceled checks and other records showed that 
Associated had used the tobacco company's funds to buy, among other things, a 
$42,307 automobile for Newman, a $22,047 car for Clint Eastwood and $12,715 in 
jewelry for Sean Connery. 
</P>
<P>
 To support the claimed gift to Newman, Associated apparently showed B & W's 
auditors a canceled check for $42,307 written to Auto Stiegler Inc., an Encino 
car dealership. But John Stiegler Jr., a spokesman for the dealership, said 
last week that a Mercedes convertible at that price was delivered to Kovoloff, 
not Newman. Kovoloff subsequently acknowledged he got the car. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kovoloff also acknowledged, Associated did not buy Clint Eastwood a car 
from Auto Stiegler, either, despite the audit record. Selling "a car to a 
celebrity . . . is a big thing to us," Stiegler said. "I would have known if 
there was any car going to Clint Eastwood.' 
</P>
<P>
 As for Connery, his attorney stated that the actor did not receive any kind of 
payment for the placement of tobacco products in movies in which he performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another audit entry listed a payment of $13,000 to David Levy, described as 
"assistant producer" of the movie "Tank." But according to the filmmakers and 
credits, "Tank" did not have an assistant producer--nor any involvement by a 
David Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the purported payment, however, Associated did pay $13,000 to a 
David L. Levy--a real estate man who had nothing to do with the film. The money 
was for a security deposit and two months rent of a West Los Angeles office and 
warehouse building owned by Levy. The payment was cited in court papers in a 
lawsuit against Associated--one of several Levy wound up filing for unpaid 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lW documents also included an April 28, 1983, letter to Kovoloff from 
Sylvester Stallone, in which Stallone agreed for a fee of $500,000 to "use 
Brown & Williamson tobacco products in no less than five feature films.' 
</P>
<P>
 The B & W audit, prepared several months later, said Associated had received 
$300,000 of the funds for disbursement to Stallone. Stallone's representatives 
have declined to discuss the matter, and it is unclear where the money wound 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 B & W canceled its contract with Associated Film in 1984. Internal memos show 
the firm was disturbed by Associated's record-keeping practices and didn't 
think it was getting its money's worth. Moreover, the cigarette maker had just 
been hammered by bad publicity over the showing of a Kool cigarette commercial 
in a Massachusetts theater featuring the G-rated movie "Snow White.' 
</P>
<P>
 A memo said Kovoloff and Associated Film Senior Vice President James F. 
Ripslinger were told the deal "was being terminated because of a corporate 
policy decision.' 
</P>
<P>
 B & W's parting was more amicable than that of some Kovoloff clients, who sued 
but were unable to collect their judgments. Collection was stymied by 
Kovoloff's 1992 bankruptcy, which wiped out debts of more than than $1.5 
million to nearly 100 creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his seemingly dire financial straits, though, Kovoloff maintained some 
trappings of the high life. 
</P>
<P>
 At a court hearing in November, 1990, involving an unpaid legal judgment, 
Kovoloff said he and his wife "have nothing. . . . We are as broke as two 
people can be.' 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged, however, that his wife was driving a Range Rover. His car? A 
Jaguar.

 Tobacco Firm Paid $950,000 to Place Cigarettes in Films

 Movies: Company paid actors in cash, cars or jewelry in early '80s, memos

 Internal memos say that Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. spent more than 
$950,000 in a span of four years to feature its cigarette brands in more than 
20 movies--including payments of at least $300,000 to action film star 
Sylvester Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
 The payments took the form of checks, cash and merchandise--including jewelry 
and automobiles for such stars as Paul Newman, Sean Connery and Stallone--over 
the years 1979 to 1983, the documents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Product placement, which involves payments for display of brand-name 
merchandise in films, is a legal and potentially large source of revenue for 
filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 But use of the practice by tobacco companies drew harsh criticism in Congress 
and from health activists in the late 1980s. Critics charged that the tobacco 
companies were making an end-run around federal laws that require warning 
labels on cigarette ads and banish tobacco ads from television, where many 
feature films eventually appear. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Brown & Williamson spokesman Tom Fitzgerald, the nation's No. 3 
cigarette manufacturer--which makes Kool, Barclay and other brands--halted the 
use of product placement agreements several years ago. Tobacco foes believe 
that the practice continues in the industry, citing what they consider an 
otherwise inexplicable rise in smoking scenes in films and television. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the papers, recently leaked to anti-smoking leaders in Congress and 
several news organizations, is an April 28, 1983, letter signed by Stallone in 
which he agrees for a fee of $500,000 to "use Brown & Williamson tobacco 
products in no less than five feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman said Stallone had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Bergman, executive director of the anti-smoking group STAT--which has 
accused tobacco firms of using movies to hook young smokers--said Wednesday 
that the revelations are dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's purposely putting advertising in the movies but pretending that it's not 
advertising, knowing that the movies that Sylvester Stallone is in appeal to 
children and youth more than anyone else, Bergman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, then-Rep. Thomas A. Luken (D-Ohio) conducted hearings on the use of 
product placement deals by tobacco firms. In the biggest expenditure disclosed 
during Luken's inquiries, Philip Morris said its Tokyo-based advertising agency 
had paid $350,000 to showcase Lark cigarettes in a James Bond film that was to 
run in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the placement effort described in the Brown & Williamson documents is the 
most extensive and costly ever to come to light. 
</P>
<P>
 The papers include a 1983 audit of the tobacco company's agreement with 
Associated Film Promotions, a now-defunct Los Angeles product placement firm. 
According to the audit, Associated Film's records showed that "they have 
attempted to make placements for B & W in over 150 movies or television shows 
and have succeeded in making placements in 22 movies and one television show. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said B & W was paying Associated Film a $30,000 quarterly retainer 
in 1983 and had paid a total of $278,000 in retainer fees since their 
relationship began in mid-1979. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, B & W spent an additional $687,000 for special 
placements arranged by Associated Film in a variety of movies--including 
$100,000 apiece for "Where the Boys Are and "Harry & Son, both 1984 releases, 
and $50,000 for the Clint Eastwood picture Killing Ground, released in 1983 as 
"Sudden Impact. 
</P>
<P>
 About $300,000 of the special placement monies went to Stallone as part of the 
five-picture deal worth $500,000, the documents said. Among the Stallone films 
in the deal, according to the documents, were Rhinestone Cowboy, "Rocky IV and 
"Rambo, which was released as Rambo: First Blood Part II. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents suggest that B & W officials were not sure they were getting 
their money's worth, after sitting down to view seven films in which their 
brands were to be featured. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Body Heat, the blurred image of a Kool poster appeared three times, but 
two lead characters were "observed . . . smoking Marlboro--industry leader 
Philip Morris' flagship brand--throughout the film, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same story with "Only When I Laugh. That film included "a blurred 
pack of Kool, but "the lead character . . . smoked Marlboro throughout the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco executives also discovered that in some cases, Associated Film was not 
paying with "checks to individuals because movie producers prefer cash, 
jewelry, cars, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the report said, Associated Film's records showed that of $20,000 
paid for placement in the James Bond film, "Never Say Never Again, $12,715 was 
spent on "jewelry for Sean Connery. 
</P>
<P>
 The $100,000 purportedly paid for placement in "Harry & Son included $42,307 
for a "car for Paul Newman, the documents said. And of $50,000 listed for the 
film that became "Sudden Impact, $22,047 was said to have been spent on a "car 
for Clint Eastwood, according to the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Connery and Newman did not return phone calls seeking comment. A 
spokesman for Eastwood said the audit entry had to be a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't receive a car, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kovoloff, a public relations man and former president of Associated 
Film, declined to discuss the documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to do with this right now. My answer is I have nothing to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Several tobacco companies told Luken in 1989 they no longer paid filmmakers to 
feature their brands, but had done so in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, cigarette firms wrote a prohibition on placements into the 
industry's voluntary advertising code, according to an official with the 
Tobacco Institute. The code states that tobacco companies will "not . . . 
engage in paid movie product or cigarette advertising placements. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice remains common among other makers of consumer goods. One current 
release, "Major League II, includes prominent displays of at least eight 
recognizable brand names.
