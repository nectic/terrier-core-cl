 Bullock's Speedy Casting: Actress Sandra Bullock, who stars with Keanu Reeves 
in the current box-office hit "Speed," has signed a $1.2-million deal to star 
in the romantic comedy "While You Were Sleeping," to be directed by Jon 
Turtletaub for Disney's Caravan Pictures. Bullock starts work on the film in 
about three weeks. She is also a strong contender to play the caped crusader's 
girlfriend in Warner Bros.' "Batman Forever," but the Caravan schedule would 
most likely preclude her from accepting that role. (See story on "Batman" 
casting, Page F4).

 * Grant's a Studio Man: British actor Hugh Grant, who rose to stardom this 
year in the surprise box-office hit "Four Weddings and a Funeral," will make 
his major studio film debut with 20th Century Fox in "Nine Months," a remake of 
the French comedy about the trials and tribulations of a young couple preparing 
for the birth of their child. The film will be directed by Chris Columbus

 Ike's in the House: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Ike Turner makes a rare 
Hollywood appearance tonight at Sunset Boulevard's House of Blues where he 
plans to record a live album with his new 16-piece soul revue, as well as shoot 
footage for an upcoming video. Turner, whose turbulent relationship with former 
wife and musical partner Tina Turner was chronicled in last year's film "What's 
Love Got to Do With It," has been shopping for a record deal since being 
released from prison in 1991 after serving 18 months on cocaine charges. The 
legendary 62-year-old composer -- whose 1951 hit "Rocket '88" is frequently 
cited by historians as the first true rock n' roll record -- isn't above doing 
his own promotion for the show. "Ike is going to deliver 90 breath-holding 
minutes," Turner said Thursday in a phone interview. "Man, I don't mean to 
sound egotistical, but I've got four new girls who are gonna sing and dance 
their butts off and a band that won't quit." My advice to anybody who hasn't 
seen Ike play is, 'Do yourself a favor and don't pass up this opportunity."

MOVIE REVIEW; 'LA SCORTA' A THOUGHTFUL, SLICK THRILLER; RICKY TOGNAZZI'S FILM 
IS CONCERNED WITH CHARACTER TO AN EXTENT MOST MELODRAMAS DON'T THINK IS WORTH 
THEIR WHILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The worst of times for a particular country may end up the best of times for 
its filmmakers. Witness "La Scorta," a taut, expertly made political thriller 
that confronts Italy's pervasive institutional corruption with a surprising 
combination of energy and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Slickly directed in the best sense by Ricky Tognazzi, whose father Ugo was a 
celebrated actor ("La Cage aux Folles"), "La Scorta" offers more than the 
expected squealing tires on rain-slick pavement. It is also a thoughtful film, 
concerned with character to an extent most melodramas don't think is worth 
their while. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in Sicily, where the Italian government and the Mafia have been engaged in 
a bitter, violent power struggle, "La Scorta" is freely adapted from the 
experiences of a real-life investigating magistrate and the escort of 
carabinieri , or state police, designated to protect his life. 
</P>
<P>
 An expensive film by Italian standards, "La Scorta" ended up being a huge hit 
in its home country and was well received as well at last year's Cannes Film 
Festival. The factors that helped make it popular, qualities like carefully 
controlled tension and unself-conscious heroism, should translate easily to 
this country as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "La Scorta" focuses on a pair of carabinieri, part of a detail assigned to a 
magistrate who has vowed to at least begin to clean up the city of Trapani. 
One, Angelo Mandolesi (Claudio Amendola) has come back to Sicily because his 
best friend was killed trying to protect the city's last magistrate. The other, 
Andrea Corsale (Enrico Lo Verso), never left, and now has a wife and three 
children who are strongly affected by the kind of work he does. 
</P>
<P>
 When Judge De Francesco (Carlo Cecchi) arrives, he doesn't feel comfortable 
with the idea of protection. And his escort, it turns out, has to make do with 
an ancient Alfa that barely runs. There are so few bullet-proof vests that the 
detail has to draw straws to determine who gets one. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, however, the seriousness of the problem becomes clearer to both the 
judge and his protectors. It is a venality so nearly all-inclusive that it 
makes almost everyone, even many of its supposed opponents, an accomplice in 
the evil to one degree or another. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet this challenge, the previously faction-ridden escort, including the 
uncommitted Fabio (Ricky Memphis) and the easy-going Raffaele (Tony Sperandeo), 
coalesce into one of those cinematic band of brothers, united in their 
determination to protect the judge and see that at least an attempt at justice 
is made. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the elements of the script by Graziano Diana and Simona Izzo are 
extremely traditional: wiretaps, gutless squealers and midnight rendezvous. But 
director Tognazzi, helped by one of the best of Ennio Morricone's recent 
scores, makes the scenes crackle and doesn't fall victim to excessive 
histrionics. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching these obsessed men shiver with uncertainty as they enter a building 
or climb a flight of stairs knowing that something could go wrong at any time, 
that even a momentary lapse could mean death, is as intense an experience as it 
sounds. Operating on the theory that if you're not scared, you're not doing 
your job, they make us feel the realism of their story. 
</P>
<P>
 Essential here is the work of the excellent actors, most of whom are not well 
known to American audiences. Claudio Amendola has the necessary animal energy 
for the brooding Angelo, Carlo Cecchi is the image of stony integrity as the 
judge and Enrico Lo Verso, the star of "Stolen Children," is sympathetic as the 
escort leader and concerned father who will only kiss his kids when they're 
asleep so they won't grow up soft. Such touches raise "La Scorta" above the 
crowd.

MOVIE REVIEW; A THOUGHTFUL SEARCH FOR LOVE IN THE '90S; DIANE KURYS' 'LOVE 
AFTER LOVE' EVOKES AN ACUTE SENSE OF CONTEMPORARY URBAN LIFE AND ROMANCE WITH A 
THIRTYSOMETHING TWIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Diane Kurys' wise and graceful "Love After Love" opens,Lola (Isabelle 
Huppert), a popular Parisian novelist, is celebrating her 35th birthday at a 
festive gathering in the spacious high-rise apartment she shares with her 
longtime lover, David (Bernard Giraudeau), an equally successful architect. 
Lola would appear to have everything, but by the time she celebrates her next 
birthday, her entire life has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lola and David have been together since she was 15, and their determinedly 
open relationship has survived David's fathering two children with another 
woman. An autobiographical novelist, Lola is experiencing writer's block, 
apparently for the first time. It is not lost on her that her own new lover, a 
rock musician (Hippolyte Girardot), is also the father of two children who make 
legitimate claims upon his time and attentions. Lola is beginning to be no 
longer content playing second fiddle in the lives of the men with whom she is 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Lola's quietly intensifying search for renewal, Kurys evokes an acute 
sense of contemporary urban life as it is lived in most major cities of the 
world. Lola and David may be more sophisticated in regard to the vicissitudes 
of amour than most couples, yet Kurys suggests that traditional French 
worldliness in affairs of the heart may be wearing a tad thin in the 
competitive, economically depressed '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kurys puts major importance on the relationship between David and his younger 
half-brother Romain (Yvan Attal). Handsome and debonair in his 40s, David 
reflexively responds to the overtures of gorgeous women, including his 
ambitious but naive new secretary (Judith Reval) and regards such encounters as 
merely casual sex. A workaholic who accepts all the commissions that come his 
way, David is an irascible hard-driving employer. He is everything that Romain 
does not want to be; Romain wants to strike out on his own and also to 
establish a stable marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although central to the story, Lola is also a point of departure for Kurys in 
exploring with wry humor and compassion the longings and frustrations of all 
the key people close to the novelist. Kurys gets reflective portrayals from her 
first-rate cast, and "Love After Love" has the easy flow and intimacy typical 
of Kurys, who has always seemed the most natural and spontaneous of filmmakers. 
Indeed, this lovely and thoughtful film proceeds with so much effortlessness 
that you may be in danger of overlooking its considerable substance.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'THE SLINGSHOT' OFFERS A WARM LOOK AT FACING LIFE; ANECDOTES AND 
HUMOR PUNCTUATE THE BITTERSWEET STORY REVEALING THE IMPORTANCE OF A STRONG 
FAMILY LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Slingshot," a bittersweet but warm account of growing up in Sweden in the 
'20s, takes its title from the devices fashioned by its ingenious 10-year-old 
hero Roland Schutt (Jesper Salen) from condoms his mother sells to her friends. 
Roland's enterprise is doubly significant: As the film is based on an 
autobiographical novel, it foreshadows Roland's adult career as an inventor 
(the real Schutt is now in his 80s), and it reveals that Sweden was once far 
from the progressive nation it is today. No wonder Roland's mother, Zipa (Basia 
Frydman), is mightily upset with him: Between 1910 and 1937 the dissemination 
of birth control information was illegal in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Zipa's family-planning advocacy, however, is but part of her larger commitment 
to socialism. She's a diminutive, fiery woman, a Russian Jew, whereas her 
husband, Fritiof (Stellan Skarsgard), is a tall, strapping fellow, expansive, a 
bit pompous but an even more fervent socialist than his wife. He runs a 
Stockholm tobacco shop, and his family -- which includes an older son Bertil 
(Niclas Olund), an aspiring boxer -- lives behind it in small but 
well-appointed quarters. Although there's not much money left over to buy the 
things boys crave, like a bicycle, the Schutts, for all the radical 
pronouncements made in their parlor, are definitely members of the middle 
class, albeit in the lower rungs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A revolutionary never closes his eyes," preaches Fritiof to Roland, who is in 
the process of establishing his own sense of identity amid considerable 
conflict and adversity. That he is an uncircumsized, baptized Christian -- as 
presumably is his father -- does not prevent him from being subjected to a 
chronic, crude and sometimes physically brutal anti-Semitism (whose worse 
practitioners are in fact his repellent teacher and principal; these two old 
men are virtual Nazis). Roland is not really interested in his father's 
politics, but he does develop the courage to look his adversaries straight in 
the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The key significance of Roland's story, told by writer-director Ake Sandgren 
in leisurely, anecdotal fashion with both humor and poignancy amid impeccable 
period settings, is that it reveals the bedrock importance of strong family 
life. That Roland learns, quite literally, to roll with the punches, is because 
he's been blessed with loving parents. That Fritiof is clearly not very 
ambitious and that he's full of hot air doesn't much matter when you think of 
the love he's capable of expressing for his sons and the large amount of time 
he spends with them. Sandgren is a fine director of actors, his way with young 
Salen is a wonder, but it's Skarsgard's Fritiof that fills the screen with a 
rounded portrait of a voluble, grandiose dreamer who also happens to be a very 
good father.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; TWO OPTIONS WHEN IT'S TIME TO-GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This last heat wave sent me running from the stove straight to two fun new 
to-go counters. 
</P>
<P>
 La Bottega Marino, the cute and casual daughter of Marino, one of L.A.'s more 
ancestral Italian restaurants, sits on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and 
Sweetzer. With wooden tables and chairs, a young Italian staff and thoroughly 
Euro ambience, it's a great place for a latte and a dolce, or a fast, big, 
moderately priced bowl of pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a fully equipped takeout kitchen whose options include prepared 
salads, pastas, chicken dishes and sandwiches plus cold cuts, wines, assorted 
groceries and pasta sauces by the pint. A steam table tempts one with huge 
meatballs, browned sausages, roasted chicken and three kinds of lasagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandwich rolls aren't crusty enough, but I love the hot sausage and rapini 
sub, and the cold Atomico, with spicy varieties of coppa , salami and capocolla 
. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pastas are varied and competent. I like the bright-tasting spaghetti 
puttanesca with fresh tomatoes and a penne with many plump, slippery porcini 
and shiitake mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Two not-to-be-missed items include Marino's terrific antipasti (grilled, 
sauteed and marinated vegetables) and a tiramisu that, for once, is neither 90% 
soggy ladyfingers or whipped cream, but mostly mascarpone, the world's richest 
cream cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 La Bottega's staff, while ebullient, is temporarily distracted. "It's World 
Cup service," some regulars explain as I wait for an order. Indeed, my bags are 
filled between bouts of cheering and moaning around the TV, and I leave without 
my order of lasagna or any of our sfizi di , those golden-fried arancini (rice 
balls) and crocche de patate (potato croquettes). So best wait until after July 
17 to descend on La Bottega. 
</P>
<P>
 * La Bottega Marino, 8301 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, (213) 654-1214. 
Monday-Saturday 8:30 a.m.-10 p.m., Sunday 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Wine and beer to go 
only. Visa, MasterCard and American Express accepted. Dinner for two, food 
only, $15-$38. Those Wild Oats Are Contemporary 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Oats Community Markets can be found in New Mexico, Missouri and other 
points east, but the large, health-food oriented supermarket on South Lake in 
Pasadena feels entirely like Berkeley to me. Heck, you can get a neck massage 
while you're waiting for your to-go deli order. 
</P>
<P>
 Versatile and friendly, Wild Oats caters to most contemporary food 
preferences; in the deli, this means wheat grass juice and espresso, vegan fare 
and beef, nonfat doughnuts and butter-cream cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the sandwiches and the sushi, deli food is prepared at Wild Oats' 
own off-site kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 We like a classic summer meal of cold lemon chicken and potato salad made with 
fresh dill -- with creamy, slightly overcooked rice pudding for dessert. A 
vegetarian friend and I try a flavorful lentil/walnut pate, bland seitan 
stroganoff, a juicy Greek salad and, best of all, curiously addictive tofu 
chunks in peanut sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salads can be hit or miss; a lemony orzo and bulgur is wonderful, but the 
barley and corn salad tastes mostly like dry oregano. Pasta salads are on the 
bland side. Our friendly server accurately predicts that we'll find a salad of 
grapes, melon, corn, onion, peppers and cilantro "weirdly refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
 Pea-filled vegetarian tamales are surprisingly delicious -- far better than 
their chicken counterparts. Sandwiches are a disappointment; a pita with 
cheese, sprouts and artichokes fell apart in our hands; a prosciutto sandwich 
with ordinary black olives is simply misconceived. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Wild Oats is a large, diverse supermarket, to-go meals can be 
augmented with almost anything -- Jamaican ginger beer, no-fat black sesame 
crackers, small organic peaches. Desserts are from Mani's, Perfectly Sweet and 
other local bakeries. High impulse items clustered around the deli case can 
cater to obscure impulses; I buy a bag of sea vegetable crackers just because 
they contain something called "Job's Tears."

JAZZ NOTES: MCLEAN STILL FLYING WITH THE SPIRIT OF BIRD; CHARLIE PARKER HAS 
'NEVER LEFT MY LIFE,' SAYS THE RENOWNED ALTO SAX PLAYER, WHO'S AT CATALINA NEXT 
WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jackie McLean's stomach was doing flip-flops when he entered the recording 
studio in New York back in 1951. He had reasons: The now-renowned altoist was 
just 19 and this recording session -- led by Miles Davis, and including such 
soon-to-be-giants as tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins and drummer Art Blakey -- 
was McLean's first. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean says he looked around the room and he almost froze: Sitting on a chair 
in the background, minding his own business, was his idol, the alto genius 
Charlie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the people! His presence made me even more nervous," McLean recalled 
in a telephone conversation this week from New York. "But Bird came over, took 
me into a corner, and talked to me, telling me he was there for me, that this 
was a great moment for me, and that relaxed me. Though I was still nervous, 
simply because of the recording." 
</P>
<P>
 McLean, who appears with the Cedar Walton Trio Tuesday through July 17 at 
Catalina Bar & Grill in Hollywood, is now one of jazz's most significant 
artists, a man with a tone that both caresses and sears, a style that leaps 
from lyrical be-bop phrases to angular, modernist bursts, and never stops 
swinging. But through all the curves of his career, he's maintained his 
affection for Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's never left my life," says McLean, 62. "I always have him in my spirit. I 
wear two neckstraps: one for me, one for him. I love Bird deeply." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, McLean is honoring Parker by performing portions of one of the 
altoist's most poignant solos: "Loverman." The selection was recorded by Parker 
in Los Angeles on July 29, 1946, when he was under the influence of both 
alcohol and barbiturates and on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Just weeks 
later he would begin what was to be a six-month stay at Camarillo State 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how Bird managed to create that solo in that moment," McLean 
says. "But from the very first note he uttered, it was gorgeous. I start with 
his solo, and then segue into my own things." 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are good that McLean will play more than one tribute to Parker at 
Catalina, where he'll rejoin some of his oldest compatriots: pianist Walton and 
drummer Billy Higgins. Bassist David Williams completes Walton's trio. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean first worked with Walton's trio in Italy in 1989 for just a few weeks. 
But his association with Higgins and Walton goes back almost four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I first heard Billy in Los Angeles in 1957, when I was playing at Jazz City," 
the altoist recalled of the now-defunct club that was located at Western and 
Hollywood. "I was with Art Blakey and Billy was working opposite us" in another 
band, McLean added. "He had me salivating but I couldn't let Art know. He got 
mad if you looked at other drummers," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean employed Higgins for such 1960s Blue Note albums as "Let Freedom Ring" 
and "Consequence" and used the drummer in his bands in 1966-67. Higgins, he 
said, is the epitome of what an accompanist should be. "Billy has something 
original that resides only in his heart , that you can't find anywhere else," 
McLean said. "You see the joy on his face when he plays. And he's not just a 
be-bop drummer, but a be-bop-friendly drummer. He goes beyond be-bop, as do I, 
so we're perfect together." 
</P>
<P>
 Walton, who has released more than 30 albums in his career, gets similar 
acclaim from the altoist. "He's one of the greats, a man like Herbie Hancock," 
McLean says. "And besides having a wonderful pianistic concept, he's a superb 
writer." 
</P>
<P>
 Though McLean mostly appears with his sextet, he relishes ad hoc appearances 
like this engagement with Walton, whose latest release is "Rhythm of the 
Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't have time for rehearsals," he says. "We'll get in the mood right up 
there on stage. Then the people in L.A. will get the true improvisational 
spirit of the music." 
</P>

THEATER BEAT: 'DYING FOR LAUGHS': COMEDY WHERE CHEMISTRY WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Dying for Laughs" is one of those terrific little surprises that crop up now 
and then at smaller stages -- in this case, the Santa Monica Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Sroka and John Fleming have pulled off a deceptively difficult task: 
writing a solid, urbane and very funny domestic comedy in the Neil Simon mode. 
Best of all, the premiere production features a Broadway-caliber cast blessed 
with remarkable chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 Sroka plays Marty, a nebbishy sitcom writer who hasn't found much work since 
his last series about two orthodontists. Marty's live-in girlfriend, Lee 
(Gwendolyn Coleman), urges him to reunite with his ex-partner, Robb (Vasili 
Bogazianos). The two reluctantly take a job writing for a foul-mouthed comedian 
named Stephanie Smart. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the real fun begins. Smart drags the two writers into her 
complicated personal life, including her apparent affair with her manager 
(Elisa Surmount) and her growing gambling debts to mobsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood insiders will probably appreciate the show's in-jokes and 
self-deprecating look at show biz. Yet director Chris DeCarlo rightly keeps the 
focus on the actors, who transform a clever script into a beautifully timed, 
spring-heeled little comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sroka, himself a sitcom veteran, plays a superb straight man to the 
delightfully sarcastic Bogazianos. Coleman suggests -- often deliberately -- 
Mary Tyler Moore in "The Dick Van Dyke Show" of the 1960s. And Stuart Pankin is 
devilishly hilarious in a role that puts Mrs. Doubtfire to shame. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Dying for Laughs," Santa Monica Playhouse, 1211 4th St., Santa Monica. 
Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 6:30 and 9:30 p.m.; Sundays, 5:30 p.m. Ends Aug. 
28. $19.50-$20.50. (310) 394-9779. Running time: 1 hour, 50 minutes. 'Weird 
Romance' Charms at First 
</P>
<P>
 The weirdest thing about "Weird Romance," an ambitious science-fiction musical 
at Theatre 1761 in Los Feliz, is that its two parts were ever joined in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beauty and the Beast" composer Alan Menken and librettists Alan Brennert and 
David Spencer have crafted a sly and charming computer-age fable as the first 
act. But the confused, plodding follow-up resembles nothing so much as a work 
in progress. The resulting pair of offbeat tuners really has little in common 
besides the same director, Steve Josephson, and an exuberant young cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The first story, "The Girl Who Was Plugged In," concerns a bag lady (Margo 
Upham) whose soul scientists have transferred to the body of a blond mannequin 
(Marguerite Macintyre) in order to create an instant celebrity. The book, based 
on James Tiptree Jr.'s story, tells this fairy tale with wit and sensitivity, 
vividly evoking a brave new world of outlaw corporate CEOs and humble silicone 
farmers. Menken's songs, while not stellar, fit the narrative well and are 
usually a pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spell is broken after intermission. In "Her Pilgrim Soul," Brennert 
penned an intriguing but strangely inert tale of a scientist (Christian Whelan) 
who falls in love with a laboratory-generated hologram of a woman (Macintyre) 
who died years before. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many of the scenes remain stuck in the lab, mired in scientific mumbo 
jumbo, and the music is never lively or interesting enough to provide any 
momentum. Even the performances begin to flag, too, as the actors run out of 
ways to make a five-minute idea interesting for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Weird Romance," Theatre 1761, 1761 N. Vermont, Los Feliz. Thursdays, 
Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. Ends July 30. $15. (213) 660-8587. Running 
time: 2 hours, 10 minutes. 'Red River Rats' Studies Heroism 
</P>
<P>
 "Red River Rats," at the Burbage Theatre, ponders military heroism with all 
the subtlety of a Veterans Day parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Set at a reunion for eight former Vietnam fighter pilots, Paul Gillette's 
one-act devolves into a virtual court-martial melodrama, a pale successor to 
"The Caine Mutiny" and "A Few Good Men." 
</P>
<P>
 The title characters were once flying aces shot down over North Vietnam's Red 
River and held as POWs. Now, they are middle-aged burghers who punch one 
another's pot bellies and trade nicknames like "Woo Woo" and "Easy Ed." 
"They're not exactly 'Top Gun,' " says a skeptical prostitute (Judi Diamond) 
hired for their reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bash is interrupted when Graziani (Jack Scalia), who was severely 
tortured as a POW, insists on inviting a fellow ex-pilot whom the others 
believe turned traitor during the war. What follows is a mildly involving, if 
far too preachy and morally simplistic, study of military courage. 
</P>
<P>
 Director John Pieplow has an unfortunate tendency to allow his actors, 
especially Scalia, full rein to indulge the script's most melodramatic 
excesses. This leads to some clenched-fist speechifying that undercuts any 
nuance Gillette may have intended. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing overacting is not punishable by court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Red River Rats," Burbage Theatre, 2330 Sawtelle Blvd., West Los Angeles. 
Fridays-Saturdays, 9:15 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Sept. 4. Tickets: $15.

TAKING A COLLECTIVE LOOK AT 'THE SACRED AND THE PROFANE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andres Serrano's notorious "Piss Christ" is the definitive image of "The 
Sacred and the Profane," a large group show at Jan Baum Gallery. Serrano's 
purpose -- besides the obvious one of producing a spectacular photograph -- is 
to suggest not the disparity, but the proximity of the earthly to the 
sublime.This is also the point of a cavalcade of paintings, drawings, 
sculptures, photographs and mixed-media assemblages, made by a rather random 
group of artists ranging from the canonized (Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert 
Mapplethorpe) to the rapidly up-and-coming (Monica Majoli and Dani Tull). 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the artists go the literal route -- Tim Ebner sculpts a cross out 
of cement; Lynn Aldrich crafts a piece called "Epiphany" out of a cluster of 
aluminum crutches; Laura Cooper offers a stairway to heaven, which consists of 
planks of gold-painted wood, ascending into the gallery's rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 There is indeed a lot of gold paint and gold leaf here; gold is, after all, a 
handy signifier both of celestial purity and earthly greed. But the two best 
pieces in the show are as white as snow: Tom Otterness' "Signs of the Zodiac," 
a sculptural Kamasutra enacted by miniature, blanched figures; and Jacci Den 
Hartog's "Cosmic Milk Mountain," an oozing, dripping, yet entirely antiseptic 
mess, which puts a whole new spin on abjection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan Baum Gallery, 170 S. La Brea Ave., (213) 932-0170, through July 30.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; WYNONNA JUDD NOW A WHIRLWIND AS A SOLOIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wynonna Judd, who performed Wednesday at the Blockbuster Pavilion here, seems 
to become a more gutsy performer with each show. 
</P>
<P>
 After she left the mother-daughter duo the Judds a few years ago, her 
performances were tentative at first.They had a little-girl-lost feel that 
tended to deflate her material. On stage, her attempts at bravura simply didn't 
ring true. 
</P>
<P>
 Since those days, though, she's turned into a whirlwind. On Wednesday, she 
swooped on stage with a take-charge attitude, belting out tunes, dancing, 
joking and even doing a little preaching. Her inspirational, broken-romance 
material needs the kind of authority she's exhibiting now. 
</P>
<P>
 Judd -- who will be going off the road soon to prepare for the birth of her 
baby -- is still one of the best pop singers around, which she made very clear 
throughout the show. She hardly bothers with traditional country tunes, 
preferring a pop blend that forces country to take a back seat to '40s-style 
torch singing, soul and gospel. Her performance was enhanced by the work of her 
terrific band and trio of backup singers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim McGraw, country's newest star, opened the show with a rousing set of 
rock-bottom honky-tonk. The main flaw of "Not a Moment Too Soon," his debut 
album and the year's biggest country hit, is that the echoes of such greats as 
George Jones and Merle Haggard are so loud that the real McGraw never comes 
through. On stage, McGraw has a more distinctive style, and he thoroughly 
energized some songs that seem flat and derivative on the album. DENNIS HUNT

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; THE WHO AT '30' -- POLISHED AND ROUGH ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leave it to the Who. 
</P>
<P>
 During its heyday, the British rock group relished outdoing the competition. 
With a tape of live performances that came out Tuesday, they do it again -- 
resoundingly. 
</P>
<P>
 In music-video circles, a 90-minute tape is considered long. But that's short 
compared to the Who's "30 Years of Maximum R&B Live" (MCA, $20), which is a 
whopping two hours and 35 minutes. Also, when other artists assemble a 
collection of live performances, they invariably include nothing but the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the Who. 
</P>
<P>
 This definitive collection of Who live performances, including 28 songs culled 
from 17 concerts between 1965 and 1989, includes clunkers too. Some of its '60s 
performances were a bit ragged, with lead singer Roger Daltrey often drifting 
off key. Those early performances, though, function as a gauge of comparison, 
enabling us to see how the band progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining the selections, Steve Galloway, vice president of music video 
programming for MCA Music Video, said: "We were looking for dynamic, compelling 
performances and that's what we include." The band members, who were involved 
in the selection of performances, contribute incisive commentary that's 
sprinkled throughout. As you'd expect, group leader Pete Townshend has the best 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 What's most significant about this comprehensive video, though, is that it 
isn't just a collection of performances culled from other tapes: It's 
first-rate, ranking with the best live-performance tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-seven percent of the material in this home video has never been 
commercially released before," Galloway said. "It mainly came from band 
members, other bands and documentary filmmakers. As word spread that this 
program was being produced, material came from all sorts of sources -- some we 
never expected. There was probably over 75 hours of material." 
</P>
<P>
 The tape is part of Tuesday's multimedia release, including a four-CD set and 
a laser disc, both also titled "The Who: Thirty Years of Maximum R&B Live." 
</P>
<P>
 More Music Videos 
</P>
<P>
 Though often dismissed as routine, country singer Kathy Mattea can be an 
effective balladeer, as she demonstrates on parts of her half-hour video, 
"Kathy Mattea: The Videos" (PolyGram, $10). . . . "The Original Leads of the 
Temptations" is a rather ragged, low-budget video but there's some vintage 
footage of David Ruffin and Eddie Kendrick, the best of the group's lead 
singers. These are R&B crooners who belong in the doo-wop Hall of Fame. From 
Street Gold, (800) NOW-1862, $20. . . . Aretha Franklin's post-1980 material 
isn't nearly as good as her '60s classics, but about half of the hourlong clip 
compilation "Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits (1980-1994)" is worthwhile. 
Included are "You Make Me Feel (Like a Natural Woman)," performed on a TV show 
with Bonnie Raitt and Gloria Estefan. . . . The best-selling music tape on the 
Billboard music video chart is Yanni's "Live at the Acropolis." 
</P>
<P>
 Videobits 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's instant TV movie about the Menendez brothers, "Honor Thy Father: The 
Menendez Killings," comes to video July 27, as a rental on Libra Video. Some of 
the footage edited out of the TV show is included. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stores that carry Playboy soft-core porn videos are reporting a surge of 
interest in the centerfold tape of Dian Parkinson, the former "Price Is Right" 
model suing host Bob Barker for sexual harassment. Only recently did the tape 
slip out of the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest Videos 
</P>
<P>
 If the "Wyatt Earp" movie and the new "Tombstone" video inspire you to find 
out more about the Western hero, check out "Wyatt Earp: Justice at the O.K. 
Corral," a fact-filled, 110-minute documentary narrated by Kenny Rogers, 
including some great old photos. For $20 from A&E (800) 423-1212. . . . An hour 
Disney tape on vintage Broadway musicals is due Aug. 26. Narrated by John 
Raitt, it includes numbers from classic shows plus backstage footage. . . . A 
fascinating documentary about dancer-choreographer Bill T. Jones, offering 
valuable insight into his work, focuses on "Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin / 
The Promised Land." "Bill T. Jones: Dancing to the Promised Land" sells for $30 
on VIEW, (800) 843-9843. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Grumpy Old Men" (Warner): Two grouchy retirees (Jack Lemmon and Walter 
Matthau) who've been barking at each other for more than a half century clash 
over a widow (Ann-Margret). This movie was a hit largely because, as the 
bickering neighbors, Lemmon and Matthau echo their spirited sparring in Neil 
Simon's funnier 1968 "The Odd Couple." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sugar Hill" (FoxVideo): A drama about two brothers who are kingpins in the 
Harlem drug underworld. Haunted by their drug-ravaged parents, a sensitive 
Wesley Snipes tries to get out of the dope business -- against the wishes of 
older brother Michael Wright. Basically a dark, moody character study that's 
occasionally absorbing. Beware, though, of the contrived ending. Clarence 
Williams III is superb as their addict father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Romeo Is Bleeding" (PolyGram): It takes more than a startlingly original 
character -- a vicious, sexy gangster played by Lena Olin -- to make a decent 
movie. This ambitious attempt at a '40s-style, film noir about a crooked cop 
(Gary Oldman) is erratically offbeat and ultimately unsatisfying. But it's 
worth enduring the so-so sequences to savor Olin's remarkable character. 
Annabella Sciorra and Juliette Lewis co-star. FILMS ON VIDEO

 MELTING POT: For years, the federal government has doled out extra dollars to 
help the children of migrant farm workers assimilate into their new classes and 
stay in school. But the money is drying up and new restrictions threaten to 
eliminate 5,000 of the 8,000 migrant children in Ventura County from the 
program (B1) . . . . Educators plan to limit tutoring and dropout-prevention 
counseling to the neediest students, those who have moved with their families 
within the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 FARM WOMEN: With the Medfly threatening to buzz into Ventura County, 
California Women for Agriculture meet today in Ventura to bone up on their 
public relations skills. Few city dwellers realize how the Medfly, or an 
imposed quarantine, could devastate the county's citrus industry, says Donna 
Pinkerton, president of the group's county chapter. "The Medfly would not just 
attack groves and fields, but back-yard gardens too." The group will discuss 
how to best get the message to city slickers. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW COP SHOP: After years of inaction, community-based policing is moving as 
fast as a patrol car in hot pursuit. Ventura police opened another storefront 
police station, the fifth such operation in the county (B1) . . . . Twenty 
months ago Oxnard police faced a hostile reception in the La Colonia 
neighborhood to the county's first storefront shop. Now schoolchildren drop by 
for police badge stickers or candy, Officer Alex Rangel says. "The kids who 
frequent this place make it a less threatening atmosphere and make it OK for 
adults to come by." 
</P>
<P>
 NEW GAME PLAN: After months on the defense, Ventura's Avenue Cable has 
reinstated the Fox affiliate KTTV (Channel 11). None too soon for many fans: 
The NFL season kickoff is only weeks away (B1) . . . . Avenue Cable dropped the 
network when a new law allowed TV broadcasters to charge cable companies for 
carrying their programs. Avenue officials refused to pay the fees, saying they 
didn't want to pass the costs along to customers. No word yet on any rate hike.

SOME N.Y. POLICE LABELED INVIDIOUS AS 'STREET GANGS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some groups of New York City police officers have become virtual "street 
gangs" that terrorize minority neighborhoods and traffic in drugs, an 
investigation into police corruption concluded Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-month investigation by the Mollen Commission was the most sweeping in 
23 years, since the Knapp Commission report found widespread corruption in the 
city's police precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Knapp hearings, the Mollen Commission did not find a systematic 
pattern of corruption pervading the department. Instead it said that "a new and 
more invidious form of corruption has infected parts of this city." It said the 
groups "are more akin to street gangs: small, loyal, flexible, fast-moving and 
often hard-hitting." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel recommended that an independent commission be created to keep watch 
on how the department polices itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fight against corruption can only be won if the department itself is 
committed to aggressively investigate and uproot corruption on all fronts," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations made by the five-member panel pose a problem for Mayor 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican who was elected last fall with the strong 
support of police unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani refused to say if he would back the idea of an outside panel, but 
said at a news conference that he supports "most if not all" of the 
commission's 100 recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission was formed by former Mayor David N. Dinkins after it became 
apparent that the nation's largest police force, with nearly 31,000 officers, 
was not rooting out corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 One officer, Michael Dowd, continued working for six years despite 16 
complaints that he was involved in illicit drug sales. Dowd, who was arrested 
in 1992 by officers from Suffolk County on eastern Long Island and who 
testified before the commission, is being held for sentencing on federal 
narcotics charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said Dowd's group and others operated as an organized cell with 
special radio codes to alert members when internal affairs investigators were 
in the area. Members had specific jobs when conducting their illegal raids. 
</P>
<P>
 It said the officers agreed to share the spoils of their illegal acts, but in 
most cases the money was not shared unless the other officers were present. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no honor among thieves, even if they happen to be police officers," 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report did not accuse any senior officers of knowingly ignoring specific 
cases of corruption, but said they were not eager to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 It also blamed the police officers' union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Assn., 
of encouraging a combative relationship between officers and management, and in 
some cases of tipping off officers about corruption probes. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission Chairman Milton Mollen, a former state Supreme Court judge, said 
fundamental changes must be made to avoid what appears to be a 20-year cycle of 
police corruption in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But he noted that the mentality of police officers closing ranks has been 
around for more than 100 years. "We will not be so presumptuous to assume we 
can change it overnight," he said.

AQUATIC SPECIES ON COLUMBIA FERTILE, LOVING

<TEXT>
<P>
 Only the finest, friendliest and most fertile aquatic animals were loaded into 
the shuttle Columbia on Thursday for a planned two-week laboratory mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The four Japanese red-bellied newts made the cut by beating out their peers in 
the egg-laying competition.So did the two female Japanese Medaka, a kind of 
fish, which also had to get along with their two male companions and avoid the 
looping behavior exhibited by spacefaring fish in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are looping, can you mate? In a merry-go-round? It's crazy," Japanese 
project scientist Shunji Nagaoka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia is scheduled to blast off today at 9:43 a.m. PDT with these and other 
aquatic animals aboard. Forecasters gave a 60% chance of acceptable weather, 
with thunderstorms threatening to delay the launch. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80 experiments are planned for the mission, with about 200 
scientists from around the world participating. The seven astronauts include 
Dr. Chiaki Mukai, a Tokyo heart surgeon who will become the first Japanese 
woman in space. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides newts and Medaka, Columbia's passenger list includes six goldfish, 126 
jellyfish, 144 newt eggs, 340 Medaka eggs, 180 toad eggs and six toad testes to 
fertilize those eggs, 11,200 baby sea urchins and 500 flies. An equal number of 
animals will undergo identical experiments on the ground as a control group. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists are interested in how the animals develop and behave in 
weightlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese biologists, for instance, want to see whether and how fish mate in 
weightlessness.

16 DEAD IN GEORGIA FLOODS AS RAINS PELT STATE FOR 4TH DAY; DISASTER: DRINKING 
WATER FOR 300,000 IS CUT OFF AS TREATMENT PLANTS FAIL. PEOPLE ARE RESCUED FROM 
TREES AND FARMLANDS ARE INUNDATED.

 Divers searched for bodies in murky floodwaters and rescuers plucked people 
hanging from a tree Thursday as rain fell for the fourth straight day in 
southwestern Georgia. The death toll reached 16. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300,000 people were without safe drinking water for a second day 
after floodwaters from remnants of Tropical Storm Alberto knocked out water 
treatment plants. Tens of thousands of acres of prime farmland were under 
water, while cities along the Flint River braced for a record flood. 
</P>
<P>
 Four people were reported missing, although Sumter County Coroner Lynwood 
McClung held out hope. "These creeks went way back in the woods. It's possible 
we could find these people hanging in trees, still alive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Macon, about 80 miles northeast of Americus, firefighters on a 
hook-and-ladder truck rescued three men from a tree in the raging Ocmulgee 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Albany prepared for the worst as the Flint River flowed over its 
banks and sent water rushing into streets in a low-lying area. At least 14,000 
residents were ordered to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to reinforce the levees with sandbags," Albany State 
College spokeswoman Jackie Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flint is expected to reach 44 feet -- 24 feet above flood stage -- by 
Saturday. Most Albany businesses sent employees home, and a dusk-to-dawn curfew 
was ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ocmulgee was believed to have crested at 35 feet Thursday at Macon, where 
flood stage is 18 feet. But officials could not say for sure because the river 
gauge was swept away. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150,000 people in Macon and surrounding areas have been without water 
since the treatment plant flooded Wednesday. Statewide, more than 300,000 
people were without water. The Clayton County water system, one of the biggest 
of those knocked out earlier in the week, was back up Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Water was brought to some areas by tanker trucks. At one water distribution 
site, 750 people stood in line. People were asked to restrict themselves to one 
gallon per house, but some walked away with five gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll check with some of my homebound friends to see if they could use a jug 
or two," said Mary Eva DuBose, who was carrying five empty jugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five inmates on work-release, wearing white uniforms with blue stripes, 
helped people carry jugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the hard-hit areas were advised to boil tap water before using 
it. Some people in Americus bathed in water from their swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Water covered almost 60,000 acres of peanuts, 19,000 acres of cotton and 
10,000 acres of corn. Crops could be saved if there is a break in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Peanut and cotton farmer James Short said his land "is rolling enough so that 
not a lot of it is going to stay under for more than a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the victims will face even more misery after the water recedes because 
most homeowner insurance policies do not cover flood damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to government-owned structures alone was put at $58 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Henry, assistant maintenance engineer for the state Transportation 
Department, said engineers and divers were inspecting hundreds of bridges and 
roads, most of them around Macon, Americus and Albany. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's hundreds of people working. We don't know how long this will take or 
how many bridges are closed," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising waters also have swamped towns in Florida, where officials asked 
President Clinton to declare a state of emergency in 13 counties in the 
northern part of the state. Some areas within those counties have been doused 
by more than a foot of rain since the tropical storm hit Saturday.

CAMERON MITCHELL; MULTIFACETED ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cameron Mitchell, veteran character actor perhaps best remembered for his role 
as Happy in the stage and screen versions of "Death of a Salesman," has died. 
He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell died of lung cancer Wednesday night at his home in Pacific Palisades, 
his son, Chip, and Mitchell's agent, Ronald Leif of Contemporary Artists Ltd., 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A true actor isn't tagged. He isn't a heavy, a comic or a juvenile -- he can 
assume any personality the role demands and play it convincingly. Such a man is 
Cameron Mitchell," Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper wrote in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell did assume many personalities over nearly four decades in more than 
90 films and the television series "High Chaparral." His films varied from 
Westerns to the serious "Les Miserables" in 1952 to the lighter "How to Marry a 
Millionaire" in 1953 to the role of Jigger in "Carousel" in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Other films included "What Next, Corporal Hargrove?" and "They Were 
Expendable," which marked his screen debut in 1945; also, "Homecoming," 
"Command Decision," "Okinawa," "Outcasts of Poker Flat," "Powder River," "Hell 
and High Water," "Garden of Evil," "Desiree," "Strange Lady in Town," "Love Me 
or Leave Me," "House of Bamboo," "The Tall Men" and "All Mine to Give." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, Mitchell worked mostly abroad, doing foreign-language films in 
Italy, France, Germany and Spain. He was cast in such roles as Julius Caesar, 
Harald the Viking and Cesare Borgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, a teetotaler, returned to Hollywood in 1967 to play drunken cowhand 
Buck Cannon in the NBC Western television series "High Chaparral," which ran 
for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I firmly believe that our show is the best of all the Westerns," he told The 
Times at the outset of the Arizona-based series. "There is nothing like it. 
It's not hip. I'm sick of hip -- it's old style. The realism is wonderful. It's 
like it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell became a student of Western lore and read widely on the history of 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "On location, where we do most of our shooting," he rhapsodized, "I've walked 
where Cochise actually walked the land. I've talked to the people, some of the 
real pioneers of the West. For me, this series is not just a series, it's one 
long story." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, Mitchell was in lesser films such as "Nightmare in Wax," "Buck 
and the Preacher," "The Klansmen," "The Taste of the Savage," "Viva Knievel!" 
and "The Toolbox Murders." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he no longer cared to be in movies, noting during his television 
stint: "Thank God I worked with the great ones: Gable, Cooper, Power. The 
respect, mystique and imagination are gone from the movies. The old movies were 
better. Today they're junk."  
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's fortune took a downturn along with his career, and he twice filed 
for bankruptcy, in 1965 and in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell was born in Dallastown, Pa., and grew up in Shrewsbury, Pa., the son 
of a minister. He began his career on Broadway and served as a bombardier in 
World War II before he moved to Los Angeles to work in films. 
</P>
<P>
 "He isn't handsome. He isn't one of the lucky-break boys or the overnight 
flashes," Hopper said in the early 1950s when Mitchell was getting his most 
desirable roles. "Cam has gotten there the hard way over an uphill, 
obstacle-ridden course." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son, Charles (Chip) Mitchell, the actor is survived by his 
wife, Johanna, five other children -- Fred, Camille, Jake, Jono and Katie, and 
five grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be private. The family said a public memorial service 
will be scheduled within a month.

 You can't slight City Hall -- we won't let you: A week ago, we asked readers 
to design a cover to replace the depressing black netting around the City Hall 
tower during earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Response has been light, even though we offered a "My Other Car Is a Zamboni" 
license plate frame as our grand prize. OK, we're upping the stakes -- the 
winner will now receive Dr. Cynthia Watson's videotape, "Love Potions -- A '90s 
Guide to Sexual Enhancement." And in case you're wondering, this is not a 
pre-viewed tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The contenders in our contest so far include: 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Lockert of L.A., who recommended that the black strip be spray-painted 
"the right shade of brown (to match the sky) and to give the illusion that the 
top is floating." (After all, L.A. has an airhead image to maintain). 
</P>
<P>
 David Beach of North Hollywood, who offered a sort of Groucho Marx design, 
with the armband portraying the mustache. (At least Groucho was no airhead). 
</P>
<P>
 And Al Guerrero of Hollywood, who drew a vertical covering -- one that would 
remind those affected by love potions to practice safe sex (and one that will 
never appear in this newspaper). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No damage deposit necessary: From the angle of a photo by Al Axelrod of L.A., 
it appears that a local mortuary is really hustling to fill its vacancies. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 If this place could talk. . . : An anonymous Rancho Palos Verdes reader, 
meanwhile, spotted a real estate ad for a house that seems to have had an 
exciting past (see excerpt).

 Can't kick: Walley Yip will always remember the 1994 World Cup as a missed 
opportunity -- and not for the U.S. team. For Walley Yip. 
</P>
<P>
 His name was drawn from among 2 million coupons by the Gillette Co., giving 
him a chance to win $1 million at the Rose Bowl -- if he could kick a soccer 
ball into a four-foot-wide hole from 15 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 Yip had never kicked a soccer ball before, but spent a week training with 
coaches supplied by Gillette. Alas, when the big moment came he booted the ball 
over the target.  
</P>
<P>
 And so Yip will return home to Louisiana as a non-millionaire. We sort of hope 
that, for Yip's own good, Gillette didn't give him a gift supply of razor 
blades.

 List of the Day: The Southland seems to be the psychic capital of the nation,

 L.A.'s first great horse race occurred on July 4, 1855, when Jose Andres 
Sepulveda's Black Swan -- imported from Australia -- raced for 18 miles along 
San Pedro Street against Pio Pico's California-bred Sarco. The purse: $25,000, 
in addition to 500 horses, 500 mares, 500 heifers, 500 calves and 500 sheep. 
The winner: Black Swan -- as Madam Anna will predict if you call up and ask 
her.

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; HOW TO GIVE HELPING HAND TO

 Last month, Van Nuys homeowners -- motivated by the fear that more homeless 
people would come to their neighborhood -- defeated an attempt to build a 
shelter in the area. The incident illustrates the classic dilemma facing city 
officials and residents alike. Most people want to do something about the 
escalating homeless problem, but don't want shelters in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 6,000 to 10,000 homeless people roam the San Fernando Valley's 
streets, and studies show those numbers are increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 What can the San Fernando Valley do to house its homeless? 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Smedberg, executive director, San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council: 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing you do is create more shelters. Now, that's an expensive 
proposition. Two -- it's just a thought -- but it would be nice if each 
congregation -- and there are 270 churches in the Valley -- adopted one 
homeless family. . . . What they need is not just homes and jobs but they also 
need security, a sense that someone is there to talk to them.  
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have support mechanisms, and homeless organizations or religious 
congregations could see them through their crises. . . . For the homeless who 
have substance abuse problems, this is not going to work. And those people who 
are mentally ill can't survive on their own and need to be in some kind of 
institution. . . . You almost have to look at (the homeless) as someone in the 
family that's ready to go out in the real world but needs some help." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Bernstein, planning deputy for Councilwoman Laura Chick: 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say the most important thing that the Valley needs to do is to 
coordinate the many well-meaning but underfunded efforts to house the homeless 
into a larger and more purposeful effort. By that I mean the San Fernando 
Valley needs some sort of 24-hour or year-round shelter that can also be the 
main site for other services like job training, education and mental health 
care.  
</P>
<P>
 "Until the Valley unifies its efforts, the response will continue to be 
piecemeal. That would be a shame because the San Fernando Valley homeless 
population continues to grow and spread into areas where they had not been seen 
in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Lucente, president, Studio City Residents Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a more coordinated effort to increase funding for the shelters and 
expand that infrastructure and then I think that both the businesses and 
community can somehow link up with the nonprofit agencies to direct people to 
where they need to go. I think we need more shelters but the idea of temporary 
villages is not really viable. The existing shelters have proven to be very 
effective in assisting the transitional homeless, but state and federal 
resources are needed to address those that are in a more permanent situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Nat Hutton, executive director, Trudy and Norman Louis Valley Shelter: 
</P>
<P>
 "Those agencies that are willing to do something about the problem need to be 
working with the City Council people and the politicians to come up with a 
solution. . . . We need support from everyone in taking away the negative 
connotations of being homeless. . . . I think that we need something done to 
shelter the homeless in addition to what we already have.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have between 6,000 and 10,000 people on the street in the Valley and a 
third of them are mentally disturbed. It's hard to get them off the street. 
With a little help from the educated in (the mental illness) field in doing the 
right things, we will get them off the streets and clean up our San Fernando 
Valley. We here (at the Valley Shelter) would love to see that."

POLITICAL BRIEFING: HOUSE ELDER MOORHEAD SETS OWN TERM LIMIT, OBLIGATORY OR NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TERM LIMIT: Every two years, some politician or pundit speculates that Rep. 
Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) is on the cusp of retirement. Moorhead 
invariably denies that he's ready to end a congressional tenure that spans more 
than two decades and six presidencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the longtime lawmaker, who is seeking his 12th term at the age of 72, has 
set a cap on his House career -- assuming that voters don't beat him to it. He 
told The Times that he would not serve beyond 1998 and that, should he be 
reelected in November, his next term might be his last. 
</P>
<P>
 The California congressional term limit law is scheduled to take effect in 
1998, although many lawmakers expect the Supreme Court to invalidate 
state-determined term limits for Congress before that time. In any case, 
Moorhead plans to make two more terms his outside limit no matter what, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he may not hang on that long. He expressed concern that if he announced in 
advance that he did not plan to run in 1996, he might jeopardize his coveted 
post as ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which he 
gained last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not want to be a lame duck," said Moorhead, one of the House's most 
conservative members. "And I do not want to affect any assignments. I have not 
decided beyond the fact that I'm going to absolutely follow California's law" 
-- whether it's still the law or not. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 PUBLIC PENSIONERS: Moorhead and Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) 
are among 46 House members who receive pensions from previous state and local 
government positions even as they draw their $133,640 congressional salary, 
according to Roll Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, who was a state assemblyman and senator for 14 years prior to his 
election to Congress in 1976, reported in his annual financial disclosure 
statement that he received a legislative pension of $11,679 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead, an ex-state assemblyman for six years before winning a House seat in 
1972, reported that he received a legislative pension of $2,738. After serving 
in the Army from 1942 to 1945 and in the Army Reserves until 1982, he also got 
a military pension of $8,667 in 1993. House rules cap outside income at 15% of 
the lawmakers' annual salary but permit members to accept unlimited pension 
payments or other compensation for work done prior to their election to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead said that because he still holds public office he only receives what 
amounts to interest on what he paid into the state pension system as a 
legislator. His pension will be far higher when he leaves office. And he said 
he feels he earned the military pension. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reserves play an important part in our overall national defense scheme," 
Moorhead said. "And reserves get paid virtually nothing. I made myself 
available for 40 years. I don't feel I'm unentitled to the (modest sum) I get 
for those 40 years." 
</P>

 FOREIGN FACT-FINDING: As chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on 
international operations, Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) is leading a 
delegation of eight Democrats on a 10-day trip to France, Croatia, Hungary and 
the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which left July 1, is meeting with various officials in the host 
countries. It planned to examine European arms sales policy, discuss concerns 
over the role and access of American cultural products in the French 
marketplace and review U.S. and U.N. efforts to bring peace to the former 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 "A key focus of the trip is to assess the impact of U.S. assistance in the 
political and economic development of Eastern and Central Europe and the 
integration of the region into the new European security structure," Berman 
said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman's subcommittee authorizes funding for the State Department, the United 
States Information Agency and other foreign policy agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman took along his chief aide, Gene Smith, three subcommittee staffers and 
his wife, Janis. The lawmakers in tow include Californians Julian C. Dixon and 
Lucille Roybal-Allard of Los Angeles, Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco and Anna 
Eshoo of Atherton.

 BIPARTISANSHIP?: Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) got an unlikely vote of 
confidence on national television recently from none other than House Minority 
Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). It was, however, backhanded at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," Gingrich was asked whether he could be 
objective about President Clinton's health-care reform plan after accepting 
$500,000 in campaign contributions from insurance companies, medical groups and 
others opposed to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, Gingrich replied: "Henry Waxman, a very liberal Democrat who favors a 
single-payer system, gets more money from more health PACs than anybody else in 
Congress. It doesn't affect -- seem to affect -- his behavior at all. He 
exploits his position. He is very much for a big government plan, which most of 
the people who contribute to him frankly would oppose." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's facts were not quite right. Waxman received $226,949 from health 
care providers and insurers between Jan. 1, 1991, and March 31, 1994, but nine 
other House and Senate members took in more, according to a study by the Center 
for Responsive Politics, a research organization. House Majority Leader Richard 
Gephardt (D-Mo.) led with $593,621. 
</P>
<P>
 And in one respect, at least, Waxman is hardly unique. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Medical Assn.'s political arm gives more money, on average, to 
congressional candidates who oppose the doctors' positions on key health issues 
than to backers, according to a report published in the New England Journal of 
Medicine. The study's author said this occurs because the PAC "emphasizes the 
economic concerns of physicians" more than the AMA's public health stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman responded by noting that he hasn't held a fund-raiser in several years 
and has long backed proposals to pay for campaigns with partial public funding 
and cap campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt he really means to be praising me," Waxman said of Gingrich. "It 
sounds like he was trying not to answer the question about his own actions."

COMMUNITY WATCH; ALL INTO THE POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard not to agree that kids need safe and constructive alternatives to 
trouble. But for too many children in the Los Angeles area those alternatives 
are few and far between. 
</P>
<P>
 So it surely didn't help matters recently when the Department of Parks and 
Recreation began charging admission fees at the 27 swimming pools it operates 
throughout Los Angeles County. For some communities, the fees -- $1 for 
children and $2 for adults -- meant that many economically disadvantaged 
youngsters might have to spend the long, hot summer outside the pool fence 
looking in. 
</P>
<P>
 However, thanks to the efforts of County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke 
and some generous donations, that grim scenario won't play out at 13 community 
pools where the fees were dropped this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, after six lifeguards were injured in gang-related violence at the Will 
Rogers Park pool in Watts, persuaded several corporate officers to help the 
pools. In a swift and welcome gesture, two corporations -- Shell Oil Co. and 
the Gas Co. -- and one anonymous donor stepped forward with a total of nearly 
$73,000. Also, the corporations are launching a "Save Our Pools" campaign aimed 
at raising $500,000 from businesses and foundations in order to eliminate fees 
this year at all county pools. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a demonstration of how Los Angeles must work together. Every 
contribution to the community, through cash or time, can make a big difference 
because, as the wise saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child.

COMPLEX QUESTION -- THE RIGHT CALL; INADMISSIBILITY ISSUE AIRED IN SIMPSON 
HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fourth Amendment reads, "The right of the people to be secure in their 
persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and 
seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable 
cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place 
to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." 
</P>
<P>
 A historic sentence that hangs on one of its 54 words: unreasonable. And it 
was over the interpretation of this one word that prosecutors and defense 
attorneys argued so skillfully in Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell's 
courtroom in a preliminary hearing on murder charges against O. J. Simpson. It 
is a word that lies at the center of many questions and fears about unchecked 
police power. Was the initial, warrantless entry by police into Simpson's home 
soon after they learned that his ex-wife and a friend had been murdered 
unreasonable? Was their search of the home's grounds unreasonable? Were the 
many pieces of evidence collected in that search seized illegally, in violation 
of Simpson's rights and, as a result, were they inadmissible? 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Gerald Uelmen argued eloquently that warrantless searches are 
justified in only a very few cases, when there is a clear, imminent threat. 
Those circumstances, he contended, did not apply when police arrived at 
Simpson's house hours later. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark was even more 
persuasive. Officers feared something was amiss at Simpson's home when no one 
answered the door there. Had they not entered as they did, she argued, "we 
would justifiably call them derelict in their duty."  
</P>
<P>
 Questions about the search are certain to arise again as this case unfolds. 
But for now, the lawyers and Judge Kennedy-Powell have provided a real-life 
illumination of one of the difficult, gray areas of the law. The exercise was a 
riveting and instructive mini-course in criminal law. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1819, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall noted that the 
Constitution was "intended to endure for ages to come, and . . . be adapted to 
the various crises of human affairs. . . . It would have been an unwise attempt 
to provide by immutable rules for exigencies, which, if foreseen at all, must 
have been seen dimly and can best be provided for as they occur." Wrote another 
chief justice, Charles Evans Hughes, nearly a century later, "The Constitution 
is what the judges say it is, and the judiciary is the safeguard of our liberty 
. . . under the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy-Powell fulfilled her solemn responsibility Thursday when she ruled 
that the search of Simpson's property was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment 
and that the evidence gathered was admissible at the preliminary hearing. Her 
ruling was neither unexpected nor a foregone conclusion. It was the right call.

YELTSIN NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME; G-7, MEETING IN NAPLES, SHOULD GO SLOW IN 
MAKING MOSCOW EIGHTH MEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Should the Group of Seven, the world's leading industrial nations, embrace 
Boris N. Yeltsin in a Russian bear hug as a new member? Not yet. As much as the 
Russian president wants his nation to become a full, card-carrying member of 
the elite group, it hardly qualifies as a world-class economic power. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called G-7 -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain 
and Canada -- account for only about 11% of the world's population but their 
economies generate 70% of the world's gross domestic product. Russia is not in 
their league. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian economic reforms still have a long way to go before the nation has a 
market-based economy. Back in April, the G-7 warned Moscow that the Russian 
government needed to make some tough economic decisions to rein in deficit 
spending and credit expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Yeltsin will be a commanding presence at the G-7 summit, which begins 
today in Naples, Italy. For the first time since 1991, when Russia first was 
represented at a G-7 meeting, Moscow will be a formal "participant" -- more 
than a guest but not a full member. 
</P>
<P>
 The upgraded status, in recognition of Russia's political role in the world, 
means that Yeltsin will participate in a political discussion at the final G-7 
session on Sunday. In past years, a Russian leader surfaced only at the close 
of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Support among the G-7 is expected to continue for Russia's economic reforms, 
but not in the form of money. Last year Yeltsin left the G-7 meeting in Tokyo 
with pledges of $3 billion for a privatization program. Despite some progress 
in bringing down its horrific inflation rate, Russia's economic woes persist. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia hungers for full integration into the world economic system but it 
lacks credentials. The notion of a Group of Eight remains premature.

BALTICS: FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE?; PROBLEM FOR 3 LANDS -- FOREIGN DOMINATORS AND 
DESCENDANTS IN THEIR MIDST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No issue more energizes Russia's nationalists than the perceived need to 
assure the state's protection to the 25 million or so ethnic Russians who live 
in the now independent countries of the former Soviet Union. And no issue more 
disturbs the people and governments of some of those newly independent 
countries, the three Baltic republics especially, than what to do about the 
ethnic Russians in their midst. President Clinton boldly addressed this 
controversy earlier this week when he became the first American leader to visit 
Latvia. He said the right things, and said them very well. But the cold 
reception given his moderate words indicates just how sensitive is the subject 
he raised. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of Latvia's 2.68 million people are Russians. As with the 
Russians in the other Baltic states -- there are about 390,000 in Lithuania and 
more than 500,000 in Estonia -- most came after 1940, when the Soviet Union 
forcibly annexed the three countries. To the resentful majority populations, 
the Russians are invaders who should now go home. But to most Russians who live 
there the Baltics are their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is one of those seemingly irreconcilable human problems that can so 
easily provide the spark for a political explosion. It's impossible not to 
sympathize with the Baltic peoples, who regained control over their homelands 
after half a century of foreign domination. But sympathy must also go to the 
Russians among them, many of whom have never known any other home. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has been trying to help broker a deal that would see the 
withdrawal of all Russian troops still in the Baltics in exchange for agreement 
by the three states to allow resident Russians to become citizens. That deal 
has included an offer of housing vouchers worth $25,000 for each of the 2,500 
Russian officers still in Latvia and Estonia if they go back to Russia. That 
would help with part of the problem. The larger part -- the rights that might 
be granted to the remaining Russians -- is infinitely more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 As with so many ethnic-political conflicts in Europe, this is not simply a 
local issue. Most Russians are concerned about the fate of their countrymen in 
the Baltics, and most probably think their government has an obligation to use 
force if need be to help protect them. Washington is right to use its good 
offices to try to find an acceptable solution. The challenge is getting all the 
parties to agree on just what acceptable means.

HEALTH DEBATE IN CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I can't believe that Bob Dole and the Republican Party so despise Bill Clinton 
and the Democrats, and are so wed to business, that they would deny health care 
to millions of desperate American families. I'm sure this is not what the 
people of Kansas had in mind when they sent Sen. Dole to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 As Americans, we are being asked to pay for health-care insurance through 
taxes or higher prices on the things we buy. If we pay through taxes, the poor 
pay, let's say, 2% of their income, and the wealthy can pay 2% of their income 
. . . or we can all pay more for the things we buy. On the other hand, we can 
go along the way we are, and hope for the good fairy. The Republican Party 
motto should be "Better fat dividends than healthy Americans."

 * Does "NME to Settle Fraud Case by Paying Record $362-Million Fine" (June

 * Let me offer a simple solution to the health-care dilemma. Let's start with 
what we can afford. We are already paying one of the highest rates in the 
world. Let's assume that this is the absolute maximum that the government is 
going to spend and write that into the frontispiece of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Next we can address how we are going to distribute that amount. If we want 
universal coverage, then the money for recipients not now covered must come out 
of the money being spent on present recipients. That means less for Medicare, 
Medicaid, etc. The government will simply have to cut back on the amounts that 
it presently allows for various procedures to keep the total spent below the 
mandatory cap. The recipients will have to pick up a bigger portion of their 
own medical bills. We will all share the pain of medical costs and we will all 
have an incentive to keep those costs down. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, let's have no new taxes. Let's leave private insurance and employer 
plans as they are now. It will be up to each of us to do whatever is necessary 
to supplement the amount that the government can provide within its strictly 
limited budget.

 * Re "Health Care for Women Isn't Negotiable," Column Left, June 23: 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara Boxer wants abortion to be part of our "health-care" coverage. 
Many, many people in this country strongly believe that abortion is violent, 
repulsive, unconscionable and morally abominable. Isn't it enough that we must 
live in a land that allows the murder of the unborn? Must politicians now slap 
us in the face by asking us to pay for it too? 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer's main point seems to be that by not including abortion in the 
health-care plan, this will be opening a "Pandora's box of possible 
discriminatory treatment." She thinks that if abortion is not included, other 
groups will then lobby to exclude other health-care provisions such as coverage 
for contraception, AIDS or blood transfusions. I don't know anyone opposed to 
these provisions. This is a ridiculous scare tactic. However, I do hear lots of 
people talking about not wanting to pay for other people's abortions. If 
citizens must kill their own offspring, why can't they pay for it themselves?

PRODUCT LIABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Robert J. Samuelson's commentary, "Streamlining Product-Liability 
Suits" (June 24), I agree with many of his comments. Product liability laws 
compensate the victims of defective products and deter the future manufacture 
and sale of such products.When a company acts outrageously with a "let 'em 
burn" attitude as Ford Motor Co. did in the Pinto cases, then punitive damages 
are also appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 I part company with Samuelson, however, when he advocates the so-called 
"English rule" which would require the "loser" to pay the legal fees of the 
winning attorney or make the losing attorney personally liable if the case were 
taken on contingency. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows that as a practical matter, the average person injured by a 
defective product has no recourse to the legal system except through an 
attorney who is willing to take the case on contingency. 
</P>
<P>
 The "English rule" would unfairly intimidate people with valid claims from 
taking any legal action for fear that they might lose their homes and their 
life's savings. Few attorneys would be willing to take this type of risk 
either, and the result would be that real victims of defective products would

CLINTON FUND

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Defense Fund Is Set Up to Help Pay Clintons' Legal Bills," June 29: 
</P>
<P>
 Having just tiredly driven home from my 12-hour shift as an emergency 
physician in a high-volume, high-acuity inner-city hospital, where I am paid 
$17 to $20 for every patient that I care for, I was greeted by your story that 
the President of the United States cannot afford an attorney to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
 I find it ironic that for the present Administration, the overriding problem 
in this country is the "un-affordability of health care" and "all those greedy 
doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 As Hillary Clinton's task force on health reform included not a single 
physician, may I today offer my services on the task force to look into ways to 
make legal services freely available to all Americans -- including the 
President.

 * The latest flap over the defense fund is in keeping with Clinton's arrested 
adolescent behavior. People have been picking up after him for years. Of 
course, one who wants to have credit on his income tax for used shorts needs 
the help. We need a responsible adult in the White House.

 * With the Clintons' horrific expenses, caused by a well-managed campaign of 
vitriol, against all these absurd suits thrown at them, may I ask who is paying 
the bills for Paula Jones' complaint? She, too, has to pay lawyers, and since 
she had no great amount of money, if any at all, someone is paying her bills to 
harass the Clintons. Must those people, who obviously are not Democrats, stay 
unnamed?

DWP RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eldon Cotton's letter (June 24) neglected to state one key point: The 100 
customers who account for 25% of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power's revenues are already leaving DWP's system for much cheaper rates. DWP's 
industrial rates are higher than the rates offered to industrial customers by 
Southern California Edison.These customers have long realized that natural gas 
cogeneration was a viable and inexpensive means to circumvent DWP's high-priced 
monopoly. The PUC's proposal would make this option available to more 
customers, but the biggest customers have been leaving DWP's system for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan believes that these competitive pressures require that 
DWP become dramatically more efficient. He intends to benchmark DWP against its 
competition and to relentlessly demand better service and lower costs. The City 
Council's recent audit of DWP showed that these are attainable goals, stating 
that the department could achieve annualized savings of $177 million to $223 
million per year though greater efficiencies.  
</P>
<P>
 Cotton claims that the PUC's proposal threatens the favorable rates enjoyed by 
residential customers. In our view, these rates are already imperiled due to 
years of managerial neglect. MICHAEL F. KEELEY

CHRISTIAN RIGHT IN POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Pitney Jr.'s June 30 Column Right defending religious conservatives' 
right to run for elected office totally missed the point. In support of his 
position, he distorted a recent ACLU membership recruitment letter by claiming 
we would deny a fundamentalist the right to seek election. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU absolutely defends and promotes religious freedom. Even a cursory 
glance at our docket reveals the wealth of cases in which the ACLU represents 
people who are not able to practice or follow their religious tenets. There is 
no question that religious fundamentalists have the right not only to practice 
their religion but actively to engage in the political process -- and there is 
no question that the ACLU would defend that right. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of fundamentalists, however, have taken vocal and increasingly active 
roles in undermining the traditional separation of church and state. Lately, 
there has been an alarming rise in "stealth" candidates -- fundamentalists who 
do not disclose their religious agenda -- to school boards. The board members 
then impose their religious beliefs by, among other things, censoring books, 
prohibiting sex education and mandating teaching creationism in pubic schools. 
It is the erosion of this constitutional guarantee of church/state separation 
that the ACLU seeks to prevent. 
</P>

 * As the world looks on with horror at the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, many 
Americans are watching with disbelief at the religious cleansing going on in 
American politics. To be serious about your religious beliefs and to dare to 
take them into the public arena, you risk serious belittlement and ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento) epitomized this mean-spirited attitude when 
he attacked the Christian right in a recent speech (June 24). This demonization 
seems to be in part the result of the Democrats losing election after election 
throughout the country, often at the hands of people of faith. This 
scaremongering and anti-Christian bigotry deserve to be condemned.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE SIMPSON CASE; THE 4TH AMENDMENT SURVIVES IN WORLD'S BIGGEST 
COURTROOM; THE POLICE WERE WITHIN BOUNDS; A RULING TO SUPPRESS THE EVIDENCE 
WOULD HAVE BRED PUBLIC SCORN FOR THE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEROME H. SKOLNICK, Jerome H. Skolnick is professor of jurisprudence and 
social policy at Boalt Hall, UC Berkeley's School of Law. He is the author 
(with James Fyfe) of Above the Law (Free Press, 1993), about police brutality. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell admitted the evidence in the O. J. Simpson 
suppression hearing, confirming Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark's polished 
summation, and denying a passionately argued presentation by defense attorney 
Gerald Uelmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the various television commentators, those who were defense attorneys 
seemed convinced that the cops had lied and that the judge should have 
suppressed the evidence they collected at Simpson's home before obtaining a 
search warrant. But Kennedy-Powell made the right decision -- right in her 
reasoning, right on the law and most important, right on the larger 
implications for Fourth Amendment protections. 
</P>
<P>
 The police detectives told a credible story about going to Simpson's residence 
to inform him of the death of his children's mother, but not, I think, the 
whole story. They must have suspected, at least in the back of their minds, the 
former husband and convicted batterer. But the police were convincing in their 
expectation that someone would be home at 5 a.m. and would have admitted them 
to the house. Had the cops asked to look around, they would probably have been 
given permission. ("Consent" searches are the most frequent exception to the 
Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement.) So the police must have been genuinely 
surprised to find no one answering the intercom or the phone even though lights 
were on in the main house. They had just arrived from a brutal and bloody 
double murder scene. The absence of a response from inside the Simpson house, 
along with what seemed to be blood on the door of a car parked outside, raised 
in their minds the reasonable question of whether somebody was injured or dying 
within the walled property.  
</P>
<P>
 This, the prosecution argued, constituted an "exigent circumstance," an 
emergency, one of the several important exceptions to the Fourth Amendment's 
warrant requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 In her statement Thursday, Judge Kennedy-Powell relied on People vs. Cain, a 
1989 California Court of Appeal case, where officers made a warrantless entry 
of an apartment, following a rape in the adjacent residence. The officers were 
said to have "entered the apartment with a purely benevolent motive," to see if 
there was another victim. But police always have mixed motives. They are 
law-enforcement officers as well as emergency-service workers, and, unlike 
medical personnel, are supposed to take notice of evidence of crime when they 
come across it. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether evidence should be suppressed via "the exclusionary rule" has 
generated enormous controversy over the years. Preeminent legal authorities, 
such as Benjamin Cardozo, opposed the rule. In a 1926 New York case, Judge 
Cardozo (later to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court) asked whether the 
criminal should go free "because the constable has blundered." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, police rarely, if ever, blundered. Rather, in states where the 
exclusionary rule was not in effect, police simply ignored the Fourth Amendment 
and routinely conducted illegal searches. After all, they had nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court did not impose the exclusionary rule on the states 
until 1961, and even then, in Mapp vs. Ohio -- a case in which the police had 
behaved outrageously -- the court was closely divided. But by that time, a 
majority of the states had adopted it, including California, in 1955.  
</P>
<P>
 There can be no question that the exclusionary rule has had a positive 
influence on police practices. The year before Mapp was decided, New York City 
police had applied for no warrants. Still, as conservatives have come to 
dominate the Supreme Courts of the United States and California, the rule has 
been diluted, most notably with "good faith" exceptions. I have long supported 
the exclusionary rule, but it has to be carefully administered. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that the Simpson case evidence should be suppressed, Uelmen concluded 
his summation with a quote from Justice Louis Brandeis: "Our government is the 
potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole 
people by its example." 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson suppression hearing has to be the most visible legal proceeding in 
the history of the republic, offering a powerful lesson of the fairness and 
good sense of the judiciary. Millions of people watching on television had seen 
photographs of some of the evidence; had it been suppressed in a "gray area" of 
legal doctrine, what would the public have learned from the judiciary? Not what 
law professor Uelmen had hoped -- respect for the law and the Constitution. On 
the contrary, the public would have been outraged, reigniting controversy over 
the wisdom of the exclusionary rule (which is not inscribed in the Fourth 
Amendment and could be diluted further.)  
</P>
<P>
 By not excluding the evidence, Judge Kennedy-Powell made the right decision on 
the merits. She also contributed to heightening the public's respect for the 
Constitution and the legal process.

MOTHERING ISN'T A TWO-YEAR JOB; THE TIME LIMIT ON BENEFITS IN THE CLINTON PLAN 
AMOUNTS TO CRUEL PUNISHMENT FOR BEING A NEEDY MOTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEA OLVERA STOTZER, Bea Olvera Stotzer is president of New Economics for 
Women, dedicated to creating poverty solutions through the prism of women's 
experience. She works for the City of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was growing up, my family was on welfare. I vividly remember my 
mother's sense of obligation and shame for having to accept such a "handout." 
She expected us to repay it by getting a good education and being good, 
productive citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother had no choice. Here was a woman whose husband had left her with six 
children, two of them suffering from muscular dystrophy, another from a severe 
speech impediment. I would often be pulled out of school to go to the welfare 
office and interpret for my mother. Social workers gave advice and helped her 
cope with her tremendous responsibility of raising these children in a new 
country. Back then, in the late 1960s, we were told that the welfare system was 
intended to help and strengthen families during time of need. 
</P>
<P>
 For my mother, it represented the only security she had to keep us from the 
streets, homeless and starving. We were on welfare for years. If it had been 
pulled out from under us after two years, we would never have survived. Period. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the President's proposed two-year limit on benefits is so cruel. 
Now as then, the burden of caring for children is with the mother. While our 
situation was arduous then, it is worse for millions of poor women and children 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is the anger and cynicism that now accompany welfare. It is no 
longer a promise of support but a blight on someone's record, an indictment: 
guilty of being poor and, in most people's minds, of being a cheat, leeching 
off government instead of going to work. Now comes the punishment in the new, 
so-called tough stance: two years and you're out. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, there are some who may have welfare dependency, but that's because 
this country has never found solutions to poverty by investing in the 
self-esteem of women. Let's turn the equation around. Instead of viewing these 
women as a burden, let's think of them as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
 If we looked at girls and women as a vital resource for contributing to the 
economy, and motherhood as legitimate, important work, then we might actually 
want to invest in them. If we make that intellectual leap, the questions of 
what to do in reforming welfare become very different. 
</P>
<P>
 This new equation would recognize first that men be held equally responsible 
for their children. If you are a father and you leave, the expectation that 
your wife will take care of your children is usually an economic impossibility. 
Until fathers are held equally responsible, the new so-called reforms are 
simply reconfiguring the welfare problem, not solving it. 
</P>
<P>
 If reform valued, rather than punished, women and their children, Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children would not tell mothers they have two years to 
get a job. Instead, we would ask the recipients to set their own goals and 
objectives, to set a time for when they think they will be able to get off 
welfare. With those goals in place, we would create the support services to 
ensure they achieve those goals: child care, literacy programs, parenting 
programs, training and access to the services they need. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Los Angeles, there is a program that works. When New Economics for 
Women, a local nonprofit organization, built Casa Loma, a 110-unit 
affordable-housing building in the Pico-Union neighborhood, it was with the 
conviction that our tenants would need a variety of support programs to be 
self-sufficient. So, at Casa Loma we provide child care and educational 
programs that give mothers the freedom to go to classes, work part-time and 
still be with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 This program also has shown us the pitfalls of a blanket two-year welfare 
limit. One of our model tenants recently took a job. She was thrilled to get 
it, and with it, a chance for independence. But even with all of Casa Loma's 
support systems, the burden of leaving her youngest, a 2-year-old with a 
disability, was too much for her, and she left her job. 
</P>
<P>
 Superficially, she seems to be the stereotypical welfare mother: works one 
day, quits, goes back on welfare and repeats the cycle. New Economics for Women 
doesn't see her that way. We understand her concern as a mother. We continue to 
work with her, knowing that when her child reaches school age, she will have 
different choices. She will work when she is secure that her children are not 
as dependent on her. It will take her longer than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what my mother was allowed to do. We were on welfare for as long as it 
took her to raise us, educate us and be assured that we were self-sufficient. 
Without her loving presence, I have no idea where I would be today. 
</P>
<P>
 I am eternally grateful to the United States and the state of California for 
believing in me, in my mother and in helping my brothers and sisters when we so 
desperately needed it. I would like to believe that as a law-abiding wife, 
mother and tax-paying civil servant, I am paying back the debt I owe. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not alone. Millions of us have passed through the system at one point or 
another. Millions of us are now self-sufficient and successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of unleashing our anger and anxiety on the most vulnerable mothers, we 
should resolve that in this country, all mothers are valued equally and all 
have the option: to work outside the home or not. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree that the system needs reform, but to shatter the very concept of 
motherhood without understanding the consequences is not the essence of good 
reform. It is merely pandering for political gain.

RESOLVE THE KOREAN CRISIS ON OUR TERMS; NUCLEAR WEAPONS: U.S. MUST USE A STICK 
AS WELL AS A CARROT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McCAIN, John McCain (R-Ariz.) is a member of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If history teaches us anything about influencing dictators, it is that the 
efficacy of incentives depends on the simultaneous employment of disincentives. 
To get a mule to move, you must show it the carrot and hit it with a stick at 
the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 In its opposition to North Korea's nuclear ambitions, the Clinton 
Administration's approach has been the mirror opposite of North Korea's. Our 
diplomacy employs only carrots; theirs, only sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever the Clinton Administration's carrots have failed to prevent North 
Korea's violations of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it has limited its 
choice of sticks to the withdrawal of the carrot. For instance, the 
Administration responded to North Korea's defueling of its nuclear reactor by 
canceling the offer of a third round of high-level talks. (The call for 
sanctions was limited to symbolic ones and dropped once Jimmy Carter succumbed 
to the charms of Kim Il Sung.) 
</P>
<P>
 Using sticks such as their threatened expulsion of IAEA inspectors, North 
Korea has consistently intimidated Administration diplomacy. To divert the 
United States from punishing his violations of the NPT, Kim Il Sung has raised, 
then withdrawn his stick, masking his forbearance in the disguise of a carrot. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Carter's performance as an innocent abroad in North Korea, the 
Administration is obliged to examine Kim's latest offer. The practical effect 
of the former President's public embrace of the "Great Leader" is that 
Administration efforts to secure even symbolic sanctions would fail at the 
present time. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand why President Clinton might have made a virtue of necessity by 
announcing that North Korea's offer was tempting enough to explore in a third 
round of talks. But I had hoped that North Korea's long record of broken 
promises would have restrained Administration exuberance in making the 
announcement. Forgotten was the reason we canceled our initial offer for talks 
and sought U.N. sanctions: North Korea's past diversion and reprocessing of 
nuclear fuel into enough weapons-grade plutonium for two nuclear bombs. The 
President greeted North Korea's promise to freeze its nuclear weapons program 
and refrain from expelling IAEA inspectors as if Pyongyang had offered a 
concession worth celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, North Korea has offered no real concession. The fuel rods that it 
would use to make weapons-grade plutonium cannot be used until they are less 
radioactive. The reactor cannot be refueled until the rods have cooled. North 
Korea's nuclear program is, of physical necessity, frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 As the talks proceed, force enhancements in South Korea that are necessary to 
diminish North Korea's ability to destroy Seoul with artillery fire will be 
held in abeyance, leaving Seoul a hostage to Pyongyang's future belligerence. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton now has a significant personal political stake in preventing 
the perception that the talks have failed. The Carter initiative is now the 
Clinton initiative. This political reality may cause him to suffer North Korean 
dilatory negotiating tactics even after it is apparent that Pyongyang is only 
stalling until it can develop four to six more nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Administration may attempt to obscure a failure, we will reach a 
moment when it is apparent to all. That will be when North Korea begins 
reprocessing the fuel now in cooling ponds into weapons-grade plutonium. Then 
our only means to deprive North Korea of additional nuclear weapons would be to 
destroy the reprocessing plant with air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the President will not order the strikes because he has neglected to 
reinforce our defenses sufficiently to spare Seoul from destruction by North 
Korean artillery. We will have to learn to live with North Korea's possession 
of as many as eight nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 There may yet be a way to prevent this nightmare scenario from becoming 
reality. It would require the President to employ simultaneously the carrot and 
the stick. We should open the Geneva discussions by informing the North Koreans 
that while we welcome their latest offer, we are not relying on just their good 
faith. Accordingly, we will take the precaution of deploying additional 
counterbattery artillery to our defenses north of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the North Koreans then suddenly commence the reprocessing of the fuel 
now in cooling ponds, the President's decision to exercise a military option 
will not be hindered by his concern over their current artillery advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 If we reject such an approach, the North Koreans may delay a resolution of 
this crisis until it is too late. North Korea will then have the means to 
achieve the only strategic objective we have ever been certain it wants: the 
reunification of Korea under Kim Il Sung. 
</P>
<P>
 To those who dismiss this grim prediction, I offer one historical anecdote. In 
the spring of 1950, Kim Il Sung proposed that he and the South Korean president 
hold summit talks that August, just as he has proposed to meet with the South 
Korean president later this month. In June, 1950, the North invaded South 
Korea, and the United States was dragged into a bloody war for which we were 
not prepared. If the President wants to avoid a recurrence of the tragedy, he 
must show much more resolve in his dealings with Kim Il Sung.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; GIVEAWAY: JUST SAY NO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its flap with the state retirement system, Huntington Beach sounds more 
like an advocate for its employee unions than a city facing an outrageously 
high bill for artificially inflated retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) and the city do not see 
eye to eye over the latter's interpretation of a new law that makes illegal 
most aspects of pension "spiking."A number of cities have been stung by 
retiring employees pumping up retirement benefits, Huntington Beach among them. 
</P>
<P>
 The logical thing would be to lean on the law as justification for not 
spending money that isn't there, and let the unions argue otherwise if they 
wish. But the city, even with its professed abhorrence for pension spiking, is 
appealing to the state to pay an outstanding $743,632 spiking bill and is 
making the case for other big payments without beneficiaries having to make it 
themselves. What it should do is follow the law rather than risk a showdown 
with the state system over who pays. Let the courts decide the issue if 
employees press it. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's argument that it is bound by existing contracts may win points in 
some quarters for the appearance of good faith. But the fact of the matter is, 
spiking is a deplorable practice that gives away money that isn't really there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature properly has recognized the financial irresponsibility of such 
arrangements by passing the new law, and the state system is justifiably 
concerned about administering a plan that isn't covered by the contributions of 
employees.

NEW TAKE ON 'TOMMY'; AN AWARD-WINNING VERSION OF THE WHO'S ROCK OPERA, 
REINCARNATED AS A TOURING MUSICAL, ARRIVES WEDNESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Townshend will tell you that he's mellowed. He'll say that much of the 
disgust tossed at his parents' generation by him and his '60s peers -- this is 
the man, after all, who wrote the era's definitive rebel ballad, "My 
Generation" -- was simply wrong and misguided. He'll even admit that he rather 
likes Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 But among the many demands that the Broadway-ization of his (and The Who's) 
creation, "Tommy," has made on him is the press conference. Today, instead of 
trashing guitars and tossing them out hotel windows, Townshend pounces on press 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I know they're all a part of this venture," he says by telephone from his 
New York hotel room, "but I really, really hate them. I'm sure they're 
satisfying for those who put them on, but they're an incredibly brutal way to 
deal with the stuff of 'Tommy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The "venture" of "Tommy" -- first a rock opera album by The Who, then a London 
Symphony Orchestra recording, then a Ken Russell movie, then a live concert by 
The Who with guest stars, then a musical fashioned by Townshend and director 
Des McAnuff -- has taken a new turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to "Tommy" the touring musical, arriving Wednesday at the Universal 
Amphitheatre. It marks a kind of return. The epic tale of a boy named Tommy -- 
struck deaf, dumb and blind as his family splits apart, only to become a 
superstar player at the pinball machine -- was last performed at the 
amphitheater in 1989. That concert version with The Who (Townshend with Roger 
Daltrey and John Entwistle) and guests Elton John, Patti LaBelle, Phil Collins, 
Steve Winwood and Billy Idol), prompted Townshend to think of "Tommy" for the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very comfortable with the touring world," the guitarist-composer says, 
"because rock 'n' roll is a touring music, today's traveling minstrel music. 
Perhaps the biggest problem with touring a show this size is dealing with its 
Broadway scale and shoe-horning it into smaller venues. But what you will see 
in L.A. is very much the show on Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 (Perhaps, indeed, bigger: The amphitheater production will be played on a 
specially constructed stage, which at 40 feet deep is about 12 feet deeper than 
the St. James Theatre stage in New York.) 
</P>
<P>
 The key word regarding the latest "Tommy" for Townshend and McAnuff, and for 
Steve Isaacs, who plays Tommy in the touring production and at the 
Amphitheatre, is adjustment.  
</P>
<P>
 In Townshend's case, he's noticed in his frequent visits to the tour's 
numerous stops that "the touring show has a directness and purity that helps 
the metaphor of the pinball stardom. The lights and image projections on stage 
are much more evident, lending it a surreality, a consciousness that you're 
watching a show. It seems to enforce the musical's themes of celebrity's 
power." 
</P>
<P>
 McAnuff's adjustment has been that of the veteran resident artistic director 
(which he was for more than 10 years at the La Jolla Playhouse,) overseeing a 
huge moving musical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often," McAnuff says, "the show's original director will get it ready for a 
tour, then hand it over to another director. But both (choreographer) Wayne 
(Cilento) and I have kept a very close watch on things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, I'm not sure that if we had to do it all over again, we would have 
toured this way, with 14 or so one-week stops." Ticket demand has extended the 
amphitheater stop to a month, with the show running until Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaacs, who at 24 is a year younger than the original "Tommy" recording, may 
have no prior musical theater experience, but has had plenty before the camera 
as a former MTV vee-jay and in concert with his band, American Psycho. "I'm 
working hard," he says, "at not thinking about being a rock 'n' roll singer on 
stage. I don't know where it came from, but I had this weird confidence when I 
was called up for auditions. Then, I had to do it in front of Pete Townshend. 
Singing Pete's songs for Pete was a little daunting." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling "Tommy" a "temporary distraction from my real job" as a songwriter, 
Isaacs says that ever since playing the Pinball Wizard, the musical has 
inspired him to write his own song cycle. "The influence of what The Who did 
runs very deep in me." 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate adjustment to accommodate "Tommy" has been at the amphitheater, 
which will look only vaguely familiar to venue regulars. To create proper sight 
lines for the proscenium stage, framed by TV monitors, the arena's seating has 
been reduced from 6,251 to 3,800, with a temporary acoustic wall blocking off 
the unused seats on the hall's left and right sides. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, this touring "Tommy" is as the show was originally envisioned. The 
initiating producer, Pace Theatrical Group, specializes in touring productions, 
and sealed the touring elements with Townshend months before any talk of 
Broadway surfaced. With McAnuff serving as what Townshend terms "my dramaturge" 
in La Jolla, solidifying the narrative of what had been a rock opera without 
libretto or book, the musical seemed destined for Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 There -- except for perhaps rock critics -- "Tommy" hit the pinball jackpot, 
nabbing several Tony Awards, including direction for McAnuff and score for 
Townshend. Naysayers such as The New York Times' Jon Pareles charged that 
Townshend and McAnuff's adaptation of The Who's original "turn a blast of 
spiritual yearning, confusion and rebellion into a pat on the head for nesters 
and couch potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
 McAnuff charges back: "It could be that the term rock critic is an oxymoron." 
Townshend goes further, questioning the rebellion ethic that informed "Tommy" 
circa 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want 'Tommy' to remain as a testament," he says, "that this is what I'm 
saying now, and it doesn't mean that I hate rock 'n' roll. 'Tommy' was actually 
the least angry, most well-intentioned of The Who's work. But it's time to 
admit that we were kids, that we didn't know what our parents had actually 
done, what they had done on D-Day, the horrors they had faced, and that perhaps 
the only way to deal with them was a more romantic music. The Tommy character 
on stage tries to work out the relationships in his life, something I'm 
terribly aware of as I'm about to turn 50. 
</P>

not about that anymore." Where and When

LIGHTER SIDE OF HOSTILITY; TWO ONE-ACT COMEDIES TAKE A LOOK AT RELATIONSHIPS 
AND THE BITTER FEELINGS THAT CAN COME FROM THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With relationship abuse so much in the news these days, two one-act plays 
under the umbrella title "An Evening of Hostility" approach the subject from a 
different angle. Opening at the Limelight Playhouse tonight, both plays are 
serious in intent but look at hostility with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Pearsons' dark comedy "Eight Minutes of Unpredictability," takes a look 
at the love-struck irrationality of three males. Nicole Montgomery's 
comedy-drama, "There Is No Happy Medium," regards the situation from an 
individualistic female standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 The playwrights, members of the same producing company, I-Clan Productions, 
converge each evening with their own views and their original methods of 
presenting them. Pearsons was looking for a slot in an evening of one-acts for 
his short play. Montgomery's play was on its way to a three-act form when 
Pearsons suggested a shorter version. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearsons says, "We both realized that the plays were about relationships, and 
sometimes there are some bitter feelings that come out." The umbrella title was 
born out of a desire "to evoke a certain kind of response." Their characters 
are equally hostile. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearsons describes "Eight Minutes" as surrealistic. Three men are hung up on 
the same woman. They've all made mistakes in their approaches, but don't accept 
the responsibility for the resulting problems. The characters are larger than 
life, and their justifications are outrageous. That's how Pearsons sees male 
Angst.  
</P>
<P>
 "The world I've tried to present," Pearsons says, "is based on people like me 
who grew up pretty sheltered. I went to college. My parents are still together. 
I didn't get much into the harsh things that are happening in America." 
</P>
<P>
 The comedy plays with irony a great deal. The men pretend to be angrier than 
they actually are. It's just that their feelings are hurt. "They may be 
hostile, or intimidating or trying to cause frustration in someone else. But 
it's all really based in insecurity, so they come off as ridiculous," Pearsons 
says. "All of the characters do themselves in emotionally, which is what a 
person who's in love, or truly emotionalized, does." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about men who love their women, treat them well and live happily 
ever after, Montgomery laughs loudly. "Where did they go?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 She believes there is no middle ground in the War Between Men and Women, no 
"Happy Medium." Her protagonist is in an unhappy relationship, and in 
retaliation she has an affair -- with another woman. To her, this is no 
different from his outside affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery says her play "is about a woman who's not really sure what she 
wants to do in her relationship and finds out through this experience she has. 
Everybody has their own perception of what is real and what they believe in. 
And anyway, who made up this big rule that monogamy is the way? I explore that 
as well in the story." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery feels there is very little individuality in the country these days, 
that people are all supposed to believe the same thing. When two people 
disagree about something, she thinks, there should be respect for the other's 
opinion and a will to work forward from that respect. Her play also addresses 
that subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a happy medium," she says, "one of them is going to have to give up 
their beliefs to do that. 'I guess I forgive you, but you were wrong.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery and Pearsons blame both sexes for troubled relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Both playwrights are convinced, Montgomery explains, "the big problem is that 
we communicate differently. Men change the oil in the car, and they think 
that's saying they love you. Women buy flowers and think that shows they love 
the men. It's a totally different thing, and we need to start understanding 
that more, because however it's been looked at isn't working very well." Where 
and When

THEATER REVIEW; A TRAIL WORTH EXPLORING; THANKS TO A TALENTED CAST AND AN 
INSIGHTFUL DIRECTOR, A PLAY ABOUT A POSTWAR TEXAS FAMILY SUCCEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Life in small-town America hasn't changed that much in this century. The winds 
of modern sensibility blow through them today on the small screen, but Main 
Street is still the only busy street, and the lives of the people go on as 
ignominiously as always. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why it's good to look back with a novelist or playwright, into their 
insightful memory of what yesterday was, and ask the question, "Have we learned 
anything, have we grown, are we better?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Rucker family -- in Brady Thomas' memory play, "The Chisholm Trail Went 
Through Here," about life just after World War II in the dusty flatlands of 
Texas -- looks very much like similar families of that time. Industrial 
progress and fate have almost whittled them down to their knees. Their cattle 
are gone, their hopes decaying, their dreams kept alive in simple pleasures. 
Their story is painted on a dramatic canvas as wide as West Texas in a rich, 
colorful and extremely affectionate production at the Road Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The honesty and depth of Thomas' memories are not part of a story with a 
beginning, middle and end. This is a visit with real people, doing real things, 
and being themselves with their love, their anger, their passion and lust worn 
simply on the sleeves of dresses that are a few years out of style, on boots 
that track in the mess of chickens, not that of healthy, valuable cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 James McDermott's setting doesn't forget the water stains on the wallpaper; 
Mary Jane Miller's costumes remember that stockings had seams, and that they 
were often crooked, and Stephanie Losleben's lighting knows about the sunlight 
that can bake dying earth. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is director Taylor Gilbert's insight and empathy that mostly re-creates 
the world of the Ruckers' despair, with a sense that that despair is only 
skin-deep, and underneath is a faith that, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, 
everything will be all right. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert balances the play's moods and often symphonic rhythms expertly. There 
are stretches that some directors might cut because they slow almost to an 
idle. But they are as much of moment here as the fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire cast is impeccable in its dedication to re-creating this microcosm, 
this one room that stands for a whole state, for a whole country that has lost 
its will, as Texas lost its cattle empire and, later, its oil empire. 
</P>
<P>
 David Gianopoulos, as the hard-driven younger brother whose anger is too big 
for the Ruckers' reduced circumstances, is a perfect match for Christopher 
Faville's older brother, content to paint and play the piano and keep mom 
company. Tawni Tamietti, as the 11-year-old granddaughter, and Susan Rome as 
the mother cleaning city offices while trying to educate herself, are just 
right as two generations finding each other. 
</P>
<P>
 A very truthful part of this world is Patrick James Clarke's desperately 
cheerful loser, seemingly bound to destroy everyone around him, and Eve Brent's 
deaf aunt who's not as deaf, as simple, nor as pleasant as she'd have them 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
 But the family, and the mood, is held together by Patricia Herd's luminous, 
unflappable mother, Mae Rucker. Herd plays Mae as though something unusually 
beautiful is going on behind her gentle, caring and optimistic surface, a 
graceful portrait of an indomitable matriarch who could only have lived in that 
time, and that place. Where and When

BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT; DALE KRISTIEN, KNOWN FOR HER ROLE IN 'PHANTOM,' PERFORMS 
AT THE STARLIGHT BOWL IN BURBANK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the four years-plus that she played Christine Daae, the object of the 
title character's tortured affections in the Los Angeles production of "The 
Phantom of the Opera," Dale Kristien was on stage for 2 1/2 hours each 
performance, while the masked man was visible a mere 27 minutes. Yet, she says, 
her role was considered the "second banana" part. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, however, Kristien assumes headliner status, guest starring in 
the opening concert of the Burbank Symphony Orchestra's summer pops series at 
the Starlight Bowl. Her second-act, 35-minute set includes selections from 
"Phantom," of course, along with a number of other Broadway songs. All of the 
tunes are taken from her recently released debut solo recording, "The Beauty of 
Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 Though she has performed solo at fund-raisers and joined other singers for a 
Pacific Symphony concert, the Starlight outing is Kristien's first star turn 
with an orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to do a concert to launch the album," she says, relaxing with her 
golden retriever in the cozy cottage-style home she has owned in Burbank for 
the past three years. "Living here, I knew about the Starlight Bowl. I wanted 
to start humbly -- it's not the Hollywood Bowl. So I called around and found 
out who to contact." 
</P>
<P>
 Her part of the evening is conducted by veteran musical director Larry Blank 
and staged by theatrical director David Galligan, with whom Kristien has worked 
for all 10 of the annual Los Angeles benefits for AIDS-related projects 
sponsored by Southland Theatre Artists Goodwill Event. Her twin sister, 
Pittsburgh Symphony cellist Gail Czajkowski, who plays on the album, also will 
be featured at the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being on stage in front of a full orchestra is thrilling," Kristien says. 
"The hardest thing about it, though, is remembering the words. It's never a 
problem in a play, because you have a reference point. But in a concert it's 
out of context, and you're in the same outfit." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the "Phantom" numbers -- "Think of Me," "Wishing You Were Somehow 
Here Again" and "All I Ask of You" -- will be problematic, she says with a 
laugh. To perform the last, a love duet between Christine and the Phantom's 
rival Raoul, she has recruited Bill Hutton, who originated the title role on 
Broadway in another Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, "Joseph and the Amazing 
Technicolor Dreamcoat." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the repertoire includes songs from such musicals as "Peter Pan," 
"She Loves Me," "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever," "Irene" and "The Secret 
Garden." Those songs, in turn, had made the final cut for Kristien's "The 
Beauty of Broadway" recording after Galligan whittled hundreds of possibilities 
down to 54, then teamed with Kristien, Blank and the album's executive 
producers, Neal and Sandy Davis, for the ultimate 14 selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it is the Davises who are responsible for the album's existence. As a 
director for Morris Air in Salt Lake City, Neal Davis and his wife, Sandy, had 
escorted 42 tours to Los Angeles, each including a performance of "Phantom." 
Impressed with Kristien, they approached her agent about a solo album, 
bankrolling it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw Dale, and loved her voice," Neal Davis says. "We thought that perhaps 
there was too much of a spotlight on the Phantom. She was the real workhorse -- 
1,700 performances (in Los Angeles and a previous eight-month Broadway stint). 
We'd go to the Music Center gift shop and people would constantly ask if there 
were an album out. So we met with Dale the first part of this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Recorded in March with a full orchestra, the album has been selling well 
locally, Davis says. It will soon be distributed nationally, and will be heard 
on some airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Kristien welcomed the chance to make a recording while her voice 
is in good shape. "I didn't know anything about the recording business," she 
says. "We've all been learning together." I'd like to do a second Broadway 
album. And, I'd like to do a Christmas album -- a Kristien Christmas!" 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of this month, Kristien is scheduled to appear in the musical 
"Fashion" at the Alex Theatre in Glendale. She also plans to pursue her 
newfound concert career. "This is another completely different avenue," she 
says. "I like it. Let's see how it goes." Where and When

A BROTHERLY ACT; THE WELLERS, WHO SHARE AN ENTHUSIASM FOR MUSIC, OFFER A VARIED 
LOOK AT CONTEMPORARY JAZZ.

 Remember Herman's Hermits' 1965 pop-rock ditty, "I'm Henry VIII, I Am"? The 
perky little tune, which hit No. 1 on the Billboard magazine charts that year, 
might not seem like the kind of song that would inspire a career in music, let 
alone jazz, but it worked just fine for Dick and Bob Weller. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have a summer cabin up by the St. Lawrence River in Upstate New 
York," says Dick Weller, "and this kid next door had a drum set and played 
along to the record all summer long in 1965. I got to play a couple of times, 
and that's when I decided I wanted to play drums. I could play different 
rhythms with different hands, and people said, 'Oh, he's really good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Weller had a similar reaction to the drumming of that neighbor, a youth 
named Fred Hodges. "I thought my friend's drums were really cool, and they 
seemed to be something that I had a natural ability for," he says. Now, Bob 
plays both drums and piano -- he started on the latter six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the Weller household in Syracuse, N.Y., where the brothers were born and 
raised, had a drum set. Because Bob was four years older, he got the lion's 
share of playing time, which made Dick's moments at the set that much more 
exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick is now 35, a resident of Manhattan Beach, and Bob, who lives in San 
Diego, is 39. Close to 30 years -- and thousands of performances -- later, the 
Wellers still have the enthusiasm for music that began gestating that New York 
summer. They'll bring their Weller Bros. band to Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks on 
Sunday, and to Common Grounds in Northridge on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers are big fans of each other, and have captivated many other 
listeners. Paul Solomon, owner of Common Grounds, says, "They've got a really 
strong band, and they always pack the place." 
</P>
<P>
 This Sunday and Monday, the Wellers will bring along some of their regular 
associates: saxophonist Steve Tavaglione, guitarist Larry Koonse and bassist 
Trey Henry. The brothers offer a varied look at contemporary jazz, from pieces 
that have a dancing, almost rock flavor, to more introspective, deeper pieces 
that still swing. Many of their tunes will be drawn from their 1993 CD, "Coast 
to Coast" on YUSM Records. 
</P>
<P>
 There are definite differences between the brothers' compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to write melodies that people can sing, that stick in their heads 
after the performance," Dick says. "And I like fast tempos, where the tunes 
build, get exciting and kind of end with a bang." 
</P>
<P>
 "My songs are darker, more dissonant," says Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a particular sense of satisfaction and honesty for the Wellers when 
they work together. "The base thing is our familiarity, our solidarity," says 
Bob. "We've hung together for so long . . . that what comes out in our music is 
real. It has integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wellers have traveled circuitous routes in their careers. First Bob, then 
Dick came to Southern California in the '70s, and both studied music at Cal 
State Northridge. Bob got his bachelor's degree in music there; Dick studied 
for three years and finished up at New York University. Then they both moved to 
New York in the early '80s. Work was intermittent; eventually Bob started a 
limousine company, and Dick took to playing music on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a quartet, and we'd play in Times Square, Columbus Circle," he says. 
"I made $300 to $350 a week until the police no longer allowed" those kind of 
performances, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wellers came back to California -- Bob in 1987, Dick in 1993 -- and 
they've been active here since. Bob works in San Diego as a drummer and pianist 
-- he's played with the late Joe Pass and tenor great Benny Golson -- while 
Dick has been heard in bands with saxophonist Bob Sheppard and keyboardist John 
Beasley. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick says he is also speaking for his brother when he says that music has 
provided a wonderful, if at times difficult, life. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a feeling that I get playing, when everything is clicking, of being 
lighter than air, that this is the way life was meant to be," he says. "When 
you really put out, you're supposed to get this good feeling back." Where and

BIRTH OF A CHILDREN'S AUTHOR; A ROUGH PREGNANCY AND THE DELIVERY OF A HEALTHY 
DAUGHTER LED ARTIST DEBRA FRASIER TO EXPLORE WRITING AND TO PUBLISH HER FIRST 
BOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEATHER MORGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Debra Frasier's pregnancy was anything but textbook. She endured months of 
hospital confinement and intravenous feeding after losing 35 pounds because of 
a rare disease that made her extremely nauseous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miraculously, the baby was never in danger," said Frasier, a visual artist 
who was 36 when her healthy daughter, Calla, was born in 1988. "I had lots of 
time to go inside myself. It was about as close to continuous prayer as I have 
ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 During those bedridden months, Frasier was forced to rechannel her energies 
from textile artist to writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the dark quiet of the hospital, I started receiving this very special 
gift," said Frasier about the notes she jotted down while a tiny life grew 
inside her body. 
</P>
<P>
 After Frasier gave birth, she realized her writings were a unique combination 
of her own experience mixed with a huge sigh of relief that said, "We're so 
glad you've come into our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that I wanted to try writing a children's book, but I didn't quite 
know where the process would lead me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the Day You Were Born" (Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1991), Frasier's first 
picture book, has traveled a path that the new author could not have imagined. 
It received the Parents' Choice Award in 1991 and has been produced in 
Minneapolis for children's theater. The book also has been used by teachers -- 
especially in Minnesota -- to inspire students to write their own books by 
focusing on community and world events that occurred on the day they were born. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, written and illustrated by Frasier, also changed her outlook as an 
artist. With a young daughter to care for, projects naturally took longer. 
Everything functioned at a much slower pace. With a mother's insight, patience 
had even greater meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 This "incremental learning process" is as fundamental to her artistry as the 
technical specifics of how she produces her unusual illustrations. Both aspects 
will be discussed by Frasier at the author's program at Pages Books for 
Children and Young Adults in Tarzana on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes her books so wonderful is their sensitivity and exploration of the 
world around us," said bookstore owner Darlene Daniel. "Her work functions on 
so many levels. She sets a tone of unity with the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her style really fits into what we try to bring our customers -- quality 
literature that connects the reader with lasting and significant issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "On the Day You Were Born," Frasier also will discuss her most recent 
illustrations for Kim Stafford's "We Got Here Together" (Harcourt, Brace and 
Co., 1994), a book that flows like a sequel from "On the Day You Were Born." 
With figures that explode off the page, Frasier uses a sophisticated Japanese 
tie-dye wrapping called "Shibore" to create striking images of the ocean and 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been fascinated by that point where the horizon and the sea touch 
-- the mystery of it," said Frasier, who was mesmerized by the Atlantic Ocean 
as a child growing up in Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, there are secrets that are revealed," she said. "It's learning 
to listen to those secrets and answer their questions that are the road maps 
for our life and art." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Author Debra Frasier will present a program and autograph copies of "On 
the Day You Were Born" and "We Got Here Together."

 "Matthiessen has tremendous insight into both the natural world and the human 
mind and he blends them so well." "Killing Mister Watson," an excerpt 
</P>
<P>
 Sea birds are aloft again, a tattered few. The white terns look dirtied in the 
somber light and they fly stiffly, feeling out an element they no longer trust. 
Unable to locate the storm-lost minnows, they wander the thick waters with sad 
muted cries, hunting signs and seamarks that might return them to the order of 
the world.  
</P>
<P>
 In the hurricane's wake, the labyrinthine coast where the Everglades deltas 
meet the Gulf of Mexico lies broken, stunned, flattened to mud by the wild 
tread of God. Day after day, a gray and brooding wind nags at the mangroves, 
hurrying the unruly tides that hunt through the broken islands and twist far 
back into the creeks, leaving behind brown spume and matted salt grass, 
driftwood. On the bay shores and down the coastal rivers, a far gray sun picks 
up dead glints from windrows of rotted mullet, heaped a foot high.  
</P>
<P>
 From the island settlement on the old Indian mound called Chokoloskee, a 
baleful and uneasy sky out toward the Gulf looks ragged as a ghost, unsettled, 
wandering. The sky is low, withholding rain, and vultures on black-fingered 
wings tilt back and forth over the broken trees. At the channel edge, where 
docks and pilings, stove-in boats, uprooted shacks litter the shore, odd pieces 
torn away from their old places have been strained from the flood by the limbs 
over the eater. A clothesline flutters in the trees; thatched roofs are spun 
onto their poles like old straw brooms; frame buildings sag. In the dank air a 
sharp fish stink is infused with corruption of dead animals and blackened 
vegetables, of excrement in overflowing pits from which shack privies have been 
washed away. Pots, kettles, crockery, a butter churn, tin tubs, buckets, 
salt-slimed boots, soaked horsehair mattresses, and ravished dolls are strewn 
across the pale killed ground.  
</P>
<P>
 A lone gull picks disconsolate at the softening mullet along shore, a dog 
barks without heart at so much silence.  
</P>
<P>
 A figure in mud-fringed calico, calling a child, stoops to retrieve a Bible, 
then wipes wet grime from the Good Book with pale dulled fingers. She 
straightens, turning slowly, staring toward the south. From the wall of 
mangroves far off down the bay, the drum of a boat engine comes and goes, then 
comes again, a little louder.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, Lord," she whispers, half-aloud. "Oh no, please no, sweet Jesus."

CASTING LIGHT ON A NEW LIFE; THE UPBEAT ABSTRACT PAINTINGS BY HIDEO NODA BELIE 
THE DARK DAYS BEHIND HIM. HE SAYS, 'WHEN I PAINT, I FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hideo Noda's art doesn't really tell his story. 
</P>
<P>
 The bright, colorful, cheery paintings of flowers and trees set against ocean 
and sky in his exhibit at New Canyon Gallery don't betray a hint of the turmoil 
of his early years. There's no sense of the two years he spent doing hard labor 
in a prisoner-of-war camp in Siberia after World War II. They don't reflect 
life in late-1940s Japan, when he went back to his home on an island near 
Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a POW, you're just like a slave," said Noda, 71. 
</P>
<P>
 In snow up to his knees, he was forced to build houses and work in the mines 
and on the railroad. "Everything in my life was so dark," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his art, as demonstrated in the exhibit "Hideo Noda: Abstract Japanese 
Paintings," he tries "to get another side, which is light. Most of it is 
imagination. You have to have imagination," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noda was born to Japanese parents in Phoenix, Ariz., in 1922. When he was 9 
years old, his father died in a car accident. After that, Noda's mother moved 
with her six children to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1943, Noda was drafted into the Japanese army and sent to fight in China. 
Two years later, as the war was coming to an end, his unit was captured in 
Manchuria by the Russian army. After his release in 1947, Noda returned to his 
home near Hiroshima and began to paint, something he had enjoyed doing since he 
was a grammar school student. He remembers "only a concrete building here and 
there" on devastated Hiroshima, with nothing in-between, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1951, Noda moved back to the United States, going to work as a "house boy" 
in San Francisco. He also took painting classes at San Francisco City College. 
In 1955, he moved to Los Angeles and got a job washing dishes at Lawry's Prime 
Rib restaurant. A year later he became a landscape gardener. 
</P>
<P>
 Noda, a Westside resident, still tends gardens four days a week. The other 
three days he paints. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get to his age and lose a little drive. He hasn't seemed to lose any 
drive," said Howard Craig, president of New Canyon Gallery and a member of the 
committee that juried Noda into the gallery cooperative and gave him the 
opportunity to do a show. "We liked his enthusiasm, his style, and we were 
really impressed by the fact that he had been painting for 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many artists who live in temperate climates enjoy painting outdoors, 
Noda takes that activity to unusual heights. He hauls his canvases and paint up 
onto the roof of his house by ladder and works there. The splashy, splattering 
painting techniques he uses in his works would mess up the studio, he said. "I 
don't have the space in the back yard. And I have a dog," he said. Besides, 
"the paintings dry much faster on the roof." 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing the abstract backgrounds of his compositions on the roof, he 
brings the canvases into his studio to paint the detail of the foregrounds. He 
works on five to 10 canvases at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 Noda has 500 paintings in storage, many of them done in styles significantly 
different from the 20 hanging in the gallery. One can get a sense of his 
diverse painting abilities from two books of color photographs of his work that 
accompany the show, the first public display of his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was going to keep them all," he said. "They're like your 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to begin showing his paintings when a landscaping client bought one 
and encouraged him to share his work with others. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not the potential for sales that motivates Noda to continue to 
paint. It is the sheer joy of doing it. "When I paint, I forget about 
everything," he said. Where and When

COVER STORY; CAMPING; STARRY NIGHTS, SANDY BEACHES, RUSHING STREAMS AND MILES 
OF HIKING TRAILS. THEY'RE YOURS FOR THE TAKING -- AND LESS THAN AN HOUR'S DRIVE 
FROM THE VALLEY.

<P>
 If earthquake repairs, recession woes or a staggering workload leave you short 
on vacation time or money (or both), you may not be able to book a flight to 
Hawaii -- or even spend a week at Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can get away from it all by pitching a tent in the mountains and 
forests surrounding the San Fernando Valley. Of course, you'll have to forgo 
some modern conveniences -- such as watching movie videos, sleeping in a soft 
bed and waking to Mr. Coffee. But you may find the joys of wildlife watching, 
stargazing and cooking over a campfire more than offset whatever creature 
comforts you surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than an hour's drive away, many local campgrounds are in settings 
spectacular enough to rival the most beautiful national park. They are cheap -- 
most run from $5 to $16 a night. Near sandy beaches, fish-stocked streams and 
miles of hiking or biking trails, they offer plenty to do. Or if relaxation is 
what you are after, you can do plenty of nothing, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Camping is a very inexpensive way for families to break up their day-to-day 
routine and spend quality time together, away from television and other 
distractions," said Brad Childs, executive director of the Wilderness Institute 
and a former national park ranger. "It's healthy, you get some exercise, you 
learn new things about plants and the environment, and you feel like you've 
accomplished something." 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take much to gear up for local outings. If you are new at camping 
and do not want to spend a lot of money on supplies, you can rent everything 
from stoves to sleeping bags at such outdoor outfitters as Adventure 16 in 
Tarzana or REI in Northridge. Tents start at about $12 for one night, $2 to $4 
per additional night; sleeping bags rent for about $8 for one night, $2 to $3 
per additional night. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few places you can try your tent-raising, campfire-building, 
mosquito-whacking skills. You'll be there in no time. ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST 
</P>
<P>
 The 654,000-acre Angeles National Forest offers more than 100 developed 
campgrounds, from secluded forest sites high in the San Gabriel Mountains to 
sunny stream-side locations. Available on a first-come, first-served basis, 
most forest campgrounds are remote and somewhat primitive. Some, but not all, 
include pit toilets, picnic tables, stoves or grills and piped drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't need showers or flush toilets, you can visit some really 
beautiful sites that are not crowded at all," Childs said. "In the higher 
elevations, with the pine smells and the fresh air, you feel like you are miles 
and miles away. It feels like a real vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 Campers should be sure to fill their gas tanks and bring ample food and 
supplies, as few services are available throughout the forest. Warm extra 
clothing is also a good idea. Night temperatures in the San Gabriels can drop 
below 40 degrees. "It can be a nice warm day in the high country," said Terry 
Ellison, district ranger for the Arroyo Seco District, "and a thunderstorm will 
suddenly come through, and you'll get drenched." 
</P>
<P>
 For campers seeking solitude, silence and scenery, Ellison recommends Buckhorn 
Campground, which at 6,300 feet is similar in terrain to the High Sierra. 
"Buckhorn is deep in the woods with tall cedars and pines, a year-round stream 
lined with ferns and abundant wildlife," he said. A two-mile hike from the 
campground leads to fishing and swimming in Littlerock Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in Angeles National Forest, Monte Cristo Campground is an easily 
accessible, popular destination with many flatlanders, according to Julie 
Molzahn, recreation officer for the Tujunga Ranger District. "The camp is under 
the sycamores, near fishing holes, and a creek runs through it," she said. "And 
it stays cool in summer because it's at a high (3,600-foot) elevation." SANTA 
MONICA MOUNTAINS 
</P>
<P>
 If your idea of roughing it is carrying your own luggage into a room at the 
Hilton, camping in Angeles Forest may seem too rugged. You may prefer to sleep 
under the stars and enjoy such civilized touches as hot showers and toilets 
that flush in the nearby Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside is that these fully developed campgrounds, especially those along 
the ocean, are often mobbed. "Because we are so close to Los Angeles, we book 
up every weekend," a state parks spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two popular campgrounds in the Santa Monicas are Canyon at Leo Carrillo State 
Beach and Big Sycamore Canyon at Point Mugu State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few miles apart on Pacific Coast Highway, both offer campsites shaded 
by giant sycamores and coast live oaks, short trails to the beach and the 
chance to be lulled to sleep by the sound of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two, Big Sycamore Canyon, with more than 70 miles of trails 
crisscrossing the Point Mugu wilderness area, feels more rustic. But if 
convenience is what you're after, Canyon -- with its own general store stocking 
groceries, beach gear, ice and firewood -- can't be beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Also nestled in the shadows of the Santa Monicas, but slightly less well-known 
(and less crowded) than the beach camps, is the campground at Malibu Creek 
State Park, which includes miles of trails, year-round creeks and Century Lake 
a short hike away. 
</P>
<P>
 According to outdoorsman Rob Anderson, manager of Adventure 16, the 
70,000-acre wilderness area is one of the best local places to pitch a tent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only about a half-hour away, but it feels fairly secluded," he said. "I 
have seen everything from deer to rattlesnake there." 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu Creek also offers ample opportunities for outdoor recreation, Childs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can mountain bike, rock climb, swim, wade or hike on fairly flat trails. 
There are nearby shady oak woodlands and streams. The best part is all the 
wildlife you see during the quiet times at dusk and dawn." Packing Checklist 
</P>
<P>
 You don't need much to gear up for a local camping trip. Of course, you'll 
bring a tent, sleeping bag, clothing, hiking boots, toiletries, cooking 
equipment and food. But you also will want to pack these essentials:

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: FURNISHING A DEAL; ALTHOUGH ITEMS FOR THE HOME ARE 
ADVERTISED ON SALE, SANTA MONICA STORE MAY HAVE A BETTER PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The impact of color print ads or television commercials can be impressive, but 
before you bite, check around. Items that are ad vertised "on sale" at major 
stores may be selling regularly for far less somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 This proved true at Mark Friedman Furniture in Santa Monica. A pickled-pine 
entertainment center / armoire that a department store was offering on special 
for $699.99 was priced at Mark Friedman for $499. That $200 savings could buy a 
three-way recliner by Douglas that lists for $295. 
</P>
<P>
 The hodgepodge of home furnishings offered at the store reflects that this is 
a true family operation, complete with the grandchildren of owners Mae and Mark 
Friedman playing among the inventory. There are no formal room settings and no 
posh accessories to enhance the product, just excellent prices on case goods 
and upholstered pieces that make it easy to ignore the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot sellers are slipcovered sofas, in this case upholstered sofas that come 
with a slipcover. These range in price from $595 for a Linda Manufacturing Co. 
sofa to $1,195 for a product from Pacer. Other manufacturers of the slipcovered 
sofas are Designer Decor, Jonathan Lewis and American West. All have hardwood 
frames, and they vary in design. 
</P>
<P>
 Sofas without slipcovers are also well-priced. A camelback design by 
Flexsteel, measuring 86 inches, with a solid steel frame and a lifetime 
warranty, came in a cheery garden print and was a wonderful deal at $495, 
considering the list price of $1,100. 
</P>
<P>
 A large Deco-styled armchair for $295 ($599 retail) makes a definite 
statement. From the Pulaski Accentrics line, a Queen Anne-style chair with a 
whitewashed frame and plaid upholstery would fit a French provincial decor. 
This was also $295, as opposed to a retail price of $599. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find a Queen Anne-style dining set by Stanley that may be the best buy 
in the store. Made of whitewashed elm, it includes a dining table that extends 
to 100 inches, six side chairs, two armchairs and a stunning china cabinet with 
all the accessories -- top lights, mirrored back and beveled-glass doors. This 
sells for $9,500 or more at most stores and would be $4,499 on order at 
Friedman. But the one-and-only floor model was priced at $4,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to the main store is the mattress annex, with good buys on beds and 
mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friedmans have been in the furniture business for more than 26 years, 12 
years at their present location. Basically, this is a catalogue operation where 
customers may order from many catalogues representing nearly 100 manufacturers. 
But it's the floor models that are the super buys. Where to Shop

SKY WATCH; A COSMIC COLLISION; BEGINNING JULY 16, PIECES OF COMET 
SHOEMAKER-LEVY 9 WILL SLAM INTO JUPITER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Astronomers are calling it the most cataclysmic cosmic event of this century 
-- more unusual even than the appearance of Halley's Comet. And you don't have 
to leave the San Fernando Valley to catch it. 
</P>
<P>
 For about a week beginning July 16, the scattered pieces of Comet 
Shoemaker-Levy 9 will slam into Jupiter with more force than dozens of atomic 
bombs. Although the collisions will occur on the dark side of the solar 
system's largest planet, some scientists expect the impacts to briefly affect 
Jupiter's appearance, as seen from Earth. THE HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
 Comets are essentially dirty icebergs traveling through space, heating up as 
they pass close to the sun -- an effect that releases comet dust into tails 
that are stretched out by the solar wind. Most comets are believed to originate 
from a cloud of comets at the edge of the solar system and to somehow get 
knocked into orbit around the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Jupiter is a ball of hydrogen and helium gas about 1,000 times more massive 
than Earth. It rotates about every 10 hours, making it the fastest spinning 
planet in the solar system. Jupiter's Great Red Spot, which could engulf two 
Earths, is a cyclonic storm that has been raging for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 8, 1992, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 passed close enough to Jupiter for 
gravity to break it into a string of 21 fragments, most with comet tails of 
their own. By July 16 of this year, the distance between these fragments could 
span more than 4 million miles, with particles ranging in size from that of the 
Sherman Oaks Fashion Square to the city of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 The comet was discovered by observers at Palomar Observatory near San Diego on 
March 25, 1993. Like all comets, it was named after those who spotted it first 
-- professional astronomers Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker and amateur astronomer 
David Levy. The "9" signifies that this is the ninth comet discovered by this 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis of the comet's orbit revealed two startling facts: that it was the 
first known comet to orbit a planet (Jupiter) rather than the sun, and that the 
comet's icy fragments will collide with Jupiter during the week of July 16 to 
22. THE IMPACTS 
</P>
<P>
 Never before have earthbound stargazers had the opportunity to witness the 
effects of a comet smashing into a planet. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the spacecraft Galileo will be positioned perfectly to send us 
photos of the comet shelling the planet's atmosphere, scientists have no clear 
idea of what we will see from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most dramatic scenario, the exploding fragments could illuminate the 
Jovian moons caught in the shadow of Jupiter. The most likely candidate is 
Europa, which will be behind Jupiter when fragment K -- the particles are given 
letter names -- slams into the planet on July 19. Other scientists predict that 
the impacts will briefly illuminate Jupiter's faint ring. 
</P>
<P>
 A more likely effect will be atmospheric turbulence on Jupiter. Some 
scientists expect the impacts to briefly disrupt the planet's cloud belt, 
perhaps creating miniature spots south of its Equator. Another prediction is 
that shock waves could ripple across the entire planet. 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically, the event could also be a dud: Some scientists predict that 
Jupiter's atmosphere will quietly swallow up the comets like a whale scooping 
up shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
 Although scientists may not agree on the outcome, there are three things on 
which they can agree: First, earthbound observers will have to wait at least 30 
minutes after each collision before the impact site rotates into view. Next, 
observers shouldn't expect to see a dramatic explosion, but rather subtle 
changes in the appearance of the planet. And finally, it will take knowledge of 
how Jupiter looks now to appreciate the changes. HOW TO PREPARE 
</P>
<P>
 Get to know Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheapest way is to buy the July issue of "Sky & Telescope" magazine at a 
newsstand, or a $5 guide to the comet / Jupiter impact published by the 
nonprofit Planetary Society in Pasadena. Familiarize yourself with Jupiter's 
cloud belts in the southern hemisphere (about 40 to 50 degrees south latitude), 
where the impacts will occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Then head to Griffith Observatory in Griffith Park to view the action. 
</P>
<P>
 A more expensive option -- but without the long lines expected at the 
observatory -- is to use your own telescope to study Jupiter in the weeks 
before and during the impact. Fortunately, Jupiter is bright enough to be seen 
from your back yard. Turn off indoor lights and take about 30 minutes to let 
your eyes adjust. The darker the site, the better the view through the 
telescope. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are going to purchase a telescope, get the right one. It should have at 
least a four-inch aperture. The bigger the aperture, the more you will see. 
Consult a local telescope store and avoid toy-store varieties. Do not, however, 
buy a telescope just for the comet / Jupiter impact: If it's a dud, you'll feel 
ripped off. Although this is a once-in-a-lifetime event, a telescope is a 
purchase best made for a lifetime of stargazing. Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: Griffith Observatory's comet collision activities. Free to the public, 
the observatory's 12-inch telescope will be focused on Jupiter throughout the 
week of July 16-22, with a live video feed of Jupiter from the telescope 
available for viewing on a screen inside the museum. Additional telescopes will 
be on the lawn July 16. During this week, the observatory's 7:30 p.m. 
planetarium show will feature a 10-minute segment on the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: 2800 E. Observatory Road, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Observatory museum is open 12:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Telescope 
viewing dusk to 9:45 p.m., except for July 16, 20 and 21, when it will be open 
until midnight. Planetarium show times are 1:30, 3 and 7:30 p.m. Monday through 
Friday; 1:30, 3, 4:30 and 7:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: Observatory entry is free. Planetarium show is $4 for adults, $3 
seniors 65 and older, $2 children 5-12. Children under 5 are admitted only to 
the 1:30 p.m. show on weekends, for free with a paid adult admission. 
</P>

RELUCTANT NOVICE: A 'LOOK AT ME' KIND OF DANCE; AFTER SOME AWKWARDNESS, A 
WRITER SURRENDERS TO THE FLAMENCO RHYTHM AND GAINS APPRECIATION AND CONFIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When a Spanish guitarist plucks the strings of his instrument, the sound 
reaches into a place deep inside me. Fans, or aficionados , as they are known 
in Spanish -- know that the flutter of those strings can profoundly inspire the 
soul. It's nearly impossible to imagine further transcending that deep 
emotional plane -- unless you've seen it enhanced by flamenco dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Highly trained heels impact wooden floors with excruciating precision. Female 
dancers gracefully manipulate their flouncy skirts, rapidly click their heels 
and toss their be-maned heads with alluring abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 Male dancers dazzle spectators with intricate footwork and captivate them with 
their powerful, beguiling demeanor and tiny beads of sweat on their arched 
eyebrows. As their fingertips brush their svelte frames, dancers communicate a 
powerful sensuality without evoking the overtness of, say, Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so I'm passionate about it. It all started when I saw my first flamenco 
performance in Spain in 1992. Dog-tired after a long day of sightseeing, I 
found myself moved beyond belief by the guitarist's music, the singer's sad 
tales and the dancer's graceful movements. I was immediately hooked. When I 
returned, I quickly became a regular at our local bar, where professional 
flamenco dancers perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys resident Robert Amaral is an accomplished flamenco dancer 
(considerable hunk appeal notwithstanding). He offers classes for beginning 
(and more advanced) students. Although I could never perform in front of an 
audience, the dancing had to be more fun than the wind-up-doll mechanics of 
aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
 I show up for an entry-level class, since no reservations are required. 
Walking into the room and seeing a clique of castanets-carrying coquettes with 
ruffled skirts initially intimidates me, but most of them turn out to be fairly 
friendly. Instinctively, I bond with a couple of other newcomers -- 
inexperience loves company. Decked out for the class in an orange T-shirt, full 
navy skirt and an old pair of tap shoes, I look like a cross between the Great 
Pumpkin and an airline stewardess headed for the Mrs. America talent 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaral puts on the record and starts some simple footwork exercises. 
Surprisingly, there is no guitar in the drill music, just the click-clack 
rhythm required to keep footwork steady. I quickly realize that wearing tap 
shoes has its down side: My mistakes are louder than everyone else's. Goof-ups 
feel more tolerable with Moe and Curly, the other two Stooges -- er, newcomers 
-- at my side. Unlike the snooty attitude that prevails at my local health 
club, the mood here is more fun, and not as competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 When I finally get the footwork (mostly) down, Amaral says, "Now arms." At 
first, trying to do both is a little like trying to pat your head and rub your 
belly at the same time. My efforts yield a mix of failures and successes. Best 
of all, I am sweating, therefore obviously burning calories and having fun 
doing it. (StairMaster, take a hike.) 
</P>
<P>
 Into the first hour, Amaral introduces a clap called the sordas. I learned 
this in Spain, a method of cupping the hand for a more hollow tone. Smugly, I 
correct Moe when she attempts basic applause. Gently, Amaral corrects me! I 
have the sound right but not the finger position. I am beginning to learn there 
is more form to flamenco than the virtually seamless performances often 
suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as my hands are tiring, we proceed to body movements. This comes easier 
for me, having taken ballet. Unfortunately, it is the shortest segment in the 
90-minute session. Attitude and posturing seem to play a big part in pulling 
off this aspect of flamenco. I pretend I am a tall, willowy, sultry brunette, 
thinking that the official skirt (and possibly liposuction) would definitely 
enhance my mirror image. 
</P>
<P>
 Vueltas que bradas -- broken turns -- follow the body movements. Moe feigns a 
few attempts while Curly and I find ourselves the odd Stooges out. I'm thinking 
about ducking out the back door when I find myself actually getting it almost 
right. If I go with the music, immerse myself in the rhythm and don't dwell 
incessantly on the counts, it seems to help. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, I expected to feel more frustrated over my ineptness during the 
class. Now, I must admit that I'm thinking of taking a few more. The sheer 
pleasure of flamenco's novelty and sensuality appeal to a part of me that vows 
to peel myself off the couch. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to note, however, that flamenco isn't for everyone. It requires 
confidence -- it's a very "look at me" kind of dance. The anonymity afforded in 
aerobics, square dancing or other group activities is not a part of the 
flamenco tradition. Its independent nature seems to lure folks who are 
definitely part ham. Much as I hate to admit it, I guess a side of me must fit 
that bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Until I get in the groove, you can find me hiding behind the castanets 
coquettes. Where and When

LIFESTYLE; NOT JUST BUZZ WORDS; BEEKEEPING IS MORE A HOBBY THAN A BUSINESS FOR 
MANY. SOME SAY IT'S RELAXING AND MAY EVEN CURE DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Charles Owens, a high school biology teacher, was just 51 when his doctor gave 
him the tragic news. His incessant shaking was due to amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. He could count on living just 
six months to two years more. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens' son, a large-scale beekeeper in Northern California, brought his father 
a swarm of bees to tend, to help keep him busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of my biology background, I've always had an interest in natural 
science," said Charles Owens, now 73. "I became fascinated by the bees and how 
they work. About the time they were supposed to be burying me, I was getting 
stronger. They've been a tremendous therapeutic value to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Owens, who lives in North Hills, believes that not only the work involved in 
caring for bees improved his condition, but their stings helped as well. "It 
may have something to do with the immune system's response to a sting. All I 
know is, I've had thousands of stings over the years, and I'm still here." 
</P>
<P>
 He has 25 colonies of bees on his half-acre, each one home to 60,000 to 
100,000 bees. As much as 250 pounds of honey can be produced per colony, and so 
far, this has been a good season for beekeeping. "At my age, I'm having trouble 
lugging the 65-pound containers full of honey," Owens says. 
</P>
<P>
 Beekeeping might be a misnomer, because bees are highly self-sufficient. The 
combined distance that the bees in a colony travel to produce a pound of honey 
is more than the distance around the world. During a San Fernando Valley 
spring, they are able to collect nectar from a wide variety of blossoms, giving 
locally produced honey a unique taste and scent. 
</P>
<P>
 It's estimated that in the Valley, there are 800 to 900 people tending bee 
colonies, many of which are illegal. Beekeepers are required to register with 
the county each year and pay $10 for a license. They must also check to see if 
any ordinances outlaw beekeeping in their city, and if the property where they 
will keep their bees is zoned for agricultural use. 
</P>
<P>
 Most keepers take to bees because they like them, not because they're thinking 
of making a living selling honey. "There's a great deal of regulation 
surrounding bees," says Simon Scharf, a Tarzana beekeeper. "Most people buy the 
cheap honey that's imported from other countries, and there's not much of an 
appreciation for the bees that make the honey." 
</P>
<P>
 Scharf, who learned about beekeeping from his grandfather, began a business 
keeping bees and removing swarms while working as a paramedic. "Many times I 
would be called to treat someone who had been stung from a group of bees that 
had swarmed. I'd tell them I could get rid of the hive, and I'd come back when 
I was off duty and remove (the bees.)" 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually left his job to form his own company, Bee Professional, in which 
he removes wild hives from residences and office buildings throughout the 
Valley. Scharf also tends to 20 hives of his own. "It's very calming to watch 
bees work; they're so organized, you can study them for hours." 
</P>
<P>
 In a remote canyon in the Antelope Valley, Jerry Harmon finds the time he 
spends with his 10 colonies very valuable. "Not long after I got into this, I 
got a divorce, and the days I'd tend to the hives kept my sanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Harmon of Lancaster first became interested in bees when one stung him in the 
arm as a child. "I was fascinated by the morbid side of bees, their stingers; 
then I began to learn and build an appreciation for them." 
</P>
<P>
 An appliance repairman, Harmon spends at least one afternoon a week checking 
his hives, collecting honey and watching his bees. He gives the honey he 
harvests as gifts to friends and family, and he eats a peanut butter and honey 
sandwich for lunch each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmon takes exception to the public's image of the bee as aggressive. "They 
only sting when threatened, and after stinging they die, so they've got to be 
pretty sure you pose a threat to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the biggest worry among local beekeepers has been the sagging 
interest in their hobby as the region becomes less agriculturally oriented. But 
that concern has been replaced by another: Finding a way to stop the 
encroaching Africanized "killer bees" before they infest local colonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to think all bees are the Africanized bees, and hopefully 
there won't be mobs coming out and destroying every hive they see," Harmon 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll need to watch our hives more often," says Scharf. "The Africanized bee 
is very aggressive and is able to take over a hive." 
</P>
<P>
 But some believe a solution to the Africanized bee problem will be found. 
"There are so many advances in genetics, I think they'll be able to breed out 
the aggressive instinct in these bees," Owens says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to hurt the back-yard beekeeper; it's going to affect the big 
commercial farms, and they'll be leading the way to find a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about how one gets involved in beekeeping, Owens advises: "Before 
jumping into it, talk to some beekeepers and get a good book on the subject. 
Learn what's involved, how bees work, and the difference between worker bees, 
drones and queens." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting started as a beekeeper means first finding a place to keep your hives. 
If local ordinances prevent you from tending to them on your property, contact 
farms in outlying areas to see if you can keep them there. 
</P>
<P>
 Beekeeping also requires a few hundred dollars for the equipment and, of 
course, the bees. L. A. Honey, in the City Terrace section, east of Downtown 
Los Angeles, is the closest place to the Valley to get the materials needed for 
hives: the frames and the all-important sting-proof suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bees are usually bought through beekeepers and bee-removal services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone loves the honey they produce. It would be nice if people would take 
the time to appreciate the creatures that produce it," Harmon says. "And of 
course, the people who collect it." Where to Go 
</P>
<P>
 What: L.A. Honey features equipment needed to start a colony.

<P>
 Such outings typically include all meals, expert leaders and a full menu of 
activities, such as day hikes, evening star walks, nighttime storytelling, 
lessons in outdoor skills and slide shows.Campers meet at the site and need 
only bring their own tent, sleeping bag, clothing and personal items. 
</P>
<P>
 "These trips provide a gentle introduction to camping, so they are terrific 
for beginners," said Debbie Munsey, assistant curator of education for the Los 
Angeles Zoo, which offers about 10 camping trips a year.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; A STYLE OF ITS OWN; THE NEW CROCODILE CAFE IN BURBANK ADDS 
SOME SNAP TO THE STANDARD OFFERINGS OF PIZZA, PASTA AND SALAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gregg Smith isn't a household name like Wolfgang Puck, but maybe this chef's 
time is coming. Smith is the man most responsible for the very good Crocodile 
Cafe chain, which has just opened its newest -- and flashiest -- branch. (There 
are five.) 
</P>
<P>
 When Smith opened Parkway Grill in Pasadena in the '80s, many critics called 
it a Spago clone. But Smith is no clone. He was the one, not Puck, who first 
opened a casual version of his California Cuisine dinner restaurant. Crocodile 
Cafe was jammin' on Lake Street for years before the first Wolfgang Puck Pizza 
Cafe opened. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a puzzle here, though. Smith is an innovator in his own right, so why, 
one wonders, does he insist on patterning so much of his style after Puck? This 
newest Crocodile, a big, breezy place with an open kitchen and lots of brick, 
exposed ducts and conceptual art, is shameless enough to have copied the 
concept of a pizza oven covered with colorful broken tile, which originated 
with Puck's designer and wife, Barbara Lazaroff. Children, children! 
</P>
<P>
 I've actually been enjoying Crocodile Cafe since it first opened in 1987. I 
once lived around the corner from the original restaurant and ate there almost 
every week. The company's executive chef, Hugo Molina, has refined his menu 
with great skill. Today, his menu abounds with good dishes, even though many of 
them are complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of what this restaurant does reads like a California Cuisine cliche: 
pizzas, pastas, salads. But many of these creations have original spins and 
twists, and they magically seem to work. A simple salad of romaine lettuce and 
ranch dressing, for instance, is wonderful when (get this) grilled over oak 
embers and sprinkled with chile-coated pecans. The menu lists something called 
"almost cheeseless" pizza. It has no more than a kiss of Parmesan and 
mozzarella, which nicely offsets the pungency of sun-dried tomatoes and the 
medicinal sweetness of fresh pesto. 
</P>
<P>
 The appetizers have a distinctly Southwestern air. Take the soft chicken tacos 
with good guacamole, sauteed Roma tomatoes, red onion and cilantro, or the one 
called roasted chile poblano relleno , filled with a fiesta of smoked corn, 
mushrooms, cilantro and other green herbs in a delicious roasted tomato and 
pasilla pepper sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 All pizzas and calzones are wood-fired in an Italian pizza oven. You'll see 
the chefs twirling the dough in the air, just as in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they do not twirl it long enough. A four-cheese pizza eaten one day 
came out a bit thick and doughy, and the surfeit of gooey cheese made it appear 
less attractive than the standard here. Barbecued chicken pizza, however, is 
always great. 
</P>
<P>
 If I were coming for a quick lunch, I'd grab one of the sandwiches, especially 
the oak-wood burger. This is one of the San Fernando Valley's greatest burgers, 
a third of a pound of smoky chopped beef. Have it with Cheddar cheese and 
grilled onions, at no extra charge. The smoked ham and chicken sandwich appears 
a bit precious, smeared as it is with avocado and chipotle mayo on a 
jalapeno-Cheddar roll. But it all comes together in rich harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything works this well. In an attempt to make this a quintessentially 
Californian sort of place, a few Asian-inspired recipes rear their little 
heads. But these Chinese pot stickers are insipid noodle pockets filled with 
minced shrimp and vegetables. Chicken salad with spicy peanut dressing tastes 
good for a few bites, then cloys. 
</P>
<P>
 With few exceptions, I've had better luck with large plates and pastas here, 
such as fettuccine with grilled chicken and roasted pasilla chile. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as you like the taste of oak, you are going to like the grilled meats, 
which include chicken, pork tenderloin and marinated flank steak. The last is 
especially good: oak-grilled beef, sliced thin. The side dishes are borracha 
salsa, smoky frijoles charros, guacamole and flour tortillas. I'd put this dish 
up against Mexican grill food anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 And the menu certainly does not let up when it is time for dessert. Most of 
the pastries come from Pasadena's very good Old Town Bakery. Pear cinnamon cake 
has layers of butter cream and spice cake. A gooey brownie sundae soars on 
hand-whipped cream. Where and When 
</P>

 HOUSE PARTY: They're inviting 7,000 people to a reunion party at the Casa 
Youth Shelter in Los Alamitos on Aug. 5. That's how many young people have gone 
through its two-week family counseling program in the past 16 years. To help 
track them all down, founder Myldred Jones publicized the party on CBS-TV's 
"This Morning" show. The date is also her 85th birthday. . . . Jones also got 
in a little advice: "Listen to your teen-agers, really listen. Let them know 
that you care what's happening in their lives."

 JUICED: Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) got scads of national attention 
for his bill to paddle graffiti vandals. But he's a bit of yesterday's news 
with O.J. Simpson running hot. Conroy was to appear tonight on ABC's "20/20" 
until his interview got bumped by the Simpson coverage. Undeterred, Conroy's 
talking to CBS and NBC prime-time news shows about interviews. . . . "Either 
way, it's all national media," says Conroy spokesman Chris Manson: "What we'd 
really like is to get Mickey across (on) Ted Koppel's 'Nightline.' "

 SOCCER FUN: Alexi Lalas, the red-goateed defender on the U.S. soccer team, 
which trained in Mission Viejo, basked in his sudden 1994 World Cup fame by 
joking with TV's David Letterman this week. He told the talk show host that the 
1990 World Cup in Italy was a world apart for him: "I was running around with a 
bunch of high school friends chasing women and drinking beer. We were in the 
stands with our faces painted. It never occurred to me then what I'd be doing 
this year."

 BRUCE LEE PROTEGE: At this year's Orange County Fair, some of the entertainers 
have more than a fun time on their minds. A martial arts team of county 
sheriff's deputies will put on shows at the 17-day fair Sunday and next 
Thursday. . . . Their hook: to show young people "there's something out there 
besides gangs and drugs," says team captain Ray Ellis. Ellis, 31, who holds a 
black belt, says of his start: "I saw a Bruce Lee movie."

 OVIATT UNION: Things are coming together at Cal State Northridge's 
quake-battered library -- with a little help from the Federal Emergency 
Management Assistance program, that is. CSUN officials have decided to reopen 
portions of the Oviatt Library for the fall semester, rejecting a plan to build 
a temporary facility (B1). . . . Opened on Sept. 7, 1973, the library was named 
for the college's first dean of instruction, Delmar T. Oviatt. 
</P>
<P>
 A NEW LOOK: Speaking of libraries, the Northridge branch of the Los Angeles 
Public Library is also about to reopen, sporting $110,000 worth of improvements 
large and small (B3). . . . "We've been repainted after 20 years and we now 
have carpeting," said senior librarian Lina Daukas. 
</P>
<P>
 GO AWAY: You say you want to get away from it all? Well, you don't have to go 
far. Many local campgrounds less than an hour's drive from the Valley offer 
hiking, biking and fishing (Valley Life! Page 10). . . . At Buckhorn 
Campground, located in Angeles National Forest north of La Canada, hikers can 
explore terrain similar to the High Sierra (above). 
</P>
<P>
 HE'S A PINBALL WIZARD: Today Broadway, tomorrow the Valley. Its New York run 
concluded, The Who's rock opera "Tommy" arrives at the Universal Amphitheatre 
on Wednesday (Valley Life! Page 3). . . . Prior to the band's 1989 Universal 
concert, The Who had performed "Tommy" in its entirety only twice -- in 1969 at 
London's Coliseum and in 1970 at the Metropolitan Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGH-TECH HYPE: Sure, the screen's smaller, but why leave home when you can 
check out the latest blockbusters from your desk? Three Valley-based studios -- 
Disney, Warner Bros. and Universal -- have made multimedia highlights from 
their summer films available on the CompuServe computer network. . . . Film 
fans can download clips from "The Lion King," "Wyatt Earp" and "The Shadow."

CAR DEALER TO SETTLE SUIT ON SALES PRACTICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A prominent Ventura car dealer has agreed to pay $70,000 to settle a district 
attorney's lawsuit that accused two of his dealerships of false advertising and 
unfair business practices, prosecutors said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Weber Mazda and Jack Weber Nissan used a variety of unlawful sales 
practices, including misrepresenting the past use and ownership history of 
former rental vehicles, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael D. Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were failing to disclose that they were rental cars," Schwartz said. 
Instead, sales personnel would tell customers that the former rental cars had 
been used only by manufacturers' executives or secretaries, he said. Under the 
law, sellers must tell potential buyers that a car was previously a rental 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although agreeing to settle the case -- which included 47 separate allegations 
-- the dealerships admitted no wrongdoing and accused prosecutors of insisting 
on an "excessive fine."  
</P>
<P>
 The settlement comes one year after two other dealerships -- Pacific Coast 
Ford and Pacific Coast Nissan -- paid $30,000 to settle a similar action 
brought by the prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, a lawsuit accused the dealerships of falsely promising customers 
they would not be turned down for financing even if they had bad credit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Jack Weber case, prosecutors accused the dealerships of running 
newspaper ads for cars that had already been sold, and of failing to sell some 
vehicles at the prices advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weber dealerships also were accused of showing pictures of a vehicle in 
advertisements that "gave the misleading appearance of being available for 
$4,900 rather than for the actual advertised price of $8,900." 
</P>
<P>
 The improprieties were discovered following an audit of the dealerships' 
records by the state Department of Motor Vehicles -- which, along with the 
district attorney's office, had received customer complaints about the Weber 
companies, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief interview Thursday, the companies' president, Jack Weber, blamed 
any misconduct on two sales managers who have been fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber declined to comment further, but his office issued a statement 
responding to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have cooperated with the district attorney in settling to the customer's 
benefit 1991 and 1992 alleged violations discovered by the DMV in an audit of 
our business," it said. "The supervisory personnel responsible have long been 
terminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remained concerned, however, over the excessive fine imposed, as another 
cost of doing business in Ventura County, and its impact on further exodus of 
business from this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's settlement also prohibits future unlawful conduct by the Weber 
dealerships, Schwartz said. He agreed that Weber had cooperated in the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine will go to the county's General Fund, Schwartz said. The dealership 
has made restitution to customers who were misled, Schwartz said.

NEIGHBORHOOD WELCOMES VENTURA POLICE STOREFRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two months after hundreds of Ventura Avenue residents crowded a meeting hall 
to demand more protection and city services, Ventura police have opened a 
storefront substation, a three-room office in the thick of the crime-riddled 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thursday morning dedication of the Westside Storefront was marked with 
music and dance by neighborhood children and congratulations from local 
officials, who challenged residents to maintain the groundswell of community 
support that helped open the substation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are some hooligans or criminals out there who don't like this, well 
too bad," Chief Richard F. Thomas told the audience, assembled outside the 
storefront at 110 N. Olive St. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either clean up your act or get out," Thomas said. "That's my message to you 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 The Avenue-area office joins the Montalvo storefront as the second satellite 
station of the Ventura Police Department to open this year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a neighborhood that police say is a hot spot of law-enforcement 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Avenue area is a known area for criminal activity and gang activity," 
police spokesman Jack Richards said. "It has far more calls for service than 
any other reporting district in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The newest substation will be open from noon to 9 p.m. Mondays through 
Fridays, but officials hope to operate it seven days a week once training is 
completed by volunteers, who will staff the office's front desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The significance of both of these storefronts is that they are being opened 
without any public dollars," said police Capt. Randy Adams, who served as 
master of ceremonies Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would never have happened without strong community partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen people signed a volunteer contact sheet resting atop the 
storefront counter -- names the Police Department will call on in coming weeks 
to increase the hours the station can serve the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The office will offer residents more than immediate police response to law 
enforcement calls. Officials say it will operate as a clearinghouse for 
resolving almost any problem residents might experience with city government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're teachers, moderators and facilitators," said senior Officer Jim Cubitt, 
who has patrolled the Avenue area for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is their resources store and their town hall," he said. "Here at this 
store, if we don't have the answers, we'll sit down and find them the answers." 
</P>
<P>
 The station will be staffed by two full-time police officers, as well as two 
officials from the Fire Department's code enforcement team, who will track down 
and enforce building code and planning violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key word is accountability," said Dan Emry, who will respond to code 
enforcement violations from the Avenue station. "Now you've got people assigned 
to an area to clear those problems up." 
</P>
<P>
 Front-counter volunteers will answer phones, process paperwork and try to 
resolve whatever problems neighborhood residents encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers not stationed at the storefront also will be able to use it 
for report-writing and other activities they would normally need to complete at 
the main station. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the substation -- many of whom stepped up after the boisterous 
town hall meeting in May -- said the substation will give the neighborhood a 
foothold for community activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "You open a storefront and nothing will happen," said Mike Del Dosso, a 
25-year resident who helped establish the satellite office. "It takes the whole 
community to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to us -- the residents of The Avenue -- to take advantage of this 
opportunity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is convinced the storefront will drive away the gang and drug 
activity that permeates the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will know that the police will be here faster," said Rogelio 
Botello(CQ, a 17-year-old raised on The Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still going to do (illegal) things," he said. "They just may do it 
faster so they can get away." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed to help staff the Westside Storefront police substation

through Fridays, but officials hope to get enough volunteers to open the 
storefront seven days a week. For information, call 648-8133.

PROPOSED TRACT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY BOOST POLLUTION, STUDY SAYS; SIMI VALLEY: A 
CITIZENS GROUP DISPUTES THE CLAIM ON THE BASIS THAT IT EXAGGERATES THE NUMBER 
OF HOMES LIKELY TO BE BUILT. THE AREA ALSO WOULD INCLUDE A CEMETERY.

<P>
 Development of a cemetery and a nearly 700-home housing tract at the east end 
of Simi Valley would significantly increase pollution in the smog-plagued city, 
according to a new environmental study. 
</P>
<P>
 But a local citizens group whose past concerns about the project have been 
resolved by the landowner dismissed the report's pollution claims, saying they 
are based on old plans that called for more houses than are likely to be built. 
</P>
<P>
 The 381-acre hillside property, known as Douglas/Crawford Ranch, is owned by 
Mt. Sinai Memorial Park, which plans to build a 162-acre graveyard and sell the 
rest of the land to developers to help finance the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 If the development were entirely covered with homes, daily car trips would 
increase by nearly 5,000 and pollution in the city could increase by as much as 
45 tons a year, which the county's Air Pollution Control Board says would have 
a significant, adverse effect on air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley suffers the worst smog in Ventura County because pollution is 
blown in by ocean breezes and then trapped by mountains surrounding the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City Planner Laura Kuhn, whose department conducted the study, said the 
project will create a smog problem. "It's up to the Planning Commission and the 
City Council to decide if the benefits of the project would outweigh the 
pollution problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing before the Planning Commission is tentatively scheduled for 
Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project may not generate as much pollution as the study predicts, said 
Larry Fried, a member of the neighborhood group Citizens for a Safe and Scenic 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollution estimates are based on information gathered before tough 
restrictions were placed on hillside development and before part of the 
property was set aside for a cemetery and a park, Fried said. So the land now 
eligible for development is much smaller than originally anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you take out a big chunk for the cemetery and a big chunk for open 
space, you are left with two relatively small parcels," said Fried, who lives 
in the Indian Hills neighborhood next to the proposed development. "When you 
factor in hillside restrictions, there's just no way you can build that many 
units there." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn acknowledged that fewer homes than were included in the environmental 
report may ultimately be built on the property. The city's General Plan allows 
for nearly 700 homes on the property, but since the acreage surrounding the 
cemetery has not been sold to developers there is no specific construction 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very likely that there will never be that many homes on the property," 
Kuhn said. "We took what you might call the worst-case scenario." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis said he expected the number of homes slated for the 
development to drop significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we set that cap eight years ago, we considered it an absolute maximum," 
Davis said. "We've seen quite a bit of development in the city since then, and 
I think that number will have to come down." 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Sinai, which operates an 80-acre Jewish cemetery in the Hollywood Hills 
near Burbank, began considering plans to build a second site in Simi Valley two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert H. Levonian, a consultant for Mt. Sinai, said he was surprised at the 
finding that pollution could be a problem at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our clear focus here is to build a cemetery and then eventually sell the rest 
of the land," Levonian said. "We are not looking to cram in a lot of houses."

AVENUE TV RESTORES FOX TO LINEUP; CABLE: AGREEMENT WILL BRING NETWORK 
PROGRAMMING BACK TO WEST VENTURA SYSTEM WITHOUT AN IMMEDIATE RATE HIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For 10,000 or so cable customers in Ventura, Bart Simpson is back. And there 
will be no problem tuning into National Football League action this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 For subscribers of Avenue TV Cable -- which holds a monopoly on the franchise 
for western Ventura -- the nearly nine-month drought without Fox television has 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable company dropped the network from its lineup last October in a 
dispute over broadcast fees. The move prompted dozens of angry calls from fans 
of prime-time hits such as "Bart Simpson," "Melrose Place" and "Beverly Hills, 
90210." After Fox won the right to broadcast NFL games this fall, football fans 
worried about missing the first kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 customers were so miffed they canceled their cable subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 But after months of negotiations, the brouhaha has finally ended. Last week, 
Avenue Cable reinstated KTTV (the Fox affiliate on Channel 11) with no plans 
for an immediate rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, there may be some increase, but we don't plan any in the 
immediate future," said Pamela Drake, Avenue's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with dropping Fox last October, Avenue Cable also stopped carrying the 
Los Angeles affiliates of ABC and CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated residents also complained to city officials about the reduction in 
cable service, said city spokeswoman Carol Green. 
</P>
<P>
 Many television viewers in western Ventura cannot get a clear picture via 
antenna because of mountain interference. And, Green said, these customers were 
particularly annoyed that Avenue cable's monopoly gave them no other option. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have gotten used to the fact that there's one telephone company and 
one gas company," she said. "But when there's a service like cable TV, then 
they're not used to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Avenue's ratings dispute stemmed from a cable law passed by Congress in 1992 
that allowed broadcast TV stations to charge cable companies for the right to 
carry their programs. A fraction of the nation's cable companies, including 
Avenue, balked at the new law, refusing to pay the fees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, all three Los Angeles stations (KTTV, KABC and KCBS) wanted 
Avenue to add other cable channels owned by their parent networks in exchange 
for carrying their signals. Avenue officials refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite reaching agreements with Fox and KABC, Avenue subscribers are still 
missing the Los Angeles CBS affiliate from their dial. Instead, they receive a 
CBS affiliate in Santa Maria, which offers many of the same network sitcoms and 
other shows, but not the Los Angeles-based newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Avenue officials said they are still negotiating with KCBS Channel 2, but do 
not expect to resolve the standoff for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're awaiting word from them at this point," Drake said. "We anticipate 
hearing from them in the next two to three months." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement reached with Fox in late June, Avenue Cable will not pay 
broadcast fees nor will it carry FX, a new cable network owned by Fox, Drake 
said. FX was launched by Fox to offer a mixture of news, entertainment, 
syndicated reruns and regional features. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake said Avenue Cable will consider adding FX to its lineup. She declined to 
reveal any more details of the agreement with Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Avenue resumed broadcasting KABC in late May after agreeing to add ESPN II to 
a more expensive package of channels, Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
 And although no rate hike is planned with the return of Fox, Drake said the 
addition of three channels last fall boosted operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, basic subscribers who pay $16 a month will still receive TNT, the 
Family Channel and superstation TBS. Those channels were added last fall to 
make up for the loss of the larger networks.

SCHOOL DISTRICTS REDUCING AID FOR MIGRANTS; EDUCATION: DROP IN STATE FUNDING 
FORCES CUTBACKS. OFFICIALS SAY MANY STUDENTS WON'T GET THE TUTORING AND 
COUNSELING THEY NEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Deep cuts in state funding for Ventura County's migrant education programs are 
forcing local school districts to scale back extra classroom help offered to 
children of farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
 To direct scarce federal migrant-education funds to the neediest children, the 
state Department of Education has begun giving the bulk of the program's money 
to children who have been uprooted recently. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the July 1 change will mean a 25% cut in migrant funds to 
$2.4 million this fiscal year, hitting districts in Oxnard, Santa Paula and 
Fillmore the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about half of the 8,000 county students who qualified for full funding 
under the program meet the newer, tighter guidelines, educators said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many Spanish-speaking students who still need extra tutoring and 
counseling offered under the migrant program will no longer get it, said Kathy 
Cooper, who runs the program for the Oxnard School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these children come straight from Mexico," Cooper said. "They do not 
have the English language. They have never lived in our culture. So the teacher 
and the instructional assistant become their lifeline to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new state guidelines, most of the program's money goes to students 
who have changed districts in the last two years instead of within the last 
six. That's particularly significant in this county because an increasing 
number of local farm worker families are staying put. 
</P>
<P>
 The change is appropriate, state education officials said, because the most 
recent migrants have the greatest need for tutoring, counseling and other 
special services. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Ventura County educators said they do not expect migrant students to 
overcome cultural barriers and language differences in only two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids whose parents work in agriculture are unique," said Joe Mendoza, migrant 
education coordinator for the Ventura County superintendent of schools. "What's 
going to happen, No. 1, is these children are going to fall through the 
cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the funding cuts, fewer Ventura County children will have access to 
bilingual assistance aimed at curbing high dropout rates among migrant 
students, educators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really significant," said Walt Dunlop of Oxnard Union High School 
District, where migrant funding will be cut by one-third. "I know parents are 
quite concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the state officials gave districts about $400 per year for each 
migrant student whose family had moved within the last 12 months. And it 
allocated about $325 for children of seasonal workers who had relocated in the 
previous six years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But this school year the state will pay about $325 for migrant students who 
have moved within the previous two years. And it will give only $125 for 
migrant students who have relocated in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said they changed the program in California because they 
expect Congress to tighten eligibility this summer and restrict use of program 
funds similarly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a secret that we have to face change," said Vicki Lee, an analyst 
in the state's migrant program. "The feds have always pressed us to place a 
priority on the mobile child, so we're really trying to move in that 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, about 8,000 migrant students have moved within the last six 
years, but only about half in the last two years, Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, migrant education funding to Ventura County school districts will 
fall from about $3.2 million in 1993-94 to $2.4 million for 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oxnard School District, funding has been cut from $627,970 to $458,905. 
In the Oxnard Union High School District, the cut is from $403,684 to $267,382. 
In Fillmore, funding will drop from $218,819 to $123,047, and in the Ocean View 
district near Port Hueneme the loss is from $143,753 to $93,728. Santa Paula's 
loss is from $115,536 to $81,286. Moorpark school funding drops from $110,960 
to $77,810. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's Cooper explained that Ventura County farm workers are less transient 
now. Instead of picking strawberries in the spring and then moving to the 
Central Valley for the summer harvest, they now generally stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 Many families are finding local field work throughout the year, educators 
said. Others are changing to different occupations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of recent migrants is declining steadily in Oxnard, the 
elementary school district still has 1,250 students eligible for the federal 
program. To cope with the funding cuts, the district may have to cut program 
teachers' aides from 12 to five.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TEEN-AGERS EARN WHILE THEY LEARN AT CLU 
</P>

<P>
 While her friends are lounging in the warm summer sun at the beach, 
16-year-old Sonia Mata is crunching numbers in her chemistry and algebra 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not jealous," the Oxnard youth said Thursday, taking a break from her 
rigorous schedule. "I'll have time for that later on." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonia couldn't care less about getting a tan: She's more concerned about 
getting into college. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rio Mesa High School student is one of six teen-agers in a new work 
program being offered this summer as a supplement to Cal Lutheran University's 
50-student Upward Bound program. The employment aspect is being sponsored by 
Oxnard's Summer Youth Employment and Training program. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their Upward Bound classes, the six students in the work 
program spend two hours each afternoon working at various on-campus jobs. They 
earn minimum wage, and are paid for both their time on the job and in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is help gear the students toward thinking about careers," 
said Bernadette Hernandez, assistant program director. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the other Upward Bound students, those in the work program live at the 
Thousand Oaks campus during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the Upward Bound program encourages low-income students to go to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Upward Bound students are tracked academically through the school year and 
return to Cal Lutheran each summer until they graduate from high school.  
</P>
<P>
 The program's counselors also guide the teen-agers through the intricacies of 
the college application process. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran has operated the program for 13 years, but this is the first time 
some students have held down part-time jobs at the college and gone to class. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonia works in the admissions office each afternoon, performing various 
clerical tasks. Seventeen-year-old Alfredo Soto assists pool lifeguards each 
afternoon. And Rio Mesa senior Jorge Alfaro works in the college cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 All six students in the program were selected based on financial need. 
Although they will earn only about $150 during the five-week summer stint, they 
hope to walk away with more than just a few checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives you an idea of what it would be like to be working and going to 
college," Sonia said.  
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo, who also lives in Oxnard, said he enjoys the challenge of working and 
studying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I wish I wasn't here studying so hard, but this weekend I went home 
and got bored," he said. "I missed the homework." TRACY WILSON

<P>
 A Simi Valley summer school student turned herself in Thursday to police, 
admitting she had slashed a 13-year-old girl with a razor knife during a fight, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Mark Layhew said the victim was leaving summer school classes at Hillside 
Junior High School at about 12:30 p.m. Wednesday when a 14-year-old classmate 
walked up and began cursing at her. 
</P>
<P>
 A fight ensued and the 14-year-old attacked the younger girl with a small, 
retractable razor knife such as those used to open boxes, Layhew said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim suffered cuts to her upper and lower chest and arm and abrasions to 
her upper chest, Layhew said. Her brother drove her to Simi Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 She was treated and released, a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacker turned herself in to Simi Valley police late Thursday afternoon. 
She was issued a citation for assault with a deadly weapon and released to her 
mother's custody, Layhew said. The girl's case will be handled by the county 
probation department, he said. MACK REED

<P>
 Simi Valley residents concerned about soil settling from the Jan. 17 
earthquake can now obtain a free copy of a study on soil stability in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, completed last month by the state geologist, gauges the stability 
of soil on the eastern end of Simi Valley that shifted after the quake, causing 
severe damage to residences and streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing on the eastern end of the city that was built on landfill sank and 
shifted after the quake, according to the report, which said the area has 
stabilized sufficiently for repairs and rebuilding to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The report includes maps of city regions most likely to be hit hard in 
earthquakes, and recommends that extensive studies be conducted before new 
developments are built. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the report are available at City Hall, 2929 Tapo Canyon Road. SARA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; OFFICIALS LUKEWARM ON CITY FLAG DESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark officials, in a continuing quest for an official flag to represent 
their city, had a less-than-enthusiastic response to several designs that have 
been submitted for city approval. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the four top designs, chosen from more than 30 submissions, 
the City Council decided Wednesday to postpone a final selection.The council 
will take up the discussion again at its next meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bernardo Perez said the city may ultimately decide to go back to 
the original idea of using its seal -- an apricot blossom in a circular design 
on a white background -- on official correspondence. He said that may be the 
easiest solution since the seal is already being used. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we can use these other designs in city brochures or reports," Perez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have been searching for an official standard since December, 
after several council members balked at using the town's seal on a white banner 
imprinted with the words City of Moorpark. The city opened a design competition 
for an official flag under the direction of Moorpark's arts committee, and more 
than 30 designs were submitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Arts committee members pared the submissions down to the best four, member 
Eloise Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best designs are the ones that were kept simple and reflected the city's 
character," Brown said. Her favorite was one that bears the image of a freeway 
overpass and a railroad crossing each other, overlaid with an apricot blossom. 
</P>
<P>
 The next council meeting is scheduled for 7 p.m. July 27 at Moorpark City 
Hall, 799 Moorpark Ave. SCOTT HADLY

 A proposal to connect Ventura County by a series of walking, biking and 
horseback trails will be unveiled to the public next week, Supervisor Vicky 
Howard said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have been working on the Regional Trails and Pathways Master 
Plan since last year, Howard said, and are seeking public input. 
</P>
<P>
 Maps of the proposed system will be on display at the Rancho Santa Susana 
Community Center, 5005 Los Angeles Ave., in Simi Valley from 7 to 9 p.m. 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, Supervisor Maggie Kildee and trail system coordinator Ron Blakemore 
will be on hand to answer questions and take suggestions. Additional public 
sessions will be held throughout the summer, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Ventura already has an extensive trail system, Howard said the 
challenge will be establishing links to connect them all. Because the system 
will cross so many city boundaries, she said, many agencies will be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the trail will cross private property, requiring permission from 
landowners from around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for a tiered system of trails, which will include paths for all 
non-motorized forms of transportation, including walking, hiking, biking and 
horseback riding. MARY F. POLS

<P>
 A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday for John Forrest Lires, 44, 
and his 10-year-old daughter, Erin, who were killed last weekend in an airplane 
crash along the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime Ojai area pilot and an electrician for Taft Electric in Ventura, 
Lires and his daughter were killed instantly when their Cessna 195 developed 
engine trouble moments after taking off Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a service for his friends and family," said Doug Dullenkopf, a 
family friend of 15 years who is hosting the service at Santa Paula Airport, in 
the hangar of Screaming Eagle Aviation at 822 E. Santa Maria St. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a memorial flyover by local pilots at the airport during the 
service, which Dullenkopf said would be a remembrance for his two friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very well-liked," Dullenkopf said. "A little bit quiet, but one of 
those real down-to-earth people." 
</P>
<P>
 Erin was an accomplished horse rider and a child actress who had appeared in 
several television shows and commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "John loved to fly and Erin loved to ride horses," Dullenkopf said. "Erin had 
nothing but a big future in front of her." 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial fund has been set up on behalf of Lires' wife, Terri, and daughter 
Wendy, 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations to the John and Erin Lires Memorial Fund can be mailed to Greg and 
Rebecca Straubel, 12256 Ojai Road, Ojai, CA 93023. JEFF McDONALD

 A Ventura man suspected of drunken driving crashed a stolen pickup truck at a 
Ventura Freeway interchange Thursday, critically injuring his passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Several objects -- including a sawed-off shotgun and silverware -- were strewn 
near the crumpled Toyota truck at the junction of the Ojai Freeway.California 
Highway Patrol Officer Staci Morse said some of the objects were apparently 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrecked truck also was recently stolen in Tennessee, the home state of the 
injured passenger, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Lopez, 25, was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving and was being 
held in Ventura County Jail. An alcohol blood level was not available late 
Thursday, Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 The passenger, Anthony Lee Collins, was in intensive care at Ventura County 
Medical Center, a spokeswoman said. He had severe head and spinal injuries, 
internal bleeding and fractured legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez attempted to run away from the 7:10 a.m. accident, but a truck driver 
who saw the rollover "grabbed him and walked him back," Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morse said Collins will be arrested on suspicion of possession of a stolen 
vehicle if he recovers. JASON GRANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN, 19, DIES AFTER LOSING CONTROL OF CAR

 A 19-year-old Oxnard man was killed early Thursday when he lost control of his 
car on the Ventura Freeway near Telephone Road and crashed through a chain-link 
fence, hitting a brick wall and a light pole, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Madrigal was driving south on the freeway at 85 to 90 m.p.h., just 
south of the Telephone Road exit in Ventura, when his Honda veered out of 
control about 1:25 a.m., the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For an unknown reason, (Madrigal) steered into the . . . center divider," a 
CHP spokeswoman said. "He over-corrected to the right and drove across the 
southbound 101 traffic lane and the right shoulder . . . and struck a 
chain-link fence." 
</P>
<P>
 Still skidding, the car crossed Valentine Road, which runs parallel to the 
freeway, slamming into a wall and a light pole before coming to rest, CHP 
spokeswoman Staci Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Madrigal suffered multiple blunt injuries, including head trauma, and was 
pronounced dead at the scene, said Ventura County Deputy Coroner Mitch Breese. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the accident was under investigation, Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Breese said routine toxicology tests will be done to determine if alcohol 
consumption was a factor in the accident. Results of those tests will not be 
available for several weeks, he said. JASON GRANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; POLICE SEEK SUSPECT IN BANK ROBBERY

<P>
 Oxnard police are looking for a man who robbed a bank Thursday morning and 
fled on foot with an undisclosed amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The man entered California Federal Bank at 2900 Saviers Road at about 11:15 
a.m., approached a teller and asked for money, telling her to "keep her hands 
up," according to Oxnard Police Sgt. Fred Berry. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber was described as a dark-haired Latino male, about 25 years old, 5 
foot, 9 inches tall, and 160 pounds. He was wearing a white and blue baseball 
cap, dark sunglasses and a white T-shirt with a dark blue logo.  
</P>
<P>
 The teller, who told police she did not see a gun or other weapon, turned over 
an undisclosed amount of money to the man, who leafed through the cash and 
fled. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Berry, the man was last seen running toward the area of Samuel 
Avenue and Lark Street. An investigation is continuing. MARY F. POLS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; POLICE SAY ATTACKS APPEAR GANG-RELATED

<P>
 A recent rash of stabbings and shootings in Oxnard -- three in the past week 
-- appear to be the result of escalating gang conflict in the city, police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 All the incidents involve a small number of people, most of whom know each 
other and are suspected gang members, said Sgt. Charles Dunham of the Oxnard 
Police Department's Major Crimes Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it is caused by drug trafficking. I think there is a territorial 
dispute taking place, that's what the word on the street is," said Bob Herrera 
of Victory Outreach, an anti-drug and gang group. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses -- many of whom were family members and close friends of the victims 
-- have not been of much help, Dunham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they don't cooperate because they plan to take care of it 
themselves," Dunham said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent incident, 17-year-old Richard Madrid was struck in the back 
Wednesday night in a drive-by shooting on the 1200 block of South M Street. He 
was treated at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard and released, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Saturday, two men were shot outside a liquor store after a brief 
confrontation. Peter Rodriguez, 20, and Richard Salazar, 23, were wounded 
outside the Liquor Cellar store about 1:30 a.m. Police said Rodriguez was the 
intended target, while Salazar was an innocent bystander. 
</P>
<P>
 Also last week, four teen-agers were arrested on suspicion of stabbing and 
beating Rancy Dillon, 16, in the back and head during a gang fight June 30. The 
confrontation, which took place near the Fremont Shopping Center on Devonshire 
Drive and Ventura Road, involved about 20 people from two rival gangs, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 About five shootings and stabbings in Oxnard over the past two weeks are 
believed to be gang-related, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's something that happened last week, or something that 
happened last year that's triggering this," Dunham said. "It's very hard to 
tell." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

 Hundreds of antique cars and street rods will be on display Sunday outside the 
Vintage Museum of Transportation and Wildlife when the Oxnard Police Department 
is host of the fifth annual Cops & Cruisers Car Show. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is a fund-raiser for various youth organizations, including Casa 
Pacifica, a Camarillo shelter for abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This show has really grown over the past five years," said Jan Paxton, who 
organized the event with her husband, Paul, in conjunction with the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got entries from as far south as San Diego and as far north as Paso 
Robles," Paxton said. "I've even got one from as far east as Tennessee." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be food booths, entertainment, three bands and vendors selling 
parts and equipment for classic car collectors and builders. This year, police 
volunteers have set up a boxing ring for demonstrations in boxing and martial 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's Special Weapons and Tactics squad also will hold a 
demonstration. At 3 p.m., awards will given out to more than 90 vehicles in 28 
categories, including best sports cars, street rods and nostalgic automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the outdoor display is free after 10 a.m. But entry into the 
vintage museum, located at 1421 Emerson Ave. in Oxnard, is $10. JEFF McDONALD

ANGRY RESIDENTS PLAN TO PROTEST NEW SCHOOL BUILDING; NEWBURY PARK: THE DISTRICT 
AND NEIGHBORS OF CYPRESS ELEMENTARY WILL DISCUSS A TWO-STORY STRUCTURE ALREADY 
UNDER CONSTRUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last thing Newbury Park resident Arthur Minazzoli wants to see out his 
back door is a two-story building, blocking his view of school playing fields 
and the distant foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is precisely what Minazzoli and a handful of neighbors plan to tell 
the Conejo Valley school board at an emergency district meeting this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building is going to be 16 feet from our back wall," an angry Minazzoli 
said Thursday. "It's not just the idea of the view, it's how they handled it. 
Nobody here was notified." 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Unified School District has already begun construction on a 
$1.7-million cafeteria and multipurpose room on the adjacent Cypress Elementary 
School campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby homeowners say they never knew a 35,000-square-foot building was to be 
constructed until a group of engineers started poking around near their back 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Minazzoli and his neighbor, Dean Weissman, protested to the Thousand Oaks City 
Council in late June, prompting the city's request for a meeting between the 
homeowners and the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have recommended that the project move ahead, but the school 
board can stop construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The new building would accommodate student assemblies and replace makeshift 
indoor eating areas with a larger cafeteria. During the winter, students must 
eat in their classrooms because the existing facility is not large enough. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say the new facilities are badly needed and should be built 
despite complaints from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've said that we are willing to work together as far as landscaping is 
concerned," Assistant Supt. Sarah Hart said. "But the neighbors' request is 
that the building be moved. The building was designed to fit in that location. 
If you tried to move it to another location it would not work." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving the proposed star-shaped stucco building elsewhere on campus would cost 
about $500,000, Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said that if construction moves ahead, it will be completed 
next April. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents at Cypress have raised money for nearly a decade to help pay for the 
new cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain things we cannot do at the school without a large room," 
booster club Chairwoman Terri Marshall said. "It's beneficial to the children 
in enhancing their education." 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents think the district has steamrollered the community, 
misleading homeowners about its size and appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel a little suckered and a little abused," said nearby resident David 
Chambers, whose son is a fifth-grader at Cypress. "I think if the parents had 
been given a choice between it and these guys being subjected to a 20-foot 
wall, we would have said, 'Forget it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Weissman agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have notified us a long time ago so we could have been involved," 
he said. "We would like to be good neighbors and we would like to see it 
reciprocated."

MOORPARK KILLS PLAN CALLING FOR REGULATION OF DAY-CARE HOMES; COUNCIL: THE 
ACTION IS TAKEN AFTER PROVIDERS COMPLAINED THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS A MARK OF 
'OVERZEALOUS AND UNNECESSARY REGULATION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reluctant to clutter the books with new laws, the Moorpark City Council has 
unanimously scrapped a proposal to regulate day-care homes in residential 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Wednesday night, the council heard complaints from day-care 
providers who said the proposal was a mark of "overzealous and unnecessary 
regulation." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was not aimed at day-care centers, which operate much like small 
schools and typically are not on residential streets. Instead, the proposed new 
law would regulate home-based day-care services. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners argued that without a local ordinance they would have no power 
to respond to complaints of neighbors on noise or traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the home day-care providers argued that the law -- which would have forced 
them to pay fees of more than $400 in some cases -- would have made it 
difficult to stay in business. Residential day-care providers are already 
heavily regulated by the state, and additional fees and regulations would hurt 
providers whose services are in great demand in Moorpark, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 55 residential day-care homes in the city, 48 have fewer than six 
children and the rest have seven to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Scott Montgomery estimated that the city has 10,000 children, but 
only about 370 spaces at residential care centers. He said the city should not 
make it more difficult for the day-care homes by adopting new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously the need is much more enormous than what's provided," he said. "We 
need more homes, not less." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has not received any complaints about home day-care providers, said 
Jim Aguilera, director of the Community Development Department. But he said the 
city should have some way to regulate problems if they arise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Currently, there are no controls," he said. "They are exempt from city 
regulations entirely. If we received a complaint we don't have the power to 
respond." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from a local association of home day-care providers disputed 
Aguilera's comment, saying there are plenty of laws regulating their 
operations. They cited a long list of state regulations that include 
fingerprinting of providers, screening employees to weed out known child 
abusers, and inspections by fire and social services officials.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture also periodically inspects the homes to 
make sure they are meeting the nutritional needs of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Geri Fineroff, a former child-care provider who now works for the USDA 
nutrition program, said she saw no need for the ordinance "when, by their own 
admission, there have been no complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Sharki, who operates a day-care home in Moorpark, said the homes enhance 
a neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to have affordable day care near their homes, especially infant 
care, which is best provided by homes like ours," she said. "We're part of the 
neighborhood. People like us here, and if there ever were a complaint I'm sure 
it could be worked out."

 A 65-year-old film technician who allegedly posed as a Los Angeles police 
officer was charged Thursday with multiple counts of sexual assault after two 
victims identified him from police mug shots, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weldon Norman of Covina was charged with kidnaping, rape and impersonating a 
police officer, among other charges, said Phil Rabichow, a Los Angeles County 
deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 He was charged in two assaults that took place on June 29 and July 1 near a 
bus bench in front of a shopping center at the corner of Victory Boulevard and 
Vineland Avenue, said Detective Mike Coffey of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman wore a blue police jacket and carried a badge, a holstered handgun, 
handcuffs and a police flashlight, and he allegedly told his victims, young 
Latina women, that he was investigating their legal status in the United 
States, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a predator, and he was using young, naive persons who may be afraid of 
the police," Coffey said. "We have two victims in a week, and we don't know if 
there are more or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators identified Norman through Department of Motor Vehicle records 
when the first victim saw him near the bus bench the day after she was abducted 
and took down his license plate number, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both assaults took place around 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, who used the alias Mark Weldon, was arrested Tuesday when police 
served search and arrest warrants at his Arrow Highway home, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey said investigators recovered "crucial evidence" from Norman's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The first case was turned over to robbery detectives as a kidnaping because 
the victim told police that the man drove her around for some time before 
dropping her off. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second assault, the victim told police that the man told her an 
identical story and identified himself as a police officer before he drove her 
to an unknown location and assaulted her, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women gave police similar descriptions of the assailant and his car, 
Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman is being held at the Men's Central Jail on $640,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 He was expected to be arraigned Thursday in the Van Nuys branch of the Los 
Angeles Municipal Court, according to a court clerk.

PANEL REJECTS PLAN FOR ADVERTISING ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Senate Transportation Committee has rejected a bill that would have 
allowed businesses in Agoura Hills to place their logos on special signs along 
the Ventura Freeway as a possible test case for cities statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee voted 6 to 3 against the bill Tuesday, with two members 
abstaining, effectively killing a bill that Agoura Hills officials hoped would 
give them a chance to try a type of advertisement used in most other states. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was opposed by the powerful billboard and sign lobbies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really outgunned," said Kelly Gould, senior consultant for 
Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Encino), who introduced the bill last year. "The 
sign industry was very busy, and there were a couple people who changed their 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
 As approved by the Assembly last year, the bill would have permitted freeway 
signs bearing commercial logos along three miles of the freeway in Agoura 
Hills, on a five-year trial basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat of the measure comes after voters in November overwhelmingly upheld 
an Agoura Hills law banning advertisements atop tall poles. That law, as well 
as the logo sign bill, was opposed by a handful of business owners in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners without pole-mounted signs along the freeway generally 
supported the logo sign idea, said Councilwoman Louise Rishoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of businesses in our city which do not have pole signs and 
now have been denied an opportunity to make themselves known to all that 
traffic on the 101 freeway," Rishoff said. "It's a real business loss to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, 10 merchants who have pole-mounted signs filed lawsuits against the 
city in an attempt to block the law banning them. A citizens group has 
responded by organizing a boycott against those businesses. KURT PITZER

STRAWBERRY TAKES A GIANT STEP IN RETURN; BASEBALL: HE GOES HITLESS IN THREE 
AT-BATS BUT IS PLEASED WITH HIS COMEBACK PERFORMANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Darryl Strawberry got plenty of cheers but no hits in his return to the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 On a bright, warm Thursday at Candlestick Park, Strawberry took the first step 
in yet another comeback from injury and substance abuse, making his debut with 
the San Francisco Giants. It was his first major league game since last June 16 
with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he's been out with back injuries and in the Betty Ford Center 
getting treatment for drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today ranks with me as a new beginning, a new birth as far as my career," 
Strawberry said. "Today is a good start for the Giants and also for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 When he stepped to the plate for the first time, there was only a smattering 
of boos among the cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Batting fifth behind All-Stars Barry Bonds and Matt Williams, he went hitless 
in three at-bats and was walked intentionally in the eighth before being 
removed for a pinch-runner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants defeated the Philadelphia Phillies, 5-4, to end a three-game losing 
streak.  
</P>
<P>
 "He brings a lot of threat with him," Williams said. "It's good for everybody, 
not just me and not just Barry." 
</P>
<P>
 After grounding out to second base his first two times up, Strawberry hit a 
long drive off Shawn Boskie in the sixth, just after Williams homered. But Milt 
Thompson robbed Strawberry of a home run, catching the ball just above the 
fence in straightaway center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warning track power," Strawberry joked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I hit it pretty good. Milt made a good play. It's shows I'm capable of 
hitting the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson knew if he didn't catch the ball, it was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could prepare myself to jump because I got back there so fast and because 
the ball was hit so high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed by the Giants on June 19, less than a month after getting out of rehab, 
Strawberry hit .300 in three games at triple-A Phoenix of the Pacific Coast 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be back in a big league ballpark," he said. "It's been a long 
time since I performed in a big league ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
 To say Strawberry was eager to get back to the bigs would be an 
understatement. After just two games, in which he homered twice, he told the 
Giants he was ready to come up. They asked him to wait a day, so he played one 
more game with the Firebirds on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 6:15 a.m. Thursday, Strawberry was on a plane bound for San Francisco 
and was at the ballpark before 9 a.m., a departure for a player fined numerous 
times for showing up late. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in his new No. 17 uniform, he looked like the same old Strawberry in 
batting practice, a wad of chew stuffed in his cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, his bat was as quick as ever. Strawberry, who played just 75 games 
the last two seasons, hit six balls out, two into the upper deck, sending fans 
scurrying to retrieve the balls. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was finished, a group of about two dozen fans standing behind the 
dugout applauded enthusiastically and begged for autographs, but Strawberry 
strode quickly into the clubhouse and back to his locker.  
</P>
<P>
 Starting in right field, Strawberry handled five chances cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Strawberry's troubled past, the fans gave him a warm welcome. He even 
had his own cheering section: six young men dressed as strawberries, green 
bandannas on their heads and chests painted red. They hung a "Strawberry Patch" 
banner from their seats in the center field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign reading, "We are behind U Darryl," hung in right field.

DOW GAINS AGAIN, BUT YIELDS UP ON JOBS JITTERS

 Stocks rose for the fourth straight day Thursday, while bond yields inched 
upward on expectations that June employment figures due out today will be weak 
enough to hold off an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks advanced as investors overcame their uneasiness about interest rates, 
focusing on economically sensitive companies and recently depressed issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 13.92 points to 3,688.42 on Big Board 
volume of 259.74 million shares. In the broader market, gainers outpaced losers 
by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad market measures also finished higher, with the NYSE composite index 
rising 1.03 points to 247.57 and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gaining 
2.25 points to 448.38. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq Stock Market composite index of mostly smaller companies moved 
ahead 5.53 points to 706.53, helped by rebounding technology issues. The 
technology sector had been under pressure for several days since a merger 
announcement involving Wellfleet Communications and SynOptics Communications 
was poorly received. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales reports from the nation's major retailers suggested that economic 
activity remained high in June. Industrywide, business was respectable for 
stores, but retailers that didn't do as well as the majority witnessed a 
selloff in their stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks found nothing inspirational about the bond market's performance. Bonds 
languished through a listless session, as traders treaded cautiously ahead of 
the release of monthly employment statistics. The key 30-year Treasury yield 
was nudged up to 7.60% from Wednesday's 7.59%. Its price, which moves in the 
opposite direction, was off 1/8 point in late trading, or $1.25 per $1,000 in 
face value.  
</P>
<P>
 With the Fed's apparent decision this week to leave short-term interest rates 
unchanged for now, market players were mulling the potential for a negative 
surprise in the June economic report. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Alexy, a market strategist at CS First Boston Corp., tied some of 
Thursday's price drop to selling by traders anticipating an unexpected jump in 
June jobs growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists believe the economy added about 285,000 jobs last month, with 
the unemployment rate edging up to 6.2% from 6% in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors will also be watching for developments from the weekend summit of 
leaders of the major industrial countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Group of Seven government leaders are meeting in Naples, Italy, 
where they are expected to discuss the dollar's recent slump against other 
major currencies and what consequences it might have on economic policies.  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar continued to fall Thursday, as participants in the G-7 summit 
indicated that a combined effort to support the greenback is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the U.S. currency fell to 98.75 Japanese yen from 98.95 yen 
Wednesday. The dollar closed at 1.575 German marks, up from 1.569. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Phillips Petroleum shed 1 1/4 to 31 7/8 after it reported disappointing 
results from the closely watched Teak sub-salt prospect, of which it owns 50%. 
Anadarko Petroleum, which owns the other 50%, tumbled 6 5/8 to 50 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some retail stocks bounced after reporting upbeat June sales figures. 
Dayton-Hudson rose 1 to 81 7/8, Wal-Mart gained 7/8 to 24 3/4 and Bon-Ton 
Stores added 1/4 to 9 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Others did not fare as well. J.C. Penney dropped 2 5/8 to 48 1/2. It 
reported a same-store sales rise of 6.8%, but Wall Street had expected a bigger 
gain at both its stores and its catalogue business. Best Buy lost 3 1/4 to 25 
3/8 and TJX lost 2 7/8 to 19 1/8. TJX warned Wall Street that its 
second-quarter net income will be lower than last year's because sales in May 
and June were below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among rebounding technology shares were some recently hammered computer 
networking stocks. 3Com rose 2 3/4 to 48 1/2 and Wellfleet Communications 
advanced 1 3/16 to 20 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * But software company Gupta fell 1 to 8 3/4 after saying it would probably 
lose 45 to 55 cents a share in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets were mixed. London stocks ended higher with the Financial 
Times 100-share average rallying strongly to end 17.7 points up at 2,964.4. In 
Frankfurt, the DAX-30 average closed at 2,043.85, up 8.15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average finished off 9.01 points at 20,620.02. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, the Bolsa index finished 24.40 points higher at 2,334.39.

COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT FUNDS IN JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Efforts to shield Los Angeles County's key law enforcement agencies from deep 
budget cuts were in jeopardy Thursday, as Chief Administrative Officer Sally 
Reed proposed additional cutbacks to offset state-imposed funding losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed has estimated that the county will lose at least $350 million under the 
state budget approved this week by the Legislature and awaiting Gov. Pete 
Wilson's signature. That is in addition to more than $107 million in local 
shortfalls that still must be dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors in May tentatively approved a $14.7-billion spending 
plan for fiscal 1994-95 that called for closing parks, pools, libraries and 
health clinics, and cutting other services to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors in recent months had sought to spare law enforcement from 
shouldering the major brunt of budget cuts, forging deals with the sheriff, the 
district attorney and the Probation Department that substantially held funding 
at current levels. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state's budget actions will likely nullify those deals. Reed is now 
proposing cuts of nearly $73 million for the Sheriff's Department, $25 million 
for the Probation Department and nearly $10 million for the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed cuts to public safety far outweigh those aimed at other 
departments. But Reed, in an interview, said that the cuts were evenly 
distributed -- about 11.8% across the board -- and that there was no attempt to 
single out law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that a sizable portion of the state-imposed loss -- $140 million -- 
comes from shifting additional property tax revenue from the county's general 
fund to schools. It is from the general fund that the sheriff, district 
attorney and Probation Department receive the bulk of their revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed called the current budget outlook grim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the resources in the long term to make this thing work at this 
level," she said. "We've been patching (the budget) together for years and now 
we're looking at a situation where we're barely able to hold onto services for 
a few months, let alone a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich described the proposed new cuts as "shocking." He 
said he could not comment fully because he had not reviewed the proposals in 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said the proposed cuts would require closure of four jail 
facilities, the loss of 7,500 jail beds and layoff of 1,000 workers, including 
more than 700 deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a time when the governor is beefing up state correction departments, when 
the community is expressing the need for law enforcement here in Los Angeles, 
when we are called upon to deal with civil disturbances like that in Huntington 
Park following the soccer match, she is suggesting we can cut 700 positions," 
said Fred Ramirez, director of administrative services for the sheriff. "It's 
got to have an impact on the community." 
</P>
<P>
 No one from the district attorney's office was available Thursday to comment 
on the proposed cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Probation Chief Barry J. Nidorf said the cuts would gut major parts of his 
department, virtually eliminating adult services, for example. Also eliminated 
would be Municipal Court investigations and special crime prevention programs. 
The cuts would result in about 680 layoffs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Decimated is probably not a strong enough word," he said. "It becomes 
critical in terms of public safety because the word will get out that no matter 
how bad a crime you've committed, probation's not going to supervise you," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other county departments are hit under the new proposals as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Department of Children's Services, already scheduled to lose nearly $12 
million, will now be asked to cut an additional $5 million from its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Department of Public Social Services, expecting a $5.3-million cut, 
would take an additional $8.7-million hit. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Parks and Recreation Department is being asked to take an additional 
$3.2-million reduction, on top of $6.8 million previously proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is scheduled to begin budget deliberations Wednesday.

WORLD CUP / U.S.A. 1994; A TREAT FOR FEET; SOCCERFEST OFFERS VICARIOUS THRILLS 
TO THE MANY SPECTATOR WANNA-BES

 Geoffrey Martinez wasn't too upset that his "banana kick" -- a trick shot on 
goal that must be angled around a wall of defenders -- missed its mark. The 
10-year-old had a lot of company. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey was one of 2,000 youths Thursday getting their kicks at SoccerFest, a 
giant soccer theme park, and many of his peers watched their shots bounce off 
the simulated defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey was undeterred. "It's fun," said Geoffrey, at the Los Angeles 
Convention Center with other members of the Wilmington Boys and Girls Club, 
"because everyone gets a chance, and because they don't care if you're good or 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 SoccerFest is a 500,000-square-foot soccer celebration opening to the public 
today and running until the end of the World Cup on July 17. Its organizers say 
the event, modeled after other professional sports parks such as the NFL 
Experience, is a chance for those who couldn't get to the World Cup to get a 
taste of the international festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really allows people to participate in the sport," said Peter Max, the 
pop artist whose wares are on display at SoccerFest. "They're able to collect 
pins, to see star players . . . to feel the real ambience of soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 SoccerFest, sponsored by Coca-Cola and a bevy of other corporations, including 
the Los Angeles Times, consists of more than 20 pavilions of soccer-related 
treats, plus three soccer arenas, an arcade and live music from all the World 
Cup countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant inflated soccer balls loom over displays on soccer history and soccer 
heroes while stands offer food from a variety of World Cup countries. Novices 
and lifelong fans can learn about the sport and test their skills at a variety 
of interactive booths and contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Local clubs and schools are scheduled to play on the fields during most of 
SoccerFest, but organizers say there will be opportunities for pickup games. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinics for all levels will be offered on the fields, some by such World Cup 
players as Paul Caligiuri of the United States and John Milla of Cameroon. 
Organizers say they expect other non-soccer celebrities to show up, from opera 
star Placido Domingo to boxer Sugar Ray Leonard, who was on hand Thursday. 
Pele, the Brazilian soccer legend, is also expected to make an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Caligiuri, the U.S. defender from Diamond Bar, said he wished he had access to 
an event like SoccerFest when he was young to get an introduction to the 
international aspect of the sport. He said if he was a youth coming to 
SoccerFest, he would "head straight to the radar gun and see how hard I can 
kick." 
</P>
<P>
 There are many other options for both the veteran athlete and rank amateur. 
Visitors can perform a flying bicycle kick or head shot on goal, falling into a 
cushioned pit. Or they can run a soccer obstacle course, or try to "juggle" a 
soccer ball with their head, shoulders and feet. (The world champion juggler 
will be there. He once juggled a ball for more than 18 hours, a record he will 
try to top July 15.) 
</P>
<P>
 Those not as comfortable with real soccer balls can use electronic ones. 
"Goalkeeper's Challenge" is a virtual reality-style game in which players watch 
members of either the United States or Mexican team fire away at the goal on a 
video display, and must move their own bodies to block the shots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For those less athletically inclined, there are pavilions where you need not 
do anything to become a soccer star. Would-be Peles can make their own soccer 
cards, selecting country and position. They can then go next door and record 
their own soccer video. In it, their image will be superimposed on footage 
placing them at the goal, blocking a shot with a header that sails across the 
field and scores the decisive World Cup goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make a kid feel like a star," said Brian Cury, president of the 
company that designed the videotape pavilion. "We promise we're going to put 
you on TV. It may be on your own TV, but it will be on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Prizes will be awarded for all sorts of achievements, from winning a beach 
soccer game to answering a question correctly during a clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, the first 5,000 people who get their SoccerFest passport stamped at 
15 pavilions will receive a SoccerFest pin. Pins will abound at SoccerFest, not 
only on the garments of early-birds, but also at a pin display, sales booth and 
trading spot. 
</P>
<P>
 SoccerFest is open through July 17, from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. except on July 17, 
when it closes at 6 p.m. Tickets purchased through TicketMaster are $9.50 for 
seniors and children 12 and under, and $13.50 for adults (including service 
charges). At the gate, tickets are $8 for seniors and children and $12 for 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds will go to charities and to provide new inter-city soccer fields and 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public, grass-roots events" like SoccerFest will create "the tangible legacy 
the sport needs to continue (in the United States) after the World Cup is 
gone," said SoccerFest executive producer Brad Rothenberg, who is the son of 
World Cup USA Chairman Alan I. Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 There was at least one convert on Thursday. Jimmy Granger, 7, looked around 
the cavernous hall and said: "I want to do everything."

EX-MANAGER OF BRADBURY GETS 2 YEARS IN PRISON; CRIME: AURORA (DOLLY) VOLLAIRE 
IS FINED $10,000 IN ADDITION TO AGREED-ON RESTITUTION. SHE SPENT THOUSANDS IN 
CITY FUNDS ON PERSONAL LUXURY ITEMS. 
</P>

<P>
 Former Bradbury City Manager Aurora (Dolly) Vollaire, who used the city's only 
credit card to ring up thousands of dollars for luxurious personal purchases, 
was sentenced Thursday to two years in state prison, ending a more than 
yearlong scandal that shook up city politics in the affluent foothill hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Vollaire, who also was fined $10,000 on top of restitution she had already 
agreed to pay, pleaded no contest April 22 to misuse of public funds and 
submitting fraudulent claims to the city in a plea bargain that did not involve 
any guarantees as to what her sentence would be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice was definitely served," Bradbury Mayor Bea Lapisto-Kirtley said 
Thursday. "I think it sends a clear message. . . . If you're an elected 
official, it's not your money. The money belongs to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer said in pronouncing the 
sentence that Vollaire knew what she was doing all along, that the thefts 
occurred over a long period of time and that the former city official had used 
the Bradbury city treasury as "her own personal piggy bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Revelations about how Vollaire was using city money began when two city 
gadflies dug evidence of wrongdoing out of the municipal trash bin. Later, 
documents showed that Vollaire spent tens of thousands of city dollars on 
designer sunglasses, shoes, china and fine crystal in shops from Laguna Beach 
to Barbados. The resulting scandal tarnished the reputations of the former 
mayor and a city councilman, who were recalled by voters, in part because of 
their failure to question or curb her spending. Both were brought down last 
year in a recall election and replaced by two new council members, including 
one of the people who had found the documents in the trash bin. 
</P>
<P>
 Vollaire, 54, had run Bradbury virtually single-handedly for more than two 
decades before she was accused by the district attorney's office of misspending 
more than $53,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday she came to court expecting to receive probation and a sentence of 
community service, said her attorney, Rayford Fountain. Instead, she was taken 
into custody by sheriff's deputies to begin serving her prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just in a state of shock," Fountain said. "She kept saying, 'I can't 
believe this is happening to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the two-year sentence, Ringer added a $10,000 fine, the maximum 
allowable under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Although letters of support had been sent to the court by Vollaire's friends 
and neighbors, Bradbury city officials sent numerous negative letters, Fountain 
said. "The mayor of Bradbury bad-mouthed her big time," Fountain said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lapisto-Kirtley said she simply provided names of other residents she felt 
should speak regarding Vollaire's sentence. The mayor said she also told the 
court about Vollaire's spending habits, management style and temperament. "If 
you crossed her, she went after you," said Lapisto-Kirtley. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury residents first learned of the scandal in March, 1993, after Robert 
Penney Jr. and Rick Barakat dug through city trash to retrieve discarded 
financial records and receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, an investigation by The Times showed that Vollaire had used the 
city credit card and petty cash funds to charge a wide range of personal items, 
from sweat suits at discount stores to dresses at designer shops such as 
Adrienne Vittadini. In many cases, receipts had been altered to conceal the 
names of stores and items purchased. In addition, The Times found that Vollaire 
added bills after the council had approved initial expenditures, getting the 
required signatures from city officials who failed to question the changes. Nor 
did the city's treasurer, a part-time volunteer who has since been replaced, 
question Vollaire's expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 An audit ordered by the city tallied the amount of misspent funds at $84,000 
over the past decade; the city sued in November, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office filed six criminal charges against Vollaire 
with a maximum penalty of five years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vollaire pleaded no contest in April, she agreed to pay the city 
restitution of $53,000. Then, on June 14, she settled the suit with the city, 
agreeing to pay a total of $110,000, including the restitution. The money came, 
in part, from her $85,000 city retirement fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Also felled in the scandal were former Mayor Audrey Hon, who was responsible 
for signing Vollaire's expense lists and checks, and Councilman Tom Melbourn. 
They were replaced in January by Barakat and Mark Flewelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Lapisto-Kirtley said the city has put the Vollaire Administration behind 
it. Last month, the council held a public meeting to discuss all aspects of the 
scandal. In addition, city officials now publish a monthly newsletter to spur 
community involvement, operate under new financial checks and balances and will 
update the general plan, city codes and council district boundaries, items 
ignored under Vollaire's management, the mayor said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JURY 
DEADLOCKS IN LAWSUIT CHARGING EXCESSIVE FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury deadlocked over an excessive force lawsuit filed by a man who claimed 
police overreacted when he fired a shotgun blast that wounded two officers. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge William Rea declared a mistrial this week when the 
eight-member jury found itself split 5-3 in favor of the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ike Hudson, 32, and seven others claimed that police, sheriff's deputies and 
Marines used excessive force when they fired 185 shots in response to the blast 
he fired at officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit seeking $339,875 named the city of Compton, the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department and individual deputies and officers as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities converged on Hudson's Compton apartment May 3, 1992, only a few 
days after the Los Angeles riots, after neighbors reported that a shot had been 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson claimed that a shotgun he was unloading in his apartment accidentally 
went off. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he did not hear police identify themselves when they pounded on his 
door. Believing he was about to be attacked by a man who had threatened him 
earlier in the day, Hudson fired one shot through the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The shot wounded two officers. Marines, deputies and other police officers 
outside returned the fire and fired again when they thought they saw a 
silhouette of a man with a gun and a muzzle flash at a kitchen window. They 
fired 185 shots into the apartment. No one inside was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson was acquitted on two counts each of attempted murder and assault on a 
police officer.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
INTERCHANGE NAMED FOR OFFICER WHO DIED IN QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State lawmakers renamed the Golden State-Antelope Valley freeway interchange 
Thursday in memory of the LAPD motorcycle officer who fell to his death when it 
collapsed during the Northridge quake.  
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Wayne Dean, a 26-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, 
was rushing on his police motorcycle to report for emergency duty when he drove 
off the end of a broken overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution sponsored by 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) to rename the junction as the Clarence 
Wayne Dean Memorial Interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to remember the courage Officer Dean had and the dedication he 
showed by trying to get to work so soon after the quake," Katz said. "He risked 
his life to help others and is a hero we should never forget." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, who lived in Lancaster, died in the pre-dawn hour when he did not see 
the severed bridge span. The 46-year-old officer is survived by his wife and 
two children.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; OLVERA 
STREET MISMANAGED, AUDIT BY CONTROLLER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle urged Mayor Richard Riordan on Thursday to appoint 
a commission to oversee the management of Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic tourist spot lies in the heart of the El Pueblo Plaza, the city's 
birthplace.Shops and restaurants give the square the ambience of a Mexican 
marketplace.  
</P>
<P>
 In an audit released Thursday, Tuttle's office identified what he called 
weaknesses in the plaza's management practices, including Cinco de Mayo 
celebrations that lost money in 1992 and netted only $360 in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 "El Pueblo currently lacks the direction and controls to operate effectively 
and attain its objectives," Tuttle wrote. "We believe this is the result of not 
having a commission to direct and ensure management controls."  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council created a seven-member oversight panel in 1992, but neither 
Mayor Tom Bradley, who retired last year, nor Riordan made any appointments.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer said Administration officials will announce the 
appointments in a few weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 The audit concluded that leases for El Pueblo merchants had remained static 
since 1987. Furthermore, auditors found no uniform basis for setting rents.  
</P>
<P>
 Auditors also reported that El Pueblo did not conduct competitive bidding for 
contracts, and the park director awarded consulting and construction contracts 
without the approval of the Recreation and Parks Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 The Recreation and Parks Department took over management of El Pueblo from 
state parks officials in 1990. The plaza's revenues are raised from parking, 
leases, special events, filming projects and souvenir sales.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; MAN 
WHO ALLEGEDLY POSED AS OFFICER CHARGED IN RAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 65-year-old film technician who allegedly posed as a Los Angeles police 
officer was charged Thursday with multiple counts of sexual assault after two 
victims identified him from mug shots, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weldon Norman of Covina was charged with kidnaping, rape and impersonating a 
police officer, among other crimes, said Phil Rabichow, a Los Angeles County 
deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman was charged in two assaults that took place June 29 and July 1 near a 
bus bench in front of a shopping center at Victory Boulevard and Vineland 
Avenue, said LAPD Detective Mike Coffey. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman wore a blue police jacket and carried a badge, a holstered handgun, 
handcuffs and a police flashlight and allegedly told his victims, young Latina 
women, that he was investigating their legal status in the United States, 
Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators identified Norman through DMV records when the first victim saw 
him near the bus bench the day after she was abducted and took down his license 
plate number, Coffey said.  
</P>
<P>
 Both assaults took place around 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, who used the alias Mark Weldon, was arrested Tuesday when police 
served search and arrest warrants at his home, Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first case was turned over to robbery detectives as a kidnaping because 
the victim told police that the man drove her around for a time before dropping 
her off. In the second assault, the victim said the man told her an identical 
story, and identified himself as a police officer before he drove her to an 
unknown location and assaulted her, Coffey said.

POLICE ARREST MAN OVER KIDNAP HOAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who claimed that his twin infants were abducted during a carjacking in 
Downtown Los Angeles was under arrest Thursday after telling police the 
incident was a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
 "He eventually told us he, in fact, did lie," Los Angeles Detective Richard 
Record said."We contacted relatives in El Paso, and they told us he does not 
have any kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators determined that the suspect, who first identified himself as 
Alexander Maldini of El Paso, Tex., is actually Abraham Rodriguez, 24, of El 
Monte, Record said. 
</P>
<P>
 Record said Rodriguez was arrested about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday on suspicion of 
providing false information to a police officer, a misdemeanor, and booked into 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez initially reported that his children were kidnaped about 6:30 p.m. 
Wednesday near Olive Street and Washington Boulevard, at the southern end of 
Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 He claimed that carjackers pulled a gun and demanded the keys to his 1990 Ford 
Mustang and told him to "hand it over or we will kill the babies." 
</P>
<P>
 But police became suspicious when Rodriguez's story -- related to them in a 
"very calm, very passive" manner -- was difficult to corroborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, police launched a massive hunt for the car, which detectives 
later determined does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our sole concern was for the kids," Record said. "We realized there was the 
possibility that he was lying from the beginning. But we did all the proper 
procedures."

MAN TO BE TRIED IN BEATING THAT LEFT BOY 'VEGETATIVE'; COURTS: TESTIMONY FROM 
THE TOT'S TWIN SISTER IS EXCLUDED BY THE JUDGE. FATEHEEN RAHMAN IS ACCUSED OF 
ATTEMPTED MURDER OF THE 4-YEAR-OLD BOY, WHO HE SAYS FELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Glendale man faces trial on attempted murder and child abuse charges, even 
though the prosecutor was unsuccessful in coaxing testimony from a 4-year-old 
girl -- the only other person who witnessed an alleged June 12 beating that 
left her twin brother severely brain-damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Fateheen Rahman, 22, who told police the boy hurt himself in a fall against a 
marble coffee table, will be arraigned later this month in Van Nuys Superior 
Court. After a preliminary hearing this week, Municipal Judge Jessica Perrin 
Silvers ordered him to stand trial on attempted murder and child endangerment 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 So small that most courtroom observers could see only her blond curls as she 
climbed onto the witness stand, Jessica Thivener sang into the microphone, 
asked for her mother and said, "I want to see Jason." She looked at pictures of 
twin brother Jason, who a doctor testified is "in a vegetative state" -- 
perhaps permanently -- from his injuries. She occasionally glanced at Rahman. 
</P>
<P>
 But she seemed afraid. She wouldn't tell Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin 
D'Agostino what she, and she alone, had seen, despite the prosecutor's gentle 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason's sleeping," Jessica said before trying to run from the witness stand 
on Wednesday. "Is Jason hurt?" D'Agostino prodded, and the child replied, 
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked how Jason had been hurt, Jessica said, "I don't want to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 The child's age and reluctance left Silvers little choice but to exclude her 
testimony. Later, away from the courtroom and safe in the arms of her mother, 
Jessica again was asked what happened to Jason. "Fateheen," she said, grabbing 
a toy clown by the neck and hurling it forcefully to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Silvers ordered Rahman, a native of Bangladesh, held on $500,000 bail. She 
also ordered him not to call or write the twins' mother, Tammi Thivener, 25, of 
Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Thivener said she blames herself for leaving her 
children with Rahman when she suddenly was called in to work at a department 
store where she had just gotten a job. 
</P>
<P>
 She had planned to marry him, she said, but "I don't have any feelings for him 
right now. I can't believe that someone so loving, so nice, could do something 
so horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedic Dennis Archie testified that Rahman told him that the children had 
been playing and that Jason stopped breathing when Jessica sat on him. Archie 
also testified that he saw Rahman "strike the baby with his fists, harder than 
you or I would." 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Irene Frizzell of the Los Angeles Police Department testified that 
Jessica had earlier told her that Rahman had choked them. The child first 
demonstrated by putting her hands around the detective's neck, Frizzell 
testified. Later, she grabbed a Barbie doll by the neck and threw it to the 
floor, Frizzell said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frizzell recounted that when she interviewed Rahman in the Van Nuys Jail the 
day after Jason was injured, he "was crying and distraught." He told her that 
he was tired and was trying to sleep on the couch, but the children were 
crying. He said he spanked them, and that made them cry more. The detective 
said he told her that he shook Jason, who broke free and accidentally banged 
his head on the coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his brain injury, Jason will probably spend the rest of his life 
"in a vegetative state," and his prognosis for recovery is grim, testified 
Antonio Galvis, a pediatrician at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. The 
4-year-old underwent surgery for the second time Tuesday, so doctors could 
install a permanent shunt to drain from his skull the fluid that gathers there 
because of his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Galvis, on duty at the hospital when Jason arrived by helicopter June 12, said 
the boy's brain was swelling so quickly his life was in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason was bruised on the left side of his head, neck, face and ear. Tiny blood 
vessels in his face had ruptured, indicating he had been choked, Galvis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned by defense attorney Richard S. Plotin, Galvis said he doubted Jason 
received his injuries by falling against a coffee table. He said the boy's 
injuries were the type he usually sees "only in the ones who fall from 
buildings or are in automobile accidents."  
</P>
<P>
 Outside of court, Thivener said she holds her son for hours at the hospital. 
It's the only thing that seems to calm his whimpering. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's lying there, his eyes are open, and he's crying," said Thivener. "I know 
he's in pain, that he feels everything, every poke," she said. "He needs a 
miracle. They said he'd die. For him to still be alive is a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 Plotin said outside court that Rahman felt so remorseful that Jason was 
injured under his care that he wrote Jason a letter. "He expressed his remorse 
and said he was sorry. He said he loved Jason and hopes he gets better," the 
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He feels devastated and ashamed," Plotin said. "He never intended any injury. 
This is a tragedy for everybody concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Thivener: "Maybe he didn't mean to do it, but he still did it."

GOP UNIT FINED FOR NOT DISCLOSING GIFTS

<P>
 The state's political watchdog agency Thursday fined a committee of the 
California Republican Party $25,500 for failing to disclose campaign 
contributions donated to seven GOP candidates in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the action, the Fair Political Practices Commission said the 
California Republican Party/Victory 1990 Cal Plan Committee had agreed to pay 
the fine as part of a settlement reached with the agency's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The election committee primarily was engaged in providing non-monetary 
assistance, such as direct mailers, political surveys and absentee ballot 
programs, to Republican legislative hopefuls. Among the candidates helped by 
the committee were GOP Assembly members Charles Bader of Pomona and Carol 
Bentley of El Cajon, both of whom lost state Senate bids. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to the commission, the GOP group "failed to timely report late 
non-monetary contributions totaling $555,144 to seven legislative candidates," 
all of whom lost their races. The donations were later reported.

2-YEAR SENTENCE UPHELD FOR FORMER LEGISLATIVE STAFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has rejected a plea to reduce the sentence of Capitol 
corruption figure Darryl Freeman and ordered him to surrender Aug. 2 to begin 
serving a two-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton had allowed Freeman, 46, a former 
legislative staffer who will turn 47 on Monday, to remain free since his 1992 
sentencing, pending appeal of his conviction.A jury in October, 1991, found him 
guilty of conspiring and aiding in the extortion of more than $30,000 from an 
FBI agent. The agent, as part of a sting operation aimed at corruption in the 
Capitol, was posing as a businessman seeking favorable action on a bill in 
exchange for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the jury's finding, and the U.S. 
Supreme Court declined to review the case.

CSUN TO PUSH FOR LIBRARY REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fearing that the lack of a permanent library might trigger an exodus of 
students and faculty, Cal State Northridge officials have decided to push to 
reopen the university's earthquake-damaged Oviatt Library this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is a switch from a decision made in May, when officials said they 
would replace temporary on-campus library facilities with a warehouse-type, 
tilt-up concrete structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The tilt-up structure would have cost about $4 million to build, about half 
the cost of reopening Oviatt, said Doug Davis, CSUN's associate dean of 
libraries. However, it would have held only about one-quarter of Oviatt's 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got to the point where we could fully analyze everything, we realized 
(reopening Oviatt) was a far superior solution," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Construction is under way to make about 60% of Oviatt usable by Aug. 29, the 
first day of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to cost about $7 million, CSUN spokesman Mike 
Hammerschmidt said. About 90% of the cost will be covered by a grant from the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance program. The balance will be 
paid with tax money from previous bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The work includes structural repairs to the 220,000-square-foot Oviatt and 
consolidating all of its 1.1 million volumes into the original 
130,000-square-foot center of the building.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the quake damage was to the two newer wings of Oviatt, CSUN's only 
on-campus library. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bit of a squeeze, but a huge improvement over what we had in the 
spring," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that it may still be two years or more before the entire 
library is usable. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's enrollment had already been slipping when the Jan. 17 temblor heavily 
damaged the campus, and officials were concerned that the lack of a permanent 
library would prompt some of its more than 25,000 students and faculty to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Oviatt's collection of books and reference materials is currently housed in 
two emergency facilities on campus -- a 15,000-square-foot hall known as the 
North Annex and the 13,000-square-foot Lindley Dome.  
</P>
<P>
 Both facilities will continue to be used this fall for some library activities 
and study space, Davis said. Another dome will also be built next to Lindley 
Dome to provide additional study space.  
</P>
<P>
 The university also had established a shuttle service for students and faculty 
to use UCLA's library facilities in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the decision to reopen Oviatt came at a meeting between CSUN's top 
administrators, faculty representatives and the university's consulting 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge campus suffered an estimated $350 million in damage as a result 
of January's quake.

MET ROOKIE JACOME SHUTS OUT DODGERS; BASEBALL: LEFT-HANDER GIVES UP SIX HITS 
WHILE WINNING, 3-0, IN HIS SECOND MAJOR LEAGUE APPEARANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has been forced to look in his imaginary book again, in the back pages -- 
anywhere -- trying to find a cure for the Dodgers' hitting woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although hitting instructor Reggie Smith thinks he has identified the problem, 
the solution still eludes him, and it showed Thursday night in the Dodgers' 3-0 
loss to the New York Mets at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to come up with something," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 38,194, the Dodgers were beaten by another left-hander, this one Jason 
Jacome, a minor league call-up who replaced Dwight Gooden on the roster and 
pitched a complete game in his second major league appearance. Jacome (1-1) 
held the Dodgers to six hits, dropping the Dodgers to 9-16 against 
left-handers. But it isn't only lefties the Dodgers are having trouble against. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot going on in the players' minds right now, other distractions," 
Smith said. "Some will say that they are trying to stay focused, but if that's 
the case, then they are not focused. Because if you try, then you aren't." 
</P>
<P>
 With a probable players' strike looming, Smith thinks the pressure of staying 
in first place is taxing some of the players. He believes they are thinking 
about how they have to maintain the division lead, rather than playing with 
abandon. Thursday's loss dropped the Dodgers' lead over second-place Colorado 
to three games, their slimmest margin since June 27.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the team's hitting, which has led the league most of the season, 
now ranks fifth. During the 11 games of this home stand, the Dodgers are 
hitting .234 and averaging 3.2 runs a game. Neither Tim Wallach, Eric Karros 
nor Mike Piazza is hitting above .176 in those games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not executing, not getting on, not getting runners over and hitting 
too many fly balls," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had meetings and they are aware of what they need to improve and they 
are working on it, but it's hard being a first-place team over a 162-game haul. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it's like (facing a work stoppage) -- I have gone through four of 
them. But in '81, we were just playing, we didn't know what was going to 
happen. We didn't know that you needed to be in first place (in case of a 
strike). These guys do." 
</P>
<P>
 The slump isn't team-wide, as Raul Mondesi's three-for-four performance 
indicated Thursday. And Wallach singled in his first two at-bats. But only one 
Dodger reached third base -- Cory Snyder in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Karros, though, says he doesn't believe his slump is caused by outside 
distractions. "I can't speak for everybody, but speaking on my behalf, that's 
not the problem," he said. "I'm just not hitting the ball well, and when I do 
hit it well, I hit it at somebody. Tim (Wallach) and Mike (Piazza) haven't been 
swinging well lately either, and you can't have three guys not swinging well. I 
have got to get out of it as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first inning, it appeared the Dodgers were breaking out. Mondesi, who 
batted third in place of Piazza, who had the day off, and Wallach hit 
consecutive singles, but were stranded when Karros grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things start going wrong nothing phases me, I'm the type of guy who 
keeps my composure," said Jacome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been watching Bret Saberhagan for a while now and I have learned from 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Candiotti (6-4) held the Mets to six hits but was beaten in the fourth 
inning, when the Mets scored three runs on a homer by Todd Hundley, two singles 
and got a couple of breaks, including a walk to Joe Orsulak, who eventually 
scored on a comebacker that went off Candiotti's palm and chest.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I would have fielded it cleanly, we would have gotten out of the inning, 
but in the end, it wouldn't have mattered," Candiotti said. "You have to tip 
your hat to the other pitcher. You know, I was out there reflecting back to my 
second major league start, when I threw a shutout (for Milwaukee) against the 
Angels, and the other pitcher was Tommy John. I'm happy, well not happy for 
him, but he did a good job."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ASTROS GET A WORKOUT, THEN BEAT THE CUBS, 9-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apparently, a little extra exercise didn't tire out the Houston Astros on 
Thursday night in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 They had to walk the final two blocks to Wrigley Field after a car ran a red 
light and struck their team bus. No one was injured in the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros had 17 hits and turned five double plays as they beat the Cubs, 
9-3, for their sixth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Biggio had four hits against the Cubs for the third time this season and 
drove in three runs. Steve Finley and Scott Servais added three hits apiece for 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one of those things. You don't figure it out. It just happens 
sometimes and I've been lucky," Biggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember an offense as good as this one since I've been here, as a 
unit," added Biggio, whose four-hit game was his second in five days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros (49-36) are 13 games over .500 for the first time since Aug. 21, 
1989. The Cubs, meanwhile, fell to a season-low 15 games under. They haven't 
been that far under .500 since July 1990, when they were 16 games under. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Kile (6-3) beat the Cubs for the first time in his career after three 
losses. He gave up seven hits in six innings but was backed by four double 
plays in the first five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Servais homered to give the Astros a 3-1 lead in the fourth, and consecutive 
doubles by Caminiti and Kevin Bass in the fifth made it 4-1. Gonzalez had 
another run-scoring single for a four-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley tripled for his third hit to give the Astros a 6-1 lead in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess that's why they have five guys on the All-Star team," Cub Manager Tom 
Trebelhorn said. "We haven't gotten whacked like this in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 7, San Diego 0 -- Ken Hill pitched a five-hitter at San Diego to win 
his 13th game and join Jimmy Key of the New York Yankees for the most wins in 
the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrin Fletcher, who hit a two-run homer in the ninth to give the Expos a 4-2 
victory over the Dodgers, hit a three-run homer in the first inning to give 
Hill (13-3) all the support he would need. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Floyd hit a two-run double as the Expos pounded Andy Ashby, who began 
the game with a 2.81 earned-run average, the third-lowest in the National 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashby (4-7) yielded six runs and six hits in 4 1/3 innings, matching his 
shortest outing of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 8, Pittsburgh 7 -- Kevin Mitchell singled home the winning run with 
one out in the bottom of the 11th inning to give the Reds their 25th 
come-from-behind victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Garcia and Jay Bell singled home runs in the top of the 10th to give 
the Pirates a 7-5 lead, but Hal Morris hit a two-run homer against Blas Minor 
to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor walked Jacob Brumfield to open the 11th and Tony Fernandez sacrificed. 
Barry Larkin walked and Mitchell followed with a single just inside the 
third-base line. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 2, Florida 1 -- David Nied pitched a seven-hitter and Andres 
Galarraga hit a tiebreaking single in the eighth inning at Joe Robbie Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the Rockies' fourth in a row, equaling their longest of the 
year. Florida has lost five of six. 
</P>
<P>
 Nied (8-4) retired the last nine batters as he won his third consecutive 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin shortstop Kurt Abbott dropped Eric Young's high-hopper for an error to 
start Colorado's rally in the eighth. Walt Weiss walked, and after an out, 
Galarraga singled to drive home the unearned run.

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS ROLE MODEL DISCOVERS THAT FAME CAN BE FLEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 PGA player of the year Nick Price, who won the Western Open the same day 
fellow South African Simon Hobday won the U.S. Senior Open, spent his younger 
years learning golf from none other than Hobday. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days," Hobday said, "Mark McNulty and Denis Watson and Nick Price 
were all youngsters when I was playing and they used to come and say, 'Mr. 
Hobday, can we sit here in the back and watch you practice?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say, 'Fine, as long as you keep quiet.' Nowadays, if I play in a 
tournament when they are there they say, 'What are you doing here, you old 
man?' You know, things change. I used to be Price's hero and now he is mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Hobday: The story goes that Hobday, a chain-smoker nicknamed "Scruffy," 
once asked a clothing manufacturer for $500,000 for not wearing the company's 
line of golf shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was named the No. 1 major league prospect in the California 
League in 1988 by Baseball America? 
</P>
<P>
 Szechwan preferred: Seattle Mariner pitcher Chris Bosio sidestepped questions 
about his heated argument with umpire Durwood Merrill on Monday with this 
explanation: "We were just talking about Chinese food. We were just talking 
about our favorite restaurants. He likes the hot food. I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Big, big John: John Daly reinforced his reputation as the biggest hitter in 
golf at the Scottish Open this week. He hit a tee shot measured at 425 yards on 
the 525-yard 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Did they both count?Fred Tenney, a first baseman for the 1908 New York Giants, 
apparently had an unusual sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Tenney stole second base as 
Cardinal pitcher Bugs Raymond held the ball. On the next pitch, Tenney ran back 
to first. On the following pitch he again stole second. 
</P>
<P>
 The umpires huddled but could find no rule prohibiting a steal in reverse. 
Reverse stealing subsequently was declared illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick contract: The Sacramento Kings didn't hesitate to pay No. 1 draft pick 
Brian Grant his asking price. He was presented a case of Dr Pepper and a bag of 
potato chips at the announcement party to unveil the team's newest player. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my pay right here," Grant joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant had said he was so happy to be drafted he'd play for a can of pop and 
some chips. The forward from Xavier in Cincinnati was the No. 8 choice in the 
NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Knows his place: When Detroit pitcher Kurt Knudsen's earned-run average soared 
to 13.50, he was sent down to the Tigers' triple-A club in Toledo. It didn't 
surprise him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected it," Knudsen said. "Let's face it, would you want me on your 
pitching staff?" 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Ken Griffey Jr. of the San Bernardino Spirit.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: BASEBALL SEASON GETS LATE START ON NETWORK TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coming Tuesday, a real oddity: Baseball on network television. 
</P>
<P>
 All baseball on television so far this season has been on local stations or 
cable, but the networks are finally getting into the act. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC will televise Tuesday's All-Star game, then the new baseball network kicks 
into gear July 16 with the debut of "Baseball Night in America," which will 
have a 12-week run. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC will have the first six weeks, NBC the second six -- provided there's no 
strike by the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes postseason play, with ABC carrying the first, best-of-five playoff 
series, NBC the league championship series and ABC the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 16, ABC's featured game in Los Angeles at 5 p.m. will be the Dodgers 
at Philadelphia. The announcers will be Chris Wheeler, a Phillie announcer, and 
Jim Kaat, formerly of CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 The main difference between this Dodger telecast and one on Channel 5 -- 
besides the absence of Vin Scully, Ross Porter and Rick Monday -- is that ABC 
can switch to any of 12 other telecasts at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a good thing, or will it be distracting? A lot will depend on how well 
it's done. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's second night will be July 18, when the featured game in Los Angeles, at 
8 p.m., will be Boston against the Angels at Anaheim, with Al Michaels, Tim 
McCarver and Jim Palmer calling the action. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's other nights will be July 25, Aug. 6, Aug. 13 and Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC takes over Aug. 26, and all its games will be on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are 15 announcing teams on the baseball network, among them NBC's "A 
team" of Bob Costas, Joe Morgan and Bob Uecker and ABC's "A team" of Michaels, 
McCarver and Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13 other teams are made up mostly of local announcers. The Dodger 
announcers are not included, nor is the Angels' Ken Brett. The Angels' Ken 
Wilson is, and his partner is Bert Blyleven. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the baseball network teams regularly work together, and some 
announcers the network sought couldn't do it because their employers didn't 
want them appearing on a competing station. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the case with the Dodgers. Brent Shyer, the Dodgers' director of 
broadcasting, said the team, in consultation with Channel 5, sought to keep the 
local telecasts unique. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if you have Vin Scully, you don't let him go off and work on 
another station. When he was NBC's main baseball announcer, that was a 
different case. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Costas, Morgan and Uecker will work together for the first time on the 
All-Star game. To get ready, they had only one dress rehearsal -- at Yankee 
Stadium on Wednesday night, when the Yankees played the Oakland A's. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Costas: "I've actually been practicing by watching tapes of the 1975 
World Series (when Morgan played for the Cincinnati Reds) and reruns of 'Mr. 
Belvedere' (the ABC sitcom Uecker starred in)." 
</P>
<P>
 During a conference call with the three announcers this week, the possibility 
of a strike-shortened season was discussed at length. But Costas said it will 
not be a big part of Tuesday's telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really see the All-Star game, maybe more than any other game, as kind of a 
celebration of baseball, a respite from everything else," Costas said. "And 
while we'll probably acknowledge the strike possibility in the broadcast and, 
in a very general way, perhaps touch on some of the issues, it's not the 
appropriate place to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who know my approach know that I like to talk about issues, but I try 
to find the appropriate forum to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan had one suggestion for expediting negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think salary cap is a bad word in this negotiation," he said. "I think 
there's another term that needs to be used, another way of getting to the 
point. I think you've seen what a salary cap or free agency has done for the 
NFL. It's put it in turmoil."

 Sports award shows come and go, but one that has caught on is the "Jim Thorpe 
Pro Sports Awards" show. Now in its third year, it will be televised Monday, 
9-11 p.m., by ABC from the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're over the hump," said Ken Wolfe, the creator of the show who is 
also the executive producer of ABC's "Monday Night Football." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've established ourselves in the sports world as a real credible, 
quality show, and one that is going to be around for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe created the show and produces it with Dick Clark. ABC is only the 
carrier. Among the celebrities scheduled to take part are Paul Newman, Lloyd 
Bridges, Morgan Freeman, Danny Glover, Paula Abdul, Gloria Estefan, Dennis 
Hopper and "Blossom's" Joey Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Curry, star of ABC's "Hangin' With Mr. Cooper," is the host. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Aaron will be on hand to accept the Thorpe Lifetime Achievement Award. 
Previous winners are Joe DiMaggio and Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky will be presented the Thorpe Legacy Award, Don Shula the Career 
Achievement Award, and the NBA's Chris Webber will be honored as the best 
rookie in any sport. Winter Olympic gold medalists Dan Jansen and Oksana Baiul 
will also receive special awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners in 10 categories will be announced during the show. Three finalists in 
each category were selected by a panel of sports legends and journalists. For 
example, the panel for football includes Willie Davis, Gale Sayers and Roger 
Staubach, and journalists Frank Deford and Jim Murray.

 Wolfe was always inspired by Thorpe, the legendary athlete who died in 1953 at 
the age of 65, and was even more so after reading "Jim Thorpe: World's Greatest 
Athlete." The book was written by former ABC colleague Bob Wheeler, who is now 
vice president of public relations for Texas-based Liberty Sports, the division 
of TCI (Tele-Communications, Inc.) that recently acquired Prime Ticket and also 
owns 13 other regional sports networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler's book, first published by the University of Oklahoma in 1979, is in 
its fifth printing and has sold more than 300,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorpe, an Indian orphan born on a settlement in Oklahoma, overcame all odds 
to become arguably this country's greatest all-around athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe's awards show is a reminder of that greatness. TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The All-Star game will be NBC's 38th, but first since 1989. . . . Greg Gumbel

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; LASORDA NOT SET ON BULLPEN ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda, when told about Todd Worrell's comments the previous 
night about Lasorda's using him as the set-up man and closer, replied that 
Worrell is entitled to say whatever he wants. "I have no comment on that," 
Lasorda said before Thursday's game. "When a pitcher tells me he feels good, I 
put him in there. When he tells me he doesn't feel good, I don't put him in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Lasorda was asked if he buys into the present-day method of assigned 
roles in the bullpen, i.e., the set-up man preceding the closer, who pitches 
only one inning, Lasorda had a lot more to say.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't buy into that at all, and I never will buy it," said Lasorda, who 
prefaced his comments by saying he was not referring to Worrell. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of times when Ron (Perranoski, pitching coach) would report to me 
before each game about what each guy is capable of doing, he would say 
so-and-so says he can give you an inning," Lasorda said, his temper warming. 
"Finally I had enough, so I had a meeting with all the pitchers and said what 
the hell is this one inning bit? How do you measure an inning? What if it's 
only three pitches? What if it's 14? 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . You go out there and you pitch. When you say you can't pitch, then you 
don't pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell pitched the eighth and ninth innings Wednesday, giving up three runs 
in the ninth in a loss. Afterward, he questioned why Lasorda wasn't using other 
relievers in the set-up role.

 Jim Gott will start Friday for the Bakersfield Dodgers on a rehabilitation

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; PALMER AND LEARY TOO MUCH FOR INDIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dean Palmer continued his clutch power hitting with two home runs and five 
runs batted in, and Tim Leary gave Texas another solid outing as the Rangers 
beat the Cleveland Indians, 6-4, Thursday at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer's two-run homer in the fourth inning tied the score, 2-2, and his 
three-run, 438-foot homer in the fifth put the Rangers ahead to stay, 6-3. 
Eight of his last nine homers have tied a game or given Texas the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 13 games, Palmer has hit nine homers, driven in 19 runs and 
raised his average from .229 to .268. He had a two-homer game for the third 
time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary, despite pitching out of trouble much of the game, earned the victory in 
his first start of the season. He began the season at Ottawa, Montreal's 
triple-A team, and was signed by the Rangers on June 29. In his first 
appearance for Texas last Saturday, he gave up one hit and struck out five in 4 
2/3 innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary, pitching for his seventh major league team, gave up eight hits, four 
runs and two walks in 5 2/3 innings. He is the 12th starter the Rangers have 
used this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland's leadoff hitter reached in each of the first three innings, and 
Paul Sorrento's two-run single in the second put the Indians ahead, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 But Indian starter Charles Nagy also was struggling, and he gave up Palmer's 
first homer and a run-scoring double to Manuel Lee in the fourth inning that 
gave Texas a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland tied the score, 3-3, in the fifth on Omar Vizquel's single, but 
Palmer's second homer gave Texas the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Henke pitched the ninth for his ninth save, striking out Jim Thome with 
the bases loaded to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 6, Baltimore 4 -- Geronimo Berroa singled in two runs to cap a 
three-run sixth inning at Baltimore that helped the Athletics move eight games 
under .500 for the first time since April 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland has won five in a row and 13 of 14. The victory was Oakland's 12th in 
its last 13 road games. The A's are .500 on the road (23-23) for the first time 
since they were 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 9, Detroit 5 -- Robin Ventura broke out of a two-for-23 slump at 
Detroit with a double that started a four-run second inning and then hit his 
14th homer in the fifth to give the White Sox an 8-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox have won 15 of 19 games. The Tigers have lost three in a row and 
13 of 16 to fall eight games under .500. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 4, Boston 3 -- Aaron Sele limited the Mariners to one run and three 
hits in eight innings at Fenway Park, but they got three runs and six hits in 
the last two innings against reliever Ken Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Newfield, who had only one hit in his previous 15 at-bats, led off the 
10th with a double and moved to third on Dan Wilson's sacrifice. Brian Turang 
then lined a single to center to drive in Newfield with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 33rd home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 4, Minnesota 3 -- Rob Butler scored from third on Rick Aguilera's wild 
pitch with two out in the ninth inning at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, who ran for for Darnell Coles after Coles' leadoff single, advanced to 
third on Dick Schofield's one-out single. After Mark Guthrie struck out John 
Olerud, Aguilera came on and threw the wild pitch to Devon White, the first 
batter he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Castillo (4-1) blanked the Twins on four hits for 3 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 8, Milwaukee 3 -- Mike Macfarlane's three-run homer highlighted a 
six-run seventh inning for the Royals at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Eldred (9-9) took a three-hit shutout into the seventh but gave up a 
leadoff double to Felix Jose and a homer to Brent Mayne to cut the Brewer lead 
to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Shumpert then singled, stole second and scored on David Howard's single. 
With two out, Brian McRae walked and Macfarlane hit an 0-1 pitch over the 
left-field fence for his 12th homer.

TIMING ISN'T RIGHT FOR BO AND ANGELS; BASEBALL: IT'S A LONG DAY AS JACKSON 
STRIKES OUT FOUR TIMES IN A 5-2 LOSS TO THE YANKEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bo Jackson was deep in sleep Thursday morning when he was startled by a loud 
noise -- his alarm clock going off. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 6 o'clock and he wasn't supposed to get up for another four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 So he reached over and threw the clock, smashing it to pieces against the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of start should have told Jackson what the day had in store for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's days like this that you wish you could snap your fingers and disappear, 
and go to the North Pole and watch polar bears all day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Jackson had to spend his day at Yankee Stadium, where in the Angels' 
5-2 loss to the Yankees, he struck out four times, booted one ball, juggled 
another, accidentally flung his bat into the stands, got into an argument with 
plate umpire Durwood Merrill, was fined by Merrill and probably earned a spot 
back on the bench for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is a bitch, anyway, and then you've got to come to New York to play the 
Yankees," Jackson said. "You know, I've always hated this place." 
</P>
<P>
 And he couldn't recall a less satisfying afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a day," he said. "I owe Durwood $100. I owe the hotel $50 for the clock. 
And Bill Clinton gets his cut. Everybody got a piece of me today." 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of Jackson's troubles was Yankee starter Jimmy Key. Key (13-2) 
struck out Jackson three times, each time with a runner on base. Jackson, who 
has not hit the ball out of the infield against Key this season, has a .139 
lifetime batting average against him and has struck out 15 times in 36 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather face (hard-throwing) Randy Johnson (of Seattle) than Jimmy Key any 
day," Jackson said. "He'll throw soft, softer and softer. Then he'll bust you 
in on a fastball and make it look like a Mach 3." 
</P>
<P>
 Key, tied with San Diego's Ken Hill for the major league lead in victories, 
yielded six hits and two runs in seven innings. Wade Boggs, starting at first 
base for the first time since 1982, broke a 2-2 tie with a run-scoring single 
against Mark Langston (5-5) in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a mistake and I paid for it," Langston said of his 0-2 pitch to Boggs. 
"When you go against Jimmy Key, you're not allowed to make too many mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat was the Angels' 24th in 37 games and left them at 36-50. It is only 
the second time since 1978 that they have lost 50 games before the All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
 Key was tough on everyone in the lineup except catcher Chris Turner, who went 
three for four and was robbed of another hit. But no one endured more 
punishment than Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 He struck out in the second inning with a runner on base, his bat flying into 
the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 He struck out again in the fourth, this time looking. He threw his helmet and 
bat to the ground, screamed at Merrill, and was fined $100. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know what Durwood was thinking behind the plate," Jackson 
said. "It's mind-boggling sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the sixth inning, he struck out with Chili Davis on second. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seventh, his defense let him down. The Yankees had Randy Velarde on 
first and Gerald Williams on second with two out when Langston got his 0-2 
count on Boggs. The next pitch was supposed to be up and in but it sank and 
Boggs slapped it into left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson ran in to field the ball but kicked it away instead, allowing Williams 
to score easily. Langston kicked the mound in frustration, then, on an 0-1 
pitch to Danny Tartabull, slipped on the mound and helplessly watched Tartabull 
hit another single to left. This time, Jackson picked up the ball, then dropped 
it and Velarde scored. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the eighth, Jackson struck out for the final time, this time against 
Bob Wickman with runners on first and third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no excuse, no excuse at all for what happened," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sun will shine somewhere today."

<P>
 Second baseman Harold Reynolds, exasperated by his reserve role, said he will 
ask General Manager Bill Bavasi to trade him, or possibly even release him by 
the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, a two-time all-star and three-time Gold Glove winner, has started 
only three games since June 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating, especially when the team is losing and I know I can 
contribute," Reynolds said. "Everybody has a chance to win a job but me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have been trying to trade Reynolds, but talks with the Seattle 
Mariners stalled when the Mariners decided to promote shortstop Alex Rodriguez 
and move shortstop Felix Fermin to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who is batting .239 and has 10 stolen bases, lost his platoon job 
when the Angels moved Damion Easley from third to second base. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a month since Marcel Lachemann was hired as manager of the Angels, 
but Yankee starter Jim Abbott still is trying to get used to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Buck Rodgers was a very good manager," Abbott said. "I was 
surprised the Angels would go another direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, I was surprised that Lach came back. I really respect him. He could 
have gone on being one of the most respected pitching coaches, but he decided 
to take a challenge. It was a bold move." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Chris Turner was robbed of a spot in the Angel record book when Yankee 
second baseman Pat Kelly made a diving catch of Turner's line drive in the 
fifth inning, ending his streak at seven consecutive hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner could have tied the franchise record held by Jim Fregosi, Dan Ford and 
Bobby Grich. He shook off his misfortune and got two more hits for a three-hit 
game. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 A 30-foot high inflatable soccer ball tethered outside the Rose Bowl means 
different things to different people.For some, it offers a shady respite as the 
weary World Cup fan sits and chows down on a $4 hamburger. For others, it 
serves as a handsome backdrop for those "Hey Uncle Bebeto, wish you were here" 
family photos.

 And for many, it's an industrial-strength graffiti ball.

 Hristo Stoitchkov, Bulgaria's star midfielder, is a quote machine. He is the 
Al McGuire of the soccer world. 
</P>
<P>
 After his team had beaten Mexico in the round of 16, its best showing in World 
Cup competition, Stoitchkov, who spends most of his time in Spain and is a star 
for FC Barcelona, said, "Today, God was a Bulgarian." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in his career, according to the Chicago Tribune, Stoitchkov was banned 
for two months from the Spanish League after stamping on a referee's foot while 
disputing a call. His comment on that? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing against referees," he said. "The best man in my wedding was a 
referee." 
</P>
<P>
 Hristo's given name means Christ in Bulgarian, to which Stoitchkov responds: 
"There are only two Christs. One plays for Barcelona, the other is in heaven."

 The Dutch reporter who caused an international uproar by claiming he had a 
bomb in his computer as a chartered flight was about to take the Netherlands 
national team to Dallas, is not allowed to leave the country. Lex Muller of 
Rotterdam is in Dallas awaiting a decision by U.S. authorities, who are 
considering whether to charge him for his hoax.His newspaper, Alegmeen Dagblad, 
reportedly has recalled him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third incident involving the Dutch and reporters. When the 
Netherlands arrived in North America to prepare for the World Cup, its flight 
into Toronto was taken off course by about 40 miles because a reporter was 
using a computer during landing. Later, when the team was flying from Orlando 
to Washington, the plane had to make an emergency landing in Richmond, Va., 
because a reporter was suffering from indigestion. ELLIOT ALMOND

 The big story Thursday in Ireland was the return of the Irish team, led by 
Coach Jack Charlton.  
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Albert Reynolds greeted players at Dublin airport and held a 
private champagne reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best ambassadors we have are Jack, the squad and the supporters," 
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team was then flown by helicopter to Phoenix Park, where an estimated 
100,000 fans, Irish pop groups and other singers were on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Republic of Ireland President Mary Robinson welcomed the team, 
declaring, "It is very important you have come back for this welcome and 
celebration by the Irish people. The team played with wonderful Irish 
supporters and won all our hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd went wild when Charlton walked on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Charlton: "I am sorry we didn't win the World Cup for you. Every player 
here did his utmost and I can ask no more from them. It's nice to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the overwhelming welcome that observers wondered what it would have 
been like if Ireland had made it beyond the final 16.

 For one 40-year-old soccer fan in Bangladesh, life simply wasn't worth living 
after Argentina blew its chance to win the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning that his South American heroes had been knocked out of the 
tournament, Dabul Sarder swallowed poison, the United News of Bangladesh 
reported. He was taken to a hospital in the Western Pabna district, where 
doctors declared him dead Wednesday.

 Forget the heat. The French sports daily, L'Equipe, has declared that the 1994 
World Cup is "very cool." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still too early to know if the grafting of (soccer) will take on the 
outer-Atlantic," the newspaper said in an editorial Tuesday. "On the other 
hand, we can affirm that the World Cup is the nicest in history. As a relaxed 
American would say: Fun." RANDY HARVEY .

 Sure, Tab Ramos' injury hurt. As did Claudio Reyna's. As did John Harkes' two 
yellow cards during the first round. As did a distressing lack of Hagis, 
Baggios and Romarios. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real reason the United States soccer team sits on the World Cup 
sidelines today? 
</P>
<P>
 Those darned blue socks. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team wore navy blue knee-highs in three of their four tournament 
games -- and did not win one of them. The Mission Viejo Blue Sox went 0-2-1 -- 
tying Switzerland, 1-1, on a great goal by Eric Wynalda, and failed to score in 
successive 1-0 losses to Romania and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 But in their white socks, the Americans were undefeeted -- looking the height 
of fashion in a 2-1 upset of Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 For future reference, it should be noted: No United States team has ever won a 
World Cup while wearing blue socks. MIKE PENNER

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; SPOTLIGHT; HE SPEAKS IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE,

 The award for the most frustrating interview of the World Cup goes to Mexico 
Coach Miguel Mejia Baron. He is a well-composed man who doesn't duck the press 
after games, win or lose.But when he answers questions, it is in a language 
apparently spoken only on the moon. Baron has never met a question he hasn't 
deflected. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he is quoted on the official biography sheet as saying, "I like 
the players' attitude of taking part in their game regardless of anything and 
regardless of the rival." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so perhaps that is only a bad translation that somehow got into print. But 
listen to some postgame quotes, specifically after Tuesday's embarrassing loss 
to Bulgaria when the better team, his, didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What was your thinking near the end of the game when you didn't put 
in Hugo Sanchez? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "Hugo and I talked and there was a possibility that he would have been 
a sub." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why no substitutions at all near the end, when your team was dead tired and 
you were in overtime? Didn't that seem logical? 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Logic is a very relative thing. Logic to you may not be logic to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican reporters say they are able to read between the lines with Baron. If 
they can, it is journalism at its highest interpretive level. BILL DWYRE

 Brazilian journalists said Thursday that Romario, one of the team's star 
forwards, declared the Netherlands team is not as competitive or spirited as 
the U.S. team, which it defeated in the second round, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutch Coach Dick Advocaat and his players, who will face Brazil in a 
quarterfinal Saturday at Dallas, had varied reactions when Romario's sentiments 
were relayed to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocaat saw the statement as a ploy to get the Dutch to doubt themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know Romario very well because he played in Holland for a number of 
years," he said, referring to Romario's five-year stay with PSV Eindhoven. "I 
know he must have a reason he said what he said." 
</P>
<P>
 Said goalkeeper Ed De Goey: "That is his conclusion. I think I have another 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Frank Rijkaard dismissed Romario's words. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he has the right to say anything he wants," Rijkaard said. "We will 
see how it goes on the field." HELENE ELLIOTT

 In the 1990 World Cup, eight teams won at least one game. This time, 12 teams 
won at least once. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven teams went home without a victory in 1990, but only five teams 
experienced that embarrassment this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring is up in this tournament, too, compared to 1990. Through the first two 
rounds, 118 goals were scored, an average of 2.68 a game. There were 100 goals 
in the first two rounds in Italy, an average of 2.27. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the first two rounds of the 1990 World Cup had 18 games in which the 
teams scored no more than one goal. That has happened only 11 times this year. 
There have been only two scoreless matches, compared to four in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellow cards are up: 195 have been issued, compared with 131 four years ago. 
Thirteen red cards have been shown, two more than in 1990. HELENE ELLIOTT

 Dunga was not a happy midfielder after Brazil's 1-0 victory over the United 
States. He looked upset and snapped terse answers during the postgame news 
conference on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But once his answers in Portuguese were translated into English, Dunga seemed 
like another boring athlete mouthing cliches. After a few minutes, the quotes 
didn't seem to be getting any better. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunga was a virtual quote machine, according to a Brazilian journalist, who 
gave a . . . well, more interesting account to the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three Americans called us names," Dunga said. "It is not the way to play 
soccer. The result of the game is the way to answer what they said." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the three American players, their names were not revealed in either 
language -- English or Portuguese. LISA DILLMAN

<P>
 British Assn. football: a game for gentlemen played by hooligans.

<P>
 Rugby Union football: a game for hooligans played by gentlemen.

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; DELAHOUSSAYE HAS GOOD LUCK WITH SARDULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Brian Mayberry and jockey Eddie Delahoussaye were leaning on the 
railing of a backstretch porch that overlooks the track at Hollywood Park. They 
were having some fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, if there are only three horses in (Sunday's $200,000 Hollywood Oaks), it 
will be a jockeys' race," Mayberry said. "But I'm not worried, because I've got 
the smartest jockey in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayberry looked at Delahoussaye, and Delahoussaye looked at Mayberry, and 
Delahoussaye laughed. He will be riding the multiple stakes winner Sardula for 
Mayberry in the Oaks, which may indeed have only three starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, at least I'll have the smartest jockey in the race," Mayberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoussaye laughed again. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's if (Chris) McCarron's out of town," Mayberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoussaye continued laughing. He always rides Sardula. He has ridden the 
3-year-old filly eight consecutive times -- to six victories and two 
second-place finishes -- and in many of the races Sardula did all the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven months ago, at Del Mar, she broke in with a 10-length victory. A month 
after that, she won the Del Mar Debutante by 7 1/2 lengths. In April, after a 
layoff of almost four months, she won the Santa Paula Stakes at Santa Anita by 
8 1/2 lengths. Then last month at Hollywood Park, she won the Princess by 5 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've ridden a lot of good fillies, but this one might be the best," 
Delahoussaye said. "Going short or long, she impresses you. She can do it all. 
In Kentucky, I think I only hit her once. I didn't have to. When she got to the 
front, her momentum just kept carrying her." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year at Santa Anita, Phone Chatter, the eventual division champion, 
handed Sardula her only losses, by half a length in the Oak Leaf and by a head 
in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. Phone Chatter has resumed training after 
suffering an ankle injury in the Breeders' Cup, but in her absence, Sardula had 
all she could handle in the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs on May 6, beating 
the undefeated Lakeway by a half-length. Lakeway will be one of her two or 
three rivals in the Hollywood Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 On behalf of his clients, Jerry and Ann Moss, Mayberry bought Sardula at a 
Keeneland yearling auction for $110,000. Before the sale, Mayberry and his 
wife, Jeanne, looked at this daughter of Storm Cat and Honor An Offer, and 
labeled her what they call a "gotta-have." 
</P>
<P>
 In his sales catalogue, Mayberry had penciled in the figures $150,000 to 
$250,000 as Sardula's probable price. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a feeling that Storm Cat was going to break out as a sire," Mayberry 
said. "And of course he has. (His son, Tabasco Cat, won this year's Preakness 
and Belmont Stakes.) This filly came from Crestwood Farm, which I know well. 
Pope McLean does a fine job of raising horses there. I thought Sardula would 
have brought at least $200,000. We would have gone to more than $200,000 to get 
her, because you rarely see a horse that looks this good." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why Sardula went for only $110,000, Mayberry said, "She's a great 
example of why you should go to all the sales. Anomalies can happen. Maybe 
another guy (who would have bid) was at the bar, having a drink. Maybe another 
guy was on the phone, talking to his girlfriend. I don't think it was any 
secret that this filly was in the sale. She was a stickout." 
</P>
<P>
 Sardula beat Phone Chatter by 7 1/2 lengths in the Del Mar Debutante, and 
after that result flip-flopped in the Oak Leaf. Mayberry believes that his 
filly lost the Breeders' Cup because of a change in the track surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one way one day, and another way the next," he said. "They dug up the 
inside, and it was very deep down on the rail, where we were. My filly ran 
seven lengths slower than she did the previous time." 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-December, Sardula rebounded with a victory in the Hollywood Starlet, 
then Mayberry gave her an extended rest, keeping her at the barn but subjecting 
her to only a light training program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had nothing to do with soundness, because she wasn't unsound," Mayberry 
said. "You can start early running 2-year-olds, but if you've got one that you 
think is really going to be good, there's a time frame when they do most of 
their growing and developing. You've got to use that window of opportunity to 
give them some time off. But we kept Sardula's muscle tone up the entire time 
she was away from the races." 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoussaye will ride her Sunday in the 1 1/8-mile Oaks, then go into a San 
Gabriel clinic Monday for a 45-minute operation on what has been diagnosed as a 
deviated septum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be an out-patient, and I should only miss about a week," said 
Delahoussaye, who has been ill most of the spring with a virus that knocked him 
off mounts in the Preakness with Numerous and the Belmont Stakes with Strodes 
Creek. Despite his frequent absences, Delahoussaye ranks seventh nationally 
with $4.4 million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sardula has given him more than $300,000 of that total, while pushing her 
overall earnings over the $800,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's good at anything from 5 1/2 furlongs to a mile and an eighth," Mayberry 
said. "I think she could be the best sprinter in the country if we wanted to 
crank her up." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Mayberry, who has won the last four runnings of the Landaluce Stakes 
with Rhapsodic, Zealous Connection, Fluttery Danseur and Garden Gal, takes two 
shots in Saturday's $100,000 race with Chordette and How So Oiseau. The 
favorite will be Serena's Song, who will be running an eighth of a mile farther 
than she did in winning by 10 lengths at five furlongs on June 25. Serena's 
Song is trained by Wayne Lukas, who trained Landaluce, the winner of this stake 
in a record 1:08 when it was called the Hollywood Lassie in 1982. Landaluce, 
undefeated in five starts, was voted champion juvenile filly after she died 
from a virus at the end of the year. She was buried in the Hollywood Park 
infield. Others running Saturday are Cat's Cradle, a contender who drew the 
inside post; and Marfa Smeralda, Metro Link, Dymaxion, Texinadress, Embroidered 
and Dancin At The Wire. Serena's Song, to be ridden by Gary Stevens, drew the 
No. 9 post.

 Brocco, idle since running fourth in the Kentucky Derby, won't run in the 
Swaps Stakes on July 23. The Santa Anita Derby winner, scratched out of the 
Belmont Stakes because of a bruised foot, probably will return to action at Del 
Mar. . . . Corey Nakatani rode three winners Thursday, two at 17-1 and 19-1.

 Bob Lohr, a 10-year PGA Tour veteran with only one victory, more than offset a 
three-putt bogey with 11 birdies Thursday as he posted a 61 in the opening 
round of the Anheuser-Busch Classic at Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 There have only been two scores better than Lohr's 10-under-par round, the 59s 
of Al Geiberger at Memphis in 1977 and Chip Beck at Las Vegas in 1991, and nine 
rounds of 60, the latest by Davis Love III at Hawaii in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never made 11 birdies in a round before," Lohr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohr's score was one stroke lower than his previous best round. He opened with 
a 10-under 62 on the way to winning the 1988 Walt Disney World Classic.

<P>
 In his first bout since defeating Michael Carbajal last February for 
two-thirds of the major light-flyweight titles, Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez is 
scheduled to fight Armando Diaz in a 10-round nontitle fight tonight at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, 38-2 with 26 knockouts, is about to decide whether to pursue a third 
fight against Carbajal or move up to take a shot at one of the flyweight 
titles.He fought and defeated Diaz (22-16, eight KOs) last November. 
</P>
<P>
 In the previous Diaz fight, Gonzalez threw more than 1,000 punches in 10 
rounds, according to computer statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Gonzalez's last tuneup before the Carbajal rematch at the Forum, in 
which Gonzalez won a decision and the International Boxing Federation and World 
Boxing Council championships and avenged his knockout loss to Carbajal in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 10-round bout scheduled to precede the main event, undefeated 
junior-middleweight Alfred Ankamah (10-0, 10 KOs) will fight Luis Vasquez 
(29-6, 25 KOs). TIM KAWAKAMI

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; REYNOLDS MIGHT SEEK TRADE OR RELEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Second baseman Harold Reynolds, exasperated by his reserve role, said he will 
ask General Manager Bill Bavasi to trade him, or possibly release him by the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, a two-time all-star and three-time Gold Glove winner, has started 
only three games since June 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating, especially when the team is losing and I know I can 
contribute," Reynolds said. "Everybody has a chance to win a job but me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have been trying to trade Reynolds, but talks with the Seattle 
Mariners stalled when the Mariners optioned second baseman Rich Amaral 
(Estancia High, Orange Coast College) to triple-A Calgary to make room for 
shortstop Alex Rodriguez. Shortstop Felix Fermin was moved to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who is batting .239 and has 10 stolen bases, lost his platoon job 
when the Angels moved Damion Easley from third to second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaral, 32, was benched during Monday night's game in Baltimore by Manager Lou 
Piniella after committing two errors. Amaral has made a team-high 15 errors 
this season. He was hitting .276 with four home runs and 17 runs batted in in 
66 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, 18, the first player chosen in the June 1993 draft, was recalled 
Wednesday night from double-A Jacksonville (Fla.) of the Southern League. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Chris Turner was robbed of a spot in the Angel record book when Yankee 
second baseman Pat Kelly made a diving catch of Turner's line drive in the 
fifth inning, ending his streak at seven consecutive hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner could have tied the franchise record held by Jim Fregosi, Dan Ford and 
Bobby Grich. He shook off his misfortune and got two more hits for a three-hit 
game. BOB NIGHTENGALE

PHEBUS ADJUSTS ATTITUDE, DISMANTLES FOES; TENNIS: SINCE LOSING OPENER IN PAC-10 
CHAMPIONSHIPS, UCLA PLAYER HAS TAKEN HER GAME TO A NEW LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keri Phebus wasn't difficult to locate Wednesday at the Rancho San Clemente 
Tennis and Fitness Club. She was at least half a foot taller than most 
competitors at the Toshiba Tennis Classic Opportunity Tournament, a 
pre-qualifier for the pro tournament at La Costa during the first week of 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Since entering UCLA almost two years ago, Phebus has grown from 5 feet 11 1/2 
to 6 feet 1. She is undoubtedly the Pam Shriver of women's college tennis. But 
if the last two months are any indication, Phebus' growing pains appear to be 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 The unseeded Phebus pulled off upset after upset in reaching the NCAA final in 
May, and Thursday made Laura Richards, a three-time All-American at the 
University of San Diego, look like a club player in trouncing her, 6-1, 6-0, in 
less than a hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's good, but I'm playing well," said Phebus, who graduated from Corona del 
Mar High in 1992. "I wouldn't say it was easy, but I had to play well." 
</P>
<P>
 Phebus blew away Richards' spins, slices and moonballs with an aggressive net 
game that left her opponent helpless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working on coming in all along, but I'd be so awkward up there," she 
said. "I'd have no balance, no center of gravity. Now, I feel comfortable 
coming in, that's my game style now." 
</P>
<P>
 The more Phebus talked about the growth in her game, the bigger her smile 
seemed to get. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken me so long," she said. "Finally, I can move without feeling 
uncoordinated. It's all coming together. I've had to be patient. I've had my 
ups and downs, but it's all coming together." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Phebus says, the best is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wins like this give me a lot of confidence because I know I still have so far 
to go," she said. "Some people, they reach their peak now and I'm just 
beginning to realize my peak. My game's about 25% of where it could be and that 
gives me a lot of incentive." 
</P>
<P>
 But just three months ago, Phebus said her incentive was all but gone. She was 
a first-round loser and the Pac-10 championships in Ojai and she figured tennis 
might not be the best thing for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Geez, what is this going to take?' " she said.  
</P>
<P>
 " . . . Sometimes you have to go through the valleys before you hit your 
peaks. I was like Death Valley. I was like below Death Valley, ready to pack it 
up and pack it in." 
</P>
<P>
 But within a month, Phebus was proving to herself and the NCAA tournament 
seeding committee that she still could play. Phebus, who finished her sophomore 
season at UCLA 34-4 in singles and ranked No. 7 nationally, said she has been 
proving people wrong throughout her tennis career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to deal with a lot of doubts all through my junior career," she 
said. "I was ranked No. 1 in the country every single age division, yet I never 
was acknowledged for the national team or anything like that. Then I get into 
college and it's the same thing. I was ranked No. 10 (among NCAA women) going 
in. They seed 16 players, but I didn't get seeded. And of course, they put me 
against a seed in the first round. It's been good for my character. It's caused 
me to find my hope in other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Along her journey, Phebus has discovered something else about herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought school was important, now it's one of my top priorities," 
said Phebus, who is majoring in sociology. "Not only is tennis becoming fun, 
but school is too." 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, Phebus said there is no chance of her leaving school early to join 
the pro tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely want to finish it,' she said. "These past two years have been 
the best years of my life, so I've got to finish it." 
</P>
<P>
 Phebus said her parents have always told her to finish what she started. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of my parents' heads, they always knew I was going the slower 
route, one step at a time," she said. "Be top in the juniors, be top in 
college, then be top in the pros. Most people aren't even top in the juniors 
before going pro. 
</P>
<P>
 "They realized that I needed a lot of growing up. When I wanted to go play pro 
tournaments, they would just tell me to stay in school. That's been a good 
thing. I didn't seem good then, but it is now." 
</P>
<P>
 So Phebus will spend the rest of the summer and the next two years, preparing 
her mind and body for the professional tour. She leaves Monday for an 
exhibition tournament in New Jersey. She is also hoping to play in the 
Manhattan Beach tournament, the U.S. Open and the Toshiba Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Three more victories at Rancho San Clemente will earn Phebus a spot in the 
32-player Toshiba qualifying tournament and her first points on the World 
Tennis Assn. computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping to play a lot of pro events while I'm college to get my ranking 
up," she said. "I really don't want to do that satellite grind thing. It's just 
not appealing. I'd like to be ranked in the top 100 by the time I graduate from 
college." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Keri Phebus will play Susan Starrett of Los Angeles in today's quarterfinals. 
Other quarterfinals will include Rita Marie Pichardo of Beverly Hills vs. Susan 
Hawke of San Diego or Katrin Kilsch of Palm Desert, Ella Perkin of Poway vs. 
Lisa Alipaz of Anaheim Hills and Newport Beach's Cecelia Ampuero vs. Newport 
Beach's Danielle Scott. The tournament's top-seeded player, Laxmi Poruri of 
Stanford, withdrew because of an injury.

PANAMA RESCINDS OFFER TO HOUSE HAITI REFUGEES; CARIBBEAN: ABRUPT REVERSAL SENDS 
U.S. OFFICIALS SCRAMBLING TO MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS FOR 10,000 PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration struggled Thursday to salvage its latest Haiti 
policy, thrown into disarray by Panamanian President Guillermo Endara's abrupt 
cancellation of an agreement to accept up to 10,000 refugees picked up at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Endara's decision, announced at a Panama City news conference, came less than 
24 hours before the U.S. government had planned to open a Panama camp with the 
first 500 Haitians transferred from temporary quarters at the U.S. Naval Base 
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panamanian leader, installed in 1989 after a U.S. invasion deposed former 
dictator Manuel A. Noriega, had been under intense pressure from business and 
political interests in his country who opposed housing the refugees. He said 
Washington changed the conditions of the agreement, and accused the 
Administration of pressuring him excessively to go along with it despite the 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They scolded us as if we were little children," Endara said in an interview 
with Cable News Network's Spanish-language service. "They tried to intimidate 
us and pressure us, when we were simply trying to do them a favor. Instead of 
treating us like friends, they treated us like enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton's special envoy to Haiti, William H. Gray 
III, conceded that Panama's withdrawal was a serious blow, but he vowed to sign 
up other countries, probably Caribbean island republics, to take up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that agreements in principle have been reached with Grenada, Dominica 
and Antigua. He did not know exactly when refugee camps on those islands will 
be ready, but he predicted: "They will be up and running very shortly." 
</P>
<P>
 All Haitian refugees plucked from the seas will be accommodated, although the 
10,000 spots in Panama will be very difficult to replace, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The policy will go forward . . . and we expect that it will be successful," 
Gray told a State Department news conference, delayed for almost four hours 
while the Administration struggled to deal with Endara's bombshell. "We will be 
able to provide for those who would be going to Panama." 
</P>
<P>
 An American official familiar with the negotiations said that Endara 
originally was pleased with the deal but that he shied away when domestic 
opposition began to mount. 
</P>
<P>
 "He miscalculated a lot of things," the official said. "He broke it to the 
newspaper owners but had done nothing to prepare the public. There's a little 
bit of xenophobia (in Panama), and a lot of racism where Caribbean blacks are 
concerned. He got cold feet, and he could not be persuaded to change his mind. 
He dug in and became intransigent." 
</P>
<P>
 Endara will be succeeded in September by President-elect Ernesto Perez 
Balladares, who greeted the refugee plan coolly. He said that the United States 
should bear the responsibility of caring for the Haitian refugees and that 
their stay must be for a definite, short period and not open-ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, the Administration had announced that it would double from 
six to 12 the number of immigration inspectors assigned to interview potential 
refugees on the ground in Haiti in an effort to speed the handling of asylum 
seekers following Washington's preferred course. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration wants Haitians who fear political persecution to apply for 
asylum at the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince or at two provincial locations 
rather than risk fleeing the island nation by sea. The White House has 
announced that only Haitians who apply "in country" will be considered for 
admission to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have doubled our staff in country by the beginning of next week, and 
we hope soon thereafter to further increase the number of people there so that 
we can cut through the backlog," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Jamie S. Gorelick. "We 
are trying to enhance our ability to address people's asylum claims in 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorelick said potential refugees who apply in Haiti are subjected to "a fairly 
rigorous review, consistent with U.S. law and standards, to determine whether 
individuals have a legitimate and well-founded fear of persecution based upon 
their membership in a social group, a political group (or) national origin." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a time-consuming process and can be dangerous, because Haitians who 
visit the embassy could be subject to reprisals. Thousands of Haitians have 
sought to circumvent the procedure by putting to sea in small boats, knowing 
that the U.S. Coast Guard is poised to pick them up. The Administration had 
hoped to send such refugees to Panama, where they would face spartan conditions 
intended to lessen the attraction of the camps as an alternative to life in 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 
said before Endara's announcement that the camps would be virtual prison 
compounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are closed camps," she said. "Their basic needs will be provided for, 
(and) they will be safe. But they will not be able to work, they will not be 
receiving money of any kind and they will be allowed to stay in the camp in 
Panama (only) until political conditions in Haiti improve to the point that 
it's safe for their return." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard intercepted at least 1,537 Haitians in 34 boats Wednesday, 
bringing the total to more than 15,000 since June 15. About 10,000 Haitians are 
now at Guantanamo Bay, and 3,200 more are aboard American ships headed to the 
U.S. base in Cuba. The Pentagon said the capacity of the Guantanamo Bay 
facility will be increased to 20,000 to compensate for the loss of the Panama 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere Thursday, a contingent of 2,000 Marines boarded warships at Morehead 
City, N.C., as part of a four-ship amphibious-ready group ordered to station 
off Haiti. Officials said the Marines are intended to evacuate American 
citizens should conditions grow dramatically worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, officials here confirmed that U.S. Army Rangers and Navy SEAL 
commandos conducted secret exercises near Eglin Air Force Base in Florida two 
weeks ago to rehearse the possible seizure of airfields and ports in Haiti 
should the President order such an attack.

<P>
 Just hours after he was chosen president of this country of contradictions, an 
exasperated Ernesto Samper was tackling his first post-election meeting with 
international reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been 17 questions in this press conference, and 14 have been about 
drug trafficking," he complained to the assembled journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "That," he said, "is Colombia's problem." 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed as though Samper was less bothered by the fact that his country is 
the world's largest cocaine producer than by the fact that the foreign press 
was focusing on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The undeniable influence of the multibillion-dollar drug business at so many 
levels of Colombian life has created a society in conflict with itself. 
Appearance and image often take precedence over a dirty reality. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a society that cleaves to formal niceties and politeness, yet has one of 
the highest homicide rates on the planet -- approximately 85 per 100,000 
people. It is an extremely legalistic society, yet one where fewer than 5% of 
its murderers are ever brought to justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia is the center of the international cocaine trade, yet Colombians are 
increasingly tired of that single label. Many Colombians bridle at hearing 
their country described as a "narco-democracy," but they are constantly 
confronted with reports of drug money infiltrating political campaigns, law 
enforcement agencies and even their beloved soccer teams. The shocking slaying 
last Saturday of soccer star Andres Escobar, for example, may be linked to 
angry traffickers who lost money on Colombia's elimination from the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern for image, combined with a volatile sense of nationalism, has 
created a deep ambivalence about the drug war among many Colombians, who say 
they would like to clean up their government and institutions but who resist 
and resent pressure from Washington to fight the traffickers more forcefully. 
Increasingly, Colombians speak of legalizing drugs and accommodating 
traffickers as an alternative to the head-on, violent confrontation that has 
claimed hundreds of lives. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Colombia seems schizophrenic about the war on drugs, Washington too has 
been sending mixed signals to the Colombians. The confusion only compounds 
frustration and suspicion at both ends and ultimately weakens efforts to 
staunch the flow of illegal narcotics at a crucial time -- just as the Clinton 
Administration is reviewing its Andean drug strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colombia is a strangely paradoxical country," said anthropologist and drug 
expert Alfredo Molano. "A great portion of public opinion, and the government, 
is against drug trafficking from a legal point of view, and from a moral point 
of view.  
</P>
<P>
 "But economically, it fills the pockets of many people -- not just the rich 
but the poor too. In spite of everything, the cultivation and trafficking (of 
narcotics) has provided the country with certain economic stability. Therein 
lies the ambivalence." 
</P>
<P>
 Samper, who narrowly won Colombia's presidential election June 19, has been 
dogged ever since by new drug scandals that once again pose a dilemma for 
Colombians. To accept that the allegations are true would be to accept the 
worst about the Colombian system. 
</P>
<P>
 Two cassettes of taped telephone conversations, sent surreptitiously to 
journalists days after the election, reveal overtures made to Samper's campaign 
by the Cali cartel, the sophisticated operation that U.S. officials say 
controls an estimated 80% of the world's cocaine trade. 
</P>
<P>
 One tape, the authenticity of which was verified by Colombian officials, 
contains three conversations between the heads of the Cali cartel, brothers 
Gilberto and Miguel Angel Rodriguez Orejuela, and a journalist who has worked 
as their go-between. They are heard matter-of-factly planning to offer at least 
$3.75 million to Samper's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In a second tape, the authenticity of which has not been verified, Gilberto 
Rodriguez says that he has already deposited about $4 million in Samper's 
coffers and expects the future president to respond with unspecified favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing President Cesar Gaviria, who is from the same political party as 
Samper, attempted to quash the second tape by prohibiting local television from 
airing it, saying it violated a new law that bans broadcast of statements by 
criminals. Gaviria knew of the first tape before the election but kept it 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper acknowledged that the Cali bosses repeatedly offered contributions, but 
he denied accepting them. He said his own code of ethics plus legalistic 
mechanisms set up with accountants prevented the entry of dirty money into his 
campaign. But Samper did not address the fact that most such money is laundered 
or passes through third parties before reaching its destination. 
</P>
<P>
 In many countries, a scandal of this ilk would sink a politician, but Samper 
went on vacation and is expected to weather the storm. Similar accusations have 
arisen in past campaigns and faded away. Samper, as head of the presidential 
campaign of Alfonso Lopez Michelsen in the early 1980s, was alleged to have 
accepted money from the Medellin cartel; a committee of Colombian politicians 
cleared Samper of the charge then. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite great consternation among American officials, who demanded an 
explanation from Samper, domestic reaction to the latest scandal was mild, an 
almost disinterested shrug from a public already accustomed to, even weary of, 
such news.  
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper and radio headlines concentrated on how the story was playing 
abroad, and on the damage that was being done to Colombia's reputation. Some 
blamed the messenger -- one of the tapes was publicized by the man Samper 
defeated in the election, Andres Pastrana. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is bothersome in all of this is not whether or not there is 'hot money' 
in the campaigns, which is an undeniable reality in this country," Maria Jimena 
Duzan, a leading columnist and author, wrote in the newspaper El Espectador. 
"It's the opportunistic and low way that Pastrana manipulated the information 
on the cassette. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one day, (Pastrana) returned us to those dark days when, to prove that we 
were not in league with the narco-traffickers, we had to offer our lives and 
submit to all U.S. pressures." 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique Santos Calderon, a columnist with Bogota's largest daily, El Tiempo, 
said: "This scandal again places narcotics trafficking at the center of all 
that occurs in this country. . . . I can imagine the delight of Sen. Kerry and 
all the things that the gringo and international press are going to speculate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Kerry, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, has become a favorite 
target of Colombian criticism since April, when he publicly quoted a drug 
trafficker labeling the country a "narco-democracy." His comments came amid an 
escalating dispute between officials in Washington and Bogota over the tactics 
used to go after traffickers. The dispute, in the opinion of many experts, has 
eroded the working relationship between the countries and fueled Colombian 
ambivalence and American mistrust, while giving a break to the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drug war in Colombia is in very, very sad shape," said a senior U.S. 
official. "It's probably never been worse. The kingpins are not being attacked, 
and their power is only increasing with nothing to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia began changing tack on the drug war in 1991, during Gaviria's first 
year in office and following the assassination of three presidential candidates 
and a justice minister. Bowing to a demand from master criminals such as Pablo 
Escobar, the government rescinded its extradition treaty with the United 
States, sparing narcos the possibility of appearing before a U.S. court. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years that followed, Gaviria's government began a policy of 
plea-bargaining with traffickers who turned themselves in, confessed and gave 
up part of their business. But as the policy seemed to offer increasingly 
lenient sentences to brutal thugs, American support faded. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the controversy in the past year has centered on Colombia's principal 
law enforcement official, Gustavo de Greiff, who is in charge of bringing 
traffickers to justice. He has repeatedly angered American officials by 
advocating the legalization of drugs and by openly declaring the drug war a 
lost cause. 
</P>
<P>
 His most egregious sin in the eyes of American officials is his willingness to 
negotiate with the Cali cartel bosses. Under the plea-bargaining policy, the 
Rodriguez brothers and other leaders would spend little time in jail, and their 
fortunes would remain largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Such accommodation outrages U.S. law enforcement agents, yet De Greiff and 
other Colombians see it as the only practical way to put a dent in a business 
conducted by men who can pay millions of dollars and kill with ease to protect 
themselves. A military offensive would exact too high a toll, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colombia has no other way out, unless it has a suicidal calling to conduct a 
fundamentalist religious war, exposing itself to all forms of destruction," 
said political scientist Alejandro Reyes, an expert in Colombia's endemic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no other possible solution. Kill all drug traffickers? (The 
offensive against drug czar) Escobar cost us 500 to 800 lives. . . . A 
civilized country cannot sacrifice the lives of 500 people, and how many 
police? How many judges? Just to give us the pleasure of seeing the fall of 
Rodriguez Orejuela? If we can do it with negotiation -- he goes to jail, stops 
killing, stops trafficking, pays a huge fine -- that would be a great deal for 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas the Medellin cartel attacked the government head-on with car bombs and 
terrorism, the Cali bosses have more subtly damaged the government and economy 
through bribes and a complex system of shell companies and middlemen. 
</P>
<P>
 In retaliation for De Greiff's policies, Washington late last year suspended a 
longstanding practice of sharing evidence with Colombian judicial officials, 
paralyzing an estimated 50 drug-trafficking cases. The tensions between 
Washington and Bogota were inflamed further in May, when the Pentagon abruptly 
halted the use of American military radar and spy planes to track suspected 
drug flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinpointing the flights as they made their way from Peru and Bolivia, where 
the raw material for cocaine is grown, to Colombia, where the drug is produced, 
and on to the United States, had been a pillar of the international 
interdiction effort. But the Pentagon said it feared legal liability if 
Colombia or Peru began shooting down planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Radar operated by U.S. military personnel in Colombia's Amazonian jungle led 
to the interception in the past two years of more than 400 illegal flights 
carrying 300 tons of cocaine, Colombian and U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that relative success, Colombian officials were shocked and baffled by 
the sudden suspension of the intelligence-gathering effort. Gaviria's 
government had taken the political heat that came with allowing American 
military personnel to operate in national territory because a greater good -- 
the stopping of drug flights -- was served. The Colombians felt as if they had 
cooperated, only to have the rug pulled out from under them. 
</P>
<P>
 The loud, clear signal to the Colombians was that the United States was 
withdrawing from the front lines of the drug war. And if that was the case, why 
should Colombia make greater sacrifices? 
</P>
<P>
 "This (the suspension) is not something that is done among friends," said Maj. 
Gen. Alfonso Abondano Alzamora, commander of the Colombian air force. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Pentagon's action apparently stunned and angered U.S. Congress 
and State Department officials as well. President Clinton last month asked for 
legislation that would restore the radar and the spy flights, and a law that 
accomplishes that is before the House. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombians had a right to be angry, said Rep. Robert G. Torricelli 
(D-N.J.), who chairs the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Western 
Hemisphere affairs and follows narcotics issues. "The Colombian government had 
been challenged to take a stand and interdict the narco-traficantes ," he said, 
"and no sooner had they begun (than) the United States government withdrew its 
cooperation. . . . It put all of us in an embarrassing position." 
</P>
<P>
 Torricelli, citing intelligence from the Drug Enforcement Administration, said 
drug flights jumped 20% after the radar was turned off. 
</P>
<P>
 While this particular issue may be resolved, it became symbolic of the 
deterioration of a cooperation that once existed between the United States and 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing movement among intellectuals such as Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez to legalize drugs as a way to make the trade less profitable, and a 
Colombian high court's recent decision to decriminalize small amounts of 
marijuana and cocaine, raised further questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaviria, who opposes legalization, argues that his government has fought the 
good fight, pointing to the killing by police of Pablo Escobar last December 
and the dismantling of the Medellin cartel. But some wonder if the more 
insidious Cali cartel has not been allowed to operate virtually unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good number of Escobar's henchmen are in jail, and people feel, finally, a 
sense of relief," said political scientist Rodrigo Losada, an expert in drug 
violence. "But if you look below the appearances, you see the business of 
narcotics trafficking is as powerful as ever. There have been symbolic cases 
that bring tranquillity to people, but it does not change things deep down."

STRONG BAN ON SMOKING SENT TO WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN and DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Culminating a long legislative battle, the Assembly on Thursday approved a 
strong statewide ban on smoking in restaurants and most other indoor 
workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a year of lobbying, arm-twisting and arguing, the smoking 
prohibition cleared the Assembly on a 48-22 vote, and now heads to Gov. Pete 
Wilson. His office declined to say whether the governor will sign the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was authored by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood), who 
originally wanted a flat-out ban on smoking in all indoor workplaces to protect 
the public from the effects of secondhand smoke. But Friedman ran into heavy 
opposition from tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the final version passed by the Assembly bore the markings of 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from restaurants, the ban covers offices, stores, factories, hospitals 
and other large enclosed workplaces. Exempted are bars, hotels, warehouses in 
which 20 or fewer employees work, and businesses that employ five or fewer 
employees where all agree to allow smoking and where minors are not allowed. 
The bill also would permit smoking in theaters and movie sets where smoking is 
part of the production, tobacco shops, medical research facilities looking into 
the effects of smoking, and nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman's legislation retains a provision allowing cities and counties to 
impose tougher smoking restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have overcome a relentless and deceptive campaign by the tobacco 
companies," Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that despite the compromises added in the state Senate, the 
legislation will "balance the protection of workers with the accommodation of 
the reasonable needs of business." 
</P>
<P>
 When Friedman introduced his bill last year, even his supporters doubted that 
he would be successful, given the tobacco industry's long history of killing 
anti-tobacco bills in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry fought hard, sending teams of high-priced lobbyists from 
Sacramento and Washington to kill Friedman's measure. On several occasions, it 
seemed as if they had succeeded, only to have Friedman line up key votes by 
making compromises and amending the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Indicating the stakes involved, the industry-funded Tobacco Institute and the 
nation's two largest tobacco companies, Philip Morris U.S.A. and R J R Nabisco, 
spent more than $1.5 million on lobbying and legislative campaign donations 
last year. They have spent more than $750,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And the fight is not over. California voters in November will decide the fate 
of an initiative sponsored by Philip Morris.  
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would invalidate Friedman's bill and bar local governments from 
enacting smoking bans. It would set up a statewide standard permitting smoking 
in portions of restaurants and other indoor workplaces, so long as they meet 
state ventilation standards. However, those standards are not intended to 
alleviate the health consequences of breathing other people's smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris spent $491,000 on the petition drive to qualify the measure for 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Lee Stitzenberger, the consultant managing the initiative, said 
passage of Friedman's bill may help his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may draw a more clear distinction" between the bill and the initiative, 
Stitzenberger said. People will have to decide, "are you in favor of something 
that is unfair and Draconian?" 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman's big fight was in the Senate, where the measure languished for more 
than a year before passing last week in amended form. By the time the bill 
reached the Assembly, there was only token opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not be a party to taking away the rights of individuals to make their 
own choices, based on a lie," Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) said, 
contending that there is no proof that secondhand smoke "actually causes health 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. surgeon general and various 
medical studies contend that there is a link between breathing secondhand smoke 
and lung and heart disease. Helping fuel support for Friedman's bill was an EPA 
study last year that said several thousand nonsmokers die annually from 
secondhand smoke.  
</P>
<P>
 If Friedman's measure becomes law, some in the anti-smoking movement fear that 
the tobacco industry will attempt to weaken the statute or that the courts may 
strike down some of its protections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts are liable to interpret it any number of different ways," said 
Kevin Goble, of Americans for Nonsmokers Rights, a Berkeley-based group that 
pushes for local smoking bans. "As we've seen in the past, intentions don't 
mean all that much." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the bill's strongest proponents are leaving the Legislature this year, 
including Friedman, who is running for a Superior Court judgeship in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be legislative initiatives in the Assembly and Senate to weaken 
the bill," said Dean Chalois, lobbyist for the California Medical Assn., one of 
the bill's leading supporters. "Those of us in the coalition (supporting the 
legislation) will have to be on our toes to ensure that the bill remains 
intact." 
</P>
<P>
 In another smoking-related action, the Legislature passed and sent to Wilson a 
measure allocating more than $800 million expected to be raised over the next 
two years from a special 25-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes enacted by voters in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation was approved despite protests from some opponents that money 
the voters meant for anti-tobacco education was being shifted to basic health 
services that they said should be funded by general taxes.

IN L.A.'S FORENSIC ATTIC, EVIDENCE OF FAMOUS CRIMES; COURTS: BLOODSTAINED GLOVE 
IN SIMPSON CASE WILL JOIN ITEMS, LIKE GUN THAT KILLED ROBERT KENNEDY, IN CITY 
STORAGE .  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now, one bloodstained glove -- brown leather, right-handed, found on the 
grounds of the O.J. Simpson estate quite early one June morning -- will take 
its place in a vigilantly tended collection of dissonant objects that fall 
under the plain, broad heading of "evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 All this week, all the week before, this glove was literally the gauntlet 
thrown down as defense and prosecution battled eloquently to keep it out, to 
get it in. 
</P>
<P>
 Hereafter, the glove with the ribbed back is likely to be trundled in and out 
of court, photographed, tested, labeled, numbered, signed in and signed out of 
custody for as long as it takes the law to run its course. 
</P>
<P>
 It joins more than a million items in Los Angeles' forensic attic; in secured 
courthouse evidence rooms, in police warehouses, freezers, vaults and 
specialized labs across Downtown are catalogued paraphernalia and ephemera from 
mayhem as old as the spectacular Black Dahlia dismemberment of 1947, and an 
unsolved murder from the last year of the Roaring '20s. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Los Angeles' courtrooms and legal storehouses have come exhibits that 
have horrified and riveted and titillated: the gun that shot Robert F. Kennedy 
. . . an entire hotel room wall, with a peephole through which detectives said 
they witnessed a long-ago mayor having sex in front of a minor . . . gory 
Manson-abilia . . . Heidi's black book . . . an experimental three-wheeled car 
called the Dale, subject of a fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
 The constitutional questions absorbed the week's legal debate; there were 
cheers around Parker Center on Thursday morning when officers watching the 
preliminary hearing heard the judge rule in favor of the detectives who had 
entered Simpson's estate that morning without awarrant, and found the glove and 
blood spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it can be stored by the rules, it has to be collected by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the photos of blood spots and glove from the Rockingham Avenue estate 
to the 9th-floor courtroom involved what every movie and mystery fan knows as 
"the chain of evidence," the steps police are supposed to take to certify that 
the shoe or pistol or bindle of cocaine collected in the field is the same one 
that shows up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Experience of the incidents where police aren't careful teaches the 
importance" of this continuity, says USC constitutional law professor Erwin 
Chemerinsky. "My guess is there is going to be in any police department some 
horror story of police screwing up, losing custody of evidence, not being able 
to account for it for some period of time -- and (having) that coming out in 
court as the possibility of contamination." 
</P>
<P>
 One that still sends up flares at the Los Angeles Police Department is the gun 
used in the Manson murders. A little boy found it, turned it over to an officer 
(who put his own prints on it), and "we had it for months before we knew we had 
it" -- the most sought-after murder weapon in town, said Lt. John Dunkin, a 
former Central division homicide detective, now an LAPD press spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Assistant Chief David D. Dotson, a veteran of more than 30 years, 
remembers occasions when "some evidence was discovered and it was locked in the 
trunk of a car at the scene, never very far out of sight of the officers or for 
very long . . . in my mind (that) did not really break the chain of continuity, 
but ideally I suppose you would not want that to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Times change, techniques change. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin has to laugh at the memory of old "Dragnet" shows, Jack Webb preserving 
prints on a gun by poking a pencil down the barrel to lift it. Poor Sgt. 
Friday. Nothing could be worse -- sticking something in the barrel can change 
the ballistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives and criminalists have to secure each piece they collect in 
envelopes, or with wrapping or tags. The envelopes now are color-coded: gray 
for blood and saliva, brown for "debris" and pubic hair, yellow for narcotics, 
a specially labeled one for handguns, sealed and signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloody evidence like the brown leather glove is placed in brown paper bags to 
allow it to dry out. If sealed in plastic, it would putrefy, destroying its 
value as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Dotson, who says evidence is secured with a seal "unique" to the collector, 
remembers that "way back when, we used to use hot wax and fingerprints, 
literally." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker Center's vast property room is open and hopping 24 hours a day. A roll 
of brown wrapping paper is mounted on a table so officers can wrap bulky items 
of evidence, and racks of tags await evidence too ungainly for wrapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Past the secured doors, the "biohazard" storage freezer and the vaults for 
drugs and cash, the door labeled "poison," is an airless storehouse of shelves 
sagging under the weight of the evidence of human misbehaving: 
</P>
<P>
 Crossbow; tennis racket; half a brick; racks of rifles and shotguns (and a 
violin case holding a Tommy gun that "reminds you of an Elliot Ness movie," 
said a property officer); white envelopes, each containing a handgun, coming in 
at a clip of nearly 10,000 a year; sets of scales still white with drug 
residue; a papier-mache pig's head from some anti-LAPD demonstration . . . and 
a suffocating smell that officers identified as the commingled remnant odors of 
cocaine, marijuana and PCP. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dotson retired two years ago, "they were attempting to use a bar code 
system to keep track." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What does happen to life-or-death evidence years after, when justice has run 
its string? 
</P>
<P>
 Notorious souvenirs of crimes that once riveted a nation have made their way 
to the auction block as high-priced collectibles. John Wilkes Booth's backup 
Derringer, carried into Ford's Theater the night he shot Abraham Lincoln, 
fetched $77,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Harvey Oswald's toe-tag sold for $6,600, and the .38-caliber Colt Cobra 
that Jack Ruby bought for $62.50 from a Dallas gun shop -- the same one he used 
to kill Oswald -- brought $220,000 from a collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Los Angeles' most desirable crime collectibles are reportedly 
well-archived. The Sirhan gun is in the custody of federal archives. Many 
Manson records are still in the hands of the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 During trial, after trial, after appeals, the humbler objects repose in the 
exhibit storage, a part of the courthouse so secured "you need an Act of 
Congress to get into" it, said one county sage. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventoried objects number perhaps a quarter-million, some still in court, 
some long since dispensed with, an encyclopedic criminal collection from photos 
of child-abuse victims to mannequins exhibiting death-wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a close-order drill for how and when to dispose of these things. 
Several offices may have to sign off on a disposal order; some of Superior 
Court exhibits custodian Ralph Stephens' bulky files, on murder cases, for 
example, go back 30 and 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 His "ongoing purge" of obsolete exhibits does not extend to selling them to 
collectors.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the guns, says Mike Chavarela, assistant division chief in these parts, 
get melted down, not sold; he heard that the last batch will go to help rebuild 
the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things get junked -- an old brick that may have been used to clunk 
somebody on the head -- and some, like decent old clothes, goes to a Downtown 
mission. "We were giving to the Salvation Army," but it "got to the point they 
didn't want it any more." 
</P>
<P>
 From down here, the place people call "the dungeon," the flow of thousands of 
bits from the hundreds and hundreds of criminal cases each year looks 
dismayingly Sisyphean. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of wish," says Chavarela wistfully, "they wouldn't have so much 
stuff."

SIMPSON EVIDENCE CAN BE USED, JUDGE RULES; COURT: THE CRUCIAL DECISION ENDORSES 
POLICE ENTRY INTO THE EX-ATHLETE'S ESTATE WITHOUT A WARRANT. THE DEFENSE WILL 
CONTINUE TO CONTEST THE SEARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The judge in the O.J. Simpson murder case ruled Thursday that a police entry 
into the superstar athlete's home June 13 was legal, clearing the way for 
prosecutors to begin introducing physical evidence that they contend links 
Simpson to the murders of his ex-wife and a friend of hers. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to a hushed courtroom on a matter with enormous implications for the 
celebrated case, Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell endorsed the decision 
of police officers to leap over Simpson's fence and enter his estate without a 
warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys had argued that the police violated the ex-football star's 
4th Amendment right to be secure in his home. But Kennedy-Powell found that the 
officers' behavior was justified by what they found outside Simpson's home and 
by the brutal murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman a few 
hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court finds that (the officers) were in fact acting for a benevolent 
purpose in light of a brutal attack," she said. " . . . They reasonably 
believed that a further delay could have resulted in the unnecessary loss of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge rejected the arguments of Simpson lawyer Gerald F. Uelmen -- a 
former professor whose class Kennedy-Powell took years ago -- that ruling in 
favor of the prosecution in this case would undermine the Constitution and the 
protection it gives to civilians against unjustified intrusions by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind," she said, "the 4th Amendment is alive and well." 
</P>
<P>
 Although widely predicted by legal analysts, the ruling was anxiously awaited 
because it could have stricken from the preliminary hearing several pieces of 
evidence -- including a bloody glove found outside Simpson's home and 
bloodstains discovered in his car and driveway. The crowd outside the 
courthouse gathered even earlier than usual, with one man taking his spot in 
line Wednesday evening to ensure that he could secure a prized seat the 
following morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, the tension was palpable: As Kennedy-Powell announced her ruling, 
Nicole Simpson's father, Louis Brown, slumped forward, rested his head on the 
bench in front of him, and wept. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Brown said through an intermediary that he was crying with relief that 
the judge had allowed the evidence to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Uelmen, Simpson's attorneys had sharply criticized the conduct of the 
officers. They suggested that the police went to Simpson's home believing that 
he was a suspect and only later pretended to have been concerned with the 
welfare of the occupants of the estate. Kennedy-Powell disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from criticizing the police for entering Simpson's property without a 
warrant, she praised the officers for trying to notify the celebrity of his 
ex-wife's death and for trying to arrange for his two young children to be 
picked up from the police station, where they were taken after the bodies were 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The place for two small children whose mother has been murdered is not at the 
police station, sitting in a corner drawing pictures on a tablet," 
Kennedy-Powell said. "The place for those kids is with their family." 
</P>
<P>
 Once at the scene, officers first tried to raise someone by using the bell, 
she added. And only after they had failed to do that and had discovered a small 
stain they believed to be blood did they decide to jump the fence, she said, 
echoing the testimony of two police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important, Kennedy-Powell said, the officers did not conduct an 
extensive search once they were on the property but instead confined themselves 
to searching for additional victims who might be dead or injured on the 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be a very easy decision for me if in fact these officers went in 
there like storm troopers, fanning out over the property, examining every leaf, 
every car, every closet, every nook and cranny of this location," she said. 
"But the testimony as elicited by the officers, and as supported by the 
witnesses who testified on behalf of the defense, show that this was not what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Uelmen said Simpson's team of lawyers would renew its 
objections to the search and to a warrant that was subsequently obtained if 
Simpson is ordered to stand trial in Superior Court. Uelmen said he expects the 
motion to receive an extensive hearing at that stage of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very confident in our position. I still do," said attorney Robert L. 
Shapiro, who signed autographs as he waited for Thursday's hearing to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several legal experts said they believed that the legal challenge 
mounted by Simpson's attorneys had merit, they expressed doubt that another 
judge will overturn Kennedy-Powell's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their chances are next to zero," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor 
who has been monitoring the hearing. Barring new evidence, he added, a Superior 
Court judge would almost certainly defer to Kennedy-Powell's analysis of the 
facts because she heard the testimony herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of Los Angeles' best known lawyers and a friend of 
Simpson, agreed, saying that Kennedy-Powell's ruling would make it extremely 
difficult for the athlete's lawyers to win this issue should they raise it 
later in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "She found the officers credible," Cochran said. "No Superior Court judge is 
going to touch that. . . . She effectively denied the motion and at the same 
time made it extremely difficult for anyone to overturn this." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with Kennedy-Powell's ruling, prosecutors immediately plunged forward 
with the heart of their case, laying the groundwork for the introduction of 
blood samples recovered from Simpson's home and the murder scene. To do that, 
they called a number of police investigators and others to establish the chain 
of physical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 That is standard practice in criminal cases, and prosecutors undertook it in 
an attempt to prevent Simpson's attorneys from arguing that blood or other 
samples were contaminated by sloppy handling. Shapiro has hammered on what he 
has called careless handling of some aspects of the investigation, repeatedly 
grilling police officers about missing reports or leads that were not pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 As prosecutors sought to establish that the evidence was properly handled, 
they first called Detective Tom Lange, one of two lead investigators assigned 
to the case. Lange, a soft-spoken LAPD veteran who negotiated with Simpson 
during the celebrity's low-speed flight along Southern California freeways 
three weeks ago, described the grim scene that confronted him and other 
investigators on South Bundy Drive in the early morning of June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark, Lange leafed through a 
stack of small photographs of the scene of the crime. On the hearing's first 
day, prosecutors had displayed large photographs of the scene, but since then 
have turned to smaller ones that are not visible to audience members or to 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the photographs were shown to Shapiro before being shown to 
witnesses, Simpson did not glance at them even though he sits within inches of 
his lead attorney. When the photographs of Nicole Simpson's body lying in a 
pool of blood were briefly unveiled in court last week, Simpson winced, stared 
at the ceiling and gasped for breath. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Lange reviewed photographs of the grisly scene and recounted what 
awaited him when he arrived there about 4:30 the morning after the killings. He 
said he saw two bodies -- Nicole Simpson's on the walkway at the foot of three 
steps and Goldman's slumped beneath a tree off to one side. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Lange recalled spotting a white envelope lying at the feet of 
Goldman, a blue knit cap also near Goldman, a dark brown leather glove and a 
ring containing five keys. The bodies were surrounded by large pools of blood, 
Lange said, and an animal had tracked through it. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading away from the scene, Lange added, was a trail of shoe prints, to the 
left of which were a series of thick blood drops. 
</P>
<P>
 Those drops and their location to the left of the footprints are potentially 
of great importance to the prosecution because when Simpson was questioned by 
police the day after the murders, he had at least one cut on his left hand, an 
injury to the main knuckle of his middle finger -- a picture of which was 
displayed in court. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of Simpson's arraignment, Shapiro said that his client had two cuts 
on his left hand and a number of smaller scratches, which he compared to "paper 
cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that Simpson suffered at least one of those cuts in a 
fierce fight with Goldman. Shapiro and Simpson's previous attorney, Howard 
Weitzman, said they actually were the result of Simpson smashing a glass in a 
Chicago hotel room when he learned of his ex-wife's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Philip L. Vannatter, one of two lead investigators in the case and a 
familiar sight on the witness stand in recent days, testified again Thursday 
and said that when he first saw Simpson on the day after the slayings, he 
noticed a bandage on the middle finger of the athlete-turned-actor's left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter, who was busily collecting blood samples from Simpson's home and the 
murder scene, spotted the injury when the athlete returned home from Chicago. 
Once they were at police headquarters, Vannatter said he asked Simpson for a 
blood sample. According to Vannatter, Simpson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vannatter said he believes that the person who committed the murders 
wore gloves -- losing one at the scene and dropping the other one on a dark 
walkway at the Simpson estate -- that account was aggressively challenged by 
Shapiro, who pointedly cross-examined the detective for the second straight 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from Shapiro, Vannatter conceded that there is no slice in 
the left glove, even though he contended that the assailant was wearing gloves 
at the time of the attack. That disclosure raises questions about how Simpson's 
hand was cut without the glove being sliced as well. 
</P>
<P>
 As he has throughout the preliminary hearing, Shapiro derided the handling of 
some of the evidence, noting, for instance, that a representative of the media 
managed to put a cup of coffee on the hood of Simpson's Ford Bronco while the 
car was parked in front of the former athlete's Brentwood mansion. By attacking 
the handling of certain evidence, Shapiro was attempting to show that the 
Bronco could have been tampered with and is therefore unreliable as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Shapiro sarcastically set out to suggest that Vannatter had 
failed to protect evidence from the car by allowing it to be towed away: "So as 
one of the lead homicide detectives in the Los Angeles Police Department, you 
feel secure that you can leave the scene, have an unknown tow-truck driver come 
hook up the . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Clark interrupted with an objection, calling Shapiro's question argumentative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't even finished," he responded. "It gets better." 
</P>
<P>
 In aggressive questioning of both detectives, Shapiro also questioned why they 
had not interviewed the caller who first alerted them to the possibility of 
trouble outside Nicole Simpson's condominium and why certain reports had not 
been completed. Although Lange and Vannatter each defended their actions and 
those of other officers, Shapiro returned again and again to those issues in an 
effort to raise doubts about the competence of the police investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the stand Thursday, both detectives described their handling of various 
blood samples, insisting that all of them were carefully labeled and protected. 
A registered nurse who works at the Police Department's Downtown jail even 
testified about taking blood from Simpson. The nurse stressed that he had 
decades of experience in performing that routine procedure and that nothing 
went awry that day. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that testimony is the prelude to the main event: determining whether 
any blood that matches Simpson's was found at the murder scene or whether any 
blood that matches the victims' was found at his home two miles away. Either 
finding would figure heavily in the case against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sources have said that blood samples recovered from the scene of the 
crime match Simpson's blood type. More rigorous testing also has been performed 
in an attempt to narrow the number of people whose blood could match that found 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The most precise type of testing, DNA analysis, can strongly point to a 
suspect, sometimes establishing million-to-one odds against the samples being 
from different people. Although DNA testing is being performed on the samples 
in this case, that process is not completed and prosecutors do not intend to 
use preliminary DNA results in this hearing, where they do not need to prove 
Simpson guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary hearing is merely to determine whether there is enough 
evidence to have Simpson stand trial for the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 As the court day closed Thursday, prosecutors appeared on the verge of 
eliciting the first testimony linking blood samples at the crime scene to 
Simpson. Gregory Matheson, a supervising criminalist at the LAPD crime lab, 
spent half an hour on the stand establishing his credentials and reviewing the 
testing procedures used on blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of his testimony, Matheson said he tested four blood samples June 
27. Three of those were from the victims and Simpson. The fourth was from one 
of the blood drops that fell to the left of the bloody footprints leading away 
from the murder scene, Matheson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But before he could say anything about that blood sample and whether it 
matched the characteristics of Simpson's blood, Kennedy-Powell recessed court 
for the day. It resumes today, the sixth day of testimony in a hearing that has 
attracted millions of viewers nationwide.

SMOKE JUMPER RECALLS RACE AGAINST DEADLY FIRESTORM; BLAZE: INJURED SURVIVOR 
OUTRAN 'EXPLOSION OF HEAT AND FLAMES,' BUT THE RUSHING INFERNO OVERTOOK 12 
COMRADES.

<P>
 In the end, said firefighter Bradley Haugh, it came down to the simple fact 
that "Mother Nature didn't want us up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Haugh stiffened Thursday as he recounted trying to outrun "an explosion of 
heat and flames" when winds whipped a small wildfire out of control near this 
western Colorado resort town, killing at least 12 of his fellow crew members in 
one of the worst firefighting disasters in history. 
</P>
<P>
 His only chance, the 32-year-old federal firefighter figured, was to try to 
make it to a ridge opposite the cresting fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was coming fast, really fast . . . a firestorm that was unbelievably hot 
and intense," said Haugh, one of four injured firefighters among the 38 who 
escaped the inferno Wednesday. Two firefighters remained missing late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Haugh, seemingly oblivious to the gauze wrapping his burned left elbow, 
recalled Thursday that after reaching safety he looked back over his shoulder 
and saw other firefighters running while yanking at protective fire shields 
folded at their belts. But he now thinks that some were unable to unfurl the 
aluminum and fiberglass blankets and get under them before galloping flames 
overtook them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did everything we could with the resources available," said Haugh, of 
Gypsum, Colo., who has worked for two years as a seasonal member of a U.S. 
Bureau of Land Management firefighting team. "It was a freak microcosm of 
weather that kicked our butts." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, more than 250 fresh crew members tried to gain control of the 
2,200-acre South Canyon fire, named for the area five miles west of Glenwood 
Springs where lightning sparked the blaze on July 4. Overhead, aerial tankers 
and helicopters dropped flame retardant and water on hot spots. And most of the 
75 residents evacuated late Wednesday night were allowed to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire right now is about controlled, to the extent that there isn't much 
wind and the slurry bombers have doused many of the hot spots," Garfield County 
Sheriff Vern Soucie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a separate federal fire investigation team had a grimmer mission: 
scouring the 7,000-foot-high blackened ridges of Storm King Mountain in search 
of the missing firefighters and identifying the bodies of the 12 known to have 
perished. 
</P>
<P>
 The team also was trying to determine how the fire crews were overrun by 
flames and whether their protective equipment, including the shields, operated 
correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 Several townsfolk grumbled that not enough crews and equipment were sent to 
the scene in the first two days of the fire. But U.S. Forest Service and BLM 
officials defended their actions, saying that larger fires raging elsewhere in 
nine Western states had a priority for limited manpower and resources until 
early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the firefighters worried that a failure of equipment had contributed 
to the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Gov. Roy Romer said several of the surviving smoke jumpers -- 
specially trained firefighters airlifted to fire lines with heavy equipment to 
create firebreaks -- pleaded with him to ensure a full investigation. That's 
the reason, Romer said, that the bodies remained on the mountainside until late 
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could something have been done?" Romer asked. "An investigation will tell us. 
We're supposed to fly airplanes without crashing. Sometimes things go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who rushed to Glenwood Springs from Idaho 
early Thursday, called the deaths a "terrible tragedy." He predicted that it 
would be weeks before investigators would have any answers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Babbitt, a firefighter in his youth in Arizona, hailed the fire crews as 
highly trained young men and women of all races, many of them on seasonal 
summer jobs to help pay for college. They are, he said, "the face of the West." 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths, Babbitt said, underscore the fact that "despite all the 
technology, all the new techniques . . . fighting a fire is still a solitary 
act. . . . It takes tremendous courage to face risks like this." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 crew members on the fire lines Wednesday were smoke jumpers 
imported from federal firefighting training bases in Missoula, Mont., and 
McCall, Ida. Another 20 were members of a "hotshot crew" from Prineville, Ore. 
Nine of the dead or missing -- including four women -- were from the Prineville 
crew. The loss was unparalleled for the blue-collar, high desert town of 5,900 
in central Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be very painful for this town," said Scott Cooper, 
Prineville's Chamber of Commerce executive director, who went to high school 
with one of the lost firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere we have a flag in town they are flying at half-staff. The entrance 
to the Forest Service headquarters is jammed. People are walking around in a 
daze because they knew most of these kids. This was the second or third fire 
for that crew this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Prineville crew listed among the dead or missing were: Scott 
Blegha of Claskanie, Ore.; Jon Kelso of Prineville; Kathi Beck of Eugene, Ore.; 
Levi Brinkley, Burns, Ore.; Bonnie Holtby, Prineville; Rob Johnson, Redmond, 
Ore.; Tammi Bickett, Powell Butte, Ore.; Doug Dunbar, Redmond, Ore., and Terri 
Hagen, Prineville. 
</P>
<P>
 The other dead and missing were identified as: Donald Mackey of Hamilton, 
Mont.; Roger Roth and James Thrash of McCall, and Richard Tyler and Robert 
Browning of Grand Junction, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities declined to identify which of the 14 names were those of the 
still-missing firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Already Thursday, relatives of the dead were expressing bitterness over their 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just see it as somebody making a big mistake by sending them there," said 
Nadine Mackey, mother of Donald Mackey, a 32-year-old divorced father of a 
4-year-old son and a daughter who turned 6 on Thursday. "If you're a smoke 
jumper, you're way back in there by yourself. You have no place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Mackey, in a telephone interview with ABC News, said she watched reports of 
the South Canyon fire Wednesday night from her Montana home, relieved that her 
son was supposed to be in Grand Junction, about 30 miles west of Glenwood 
Springs, and therefore not on the fire lines. She learned Thursday that she was 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't supposed to be there," Mackey said. "He was supposed to be coming 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four injured firefighters, only Eric Hipke, 32, of Seattle, remained 
hospitalized Thursday. He was listed in stable condition with first- and 
second-degree burns.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of the talk in Glenwood Springs and elsewhere Thursday was about the 
resources available to the firefighters when the winds shifted so dramatically 
Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal wildfire officials said firefighters were battling 31 major fires that 
had consumed more than 160,000 acres in nine Western states, including 
California, Montana, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Oregon and Texas. On 
those fire lines were more than 7,700 firefighters, 240 fire engines, 55 
helicopters and 25 air tankers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colorado alone, four other major fires burned Thursday. And until Wednesday 
morning, a blaze that burned at least five homes in the town of Paonia, about 
60 miles southwest of Glenwood Springs, commanded more resources, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy McKee, a spokeswoman for the Colorado office of the BLM, rejected any 
suggestion that not enough crews were fighting the South Canyon blaze early 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put all the resources available out there when we knew the fire was 
growing," she said. "When the wind got high and we had to pull the bombers back 
(about 3:30 p.m. Wednesday), that's when we figured the crew must have died. It 
all happened simultaneously."

NEWS ANALYSIS; INDECISIVENESS IS CRUX OF U.S. POLICY ON HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A White House official was taken aback this week when asked how the twists and 
turns of U.S. policy on Haiti fit into an overall American strategy. "We aren't 
answering questions about strategy today," the official snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be the core of the Clinton Administration's problem as it grapples 
with Haiti, a policy nightmare that has come to torment officials out of all 
proportion to its size. 
</P>
<P>
 American attempts to staunch the flood of refugees from the impoverished, 
military-ruled country have produced only disarray -- and television images of 
drowning refugees. Its attempts to rattle the saber of American military might 
at the regime in Port-au-Prince have frightened members of Congress but 
apparently not members of the Haitian junta. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Administration has found itself lurching from crisis to 
crisis, from one attempted quick fix to another -- and is now finding itself 
drawn toward an unwanted decision on military intervention.

 "The President is in a peculiar and dangerous position on Haiti," warned 
Georges Fauriol of the private, nonpartisan Center for Strategic and 
International Studies here. "He has said the military regime must go. He has 
put his credibility on the line. But he doesn't have any way to make them go . 
. . unless he launches an invasion." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his aides have insisted they would prefer to see Haiti's generals 
leave peacefully, under the pressure of the economic and political sanctions 
that the United States has imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 But it could take months for the sanctions to topple the regime, if they do at 
all. Meanwhile, the near-collapse of Haiti's economy, coupled with U.S. 
promises to treat refugees humanely, has touched off the exodus of more than 
15,000 people in the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, the sanctions might work," Fauriol noted. "But at this rate, the 
flow of refugees will overwhelm everyone first." 
</P>
<P>
 To reinforce the sanctions, Clinton and his aides have warned publicly that 
the United States might invade Haiti and overthrow the generals by force. This 
week, they announced that a task force including 2,000 Marines with helicopters 
and landing craft was on its way to the Caribbean. The stated reason was to be 
prepared in case U.S. citizens in Haiti should need protection. They also 
confirmed that the Army and Navy have staged an exercise in Florida to simulate 
a landing in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 But the saber-rattling fell a bit flat when Clinton's special envoy to Haiti, 
William H. Gray III, said the United States still does not want to invade and 
suggested that the regime's deadline for stepping down is the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another sign that the Americans aren't serious," said a Haitian 
business leader now in the United States. The military "will see it as yet 
another fake deadline . . . a signal that they have another six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Fauriol said: "The Administration has made it quite clear that it is reluctant 
to intervene. They've watered down their own announcements (of possible 
military action). That doesn't work. If you're going to play the game of 
gunboat diplomacy, just do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, officials said, is that Clinton is genuinely undecided on 
the issue and still hopes he can avoid military intervention. Another part is 
his Administration's seeming inability to make clear decisions and make them 
stick -- as with its move to send Haitian refugees to Panama, a quick fix that 
the Panamanians abruptly rejected Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But another reason is broader: Since the end of the Cold War, Americans and 
their leaders are less ready to commit troops to combat overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole issue of military intervention is more difficult since the end of 
the Cold War . . . and the generals in Haiti know that," said Michael 
Mandelbaum of Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International 
Studies. "It doesn't help that we pulled out of Somalia. Neither does it help 
that half the Congress and half of the country don't want to intervene. . . . 
And it doesn't help that our interest in Haiti is not as clear as it could be." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Cold War, Mandelbaum noted, U.S. military interventions -- from 
Korea in 1950 to Grenada in 1983 -- were all justified on the grounds that they 
were somehow connected to the global struggle with the Soviet Union. "The 
American public has been willing to shed blood if it had something to do with 
self-defense," he said. "But that rationale is gone now." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he noted, Clinton has reinforced the nation's reluctance through his 
brushes with intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 In Somalia last year, after an ill-conceived military mission resulted in 18 
American combat deaths in October, Clinton announced that the cost was greater 
than the U.S. interest and brought the troops home. In the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Clinton declared that the United States had a deep interest 
in achieving a settlement -- but not deep enough to warrant sending any ground 
troops. "In Bosnia, we have set the standard for intervention rather high," 
Mandelbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Haiti, Clinton ordered U.S. military trainers aboard the tank landing 
ship Harlan County to withdraw last year in the face of an ugly crowd on the 
dock. That was the only gunboat diplomacy Haiti's leaders have seen so far, and 
it ended in a quick American retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 "That did not strengthen the credibility of our threats of intervention," 
Mandelbaum said. "There's an argument that can be made now that invading Haiti 
would be good for U.S. credibility. But how important that credibility is 
depends on what the stakes are. . . . And since the Cold War, the stakes just 
don't seem as big as they used to be."

DETECTIVES USED TO HIGH PROFILE, HIGH PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Detectives Philip L. Vannatter and Tom Lange have slipped comfortably into the 
witness stand in the O.J. Simpson case, appearing unflappable, hardened and a 
bit nonchalant -- as though they've been through all this before. 
</P>
<P>
 And they have. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter and Lange, the lead detectives in the Simpson case, have a combined 
51 years of police experience and have investigated as many as 500 homicide 
cases -- from gang shootings to serial killings. Most of those years have been 
spent in the specialized robbery-homicide division, where the city's most 
high-profile cases land. 
</P>
<P>
 The Robert Kennedy assassination. The Hillside Strangler case. The Night 
Stalker killings. Any case that involves prominent people, multiple victims or 
is particularly sensitive will most likely be transferred from the local police 
station to the detectives at Parker Center headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives there must be able to build airtight cases, sometimes with an 
anxious public watching over their shoulder, then defend them during intense 
cross-examination by some of the most skilled defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the best of the best," one retired detective said of the 
robbery-homicide squad. "Someone just doesn't join robbery-homicide. It takes 
years to get there. You need experience and a high clearance rate." 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives also need the stomach to immerse themselves in the goriest of 
crimes, and the doggedness to sometimes pursue a whodunit for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to ask why all the time and not let go of an investigation," said 
Capt. William O. Gartland, a 39-year veteran who is the commanding officer of 
robbery-homicide. "You never become used to all the blood. You face it 
constantly and build up defense mechanisms but, in that way, we're just like 
everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 The jobs in robbery-homicide are highly coveted. The LAPD seeks candidates who 
are meticulous, well-spoken and have proven over the years that they are not 
easily frazzled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deal with the loss of life -- whether it's a drive-by shooting or a serial 
killing," Gartland said. "That means there are certain pressures. You have the 
pressures of finding the suspect and putting all the facts together. Then in a 
case like this, you have the pressure of the press watching every move you 
make." 
</P>
<P>
 That pressure -- combined with the long and unpredictable hours -- has ruined 
many marriages in the unit, officers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to give up a normal family life and be a very intense person," said 
a former detective. "It's not everybody's cup of tea." 
</P>
<P>
 The division was created to free up detectives in the outlying police stations 
and focus on cases that cross divisional boundaries, such as serial killings. 
It was made famous in later episodes of television's "Dragnet." Sgt. Joe 
Friday, whose trademark line was "Just the facts, ma'am," would introduce 
himself as a member of robbery-homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 75 investigators in "RHD," as the division is known, and a dozen of 
them specialize in homicides. The others handle cases ranging from 
officer-involved shootings and bank robberies to serial rapes and the 
protection of heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery-homicide division is frequently described as an elite unit. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorney Stephen Yagman, an outspoken critic of the LAPD, says he has not 
been impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many units of the LAPD that are billed as elite units that the 
word is a self-stroking word," Yagman said. "It seems that the word 'elite' is 
used by the LAPD to describe all units that are not patrol. It has nothing to 
do with excellence." 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman criticized the officer-involved shooting section, where Vannatter used 
to work, for consistently supporting officers' versions of events. And he said 
he once unsuccessfully sued Vannatter and other detectives for an incident in 
the mid-1980s in which they pursued Yagman's private investigator in a 
high-speed chase to issue a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, praised Vannatter, a grandfather who is known as Dutch among 
friends and who enjoys horseback riding near his Santa Clarita home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the few people I've ever called a super-cop," said one 25-year 
veteran who has worked with Vannatter. "He's very thorough and very 
conscientious -- and he's very strong." 
</P>
<P>
 One colleague describes him as a bear of a man who once kicked in a door while 
arresting a robbery suspect on the Westside and knocked the door off the 
hinges. When Vannatter worked as a detective in Venice in the 1970s, he would 
have contests with co-workers to see how long they could hold a sledgehammer 
outstretched in front of them with one arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter has shown his feisty side, getting testy at times during some of 
Shapiro's questioning on Wednesday. In seeking to show that Vannatter illegally 
entered Simpson's property to seize evidence, Shapiro questioned every detail 
of his account of events. But the detective stood firm, and on Thursday, 
Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ruled that the police had acted 
appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange, on the other hand, has projected a more unassuming quality on the 
witness stand. Bald with wire-rimmed glasses, he has played the humble cop. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked by Shapiro on Thursday if he is an expert in homicide 
investigations, he replied: "I guess that's open to interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
 What do his colleagues think of his work? "You'll have to ask them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter and Lange have been teamed up for the last four years. In addition 
to the Simpson case, they are currently handling the case of a Culver City 
police sergeant accused of murdering his wife and the 1982 murder of actor 
Frank Christi.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if they are considered the best at the LAPD, but I do know that 
they are aggressive, tenacious and experienced," said Joel Isaacson, a criminal 
defense attorney who has two pending murder cases that the pair is 
investigating. "They don't take no for an answer." 
</P>
<P>
 It was about 3 a.m. on June 13 when Vannatter and Lange were rousted from 
their beds to investigate the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before that call was made, the detectives from the West Los Angeles 
division had already arrived at the scene, surrounded it with police tape and 
begun the search for clues. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact that two people were dead and one of them was the ex-wife of O.J. 
Simpson made this murder a good candidate for robbery-homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Capt. Gartland was awakened at home by the detective on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gartland decided to take the case, he called the lieutenant in charge of 
the unit's homicide section, who in turn called Vannatter and Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the luck of the draw that won them the case. The pair was on call that 
weekend and was scheduled to receive whatever murder came along next. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that robbery-homicide takes over jurisdiction of cases from the 
police divisions sometimes creates some hard feelings among divisional 
detectives trying to work their way up the chain of command themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a human emotion," one former robbery-homicide detective said. "A big 
case comes along, you want it. You don't want some hotshot coming in from 
outside."

ISRAEL AND PLO PAVE THE WAY FOR A WIDER PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The push for peace in the Middle East is again gathering momentum, with Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organization determinedly leading the way toward 
what they hope will become an overall resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 After surprising themselves with the ease of the Israeli withdrawal from the 
Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho after 27 years of occupation and 
the establishment of the first Palestinian government, Israel and the PLO on 
Thursday announced new negotiations to expand Palestinian self-rule and to hold 
elections throughout the Palestinian territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and Jordan, meanwhile, set a date -- July 18 -- to begin formal 
negotiations on a peace treaty that would end the 46-year state of war between 
them and lay the foundation for what both expect will be warm relations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a senior Israeli official suggested that, despite the apparent 
stalemate in talks with Syria and new clashes between Israeli forces and 
Syrian-backed guerrillas in southern Lebanon, negotiations with Damascus are at 
the "make or break" stage -- and he was betting that key elements of a 
settlement will emerge late this year or early next. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to be left behind," Yasser Abed-Rabbo, information minister in 
the new Palestinian Authority, said after intensive talks between PLO Chairman 
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin here. "And we intend to 
move ahead, not waiting for anyone to catch up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We and the Israelis have completed the first stage of what we agreed to 
almost a year ago," he added. "It was a very difficult test, but our success is 
giving a very strong impetus to the peace process throughout the region. I 
won't say it can't be stopped, but even the doubters now want to join in." 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister, was similarly 
upbeat, telling reporters: "There are many problems down the road, but I 
believe all of them are surmountable, all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the deep differences over the future of Jerusalem, claimed by both Israel 
and the Palestinians as their capital, could be surmounted, Beilin predicted to 
illustrate the progress that the mutual commitment to peace could bring. "I'm 
not saying Israel is ready to compromise on Jerusalem now, but I think that 
since we are ready to go a very long way with the Palestinians for many other 
issues, we can solve the problem of Jerusalem too," he said, adding that an 
agreement will come when each side "understands the red lines of the other 
side." 
</P>
<P>
 In agreeing to launch new negotiations Monday in Cairo, Arafat and Rabin both 
made key compromises to maintain the momentum they gained from the Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and from Arafat's return there. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel accepted the Palestinian desire for early elections, including them in 
the talks, and the PLO again deferred such sensitive questions as Jewish 
settlers in the West Bank and the future of Jerusalem to a later stage of 
talks. At the same time, Israel agreed to "consider seriously" the PLO request 
for the release of more of the 5,000 Palestinian prisoners, particularly women 
and Islamic fundamentalists, whom it still holds. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat promised to convene a meeting in Gaza "in the very near future" of the 
Palestine National Council, the Palestinians' parliament in exile, to delete 
from the Palestinian Covenant longstanding calls for Israel's destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 For Israel, this is a crucial test of confidence, and the PLO is treating it 
as such. Arafat said the meeting will be held in early autumn if Israel clears 
the entry of council members, many still listed as "wanted" by Israeli security 
services, into Gaza for the session. 
</P>
<P>
 Uri Savir, the director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and a leading 
Israeli negotiator, said Arafat needs a two-thirds majority in the 468-member 
Palestine National Council to amend the Palestinian charter; thus, achieving 
that will be a real demonstration of his ability to muster support among his 
people for the peace agreement with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I imagine he will not convene the council unless he can meet the commitment," 
Savir said. "The commitment is not just to put the changes to a vote but to 
adopt them." 
</P>
<P>
 In a further measure of Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation, the two sides will 
begin discussions, along with Egypt and Jordan, on repatriation of the 
Palestinians who fled the West Bank and Gaza Strip after the 1967 Middle East 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel agreed in principle 15 years ago to such negotiations, but it has never 
proceeded with them, and the refugee question is one of the most sensitive in 
the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rabin emphasized to Arafat the need to proceed cautiously, moving 
ahead step by step and even negotiating line by line, he finished his talks 
with the PLO leader clearly optimistic, even enthusiastic, Israeli sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going into the next stage with positive experience," Rabin told 
Israeli journalists. "Things came together better and faster than we expected 
or even hoped for. It was a surprise to me, and I think to Arafat. But it gives 
a certain momentum for us to continue, and it creates a certain pressure in the 
other sectors (Syria, Jordan and Lebanon). So, we proceed." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides said the talks on expanding autonomy beyond the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho constituted one of the most difficult phases in the peace negotiations, 
but one where progress could bring a fundamental shift in relations between 
Israelis and Palestinians, including withdrawal of Israeli troops from West 
Bank towns and villages. 
</P>
<P>
 But two killings in the West Bank on Thursday were sure to intensify 
right-wing Israeli opposition to the peace process. Palestinian gunmen killed 
an Israeli girl in a drive-by shooting near the settlement of Kiryat Arba, 
outside Hebron, and the body of an Israeli soldier was found riddled with 
bullets and stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 No group claimed responsibility for either killing, but suspicion fell on 
radical Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and Jordan agreed last month to begin their new negotiations, but 
arrangements, announced in Amman and Jerusalem, made them sound more like a 
celebration of a treaty already agreed upon than like the start of hard 
bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The two countries, which had been negotiating in Washington with U.S. 
mediation for nearly three years, decided to hold the talks inside their 
countries in an effort to accelerate steps toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordanian officials said that Secretary of State Warren Christopher has been 
invited to attend the opening session outside Jordan's Red Sea port city of 
Aqaba and its Israeli twin, Eilat. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher is due in the region July 17 to try to unblock stalled 
Syrian-Israeli peace talks and help advance the Israeli-Jordanian track. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli-Jordanian meeting will be the first opportunity for a senior 
Israeli official to set foot, openly and formally, in Jordan, despite a 
well-established history of low-profile cooperation on security and day-to-day 
matters between the two. King Hussein and Israeli officials have been meeting 
secretly for decades, and the monarch said recently that he was prepared to 
meet Israeli leaders as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In assessing the deadlocked talks with Syria, Beilin said they too could begin 
to move shortly, with Christopher's visit. "The gaps between Syria and 
ourselves are still very wide," he said. "But we were never, ever, closer to 
peace with Syria, ever. . . . End of 1994, beginning of 1995 are the coming 
months that will make it or break it." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel holds Syria, the main power in Lebanon, responsible for guerrilla 
attacks on its forces in southern Lebanon.  
</P>
<P>
 The talks are stuck over whether an Israeli commitment to withdraw from the 
Golan Heights must precede Syria's acceptance of Israel in the Middle East by 
granting it diplomatic recognition and establishing full and normal ties with 
it.

PANEL TACKLES DESERT NUCLEAR WASTE ISSUE; ENVIRONMENT: NATIONAL ACADEMY OF 
SCIENCES STUDIES PROPOSED WARD VALLEY FACILITY. THE CRUCIAL ISSUE IS WHETHER 
RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION IN THE MOJAVE COULD TRICKLE DOWN TO DRINKING 
SUPPLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the local Elk's Lodge in this dusty, overgrown truck stop, 16 of the 
nation's leading geologists, geophysicists and geochemists Thursday began 
assessing the wisdom of burying radioactive waste in a desolate strip of the 
eastern Mojave Desert 20 miles to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment of the panel by the National Academy of Sciences, the 
country's oldest and most prestigious scientific body, marks the first time an 
independent group of experts has become involved in the decade-long controversy 
over the proposed Ward Valley nuclear waste disposal facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The crucial issue for the National Academy panel is whether moisture, 
contaminated by buried radioactive waste, could trickle down 600 feet to the 
water table, migrate to the nearby Colorado River and poison the drinking water 
supply of millions of people in California, Arizona and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In a spirit of scientific candor, the three-day meeting began with an 
acknowledgment by an official supporting the dump that resolving all doubts 
about its safety will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be the last person to claim that definitive answers to all the 
detailed questions that (Ward Valley opponents) have raised are known today," 
Elisabeth Brandt, chief counsel for the California Department of Health 
Services, told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing out that people are exposed to small amounts of radioactivity every 
day, Brandt insisted that it is not necessary to show that no radioactive 
material would ever leak from Ward Valley. "To demand proof that, no matter 
what the circumstances, there will be no release whatsoever is simply 
unrealistic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For this reason (the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission) has established 
reasonable health and safety standards which we must prove that we can meet." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's examination of the dump site -- requested by Interior Secretary 
Bruce Babbitt -- will focus on a deceptively simple question. Do raindrops 
falling in the desert evaporate before they can replenish the ground water 
supply some 600 feet down? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer could go a long way toward resolving the controversy over the 
suitability of the federally owned site and persuading Babbitt whether to 
transfer the 1,000 acres in question to the state for use as a nuclear dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt has said he will not transfer it to California until he is convinced 
of its safety. He has asked the National Academy panel to give him a report by 
year's end.  
</P>
<P>
 If the scientists determine that moisture does not penetrate deeply into the 
desert, a strong case can be made that nature has created an impermeable crypt 
safe for burying some of the most long-lived and toxic materials known to man. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there is evidence of moisture in the ground, and, although no radioactive 
waste is stored in Ward Valley now, tiny amounts of radioactive tritium have 
been detected 100 feet below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Tritium occurs naturally in the Earth's atmosphere and also is a byproduct of 
past atmospheric nuclear testing. It could have made its way into the ground 
beneath Ward Valley in a vaporous form. But if water is to blame for its 
presence, there could be a big problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ward Valley is opened, tritium waste from biomedical laboratories could 
account for up to 90% of the radioactivity in the dump. If the material gets 
wet, the soluble tritium will go wherever the moisture goes, remaining 
hazardous for more than 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the tritium there now, all waste would be hermetically sealed in metal 
containers. But the containers will decay over time.  
</P>
<P>
 The state's experts point to studies showing that moisture moves much too 
slowly -- about 4 centimeters in 1,000 years -- to pose a threat. They argue 
that any waste particles leaking out of the dump would lose their radioactivity 
before reaching the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mark Liggett, a geologic consultant who has worked in Ward Valley for 20 
years, told panel members Thursday that the depth of the water table and the 
moisture content of the ground above varies widely. Liggett said the state's 
research is not thorough enough to reflect the variations. 
</P>
<P>
 While its arid climate has been a selling point for Ward Valley -- which 
receives only about 5 inches of rainfall annually -- that may not have always 
been the case. Steve Hostettler, a climatologist with the U.S. Geological 
Survey, told the panel that the site has been a lot wetter during periods over 
the past 10,000 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "We just can't say whether those conditions will recur," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over the dump has become the focal point of a national dilemma 
over what to do about accumulating waste from critical industries such as 
nuclear medicine. Currently, 31 states, including California, have no place to 
legally dispose of radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ward Valley dump would be the first of a new generation of state-operated 
nuclear facilities and the first to open in more than a quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
 The dump, if built, will consist of five sealed, underground trenches designed 
to take an estimated 5.5 million cubic feet of waste from nuclear power plants, 
hospitals, laboratories and manufacturing companies. The facility is expected 
to operate for 30 years, although much of the waste will remain hazardous for 
several hundred years, and a portion will be toxic for thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
 The panelists have indicated that they want to know if the waste trenches will 
be invulnerable to runoff in the event of flooding, and, if they aren't, how 
moisture will be prevented from leaving the trenches. They also want to know if 
the buried waste could pose a hazard to local plants and animals, including the 
desert tortoise now the Endangered Species List and categorized as threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Academy panel was under fire even before its first meeting. The 
Sierra Club, Physicians for Social Responsibility and other groups opposed to 
the dump charged that several panelists had close ties to the nuclear industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "My view is that it is a rigged jury," said Dan Hirsch of the Committee to 
Bridge the Gap, one of the groups opposed to the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, both sides in the debate have been focusing on the tritium issue, 
offering very different explanations for its presence under Ward Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the tritium originated as fallout from atmospheric testing of 
hydrogen bombs in the 1950s. If that's the case, it was able to travel 100 feet 
into the ground in less than 50 years. The only explanation, opponents contend, 
is the downward movement of moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 If that is so, the prognosis for the Ward Valley dump may not be good. It 
would mean contaminated moisture may travel fast enough to reach the water 
table while much of the radioactive waste still is toxic. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultants for the California Department of Health Services maintain that if 
the tritium in the ground was water borne, concentrations would be much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters point out that concentrations are 6,000 times less than what is 
allowed under the state's safe drinking water standards. That means, supporters 
say, the tritium arrived there as a result of gaseous diffusion -- a process 
that would have rendered the material harmless well above the water table. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides point to studies of another nuclear dump near Beatty, Nev., where 
the desert environment is believed to be virtually identical to Ward Valley. 
The Beatty dump now is closed. 
</P>
<P>
 From those studies, the Department of Health Services has concluded that 
moisture would not penetrate very far into the ground at Ward Valley before it 
evaporated.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet, tritium also was unearthed near the Beatty site. Found in a test well, it 
was about 400 feet down at concentrations that exceeded safe drinking water 
standards. It was found after the dump had been operating and receiving tritium 
waste for about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The finding of tritium contamination in monitoring wells contradicts 
assertions by Ward Valley proponents that radioactivity does not migrate in 
arid sites," said opponent Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Department of Health blame the presence of tritium on human 
mischief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody believes that well was spiked," said Brandt, the department 
counsel.  
</P>
<P>
 But David Prudic, a U.S. government geologist who has studied the Beatty site, 
sounded less confident about that explanation when he addressed the panel 
Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what to make of it at all," Prudic said. "I can't explain it. 
It's a puzzle. I don't know if it ever will be solved." The Evaporation 
Question 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over the proposed radioactive waste dump near Ward Valley has 
focused on one issue: Does desert moisture evaporate before it reaches the 
water table? 
</P>
<P>
 If it does, there is little chance of any leaking waste contaminating the 
ground water supply; if it doesn't, there's the potential danger of the 
polluted water reaching millions of people through the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the proposed construction: Proponents maintain: 
</P>
<P>
 Radioactive waste would be sealed in metal containers in large trenches. 
</P>
<P>
 While containers would decay over time, any water-borne waste would dry up 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Moisture does not penetrate far enough or fast enough to allow radioactive 
waste to reach the water table while it is still toxic. Critics maintain: 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny amounts of one naturally occurring radioactive substance, tritium, have 
already been found 100 feet underground. 
</P>
<P>
 The tritium would not be there unless carried by moisture draining through the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste buried in Ward Valley would eventually seep into the water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 20 feet: Trench ceilings when full. 
</P>
<P>
 42 feet: Bottom of one trench for radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
 60 feet: Bottom of four trenches for radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground water supply: 600 feet underground

CLAS IS RENAMED; FUTURE IN DOUBT; EDUCATION: WILSON MAY VETO THE $26-MILLION 
BUDGET ITEM FOR THE CONTROVERSIAL TESTING SYSTEM. SEN. GARY HART HAS PROPOSED 
LEGISLATION TO MEET OPPONENTS' CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California's pioneering but controversial student achievement tests emerged 
from the state's annual budget wars with a new name and an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Legislature sent this year's budget to the governor, the 
California Learning Assessment System had become the California Comprehensive 
Testing Program. Funding for the tests -- about $26 million -- was included in 
the $57.3-billion budget, but Gov. Pete Wilson's education adviser said she 
expects him to veto the expenditure and to continue pressing for changes in the 
exam system.  
</P>
<P>
 "The governor has made it very clear that until he sees significant reforms, 
he is not going to appropriate the money to continue the testing system," 
Maureen DiMarco, Wilson's secretary for child development and education, said 
this week. She was referring to statements Wilson made earlier in the year when 
he urged the Legislature to delete testing funds from the budget pending 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco added, however, that the governor is committed to having "a 
comprehensive testing system" and predicted that he would authorize funding if 
new testing legislation proposed by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) can be 
adapted to satisfy Wilson's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's legislation (SB 1273), which would reauthorize the statewide testing 
system for five years, has been heavily amended to address criticism by Wilson 
and others. It includes provisions for a wider role for parents and others in 
test development and review, prohibits questions about students' sexual, moral 
or religious beliefs and requires that test items include a mix of question 
styles that probe "building block" skills as well as higher-order thinking.  
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Hart said her boss has worked hard to answer the governor's 
concerns, and she expressed frustration over predictions that Wilson would 
blue-pencil funds for the system when he signs the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's bill has been approved by the Senate and the Assembly Education 
Committee and is awaiting a hearing before the Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 A veto would not hinder the scoring of this year's exams to be done over the 
summer, but would halt further development of next spring's series of tests, 
according to state Department of Education spokeswoman Susie Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old student testing program, taken this spring by about 1 million 
public school students in fourth, fifth, eighth and 10th grades, has won 
California national recognition for its high standards and its probing of 
higher-order thinking skills -- students' ability to discuss and apply what 
they have learned. Educators see such testing systems as key elements in the 
school reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quickly developed system has been plagued with problems in 
administration and scoring and has been criticized for the contents of its 
reading and writing portions.  
</P>
<P>
 Religious conservatives, in particular, have charged that the language arts 
tests promote bad values and illegally invade students' and their families' 
privacy. The opponents brought lawsuits against several school districts. In 
the one case in which a hearing was held on the opponents' complaints, a Los 
Angeles Superior Court judge ruled that the tests do not improperly solicit 
information about religious beliefs, family morals or practices.  
</P>
<P>
 But the controversies over the test have continued, prompting efforts to shore 
up public confidence in it.  
</P>
<P>
 The efforts included the appointment of a panel of experts in statistics to 
evaluate scoring methods used in exams given in 1993, the first year of the 
program. Their report, scheduled to be aired this week at a meeting of the 
State Board of Education, has been delayed for about two weeks. Lange said the 
panelists told the department they need more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a governor-requested evaluation of the financial, developmental and 
administrative aspects of the testing system is under way and is expected to be 
ready late next month, according to the state auditor's office, which is 
conducting the evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 The department of education is also making good on its promise in May to allow 
public examination of the current language arts exams once the school year's 
testing cycle was completed. Beginning July 18, the reading and writing tests 
for grades four, eight and 10 will be available for review -- but not to take 
or copy -- for one month at 41 sites statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the sites include all the county offices of education, 
as well as the headquarters for the Los Angeles Unified and Palmdale school 
districts. Besides the test questions, available materials include scoring 
guidelines, information about CLAS and how it was developed and samples of 
student work and scoring commentaries.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN ADS TARGET JOB LOSSES, CRIME; POLITICS: 
WILSON CAMP COUNTERS BY QUOTING DEMOCRATS WHO SAY STATE ECONOMY IS ON THE MEND. 
TREASURER ALSO ATTACKS GOVERNOR'S PAROLE POLICY, CITING 1992 MURDERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown launched a summer campaign offensive against 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson on Thursday, attacking him on two familiar fronts: 
crime and the California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new 30-second television spot, the Democratic candidate for governor 
claims California is the only state in the West to lose jobs during the past 
four years. The commercial closes with an unflattering photo of Wilson and this 
line: "Now Pete Wilson wants to keep his job, but what has he done to protect 
yours?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign aides responded by releasing a list of quotations from Brown's 
fellow Democrats -- including President Clinton -- that tout the California 
economy as being on the road to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Thursday, state Treasurer Brown traveled to the scene of a 1992 double 
murder in Pasadena to again attack Wilson's parole policy, which she alleged 
allows violators to remain on the streets "to rape and murder and kill innocent 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aides said the parolee charged with the Pasadena killings, Cedrick 
Singleton, had not been accused of any violent crime, either when originally 
sentenced to prison -- for auto theft and drug sales -- or when accused of 
violating the terms of his parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's reelection campaign spokesman, said Singleton would have 
remained free even under Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign officials acknowledged Thursday that Wilson has edged ahead of 
Brown in their own opinion poll during a period in which she based her campaign 
almost exclusively on crime and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, aides said, the state treasurer, who won the Democratic nomination for 
governor in the June 8 primary, will expand her attack to include the decline 
of education under Wilson and general allegations of fiscal mismanagement and 
government waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers have considered education to be a major potential issue for 
Brown, a former Los Angeles Board of Education member, and have wondered why 
she has not used it more aggressively. The aide said the education issue will 
get special emphasis later in the summer, as schools prepare to open for the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the parole question, Singleton, the figure in the case cited by Brown 
on Thursday, was arrested while on parole in 1992 for possession of an illegal 
knife and drug paraphernalia and for smoking marijuana. The parole officer's 
recommendation that Singleton be jailed pending a parole revocation hearing was 
overruled, Brown said, and he was freed. Singleton now is awaiting trial in the 
murder of the two Pasadena residents two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown claimed that the slayings were an outgrowth of a Wilson Administration 
policy crafted to "save dollars at the expense of human lives." Specifically, 
she alleged that the Wilson Administration has set quotas for reducing the 
number of convicts returned to prison for parole violations in an effort to 
relieve prison overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials denied that they have set such quotas, but have 
acknowledged that new parole procedures have resulted in fewer offenders being 
returned to prison for nonviolent and misdemeanor violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone committing a violent crime while on parole is returned to prison, 
Schnur said. And any parolee originally convicted of a violent crime will be 
returned to prison regardless of the nature of his parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown did not give a direct answer Thursday when asked what her policy was on 
returning parolees to prison for use of drugs, but said the parole agent's 
recommendation that Singleton remain in custody should have been followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's new television commercial is the second to air since the primary 
election. Both have dealt with unemployment, blaming Wilson for the loss of 
550,000 jobs since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to show that the economy is recovering, Wilson aides distributed 
recent quotes from several Democrats arguing that conditions are improving. One 
was a quotation from a magazine article on Clint Reilly, Brown's campaign 
manager, that said: "Last year, voters were more interested in the economy than 
in crime. This year, with the economy picking up, voters' primary concern is 
personal safety." 
</P>
<P>
 That notion has been reflected by major statewide polls. But a Brown campaign 
aide said Thursday that in Brown's own poll, 36% of the respondents said the 
economy, including the job situation, was the most important issue, followed by 
crime at 27% and education at 17%.

CALIFORNIA DATELINE / TONY PERRY: LIBIDINOUS LAUREATE SEEKS AN INTIMATE

 Kary Mullis, that puckish Nobel laureate and surfer from La Jolla, is at it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems that whenever journalists come around asking questions, Mullis, 49, who 
shared the 1993 big prize for chemistry for helping unravel the mystery of DNA, 
has something libidinous to say.  
</P>
<P>
 A couple of years ago he told Time magazine that he was partial to women 
10,000 days old (or about 28 years) because their bodies are at their height of 
lusciousness and fecundity, like "ripe avocados." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he told The Times that he loves to shake up grim-faced women scientists 
at his slide show lectures by slipping in a slide of a naked woman bathed in 
psychedelic light. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's gone a step further, possibly where no Nobel winner has gone before. 
</P>
<P>
 In the July issue of Esquire magazine ("Is Kary Mullis God? Or Just the Big 
Kahuna?"), writer Emily Yoffe says Mullis told her the only way she could 
really get to know him was to sleep with him. 
</P>
<P>
 She turned down Mullis' entreaty to engage in true participatory journalism: 
"I (told) him it will just have to be a flaw in my understanding."

 A watched pot never boils: A Southern California suburbanite--no name, no 
locale, please--thought he'd do his civic duty to keep dangerous drivers off 
the road. So when he smelled a guy reeking of marijuana in a convenience store 
and when that guy got into a pickup truck and had a fit of under-the-influence 
giggles, the suburbanite flagged down a cop and told him everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The cop was skeptical: "How do you know about this stuff?"

 Suburbanite: "I went to Berkeley in the '60s."

 Weasel politics: The Assembly's rejection of a bill to legalize the ownership

TAPES ON NIXON'S PAST IN LEGAL LIMBO; HISTORY: THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES, WHICH HAS 
RECORDINGS OF 400 INTERVIEWS, IS IN A CUSTODY DISPUTE WITH WHITTIER COLLEGE. 
</P>

<P>
 They are tape-recorded oral history interviews, numbering in the hundreds and 
containing some answers to the mystery that was Richard Nixon. But they remain 
under lock and key, bound up in boxes, accessible to no one. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the late President's daughters are allowed to hear them. 
</P>
<P>
 They can be found here, in a regional office of the National Archives. The 
government has them sealed, leaving them in what the agency's Washington 
spokeswoman calls "legal limbo." 
</P>
<P>
 No one sees any end to the dispute that has the effect of keeping the tapes 
frozen. It is a bitter rift between the National Archives, which says the tapes 
belong to federal authorities, and Whittier College, Nixon's alma mater, which 
views the tapes as its exclusive property. 
</P>
<P>
 "That may be," said Carmelo Richard Arena, the retired Whittier College 
professor who conducted the 400 interviews between 1971 and 1973, "but 
possession is nine-tenths of the law, and Whittier College doesn't have 
possession. The feds do." 
</P>
<P>
 Arena, who lives in Chino, said the interviews were conducted with scores of 
relatives, friends, neighbors and childhood contemporaries of Nixon and his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're people who knew him from the time he was born in 1913 to the time he 
entered politics, after leaving the Navy" in 1946, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They include an emotional conversation with Julie Nixon Eisenhower, the 
President's daughter, whom Arena interviewed in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the collection are what Arena calls knee-slapping stories from Les 
Brown, as in Les Brown and his Band of Renown, who knew Nixon, the piano 
player, at Duke University, where the two were classmates and friends during 
Nixon's law school years. 
</P>
<P>
 And they include insights from numerous neighbors and relatives who say 
Nixon's father -- a blue-collar grocer, a converted Quaker and, by all 
accounts, an angry man -- beat him and his siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things on the tapes would really open people's eyes," Arena said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the tapes was conceived in the early 1970s as part of an oral 
history collection for an eventual Nixon library. The now-defunct Richard Nixon 
Foundation chose Whittier College for the task and professor Arena as the 
interviewer, because Whittier College was expected to be the future home of the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 But Watergate intervened, and after Nixon's humbling resignation in 1974, the 
idea of raising funds for a presidential library appealed to no one, said Phil 
O'Brien, the Whittier College librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, the foundation -- the library-to-be's fund-raising 
apparatus -- quietly collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's deed of gift stated that the tapes were to be passed on to 
the Nixon presidential library, so, for safekeeping, they were given to the 
National Archives, which has never relinquished them -- and has no intention of 
doing so, spokeswoman Susan Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is now a Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace. Isn't it entitled to 
the tapes? 
</P>
<P>
 When the foundation collapsed, its assets were willed to Whittier College, 
which believed it would inherit the tapes, regardless of where the library 
ended up. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not to be. "The deed of gift specifically stated that those tapes 
go to the Nixon presidential library, rather than Whittier College," Cooper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier College has considered suing the federal government but has chosen 
not to do so because of the expense and time -- and the chances of losing -- 
that such a suit would entail, O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the dispute arose, the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace was opened in 
Yorba Linda, but at the mere mention of that facility, Cooper's tone turned 
brusque. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no Richard Nixon presidential library," she said. "Technically, it 
is not one under the law. It does not hold Richard Nixon's presidential 
papers," which are kept in the National Archives facility in College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine presidential libraries are administered by the National Archives. 
They do not include the privately run facility in Yorba Linda, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's presidential portfolio in the Maryland archives includes all materials 
related to Watergate, Cooper said, including the infamous Oval Office tapes 
that led to Nixon's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Richard Nixon left office, he took a lot of material with him," she 
said. "There were several court cases, and then legislation was passed, 
mandating that such material belonged to the government and had to stay in the 
Washington area. At this point, it would take an act of Congress to change 
that, and I don't see that happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither do the other principals, who say the inaccessibility of the tapes has 
created gaps in writings of Nixon's biographers. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have been able to use more than 200 taped interviews at Cal State 
Fullerton, which conducted its own oral history project on Nixon in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interviews were conducted by Fullerton history professor Harry Jeffrey, 
who believes he may have unwittingly inspired the Whittier project. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Nixon took office, Jeffrey flew to Washington to approach Nixon 
aide H.R. Haldeman, who rejected the idea of Jeffrey conducting an oral history 
program about Nixon's pre-presidential years -- the focus of both the Fullerton 
and Whittier endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two years, the Richard Nixon Foundation announced the Whittier project. 
</P>
<P>
 The tendency of the National Archives' spokeswoman to level criticisms at the 
Yorba Linda facility is unfair, Jeffrey says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yorba Linda library "has hired impeccable archivists," Jeffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a version of events that Cooper, the archives spokeswoman, confirmed, 
Jeffrey noted that "when Nixon was ready to resign, he signed a sweetheart deal 
with the General Services Administration, which at the time controlled the 
National Archives. The archives are now independent, but at the time, they were 
under GSA. 
</P>
<P>
 "That gave him control of all tapes -- all materials -- collected before and 
during his presidency. With the animosity felt toward Nixon after Watergate, 
Congress went ballistic when all of this was exposed. So, Congress overrode 
that agreement between Nixon and GSA and passed a law in late 1974, several 
months after his resignation, saying that all the Nixon materials were the 
property of the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said the Whittier tapes are not the only Nixon materials caught in a 
legal limbo. Hundreds of other items remain frozen, in effect, the product of a 
series of lawsuits between the Nixon estate -- which refuses to turn over 
certain materials -- and the archives. The disputed material includes 4,000 
hours of Oval Office tapes not related to Watergate.

HOUSE POSTAL WORKERS CALL OPERATION 'CESSPOOL'; CONGRESS: INTERVIEWS IN 1992 
REPORT SLOPPINESS. THEY CITE SIGNS OF EFFICIENCY ONLY WHEN DEALING WITH SUCH 
POWERFUL MEMBERS AS REP. ROSTENKOWSKI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Employees at the House post office described their workplace as a cesspool of 
sloth and disorganization that showed efficiency only when called on to do 
special favors for members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 And prominent among those who tapped the post office for help was Rep. Dan 
Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), the former Ways and Means Committee chairman now under 
federal indictment on corruption charges, according to transcripts released 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The transcripts, from interviews conducted two years ago as part of an 
internal House probe of its own postal system, portrayed an operation where 
tens of thousands of dollars lay loose in drawers and even on the floor, where 
record-keeping was sloppy or nonexistent, and where some of the highest-paid 
employees spent their days reading newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time a member (of Congress) wanted anything, I mean . . . just jump to 
it, you know, especially if it might have been a powerful member, you know, 
like Dan Rostenkowski," said Inga Lawson, a mail clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Former postmaster Robert V. Rota "pretty much would do anything for Dan 
Rostenkowski," Lawson told investigators for the Committee on House 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 While other House members and former members were mentioned as taking 
advantage of post office favors, Rostenkowski was singled out by several 
witnesses as particularly well connected. 
</P>
<P>
 On one occasion, a postal clerk was sent to help answer telephones in 
Rostenkowski's office while his staff attended a Christmas party. At another 
time, a postal worker spent "months" stamping calendars with Rostenkowski's 
greetings and mailing them out. Post office drivers were dispatched to make 
special pickups for the Illinois Democrat, Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever he'd call or wanted something, in fact everybody had to jump to it, 
you know, regardless of what it was," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski's office referred a request for comment to Dan Webb, his lawyer 
in the corruption case, who did not immediately return telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 After the interviews were conducted in the spring of 1992, the House ended the 
political patronage hiring system at the post office and placed the operation 
under the control of a nonpartisan administrator, Michael J. Shinay. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems at the post office were central to the investigation that led to 
Rostenkowski's indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 The two volumes of transcripts, totaling 3,293 pages, also provide glimpses 
into the partisan bickering that accompanied the panel's probe, special 
arrangements with lobbyists, rides to the airport or other destinations 
provided to certain lawmakers and special pickups of campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 One witness, former postal secretary Margaret Hatcher, told of a secret set of 
66 postal boxes maintained by Rota that he used to collect "dear colleague" 
letters sent by House members to each other and forward them to favored 
lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Rota pleaded guilty a year ago to conspiracy and embezzlement charges for 
helping one former and one current member of Congress obtain cash illegally for 
personal use by submitting vouchers. He agreed to cooperate with prosecutors as 
part of the deal that led to his guilty plea, and he is likely to be a 
principal government witness against Rostenkowski at the Illinois congressman's 
trial.

PITY THIS HARRY AND LOUISE: NO INSURANCE!; HEALTH CARE: THE DEMOCRATS GIVE 
EFFECTIVE TV AD CHARACTERS A DIFFERENT SPIN. THIS TIME THEY ARE ADVOCATES FOR 
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The health care debate, already more than a little surreal, took another step 
toward the twilight zone Thursday as two of television's most prominent 
fictional characters lost their health insurance, courtesy of the Democratic 
National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The characters are named Harry and Louise, the same as the couple made famous 
by the insurance industry through a highly successful series of advertisements 
attacking Clinton's health plan. This time, they return to the small screen 
arguing the other side of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance industry used their Harry and Louise ads to raise doubts about 
the workability of Clinton's plan. The new ad, produced for the Democrats by 
Clinton's friend Harry Thomason, the Los Angeles-based television producer, is 
designed to provide "a reality check and maybe a little humor" for the health 
debate, Democratic Chairman David Wilhelm said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ad, two actors who resemble the Harry and Louise from the insurance 
industry ads are in bed -- Harry in a full body cast, Louise with her leg 
elevated and her arm in a sling. Harry, it appears, has lost his job and with 
it, his health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You said universal health care was too complicated," Louise says, a nagging 
tone in her voice, and then shoves Harry. "You said, you'd never lose your job 
so we'd always be covered. You said, what would we do when the government runs 
out of money?  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, who's out of money now, Harry!" 
</P>
<P>
 The ad, which the DNC has started broadcasting in New York and Washington, 
ends with an announcer picking up the tag line from the original Harry and 
Louise advertisements, but adding a pro-Administration twist. "There is a 
better way," the announcer says. "Tell Congress you want what they already 
have. The security of affordable, universal health care." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Assn. of Retired Persons, one of Washington's most powerful 
lobbying groups on health issues, also unveiled an ad campaign Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The $800,000 effort got under way this week in 53 cities in 29 states, 
featuring two television spots and a radio ad urging the public to demand 
congressional enactment of health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Horace Deets, AARP's executive director, also sent a letter this week to each 
member of Congress, warning that failure to overhaul the health care system 
will cause the public to become "more impatient and cynical with our 
institutions of government." 
</P>
<P>
 Most elderly groups already are on record in support of President Clinton's 
reform agenda. AARP has not endorsed it, although the organization supports 
Clinton's proposed employer mandate as the chief financing mechanism to achieve 
universal coverage.

LAW ENFORCEMENT; COP'S ALLEGED ROLE IN HEIST MAY BE LAST STRAW IN SALVADOR; 
NATIONAL POLICE HAVE SO FAR ESCAPED MANDATED DISSOLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It became clear that last month's daring midmorning bank robbery would become 
an unusually dicey case when police officers watching a videotape of the 
assault recognized the ringleader as one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, authorities now say the robbery, in which five people were killed, 
was directed by a National Police lieutenant who was also a commander of that 
agency's division of investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The participation of a senior police officer in such a brazen crime has 
exploded into a major challenge for the 5-week-old government of President 
Armando Calderon Sol. Far from an isolated act, the crime laid bare the 
corruption within a police force that Calderon Sol had taken great pains to 
defend. And it exposed an unsavory phenomenon that the government never wanted 
to admit: the existence of organized crime in state institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very surprising to see the frankness with which (officials) are now 
talking about organized crime and the need to dismantle it regardless of who 
might fall," said Roman Catholic Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attitude of the new president before such corruption and impunity at the 
highest levels of government will be crucial for the nation's future." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Police is a militarized security force associated with right-wing 
death squads and human rights abuses during the civil war decade of the 1980s. 
It was to be disbanded under terms of U.N.-brokered peace accords that ended 
the war in 1992, and replaced by a professional, nonpolitical Civilian National 
Police whose members were to include former combatants from both sides of the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon Sol and his predecessor, ex-President Alfredo Cristiani, resisted 
dismantling the National Police, arguing that it was needed until the civilian 
police were fully functional. The government repeatedly pushed back the 
deadline for phasing out the National Police and allowed its police academy to 
continue turning out cadets. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank heist, however, has forced Calderon Sol to admit his solution may be 
part of the problem. He announced last week that he will shut down the National 
Police by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must purge the interior of our public security institutions, apply the law 
to whoever commits a crime and put an end to the impunity that has prevailed 
for so long," Calderon Sol said. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 22 bank holdup began when 15 men, dressed in police uniforms and 
armed with grenades and assault rifles, attacked an armored car making a 
delivery at a downtown branch of the Banco de Comercio. The episode escalated 
into a free-for-all as outnumbered bank guards shot it out with the assailants, 
who eventually made off with more than a quarter of a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Three guards and two civilian passersby were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged role of Lt. Jose Rafael Coreas Orellana in organizing the raid 
might never have been revealed if a television news crew had not stumbled upon 
the bank as the assault unfolded.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the television station could broadcast the footage, however, a National 
Police platoon appeared at the station's offices and demanded the tape. The 
station's manager refused, aired the tape on a midday newscast -- and Coreas 
Orellana was identified by other cops who had tuned in to watch a World Cup 
soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested along with two former policemen and a taxi driver. He has 
declared his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank heist, combined with a recent surge in kidnapings of rich farmers and 
others, has alarmed the business class that is Calderon Sol's most important 
base of support and is fearful of lost foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a full-page newspaper advertisement this week, the National Assn. of 
Private Enterprise urged swift action by the government to stop the crime wave, 
"whoever turns out to be guilty."

NUCLEAR ARMS; U.S. HOPES SWISS TALKS WILL BARE N. KOREA'S INTENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Over the next week in this tranquil Swiss city, the United States will try to 
find out, finally, what North Korean President Kim Il Sung has in mind for his 
fast-moving nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 Are Kim and his impoverished regime determined to obtain nuclear weapons, no 
matter what the cost, as the guarantee of their survival? Or do they see 
nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip that would ultimately be abandoned for the 
right price from the United States and its allies? 
</P>
<P>
 Those questions have bedeviled the Clinton Administration for more than a 
year, becoming one of the top preoccupations of U.S. foreign policy. Now, in 
negotiations with North Korea here, the Administration hopes to get some 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks open today, with Assistant Secretary of State Robert L. Gallucci 
heading the American team and Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju leading the 
North Korean delegation. The United States has said it will offer North Korea a 
series of diplomatic and economic concessions in exchange for abandonment by 
Pyongyang of its capability to make nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're prepared to talk to them (the North Koreans) about their concerns," 
Gallucci said in a mid-Atlantic interview en route to Geneva. At the same time, 
he went on, "We're interested in getting to the heart of the nuclear issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The talks are of extraordinary significance, not only for the nations of Asia 
but for the future of efforts to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials fear that if North Korea succeeds in developing such weapons, 
neighboring countries -- Japan, South Korea, Taiwan -- could feel compelled to 
follow suit, heightening the risks of destruction in the most economically 
vibrant region of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 And nations outside the region with the potential to acquire nuclear weapons, 
such as Iran and Iraq, could eventually take the path blazed by North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks will take place under considerable time pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 In early June, defying the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), North 
Korea withdrew spent fuel from its nuclear complex at Yongbyon. The fuel 
includes plutonium, which could be reprocessed by the end of this year into 
enough material for five or six nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 That material, in the form of thousands of fuel rods, now sits in pools of 
water while its intense radioactivity cools down. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States held two earlier rounds of talks with North Korea last 
summer, which were suspended because North Korea repeatedly delayed and 
resisted efforts by the IAEA to carry out full inspections of Pyongyang's 
nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 When North Korea began removing the fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor last 
month, the Administration began talking to its allies and members of the U.N. 
Security Council about imposing economic sanctions against Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the North Korean president invited former President Jimmy Carter to 
Pyongyang and gave assurances that he would freeze his nuclear program during a 
new round of talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Few experts believe that the United States and North Korea will solve all of 
the contentious issues dividing them within the next 10 days. Instead, U.S. 
officials may seek some short-term deal in which North Korea extends the freeze 
on nuclear development in exchange for some limited concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 That would give the two countries time for further confidence-building steps.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, U.S. officials admit the possibility that North Korea's freeze may be a 
delaying tactic and that they may find Pyongyang is not willing to negotiate 
away its nuclear program. In that case, they say, they will soon find 
themselves again seeking sanctions against North Korea. The Talks' Hot Topics 
</P>
<P>
 These are the main issues likely to be addressed in negotiations between the 
United States and North Korea: 
</P>
<P>
 Nuclear fuel: North Korea recently removed enough fuel from its nuclear 
installation at Yongbyon to produce five or six nuclear weapons. The United 
States wants to make sure that this material remains under international 
safeguards and is not reprocessed to produce weapons-grade plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 History of the North Korean plant: The United States believes that North Korea 
diverted nuclear fuel from the Yongbyon plant once before, in 1989, obtaining 
enough material for one to two nuclear weapons. North Korea has denied doing 
so, but it has refused to permit international inspectors to carry out the 
checks needed to verify what happened in 1989. The United States wants North 
Korea to account for the history of its nuclear program and to give up whatever 
weapons-grade material it produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomatic recognition: North Korea is one of the world's most isolated 
states. The Clinton Administration has said that the United States (along with 
other allies, such as Japan) is prepared to move toward diplomatic relations 
with the Pyongyang regime as part of a deal for ending the North Korean nuclear 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic aid: The United States has suggested it would help arrange economic 
help for North Korea as part of a settlement of the nuclear issue. One 
possibility North Korea mentioned last year would be for the United States and 
its allies to replace the existing nuclear equipment at the Yongbyon facilities 
with new light-water nuclear technology, with which it would be much more 
difficult, if not impossible, for North Korea to make weapons-grade plutonium. 
Japan, South Korea and some European countries might be asked to help pay for 
this new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Security: North Korea would like the United States to provide some form of 
guarantees of its security. In particular, before giving up its nuclear 
program, Pyongyang wants the United States to promise that it would not use 
nuclear weapons against North Korea.

STUDY PUTS SMOKING'S MEDICAL BILL AT $50 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Smokers burn up about $50 billion a year in direct medical costs associated 
with cigarettes, or about $2 a pack, according to a study by UC Berkeley and UC 
San Francisco researchers and federal scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures, announced Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, are nearly double the size of the medical bill attributed to 
smoking in previous CDC studies, but confirm more recent, informal data. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's staggering," said John Bloom of the Coalition on Smoking OR Health. "It 
shows that tobacco is as harmful to the economy as it is to health." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom's group, a coalition of the American Heart Assn., the American Lung 
Assn. and the American Cancer Society, is seeking a $2-a-pack increase in the 
federal tobacco tax. The tax is now 24 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers analyzed the recently released National Medical Expenditures 
Survey of 1987-88, which tracked the health expenses of 35,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that data, the team estimated that in 1993, smoking cost $50 billion 
in medical care, with $26.9 billion -- 54% -- spent on hospitalization alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers footed 43% -- 89 cents a pack or $21.6 billion -- of the total bill, 
the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 For each of the 24 billion packs of cigarettes sold last year, about $2.06 was 
spent directly on medical care associated with smoking, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, Thomas Lauria, cited earlier studies, 
including one from the CDC, that found far lower medical costs associated with 
smoking. He noted that the nation's 48 million adult smokers already pay an 
average of 56 cents a pack in state and federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smokers are not only paying their own way, but they add to the public 
coffers," Lauria said. "We stand by our conviction that those costs do not 
exceed the taxes collected on the product." 
</P>
<P>
 CDC medical epidemiologist Dr. Thomas Novotny, assistant dean of UC Berkeley's 
School of Public Health, countered: "Smokers do pay taxes, but the economic 
burden is shared by more than just smokers."

 The Khmer Rouge was outlawed by a controversial measure designed to weaken the 
brutal guerrilla group that has battled the government for 15 years."It is time 
to give up," Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the first prime minister, told the Khmer 
Rouge after unanimous passage of the law by Parliament. The vote averted a 
fracture in the government after it reported an attempted coup led by 
Ranariddh's half brother, Norodom Chakrapong, on Sunday. Passage of the law 
came after Parliament included amnesty provisions.

CLINTON EXHORTS POLES TO HEW TO FREE MARKET'S 'PROVEN PATH'; EUROPE: PRESIDENT 
LAUDS CITIZENS' WARTIME VALOR BUT SAYS THEY FACE NEW CHALLENGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Appealing to logic and national pride, President Clinton sought Thursday to 
bolster weary Poles' faith in the free market's "proven path to prosperity," as 
economics overshadowed security concerns in his second day of meetings with 
Polish leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who later flew to Naples, Italy, for a three-day economic summit that 
begins today, spoke in an appearance before the Sejm, or lower house of 
Parliament, of Poles' valor in fighting Adolf Hitler and in their long 
struggles against the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said Poles now face the challenge of economic and democratic reforms, 
which will not yield the same drama as their war experiences did. "If we meet 
them well, our reward will not be stunning moments of glory, but gradual and 
real improvements in people's lives," he told the chamber in a 20-minute 
address that received only mild applause. 
</P>
<P>
 The preoccupation of Polish leaders with economic questions was apparent in 
Clinton's meeting with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and leaders of the 
left-wing coalition that dominates the Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Pawlak "didn't say a word" about the new North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
membership plan that has dominated public debate between American and Polish 
officials in recent months, said a senior Clinton Administration official, who 
added, "It just didn't come up." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Pawlak and Polish officials focused their discussion on U.S. economic 
aid, and most particularly on their desire for sharply stepped-up American 
investment in Poland, officials said. Surprising some analysts, the United 
States has become the largest single source of foreign investment in Poland, 
with a total of $1.2 billion, or 44% of the overall sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Polish President Lech Walesa underlined the same interest Wednesday when he 
said that Polish hopes rest "in the American generals -- General Motors and 
General Electric." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, insisting that neither they nor American taxpayers favor a new 
"Marshall Plan," did not leave Warsaw without pledging additional help for the 
Poles. 
</P>
<P>
 They announced outlines of programs they said are worth about $200 million. 
These efforts aim to increase American investment and offer Poles help in 
building housing and their banking system; others will assist the Poles in 
improving their programs to find new jobs for the unemployed and fight the 
crime that has grown amid Poland's reforms. There also is a $65-million "Polish 
Partners Fund," which will use government seed money and U.S. labor unions' 
pension fund assets to create a larger investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials said one of the greatest changes Poland must undertake is 
reform of its social welfare system, which is poorly organized to meet its 
citizens' needs. In keeping with the Soviet system, government assistance is 
doled out widely -- it goes to 85% or 90% of the population, although perhaps 
80% of Poles might not qualify for it if income was the only criterion, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many Poles have expressed grave concern about the troubled economy 
and the political tumult of the post-Soviet era here, American officials 
insisted that Pawlak and his allies reaffirmed their intention to stay the 
course of reform. "They were all voicing a commitment to economic reform of the 
market," said one official, adding that all -- including former Communists -- 
"sounded like total converts." 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Clinton was unstinting in his praise of Poles. He recited their 
wartime heroics, including the Warsaw uprising against Hitler ("the greatest 
urban uprising of this century") and their success in breaking Nazi codes in 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official said such praise was an effective way to 
appeal to a people who have suffered deeply through the centuries. "What he's 
basically doing is something the Poles really appreciate, in that he's honoring 
them for their history of being . . . raped, pillaged and plundered," the 
official said. "The Poles love to hear the fact that they're the heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton included in his speech other language intended to reassure the Poles, 
who worry about military threats, especially from a resurgent Russia. "No 
democracy in this area should ever be consigned to a gray area or a buffer 
zone," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to fears that Russia might use its clout in international 
organizations to affect the course of Western military aid, Clinton said that 
"no country should have the right to veto, compromise or threaten democratic 
Poland's, or any other democracy's, integration into Western institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he did not answer a question Polish officials have pressed over and 
over: When will Poland be allowed full membership in NATO? 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton stressed how far the Poles have come toward capitalism and democracy. 
"Poland faces what may be fairly described as its best prospects for peace and 
security in 350 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Clinton made ceremonial visits, drawing enthusiastic but small 
crowds. He stopped at the Monument to the Ghetto Uprising, which memorializes 
the resistance of Jewish fighters in the Warsaw uprising; a monument to 
children who took part in the uprising, and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

I'M NO COUP PLOTTER, GORBACHEV THUNDERS; RUSSIA: EX-SOVIET LEADER DENIES 
COMPLICITY IN 1991 ATTEMPTED PUTSCH DURING TREASON HEARING AGAINST A CHIEF 
CONSPIRATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "Lies! Arrogant lies! Lies and slander!" 
</P>
<P>
 When, at long last, former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev took the 
stand Thursday to set the record straight on the 1991 Kremlin coup attempt, his 
main message -- publicly under oath for the first time -- was a disgusted 
denial that he had collaborated with the plotters. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are all lies, lies, shameless lies by people who have lost everything," 
Gorbachev said of allegations that he initially went along with the coup, that 
he could have phoned or escaped from his junta-imposed captivity at a 
government estate in the Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the talk of falsehood, the trial Gorbachev attended is meant to 
establish the historical truth of the three-day August putsch that horrified 
the world and, within months, led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Formally, military judges at Russia's Supreme Court are now hearing charges of 
treason against Gen. Valentin I. Varennikov, one of the most active of the 
dozen conspirators. But in reality, participants and spectators say, the trial 
is also meant to determine who is to blame for the Soviet Union's messy 
disintegration. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev, who remains as scorned at home as he is revered abroad for ending 
the Cold War, must have had to steel himself for the courthouse ordeal, which 
began with a gantlet of protesters shouting "Judas!" as he entered. 
</P>
<P>
 But the former president, initiator of the Soviet reform program known as 
perestroika , said he had decided to testify because he wanted to ensure that 
Russians see the error of trying to solve problems by force instead of legal 
means. 
</P>
<P>
 If the coup attempt appears justified, he said, "We'll never truly become a 
country. . . . Everything will be decided by the latest rebels." 
</P>
<P>
 His court appearance has also prompted speculation that the 63-year-old former 
leader, rosy and energetic as ever, may be planning a political comeback. He 
told the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week that he would not rule out 
running for president in Russian elections planned for 1996. "If I see that my 
participation is necessary, I will not avoid it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Gorbachev will be participating in what he termed a very "strange 
trial," a clearly political forum in which his role could last two days or two 
months, considering the volume of information he holds. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was strange to begin with because Varennikov, like the other coup 
plotters, could have taken advantage of the parliamentary amnesty issued in 
February covering all Russia's recent political clashes. Charges were dismissed 
against all defendants implicated in the 1991 coup attempt and last October's 
parliamentary revolt. Only Varennikov refused the favor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the amnesty remains in force, and even if Varennikov is convicted of 
treason, he will go free. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial also has something of a time-warp atmosphere. Several of the 
plotters, including former Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov and former 
KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, attended Thursday, still much the thinner for 
their months in prison before the amnesty. Protesters outside shouted: "Soviet 
Union! Soviet Union!" 
</P>
<P>
 Nostalgia, in fact, was the very essence of the courtroom drama, with 
Gorbachev and Varennikov each fighting to pin the blame for the Soviet Empire's 
demise on the other -- neither allowing that the collapse could have been 
inevitable, perhaps even for the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev clearly cannot escape the tormenting thought that he was just on the 
verge of cementing the Soviet Union together with a new agreement, the Federal 
Treaty, when the coup ruined the entire long-negotiated deal. "The collapse of 
the Soviet Union was not unavoidable," he lamented. "The conclusion of the new 
treaty was actually a real alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 When it did not focus on one of the most significant political events of the 
late 20th Century, Gorbachev's testimony included accounts, detailed to the 
point of trivia, describing his experiences during the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Letting his throaty voice reflect all his outrage, he accused Varennikov, then 
commander of Soviet land forces, of intentionally isolating him from the launch 
mechanism for the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons, thus endangering the 
country's security. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at a pillared lectern that faced the three judges rather than the 
audience, Gorbachev asserted that he was not after revenge but added, "We'll 
never accept the law if we forgive everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and defense lawyers focused largely on trying to determine whether 
Gorbachev could somehow have indicated his consent to the imposition of 
emergency rule. Several conspirators have claimed that he initially went along 
with the putsch plan, then backed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev allowed that the country was facing difficulties and that emergency 
rule had been discussed but denied fervently that he had given his approval to 
the State Committee on the Emergency Situation, as the junta called itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Calm and statesmanlike at first, Gorbachev grew noticeably more irritable as 
the day wore on, particularly after Varennikov accidentally-on-purpose referred 
to him as "the accused" instead of as a witness. At one point, Gorbachev 
advised a defense lawyer to read his memoirs for the answer to a question. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not clear whom they're accusing; they seem to have forgotten about 
Varennikov," Nikolai Zyryanov, a World War II veteran, said in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev's testimony was scheduled to continue today, but possibly in closed 
session.

 The first U.N. relief flight in weeks landed at Kigali airport as efforts were 
stepped up to forge a cease-fire between victorious Rwandan rebels and 
remaining government forces.The Canadian military transport plane flew to the 
Rwandan capital from Nairobi, Kenya, with supplies and troop reinforcements for 
the small U.N. contingent that has battled for weeks to save people from 
slaughter. "You are welcome," Maj. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, commander of U.N. 
forces in Rwanda, told arriving peacekeepers from Ghana. The airport had been 
closed since it came under mortar fire in early June.

 Four African presidents met in Pretoria to seek an end to Angola's civil war, 
but South African President Nelson Mandela said the conflict could not be 
settled without participation by Angolan rebels. Mandela gathered Angola's Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos, Mozambique's Joaquim Chissano and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire 
for talks on Angola, where rebels have been fighting the government for nearly 
20 years. The leaders said the talks had helped ease tensions between Zaire and 
Angola, but no representatives of the Angolan rebel movement UNITA were 
present.

 Emergency workers battled to smother wildfires that have killed 19 people this 
week, including five crew members of a plane that crashed while trying to douse 
the flames.Firefighters, soldiers, police and volunteers struggled to control 
blazes that have threatened at least 325,000 acres along the Mediterranean 
coast. The emergency drew assistance from neighboring France and Portugal, a 
gesture that ended in disaster when a Russian-made Antonov fire plane sent by 
Portugal crashed near Alicante on Wednesday, killing four Ukrainians and one 
Portuguese. One Ukrainian survived with serious injuries. By midday, 17 fires 
were still burning in the regions of Catalonia, Valencia, Murcia and Andalusia.

18 DEAD IN GEORGIA FLOODS AS STORM HITS FOR 4TH DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Divers searched for bodies in murky floodwaters and rescuers plucked people 
hanging from a tree Thursday as rain fell for the fourth straight day in 
southwestern Georgia. The death toll reached 18. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300,000 people were without safe drinking water for a second day, 
after floodwaters from remnants of Tropical Storm Alberto knocked out water 
treatment plants. Tens of thousands of acres of prime farmland were under 
water, while cities along the Flint River braced for a record flood. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton on Thursday authorized federal disaster aid for four Georgia 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen people have been killed, 10 of them in Americus, as flash floods 
swept through. Four people were reported missing, although Sumter County 
Coroner Lynwood McClung held out hope. "These creeks went way back in the 
woods. It's possible we could find these people hanging in trees, still alive," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Macon, about 80 miles northeast of Americus, firefighters on a 
hook-and-ladder truck rescued three men from a tree in the raging Ocmulgee 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Albany prepared for the worst as the Flint River flowed over its 
banks and sent water rushing into streets in a low-lying area. At least 14,000 
residents were ordered to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to reinforce the levees with sandbags," Albany State 
College spokeswoman Jackie Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flint is expected to reach 44 feet -- 24 feet above flood stage -- by 
Saturday. Most Albany businesses sent employees home, and a dusk-to-dawn curfew 
was ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ocmulgee was believed to have crested at 35 feet Thursday at Macon, where 
the flood stage is 18 feet. But officials could not say for sure because the 
river gauge was swept away. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150,000 people in Macon and surrounding areas have been without water 
since the treatment plant flooded Wednesday. Statewide, more than 300,000 
people were without water. 
</P>
<P>
 Water was brought to some areas by tanker trucks. At one water distribution 
site, 750 people stood in line. People were asked to restrict themselves to one 
gallon per house, but some walked away with five gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll check with some of my homebound friends to see if they could use a jug 
or two," said Mary Eva DuBose, who was carrying five empty jugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Water covered almost 60,000 acres of peanuts, 19,000 acres of cotton and 
10,000 acres of corn. Crops could be saved if there is a break in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Peanut and cotton farmer James Short said his land "is rolling enough so that 
not a lot of it's going to stay under for more than a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to government-owned structures alone was put at $58 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As rain continued to fall across southeast Alabama, some 2,500 people were 
evacuated from the levee area of Geneva, a town of about 4,600 near the Florida 
line where two rivers converge. At Elba, where more than 1,200 were evacuated 
earlier, the Pea River climbed more than 20 feet in about 24 hours to 38 feet 
Thursday morning -- six feet from the top of the levee. 
</P>
<P>
 In Florida, state officials predicted that the Chipola River, with a flood 
stage of 19 feet at Marianna, could crest near 30 feet today. Similar 
conditions were forecast for three other rivers.

BILL TO END PRENATAL CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS LEFT UNRESOLVED; FUNDING: 
ASSEMBLY ADJOURNS WITHOUT TAKING NEW VOTE, LEAVING WILSON WITH A PIECE OF 
UNFINISHED BUDGET BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Assembly adjourned for a summer recess Thursday without reconsidering its 
earlier rejection of a measure to end the provision of prenatal care to 
pregnant illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, which Gov. Pete Wilson and Republican lawmakers say was part 
of a bipartisan agreement on the state budget, fell five votes short of passage 
Tuesday night and was to be reconsidered Thursday. It is the only piece of the 
budget package not yet on Wilson's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aides say the governor is expected to sign the budget today. To pay for 
the prenatal program without adding to the state's deficit, Wilson will have to 
use his line-item veto to delete about $50 million for services that would have 
gone to legal California residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga intended to ask the 
Assembly to reconsider its vote Thursday but said he concluded that doing so 
would be fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have the votes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte said Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown assured Wilson and other 
legislative leaders during budget negotiations that Assembly Democrats would 
provide sufficient votes to pass the bill if all 33 Republicans in the lower 
house voted in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown has said he warned Wilson that the Assembly probably would not pass 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget, which a majority of Democrats voted to approve, contains only 
enough money to keep the prenatal program running through Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But a separate state law establishes the service as an entitlement program, 
meaning that any woman who applies for the program and qualifies must be given 
the care -- whether there is money in the budget for it or not. The bill the 
Assembly rejected would have repealed that law. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson argues that the prenatal care is one of many magnets drawing immigrants 
into California illegally. The state, says Wilson, should not be providing this 
service to illegal immigrants when it does not have enough money to give the 
same care to all legal residents who need it. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, however, contend that Wilson's policy is shortsighted. They point 
out that the children of illegal immigrants are U.S. citizens. If they are born 
ill and their parents are poor, their care is paid for by California taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte said he may try again to pass the bill when the Assembly reconvenes in 
August after a four-week recess.

HAWAII'S HEALTH PLAN OFFERS LESSONS FOR FUTURE; MEDICINE: AN EMPLOYER MANDATE 
ACHIEVES COVERAGE FOR 96% OF THE STATE'S WORKERS. BUT OTHER EFFORTS STILL MUST 
HELP THOSE WHO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Atop a wind-swept bluff with an ocean vista that a posh resort would envy, the 
Waianae Comprehensive Health Clinic on Oahu's leeward coast offers a compelling 
view of the benefits and limits of the employer mandate -- the controversial 
linchpin of President Clinton's health reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 years under a state law that requires employers to pay part of their 
workers' health insurance, 96% of Hawaiians enjoy medical insurance, easily the 
highest percentage of any state. Yet this rural clinic still provides $1 
million a year in uncompensated care to those lacking coverage, mostly people 
who drift in and out of odd jobs, seeking treatment only when a serious problem 
arises. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hawaii's not perfect," says Dr. Jack Lewin, a chief architect of the state's 
recent efforts to cover everyone. "But we have powerful lessons for the future. 
We're not theoretical. We're real." 
</P>
<P>
 Many lawmakers and analysts, the President among them, believe that requiring 
employers to pay the lion's share of their workers' health costs is the most 
feasible way to achieve universal coverage and that spiraling costs cannot be 
contained until everyone -- including the nation's 38 million uninsured -- is 
covered. But others believe that cost containment must come first, with the 
savings used to extend coverage gradually. They also believe that an employer 
mandate would pose severe financial burdens on many businesses, costs that 
would only grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii's unique experience as the only state with an employer mandate offers 
lessons for all participants in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the results of the state's experiment: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hawaii has contained costs, even while expanding coverage, and is 
approaching universal coverage, with 96% of its 1.2 million residents covered. 
The explosive growth of insurance costs for all, especially small businesses, 
has been lowered by 30% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 * An employer mandate alone does not guarantee that all will be insured. Other 
programs must be put into place to pay for the medical care of those who slip 
through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Independent studies have shown that the employer mandate has not resulted in 
"disruptions" or high unemployment among small businesses here, but the costs 
to such firms have clearly grown over the years. The employers' share of 
premium payments has skyrocketed in relation to employee contributions, and the 
state has required a host of new benefits that must be covered, further driving 
up costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Louis Harris & Associates poll, sponsored by the California-based Kaiser 
Family Foundation, found that 56% of small businesses in Hawaii cited health 
insurance as "a major problem," more so than any other government mandate. And 
yet, the identical percentage also said they would support an employer mandate 
if one were proposed today. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly universal coverage can dramatically improve overall public health, 
further reducing spending and leading to a more productive work force. Hawaii 
officials cite the infant mortality rate, which is down 50% from its 1974 high 
of 16 deaths per 1,000 births, and the state's life expectancy of 78, the 
highest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hawaii adopted the Prepaid Health Care Act in 1974, most of the state's 
then-million residents already were insured. The employer mandate was designed 
to reach the 17% believed to be without coverage, roughly the same percentage 
of Americans nationwide who now lack health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 All employers were required to pay at least 50% of an employee's health 
insurance premiums. But the state law capped a worker's contribution at 1.5% of 
wages. Thus, a minimum-wage worker in the mid-1970s, when health costs were 
much lower than they are now, paid almost one-third of the cost of his 
insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, insurance premiums skyrocketed, far outpacing the growth in 
wages. Yet the 1.5% cap remained, meaning that employers were forced to pay an 
increasingly disproportionate share. 
</P>
<P>
 "Workers are not being asked to share the burden. There has to be more of a 
shared responsibility," said Russell R. Watanabe, president of a family-owned 
flower and floral supplies business in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials concede the point. Lewin, the former state health director who 
is now seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, said the cap on 
individual contributions should be raised to "somewhere between 3% and 6%" to 
make the arrangement more equitable. (Originally, Hawaii had intended a 50-50 
split between employer and employee.) 
</P>
<P>
 Watanabe and many other small business owners also complain that the frequent 
addition of new and costly benefits -- such as in-vitro fertilization and 
mental health -- have forced many small business owners to reduce other 
benefits, to lay off employees, to hire more part-time workers or simply to go 
out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Subsidies may come and go, but mandates are forever," said Bette Tatum, state 
director of the National Federation of Independent Business, a small business 
advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton would require employers to pay the premiums of part-time 
employees working as little as 10 hours a week, Hawaii placed the cutoff at 20 
hours or more per week. 
</P>
<P>
 Watanabe and other entrepreneurs said some business owners have attempted to 
duck the mandate by hiring part-timers to work 19 hours a week. In the Harris 
poll, three of 10 firms said they had engaged in the practice in the last two 
years, specifically to avoid the requirement. But state officials disputed such 
claims, noting that the percentage of part-time workers on the islands (18.2%) 
is lower than on the mainland (19.2%). 
</P>
<P>
 A study this year by the General Accounting Office concluded that the employer 
mandate in Hawaii "has not resulted in large disruptions" among small 
businesses. But it also questioned the extent to which Hawaii's experiences 
might be replicated nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Hawaii's law -- unlike Clinton's proposal -- did not require 
dependent coverage. Yet, because of the state's tradition of generous 
plantations that provided free medical care to workers and because of strong 
pro-union forces here, most businesses have chosen to pay the cost of dependent 
coverage as well. Up to 80% of companies pay the full premium for dependents, 
state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Too, the state's traditionally low unemployment rate -- below 5% last year -- 
forces employers to be competitive. "Good employees are hard to get. The costs 
are high but I'm willing to do it," said the owner of a gift shop in Honolulu's 
Ala Moana Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to part-timers, Hawaii's mandate exempted from coverage seasonal 
workers and salespeople working on commissions. It is they and the working poor 
ineligible for Medicaid who have eluded the reach of the employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, the state has significantly expanded Medicaid eligibility, 
bringing in thousands of previously uninsured residents, mostly women and 
children. And in 1990, the state launched with great fanfare the State Health 
Insurance Program to further target the remaining uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Clinton's plan would require all individuals to have insurance, 
with the needy receiving partial or full subsidies from government. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such efforts to reach universal coverage in the state, as many as 20% 
of patients who show up at the Waianae clinic are uninsured, administrator 
Richard Bettini said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is the same story at the bustling Queen Emma Clinic in downtown 
Honolulu. Of the 38,000 patients who visit the clinic each year, one in four is 
uninsured, director Chuck Duarte said. 
</P>
<P>
 C. J. Eguchi, 22, has come seeking treatment for a severe cold. Now 
unemployed, she recently came off a series of part-time jobs that totaled more 
than 30 hours, but not one of which qualified her for employer health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 She is uninsured. "Oh, I'll get billed directly, but I don't know how much, or 
how much I can pay," Eguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The adjacent Queen Emma Hospital ends up picking up the tab for the uninsured, 
passing the $3-million to $4-million annual cost on to paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need an employer mandate," Duarte said. "But some employers are right; 
the demands are too high on the employers." 
</P>
<P>
 It is clinics such as Duarte's that, when all else fails, reach the remaining 
uninsured, Lewin said. "Anyone can walk in off the street." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite some problems in achieving total coverage, officials here 
generally agree that the employer mandate is the essential building block of 
universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without it," said Marvin Hall, Hawaii's top private health insurance 
executive, "you are just not going to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our message to Congress is, 'Whatever you do, don't sacrifice universality,' 
" Lewin said. "If you commit to universal coverage, everything else will fall 
into place. Otherwise, you'll have prolonged agony of rising costs and more 
cost-shifting."

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; OFFICERS CHEER AS JUDGE UPHOLDS DETECTIVES' SEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For several days, the much-maligned Los Angeles Police Department was under 
the national spotlight once again, this time for conducting a controversial 
search of O.J. Simpson's estate after his ex-wife and her friend were slain. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday came sweet vindication, when Municipal Judge Kathleen 
Kennedy-Powell upheld the actions of the detectives who let themselves onto 
Simpson's Brentwood property after the murders. There were cheers at the LAPD's 
Downtown Parker Center headquarters and quiet gulps of relief at police 
stations from San Pedro to the San Fernando Valley, where officers were 
practically glued to their TVs and radios. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a police officer's position these days, it's damned if you do and damned 
if you don't," said robbery-homicide Detective Jim Barry. The 30-year veteran 
works alongside those in the Simpson case whose efforts were challenged in 
court by Simpson's attorneys. And like them, he said, he routinely has to 
defend his evidence-gathering efforts under the withering cross-examination of 
defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get judged on a situation that happens in a matter of minutes, by people 
with law books and a week or two of hindsight," he said. "It's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry's sensitivity on that point is not uncommon within the department, which 
has endured criticism over the Rodney G. King beating, its response to the Los 
Angeles riots and a divisive and prolonged labor negotiation. In recent days, 
officers have had to sit by as high-profile attorneys publicly impugned the 
integrity and professionalism of the detectives who arrived at Simpson's 
compound and searched part of the premises before obtaining a search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the judge agreed with defense lawyers that a bloodstained glove and other 
evidence were illegally obtained, police said, it might have been the biggest 
humiliation yet for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, police got a nice, nationally televised "atta boy." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had all the confidence that those detectives knew what they were doing," 
Barry said as he and his partner discussed the case over a couple of Bob's Big 
Boy hamburgers. "But you just don't know in these courts -- you can't take 
anything to the bank. Nothing's a gimme." 
</P>
<P>
 That holds true not only in the court of law but also in the court of public 
opinion -- and some officers had been bracing for another setback in both. 
</P>
<P>
 After the ruling, the official LAPD comment was terse. "We knew we were doing 
the right thing when we did it," Lt. John Dunkin said. "Nothing that happened 
in court was unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were more ebullient. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all heartened by it. It validates our collective efforts," said Sgt. 
Bob Brounsten of the West Los Angeles Division, the station whose officers were 
the first at the scene and led the way to Simpson's house. Brounsten and his 
officers intently watched the televised proceedings, rooting for their 
colleagues on the witness stand as defense attorneys tried to trip them up.

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; CHALLENGES TO EVIDENCE RULING LIKELY TO FAIL, EXPERTS SAY; 
PROCEDURES: SIMPSON ATTORNEYS WOULD NEED NEW INFORMATION TO REOPEN ISSUE, THEY 
SAY. SOME CONTEND THAT DEFENSE TOOK A MAJOR RISK BY FILING ITS MOTION EARLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After failing in its long-shot bid to suppress highly damaging evidence, O.J. 
Simpson's defense team vowed Thursday to challenge a judge's ruling on that 
issue if the former football star is placed on trial for murder, but legal 
experts predicted that that will be an uphill battle too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The care with which the judge conducted the hearing and made her findings 
makes it unlikely her ruling will be overturned as the case proceeds," said 
Loyola University criminal law professor Samuel A. Pillsbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some defense lawyers said the decision was vulnerable, many others 
agreed with Pillsbury. So did Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. E. Thomas Dunn, 
who specializes in evidence issues. "The chance of the defense getting a 
reversal of this ruling in Superior Court is virtually nil," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawyers said Simpson's attorneys had taken a major risk by filing a 
motion to keep out evidence at this stage of the case because Municipal Court 
judges rarely grant such requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "To make a motion like this so early is extremely chancy because so much more 
information is going to develop" that could have helped the defense had it 
filed later, said San Francisco defense lawyer Doron Weinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg and others said the defense team may have made the bold move because 
they are attempting to start the trial in "the court of public opinion" and 
wanted to raise as many doubts as possible about the prosecution's case as 
early as possible before a huge audience of potential jurors watching the 
proceedings on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "My suspicion is the defense felt they needed some weapons, as a public 
relations gesture and as a matter of case strategy and momentum," Weinberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he said the defense is now in a better position to assess the 
strength of the prosecution's case, knowing that blood splatters found in the 
driveway of Simpson's estate, a bloody glove found on the grounds of the estate 
and blood found on the door handle of the former football star's white Ford 
Bronco will be admitted into evidence, barring a reversal of Judge Kathleen 
Kennedy-Powell's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the prosecution's victory, Los Angeles defense lawyer Janet Levine 
said the defense still could prevail somewhere along the line. "Sometimes, when 
you are on the defense, you only have to win one time and it doesn't matter 
where, but the prosecution has to keep winning." 
</P>
<P>
 A challenge to Kennedy-Powell's ruling would be bound by the record of 
testimony introduced on the suppression motion during the preliminary hearing. 
Defense lawyers will not be able to call any new witnesses or introduce any new 
evidence unless they can demonstrate exceptional circumstances, according to a 
section of the California Penal Code. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceivably, Simpson's lawyers could argue that important information was not 
available to them at the time of this week's first hearing, said Los Angeles 
defense lawyer Barry Tarlow.  
</P>
<P>
 Because Simpson's preliminary hearing was held so soon after the crime, "it's 
reasonable to believe" that such information may come to light, and that may 
give defense lawyers a better shot at presenting new evidence in a Superior 
Court hearing on the search, said San Diego defense lawyer Elizabeth Semel. 
</P>
<P>
 However, several experienced defense lawyers said they had never won an 
"exceptional circumstances" motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more significant for both sides, Kennedy-Powell's decision appears to 
pave the way for prosecutors to use all the evidence they now have at trial -- 
including evidence gathered by police officers inside Simpson's house after 
they obtained a search warrant about 10 hours after the discovery of the bloody 
bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman outside her 
Brentwood condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most critical decision on the admissibility of evidence," 
Pillsbury said. "Even though the warrant evidence wasn't litigated at the 
preliminary hearing, it will probably stand or fall on the initial search 
because they're all connected." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's decision covered only a portion of the motion filed by defense 
lawyers, who also sought to invalidate the search warrant, contending that it 
was improperly obtained by police officers who made "material 
misrepresentations" to a judge. Kennedy-Powell ruled only on the admissibility 
of evidence obtained before the search warrant was issued; she declined to rule 
on evidence gathered after the warrant was obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion asserted that Detective Philip L. Vannatter "misrepresented the 
nature of (Simpson's) absence" from his home by stating in an affidavit that he 
had left on an "'unexpected flight to Chicago in the early morning hours of 
June 13, 1994, when they were fully aware" that he was on a planned business 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense motion also states that at the time Vannatter made this statement, 
police officers had spoken to Simpson on the phone in Chicago and learned "that 
he was fully cooperative and indicated his intention to immediately return to 
Los Angeles on the next available flight." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge did not consider Vannatter's affidavit in making her decision 
because Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark did not attempt to introduce any 
evidence from the search of the house. But the judge listened to his testimony 
and that of Detective Mark Fuhrman, who talked at length about the officers' 
feelings that "exigent circumstances" made it necessary for an officer to scale 
a five-foot wall at Simpson's estate before obtaining a search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 In a key finding, the judge said she believed the officers. "The court finds 
that they were, in fact, acting for a benevolent purpose in light of the brutal 
attack and that they reasonably believed that a further delay could have 
resulted in the unnecessary loss of life." 
</P>
<P>
 That finding is critical if defense lawyers challenge the judge's ruling or if 
they attempt to have the search warrant invalidated, according to legal 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge made several factual findings. Unless they are clearly erroneous 
they are not reviewed by the Superior Court judge," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said the Superior Court judge can review the legal conclusions 
Kennedy-Powell made, based on the facts presented at the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 If Simpson is bound over for trial, the defense could file new motions seeking 
to reverse Kennedy-Powell's ruling and to overturn the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a full-blown hearing on the validity of the warrant, the defense has to 
make a substantial showing in writing that the police officer lied or made 
representations in his affidavit that were in reckless disregard of the truth, 
according to Dunn, the Orange County prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 If the defense can make such a showing, then it could call the officers and 
others to the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 If a Superior Court judge rejects defense motions on the warrantless search or 
on the validity of the search warrant, the defense could file a writ seeking 
relief from a state court of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, those writs are denied summarily by postcard," said Los Angeles 
defense lawyer Andrew M. Stein. He said the California Supreme Court also 
routinely rejects such pretrial appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the defense could challenge the legality of the warrantless search 
and of the search warrant as part of an appeal if Simpson is tried and 
convicted.

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; JUDGE CITES CASE NOT MENTIONED BY EITHER SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her decision Thursday, Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell cited a 1989 
California appeals court ruling she found in her research, a decision that was 
not mentioned in either the defense or prosecution's briefs. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said the case, People vs.Cain, "although not identical to the 
circumstances in (the Simpson) case, is more similar than most of the other 
cases" on the critical issue on which she was ruling: What "exigent 
circumstances" justify a police search without a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fresno appeals court decision stemmed from the beating and attempted rape 
of a Merced County woman. When sheriff's deputies came to the victim's 
apartment, "they could hear music coming from the next apartment and could see 
lights were on, and it was early in the morning," Kennedy-Powell said, 
describing the situation outlined in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the officers "knocked on the door, received no answer" and decided 
there could be an additional victim. They entered the unlocked door and found 
the defendant passed out and intoxicated. They recovered evidence, she said, 
including bloodstains and clothing that eventually tied the defendant to the 
crime for which he later was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court upheld that warrantless entry, and Kennedy-Powell said the 
language in that decision was "particularly helpful" in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Due weight must be given to the "reasonable inference" an officer's experience 
entitles him or her to draw from the facts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she said, the appeals court stated that the search "must be 
strictly circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation." 
Kennedy-Powell explained that evidence in the Simpson case showed that the 
search was legal because it had not exceeded the bounds necessitated by the 
emergency the officers reasonably perceived. HENRY WEINSTEIN

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY; SIMPSON MURDER CASE; IN 'JUST THE FACTS' TONES, 
DETECTIVES WOO TOUGH AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY

<P>
 When Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell upheld a fence-jumping Los Angeles police 
entrance onto O.J. Simpson's estate, she strengthened the credibility of LAPD 
investigators whose testimony is so important in prosecuting the football hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, the believability of the cops may not have been such a big 
issue. As late as 1988, the Los Angeles Times Poll showed that 74% of Los 
Angeles residents held a positive view of the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last three years, events have soured the relationship between the 
cops and many Angelenos. "As soon as you have a man with a badge taking the 
stand, you know that instead of him having that aura of credibility, there may 
be one juror who (thinks) quite the opposite," Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti 
recently told me. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rodney King beating was followed by a drop in public support for the 
department. A 1991 Los Angeles Time Poll showed just 34% approved. This climbed 
to 67% in the latest survey taken last month, much better but still below 
pre-King, pre-riot levels. 
</P>
<P>
 These public perceptions of the LAPD will be important if Simpson is ordered 
to stand trial for killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, 
Ronald Lyle Goldman. Perceptions of the police, and of the preliminary hearing 
testimony of police detectives, are important in shaping the mind-set of 
potential jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Public attitudes will be especially tricky if there is a Simpson trial. It 
would be held in the Downtown Criminal Courts Building, where the jury pool 
tends toward the working class, with substantial numbers of African Americans 
and Latinos. It's important to note that the poll shows that blacks and Latinos 
are substantially more suspicious of the LAPD than are whites. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be a tough audience, and homicide detectives Philip Vannatter and 
Tom Lange will have to be persuasive salesmen if they testify at a Simpson 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As I watched Vannatter and Lange on the witness stand at the preliminary 
hearing, I wondered who played the con man and who played the SOB when the 
detectives engaged in the game of good cop, bad cop. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter has a steady, sort of flat voice, a small paunch and a face that is 
friendly, with deep lines earned during 15 years in robbery-homicide. Lange 
looks more intimidating because of his thick mustache. But when he started 
talking, Lange spoke with the same spare, unemotional manner as his partner. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this manner that made them so convincing. Why did they go from the 
murder scene to Simpson's nearby residence and enter it without a search 
warrant? In heavy detail, Vannatter explained the circumstances: They wanted to 
notify Simpson that his former wife was dead and that his small children were 
at the police station. The cops wanted to tell him, Vannatter said, "before the 
media got hold of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In supporting the cops, Judge Kennedy-Powell picked up on Vannatter's 
reference to the small kids. "The place for two small children is not at a 
police station, sitting in a corner drawing pictures," the judge said. "The 
place for those children is with their family." This was part of her reasoning 
that the cops had a legitimate reason to be on the Simpson property. 
</P>
<P>
 After the judge announced her decision at the opening of Thursday's session, 
we got another example of why the two detectives are strong witnesses. This 
time it was Lange describing the death scene. 
</P>
<P>
 He told of Simpson lying on the walkway, Goldman nearby, the blood around the 
two bodies, "draining down the sidewalk in an easterly direction from Nicole 
Simpson." He told of bloody shoe prints "leading away from the body, westerly. 
. . . She was lying more or less on her left side in what I would call a 
semi-fetal position." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark's questions were as detailed as his answers. 
His voice was so bland, his manner so controlled that it was almost possible to 
forget he was taking us through a bloody, horrible scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter-of-fact presentation was so mundane that it had the effect of 
making Simpson one more murder suspect in a city full of them. It was a clever 
spin to the prosecution's case, considering the demographic potential of jurors 
in the Downtown courts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, Simpson's attorney, also seems to understand the 
composition of the Downtown jury pool and its high percentage of minorities, 
who tend to be more suspicious than whites of the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why the attorney hammered away at something that appeared to be a 
small part of the two detectives' testimony, their impatience with the need to 
follow every rule of a department notorious for its large number of 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Did they fill out a form containing the narrative of their investigation? No, 
Vannatter said, they didn't use the form because they were called to the scene 
before dawn. Instead, he said his partner, Lange, wrote the narrative on blank 
white paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you follow the department manual on murder investigations? Shapiro asked 
Lange. "I have read it," Lange replied. "It hasn't been updated for several 
years. It is not a hard-and-fast text on how to conduct a homicide 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure that's true. But in bringing up their attitude toward regulations and 
manuals, Shapiro touched on something of tremendous importance to south and 
East Los Angeles, home to many Downtown jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 People in those communities want police officers to follow rules and 
regulations. They complain of cowboy cops breaking rules there frequently, 
bursting into houses, ignoring courtesy and civil rights. In South-Central, 
rule-breaking brings up visions of Rodney King and recollections of the 1988 
Dalton Street raid, when 80 police officers burst into two apartment buildings, 
rendering them uninhabitable. None of the residents was charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the past two days, when the testimony of LAPD officers dominated 
the proceedings, it seems that both the prosecution and the defense appreciate 
the fact that times have changed, that a cop's credibility is no longer a 
given.

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; AS WORLD TURNS ON SIMPSON CASE, SOAP OPERA FANS ARE UPSET; 
TELEVISION: VIEWERS ARE FLOODING EXECUTIVES WITH COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE LIVE 
BROADCAST OF THE REAL-LIFE DRAMA. 'I'M SICK OF THIS. I WANT MY SHOWS BACK,' 
SAYS ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's an angry television audience out there that's fed up with the 
real-life drama of O.J. They want to know what's going on in the make-believe 
dramas of Erica, Bo, Billie, Gina, Peter, Victor and Jennifer. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of soap opera fans have been flooding ABC, NBC and CBS with 
complaints about the gavel-to-gavel coverage of the preliminary hearing in the 
O.J. Simpson murder case that has brought a temporary curtain down on most of 
their favorite daytime dramas. Just like in the soaps, emotions have ranged 
from frustration to rage. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the hearing began June 30, when all three networks started putting aside 
the majority of their morning and afternoon programming to air the hearing, the 
calls have been growing in number -- and in fury -- say network executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, they were just angry that the shows were not on, but now they've 
escalated into really angry calls, death threats, things like that," said Susan 
Lee, vice president of daytime programming at NBC. "The calls have come from 
all over the country. They just can't believe that someone isn't watching an 
episode somewhere . These fans are desperate to get to anyone at the network 
who can get them a tape, or make a decision to put the shows back on." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Reilly, a spokesman for NBC's "Days of Our Lives," said: "A day 
without 'Days' is difficult for our fans, and they don't feel shy about letting 
us know." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the soaps were reaching critical crises in their story lines, some 
soap experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at CBS and ABC also said they had received several complaints from 
viewers over the preemption of soaps such as "Guiding Light," "All My 
Children," "The Young and the Restless" and "As the World Turns." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding in part to the furor, NBC has scheduled two episodes of their 
popular soap "Days of Our Lives" tonight in an unusual prime-time slot. The 
two, one-hour episodes will be broadcast back to back at 9 and 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But NBC added that there were no immediate plans to show another soap, 
"Another World," in prime time, and officials at CBS and ABC said they have no 
plans to show any of their preempted soaps in prime time or late at night until 
after the conclusion of the hearing, which could last into next week. 
</P>
<P>
 To fend off concerned fans, network officials -- as well as many of the news 
anchors involved in hearing coverage -- have told them that they will not miss 
any episodes, that the dramas will resume at the point where they left off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're letting them know that they're not missing anything," an ABC 
representative said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to broadcast the hearings has cost stations about $200,000 a day 
in advertising revenue, sources have said, but officials declined to offer 
further details on how they are dealing with advertisers about rescheduling 
commercials and adjusting rate scales. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the viewers who are really feeling shortchanged, said Lynn Leahey, 
editor in chief of Soap Opera Digest, a biweekly magazine for soap fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine being in the middle of a great book, and then you lose it and can't 
find it," Leahey said. "That's the way many of these folks feel. It's the 
ultimate frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 Leahey said most of the complaints have centered on the perceived overkill of 
the hearing coverage: "It's not like the fans don't have interest in the trial, 
because they do. But they don't see the necessity of having to see two hours on 
a hair follicle. They say this case is not a life-threatening emergency like 
the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, they want their soaps and O.J. too. They want the network to show 
the soaps, and break in whenever something important happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Gladys Vaughn of New York, a retired nurse, said she is furious at CBS for 
preempting the soaps. She said watching her dramas -- "The Young and the 
Restless," "As the World Turns" and "Guiding Light" was one of her few daily 
pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how mad I am," said Vaughn, 64. "Why does it have to be on 
every channel when it's only going to be on all the newscasts at night anyway? 
Why don't they just do a capsule summary at 11 p.m.?" 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla Jones, a supervisor with the Los Angeles County Department of Child 
Services, said: "I'm ticked off." Jones said she is addicted to "All My 
Children" and "One Life to Live." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's on every station, every day, every night," she said of the preliminary 
hearing. "I can't get away from it. When the trial comes on, I turn it off. 
It's like a big circus to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Her sister, Laura Boyce, a data entry operator with the Los Angeles Regional 
Family Planning Council, agreed: "So what if O.J.'s an ex-football player? He 
puts his pants on one leg at a time just like everyone else does. I'm sick of 
this. I want my shows back."

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; CASE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In denying a defense motion to suppress evidence, Judge Kathleen 
Kennedy-Powell cited a 1989 ruling. The case involved an elderly woman who was 
assaulted in Merced County.While questioning the woman, two sheriff's deputies 
heard music through the wall of the adjoining apartment. Believing another 
victim might be inside, they entered through the unlocked door and found Dale 
Vernon Cain drunk and asleep on the floor. His clothes fit the woman's 
description, and bloodstains matched her blood type. After a judge ruled the 
entry was legal, Cain pleaded no contest to attempted rape. IN THE LIMELIGHT 
</P>
<P>
 Robert H. Philibosian and Ira Reiner, two of the many lawyers serving as media 
commentators on the Simpson case, are familiar with the pressures of 
prosecuting high-profile cases in Los Angeles. Both are former Los Angeles 
district attorneys. Philibosian's cases included prosecution of Angelo Buono 
for the Hillside Strangler slayings of 10 young women and girls. Reiner oversaw 
such trials as the McMartin Pre-School molestation case and the Richard Ramirez 
Night Stalker murder case. Reiner is serving as a consultant for NBC News; 
Philibosian has been interviewed on a variety of programs.

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; TRANSCRIPT OF RULING DENYING MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Statement by Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell, who on Thursday denied a 
defense motion to suppress evidence found by police who entered O.J. Simpson's 
estate without a search warrant. The transcript is from CNN-Journal Graphics.  
</P>
<P>
 First of all, before announcing the ruling with regard to the 1538.5 motion, 
I'd just like to say both attorneys, both sides in this case, did an excellent 
presentation -- for which the court is grateful -- and you both gave me quite a 
bit to think about during the last several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The key issue for the court's determination is whether the warrantless entry 
into the property on Rockingham and the recovery of certain items of physical 
evidence was justified in light of exigent circumstances. And there's -- this 
is really a gray area of the law. I mean, there's no set formula to establish 
when an exigent circumstance does exist and when it doesn't, and it's really 
something that has to be decided on a case-by-case basis, based upon the 
evidence that's actually presented in the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 There were numerous cases cited by the prosecution as well as by the defense. 
The court has reviewed all of those cases. The court also found an additional 
case that I did not see cited by either the prosecution or the defense, which 
-- although not identical to the circumstances in this case -- is more similar 
than most of the other cases, and that case is People v. Cain . . . a case 
decided in December of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In that particular matter, the situation was that there was a woman who had 
been beaten and raped in a certain apartment. The officers went to that 
location, observed her. Through the common wall, they could hear music coming 
from the next apartment over and could see that lights were on, and it was 
early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers knocked on the door, received no answer and made a determination 
in their own minds that they felt that there could indeed be an additional 
victim in the adjacent apartment. The door was unlocked and they entered that 
apartment. They later found the defendant passed out on the floor intoxicated 
and recovered physical evidence including bloodstains and clothing that 
eventually tied that particular defendant to the crime for which he was later 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The court upheld the warrantless entry into that apartment, and the language 
in that case the court finds particularly helpful in this particular matter. 
The court indicates that due weight must be given, not to the un-particularized 
suspicions or hunches of the police officers involved, but to the reasonable 
inference which he, or she, is entitled to withdraw from the facts in light of 
his or her experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, that court places a limitation, which other courts indeed have 
recognized . . . that the search involved must be strictly circumscribed by the 
exigencies which justify its initiation. Let's consider the evidence in this 
case -- and basically, the evidence that was presented in this matter is for 
the most part un-controverted with regard to the search. 
</P>
<P>
 We know from the evidence that was presented that the detectives in this 
matter, Vannatter, Fuhrman, Lange and Phillips, I believe, started out at the 
crime scene on Bundy. They made the observations of the two dead bodies, the 
blood, the glove, the footprints and the droplets of blood leading away from 
that location. There's no dispute as to what they saw there at Bundy. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also no dispute that there were two small children who apparently were 
asleep inside that particular location at the time of the incident itself, and 
that those small children were taken to the police station. Notwithstanding 
suggestions to the contrary during cross-examination, the place for two small 
children whose mother has been murdered is not at the police station sitting in 
a corner drawing pictures on a tablet. The place for those kids is with their 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The detectives testified that they were concerned about those children and 
wanted to make arrangements with regard to those children. The person who is 
the next of kin to those children is the defendant. He's their father. He's the 
person that logically would be the one that would be called upon to take 
action, to take custody of those children. So I don't find anything improper -- 
in terms of the police conduct -- with the idea that they are going to go to 
the Simpson home. 
</P>
<P>
 One might say, "Well, why didn't they just call?" Well, apparently they didn't 
have the phone number to the Simpson home. We learned that through the 
testimony -- that they had to get Westec Security to come actually out to the 
location to try to get that phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 So they go to the Simpson home, which apparently is only some two miles away 
and a short car ride. They get to the gate, and here again it seems to me that 
they really do extraordinary things to try to make contact with the persons 
inside. I mean, the testimony was that they rang that bell for some 15 minutes 
to try to roust somebody from within the house. They could hear that phone 
ringing from out at the gate. There's no response. 
</P>
<P>
 But what do they see? And this apparently also is un-controverted in light of 
the testimony that was presented. There's a light on upstairs. There's a light 
on downstairs. There's several vehicles in the driveway -- a suggestion that 
there are persons inside. But then there's more, and of course this is the 
crucial piece of evidence, but it by itself -- without all of the other 
surrounding circumstances -- would not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 But what the officers say is -- while they're shuffling around for this 15 
minutes trying to get in touch with someone inside the house -- is that they 
see blood, what they believe to be blood, on the door handle or near the door 
handle of this white Bronco, a white Bronco that is parked on a public street 
where the officers have a right to be. And the court sees no problem with the 
observing or recovery of the blood sample from the door of the Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
 So, seeing what they believed to be blood and having seen droplets of blood 
leading away from the location, the officers even now are doing more to get in 
touch with the people inside. They're calling the Westec Security who 
apparently dispatches at least one, if not two vehicles to the location and 
eventually give the police the telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 What they get at that point is an answering machine. They feel -- the 
testimony of both officers was that they felt that there was an emergency 
situation. The officers are cross-examined at length, both by Mr. Uelmen, (of) 
the initial officer, and by Mr. Shapiro, (of) Detective Vannatter. And both 
lawyers, defense lawyers in this case, did an excellent job on 
cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 But when one looks at the result of that cross-examination, basically there 
were really no holes put in either of those detectives' testimonies that they 
felt they were acting in an emergency situation at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, I go back to that language in Cain. The search must be strictly 
circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation. This would be a 
very easy decision for me if in fact these officers went in there like storm 
troopers, fanning out over the property, examining every leaf, every car, every 
closet, every nook and cranny of this location. 
</P>
<P>
 But the testimony as elicited by the officers, and as supported by the 
witnesses that testified on behalf of the defense, show that this was not what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 What the testimony was is that the officers went in search of persons on the 
property. They went to the guest quarters of Mr. Kaelin, woke him up. Now, 
someone might say, "Well, what are they doing looking at those tennis shoes?" 
Well, they didn't know what the situation was. They knew there were bloody 
footprints that led away from that location, and there was blood on this 
vehicle that somehow is tied in, or could be tied in, to that. 
</P>
<P>
 So they pick up the tennis shoes. There's no blood on those shoes, but they 
don't start searching under beds, searching drawers, they don't handcuff Mr. 
Kaelin. They don't do anything like that. Instead, what they do is, they asked 
him if there's other persons on the property. And where do they go? He directs 
them to Arnelle Simpson's quarters, apparently further down that pathway. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Arnelle Simpson testified the officers didn't ask her whether there was 
anyone hurt or injured or a suicide or something like that going on. But what 
did Arnelle Simpson tell us? She told us that while she was walking into that 
house taking a path to the front door and opening it with a key, the officers 
asked her about the live-in maid. Again, we have to judge the officers' conduct 
and the exigency if there was one, not based upon what all of us know today, 
but based upon what the officers knew at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 And the information that they had been provided by Westec Security was that 
there was a live-in maid at the location. Additionally, Westec Security advised 
them that they had not been informed that there was going to be a vacation or 
an absence of the residence from that location. 
</P>
<P>
 We know now, obviously, that there was no dying person or injured person on 
the property of the Simpson estate at that time. We know that all the persons 
who were supposed to be there were accounted for. Mr. Simpson was in Chicago. 
Mr. Kaelin was in his quarters. Ms. Arnelle Simpson had been out and returned 
about 1 o'clock in the morning and Gigi, the maid, was on her night off. But 
the officers didn't know that at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 So their immediate question -- "Where's the maid?" -- and a quick, sort of 
cursory look around the area of the maid's room once they get into the house 
again seems to be, was conduct that was strictly circumscribed by the 
exigencies which justified its initiation, the language from that case. 
</P>
<P>
 Now what happened once the officers got into the house? What happened was they 
got on the telephone, they did exactly what they said they were there to do, 
which is to make arrangements for those children. Cathy Randa was called. Mr. 
Simpson was located and contacted in Chicago. Apparently Mr. Cowlings was 
contacted. Nicole Brown's parents were contacted. This is exactly what they 
said they were there to do, and that's what they did. 
</P>
<P>
 There's some suggestion, although I'm not sure that it's clear from the 
record, that at some point in time Arnelle Simpson apparently left the location 
in order to get the children, presumably leaving the police there at the scene, 
although that part of it is not clear to me. There's no indication at any point 
in time that the officers were told to leave, that they were not welcome there. 
Ms. Arnelle Simpson was apparently so upset, and justifiably so, by the 
circumstances of which she was informed, that she couldn't even talk on the 
phone and explain to those persons that she was calling what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 And the only other thing really that went on while the officers were there at 
that time, at that portion of the testimony, was that they talked to Mr. 
Kaelin. "Did anything unusual happen around here last night?" And we know from 
Mr. Kaelin's testimony that there was a loud, jarring, banging on the wall of 
his guest quarters, one that scared him, that he didn't know the origin of, 
that he had mentioned to several other persons but had never really 
investigated himself. 
</P>
<P>
 So the officers have that information from Mr. Kaelin, and Detective Fuhrman 
walks down that path, he doesn't go anywhere else on the property. Officers 
make no attempt to go upstairs. They don't start opening cupboards, lifting up 
carpets, opening vehicles. He goes down that path to the area approximately 
adjacent to the air conditioner where that noise was seen and the picture 
jarred from the wall and finds a glove -- a glove that appears to be the 
apparent mate to the glove found at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 And at that point, he describes that he walked down toward the end of the path 
to see where it would lead, looking to see whether he would find a body there, 
and that's sort of what he expected to find according to his testimony. He then 
takes the other detectives one at a time to that location and shows them the 
glove as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the suggestions in defense argument that this ruling allowing the 
officers' conduct, or finding that it was reasonable and there were exigent 
circumstances, would mean the end of the 4th Amendment and the Constitution and 
anarchy, I disagree. And I think one only needs to look as far as the fact that 
a short time after the glove was discovered, that the officers did in fact 
obtain a search warrant and apparently many other items of evidence were 
recovered, none of which are going to be offered during the course of this 
particular proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 So in my mind, the 4th Amendment is alive and well. It is recognized. It's 
nothing new, nothing novel that I am coming up with here that there are exigent 
circumstances that on occasion justify a warrantless entry and a limited 
search. And this, it appears to the court, is what occurred in this particular 
case based upon, as I indicated, not only the testimony of the officers as to 
what their state of mind was, but the specific actions that they took which 
show, in fact, that indeed was their state of mind. And they are entitled to, 
and the court is entitled to, give weight to the experience of those officers 
in drawing their conclusions. And what we learned about those officers is that, 
I think, one had 19 or so years of experience and Vannatter over 25 years of 
experience in an elite homicide unit, and all of that can be taken into 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 The court finds that they were in fact acting for a benevolent purpose in 
light of the brutal attack and that they reasonably believed that a further 
delay could have resulted in the unnecessary loss of life. And therefore, the 
court denies the defense motion to suppress and will allow the introduction 
into evidence of the glove that was recovered and of the spattered blood spots 
that were located on the driveway once the sun came up, as well as the 
bloodstain from the Bronco which was in plain view on a public street.

BOSNIA'S MUSLIM LEADERS SUPPORT WESTERN PEACE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnia's Muslim leaders recommended Thursday that their Parliament accept a 
peace plan demanded by the United States, Russia and Europe, increasing 
pressure on reluctant Serbs to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic Serbs, who have seized 70% of Bosnia in 27 months of war, would have to 
give up territory under the plan presented Wednesday in Geneva.It would leave 
Serbs 49% of Bosnia and give a Muslim-Croatian federation 51%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serbs' leader, Radovan Karadzic, had fumed that the plan smacked 
of "an absolute American dictate." But on Thursday, in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, he 
sounded more conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
 While repeating that the Serbs "had been hurt most by the maps," Karadzic 
stressed that he had not rejected the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 He indicated that Serbian acceptance could hinge on whether their areas would 
be allowed to unite with Serbia, the dominant state of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs would want constitutional arrangements and questions of access to 
the sea and control of Sarajevo nailed down before resuming talks, Karadzic 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, peace envoy Thorvald Stoltenberg briefed the Security 
Council on the international plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the only realistic proposal, and I . . . hope this will turn 
into a peace agreement because what is the alternative? It is continued war," 
Stoltenberg said after the closed meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The swift Muslim endorsement of the plan makes it likely the Bosnian 
Parliament will accept it in a vote planned for July 18.

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; ROUNDUP; WOLF NEAR PERFECT FOR 4 INNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Wolf, masterful in two City championship games at Dodger Stadium, showed 
Thursday night he has Busch Stadium conquered, too. He pitched four hitless 
innings, striking out five and allowing only one baserunner in his Olympic 
Festival debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the West team, Wolf didn't pitch until the sixth inning. By 
that time, the North already had all the runs it needed to post a 4-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, from El Camino Real High, issued one walk, and a disputed one at that. 
Catcher Tom Topaum was on his way to the dugout after framing an 0-and-2 
curveball, but the umpire called the pitch a ball. Otherwise, Wolf was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Bryan LaCour was in two chances at third base, and also in a pair of 
plate appearances. LaCour, from Chatsworth High, had a single in the seventh 
and a double in the bottom of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Schaeffer, who played at Harvard-Westlake High, started at catcher for the 
West and was hitless in four at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Olympic Festival action: 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Zakharyan of Glendale and partner Brian Pace of Augusta, Ga., lost only 
one game in sweeping three mixed doubles table tennis matches and advancing to 
the quarterfinals on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Zakharyan, ranked fourth in the nation among women's players, split two 
singles matches during team competition, defeating Karen Change of Jamica 
Estates, N.Y., 21-11, 21-10, and losing to second-ranked Lily Yip of Metuchen, 
N.J., 21-14, 21-19. 
</P>
<P>
 Masaru Hashimoto of Pacoima lost twice in men's singles, once in doubles and 
three times in mixed doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 In men's volleyball, the East team lost for the first time in three matches as 
Cal State Northridge teammates Jon Baer and Peter Piexoto played sparingly 
against the North. Baer had nine kills and one block. Piexoto contributed three 
kills and three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Hughes of Moorpark had 12 kills for the North. Paul Severns of Glendale 
added eight kills and seven blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 In racquetball, Tony Jelso of Woodland Hills, Festival singles champion last 
year, teamed with Sudsy Monchik of Staten Island, N.Y., to easily dispatch 
Michael Bronfeld of Carmel Valley, Calif., and Bobby Rodriguez of Denver, 15-0, 
15-3.

TRACK & FIELD / JOHN ORTEGA; BECK COULD IMPROVE OVER TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marty Beck jokingly refers to himself as "a quarter-miler who didn't make the 
grade," but the former Glendale College standout is regarded as one of the 
nation's top young 400-meter intermediate hurdlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, 24, finished fifth in last month's USA Track & Field championships in 
Knoxville, Tenn., and will represent the United States in three international 
meets later this summer, including the USA-Africa meet at Duke University Aug. 
12-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the field in the national championships was weaker than in previous 
seasons -- due to the fact that there are no Olympic Games or World 
Championships to qualify for this year -- Beck viewed it as an opportunity for 
some of the nation's young hurdlers to grab the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 He was particularly pleased with his 49.53 clocking in a quarterfinal that 
lowered the personal best (49.59) he set as a UCLA senior in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very controlled, technically sound race," Beck said. "I wasn't 
running all-out so I was surprised with the time. I went into the race looking 
to run just fast enough to advance to the next round so I was really pumped up 
after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, who runs for Nike International L.A., hoped to lower his personal best 
in the final two days later, but timed 49.77 while running in Lane 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like making excuses for myself, but the lane I was in didn't help," 
Beck said. "Most of the top competition was on the inside of me and that made 
it hard for me to tell exactly where they were during the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Beck's disappointment at finishing out of the top three, his season is 
proceeding smoothly compared to last year, when he was eliminated in the 
semifinals of the USA Track & Field championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck attributes last year's troubles to an insufficient number of races. As a 
senior at UCLA, he ran a total of 28 400-meter races -- counting the 400, 
intermediate hurdles and legs on the 1,600 relay -- but that figure dropped to 
seven in 1993 as it became harder for him to get into invitational meets 
because he was running at the more-competitive club level. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he never got into a racing groove. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was coming off a great year in 1992 and I expected things to continue in 
1993, but they didn't," Beck said. "It was a tough transition from college." 
</P>
<P>
 With last year's experiences behind him, the 6-foot-3 1/2, 180-pound Beck is 
looking forward to breaking 49 seconds by season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the goal," he said. "(49 seconds) seems like a big barrier to me 
right now, but I think it's more psychological than physical. As soon as I get 
that first 48, I'll realize I can do it and probably start running under 49 all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia question: What local high school track coach placed third in the 
120-yard high hurdles and the 180-yard lows in the 1964 State high school 
championships? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the spotlight: Drue Powell, the 1993 State champion in the 110-meter 
high hurdles for Reseda High, got his first taste of working in the movie 
industry last spring and enjoyed it so much that he has put his track career on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell won the 110 highs for Glendale College in the Western State Conference 
championships in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a week later, he and long jumper Mike Wright were suspended for the 
remainder of the season for violating team rules, however, and he hasn't raced 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intended to run during the summer track season, but I got really involved 
with films," Powell said. "I'm really enjoying what I'm doing right now so I 
want to see where this will take me." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell became involved in movies in February when he was hired as an extra in 
a Mario Van Peebles film about the Black Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 During a break one day, Powell remarked that making movies seemed pretty easy 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
 An assistant director took exception to his statement, but instead of getting 
angry, asked Powell if he'd like to work as a production assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Powell accepted the offer and discovered that things weren't so 
simple, he became enthralled with working behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 The filming of "Black Panthers" ended recently, but Powell hopes to gain 
employment in other films and wants to enroll at UCLA in the spring to begin 
work toward his film degree. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Holding out: Danny Haag, who graduated from Granada Hills High last month, was 
among the region's top performers in three events this season, but doesn't 
expect to be a member of a college team next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he'll compete for one of the clubs in the Los Angeles area and hopes 
to improve enough to earn a scholarship to an NCAA Division I school for the 
1995-96 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
 Haag finished fourth in the long jump and seventh in the 110 high hurdles in 
the State championships last month, but the decathlon is his forte. 
</P>
<P>
 He totaled a personal best of 6,476 points in that event to win the young 
men's division of the USA Track & Field Junior Olympic Region 15 championships 
last month and figures to be shooting for the meet record of 6,768 points when 
he competes in the national championships July 26-27 at the University of 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State tendered Haag a partial scholarship for the upcoming school year, 
but he hopes to improve enough next season to warrant better offers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bad call: Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High, and not Mebrahtom Keflezighi of 
San Diego, should have been selected as the 1994 Gatorade Pacific Region and 
State boys' track and field athlete of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Keflezighi, who will run cross-country for UCLA in the fall, had a superb 
senior season, but Fischer's was better. 
</P>
<P>
 Keflezighi won state titles in the 1,600 and 3,200 meters, and led the yearly 
national list in the mile and 3,200 with times of 4 minutes 5.58 seconds and 
8:51.8. 
</P>
<P>
 However, his best time in the mile puts him in a tie for 27th on the all-time 
national high school performer list and his 3,200 best ranks 56th. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, who is headed to Wisconsin, won the state title in the high jump and 
was undefeated outdoors. His personal best of 7 feet 4 inches ties him for 
eighth on the all-time national list. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Reseda Coach Steve Caminiti ran 14.1 seconds in the 120 highs 
and 18.7 in the 180 lows for Crespi in the 1964 State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Caminiti, who was nicknamed the "Crespi Comet," is a co-holder of the region 
record in the high hurdles. His best of 13.7 in the 120-yard highs converts to 
a 13.6 clocking for 110 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton Boykin shares the region record with Caminiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Boykin won the 1987 City Section title for San Fernando with a fully-automatic 
time of 13.84, which converts to a hand time of 13.6.

NEWSWIRE: LOHR USES 11 BIRDIES TO SHOOT A 61 AND TAKE FIRST-ROUND LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Lohr, a 10-year PGA Tour veteran with just one victory, offset a 
three-putt bogey with 11 birdies as he posted a 61 in the opening round of the 
Anheuser-Busch Classic at Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 There have only been two scores better than Lohr's 10-under-par round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a great round," Lohr said. "I've never made 11 birdies in a round 
before."

 Lohr's score was one stroke lower than the previous best round of his career. 
He opened with a 10-under 62 on the way to winning the 1988 Walt Disney World 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'd even know how to pencil in a 61," said Nike Tour regular 
John Wilson, whose 64 put him in a second-place tie with PGA Tour rookie Glen 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The only tour scores better than the 61 were the 59s of Al Geiberger at 
Memphis in 1977 and Chip Beck at Las Vegas in 1991 and nine rounds of 60, the 
latest by Davis Love III at Hawaii in January.

THE SCENE: MODERN GOTHIC; CLOTHES, CLUBS CELEBRATE THEATER OF THE MACABRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's enough to send parents into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost overnight, their sweet, "normal" teens take to wearing only black. They 
pore over Ann Rice books and quote Edgar Allan Poe. Graveyards and gargoyles 
are revered and satin-lined coffins considered ideal furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 The minor-chord drone from their stereos sounds like a track from a Bela 
Lugosi flick. Even their chums look the part, with their zombie makeup and dyed 
black 'dos. 
</P>
<P>
 And it isn't even Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is this a part-time masquerade to those in this year-round scene. Call 
them Gothics or death rockers. Just don't call them weird.  
</P>
<P>
 These deadheads emerged as a horror sideshow from the punk movement back in 
the late '70s and early '80s. At the forefront was London's Batcave nightclub, 
which featured death rock bands, as well as a tight community of such bands in 
Los Angeles that played the local club circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The look was -- and still is -- a combination of punk and 18th- Century dandy 
for both sexes: hair teased out straight, plenty of black eyeliner, witchie-poo 
pointy shoes (preferably in patent leather and with loads of decorative 
buckles), shirts of ruffles and lace and mixtures of vinyl and velvet. 
</P>
<P>
 Render it a version of the Theater of the Absurd, with roots that go much 
deeper in time than the past two decades. Modern-day Gothics cull the more 
macabre and Romantic elements from the 14th through 16th centuries, known for 
Gothic art and architecture, and the 18th and 19th centuries, which include the 
Romantic period. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the bizarre historical and mythical tidbits that fascinate them: the 
corruption of the medieval Catholic Church, executioners, ghosts and vampires. 
Besides Poe, other icons are Lord Byron, the Marquis de Sade and Charles 
Baudelaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the undead who never really leave the planet, Gothics haven't really gone 
away -- they've only gone, uh, underground. You may have spotted one out in 
daylight: the widow wardrobe, pale face and Morticia makeup -- on both the boys 
and girls. Their numbers have been rising again over the last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Distinguishing the she's from the he's in this androgynous parade of groovy 
ghoulies is another matter. It's an issue that caused a rift between Sarah 
Bronkhurst, 15, of Anaheim Hills and her father.  
</P>
<P>
 "My dad says my friends are a bunch of freaks," said the Horizon High 
sophomore, biting her burgundy-stained lips. She dyed her blond hair to match 
her wardrobe when she got into Gothic three years ago via her mom's record 
collection, which included albums by such early '80s seminal acts as Bauhaus, 
Sisters of Mercy and Siouxsie and the Banshees.  
</P>
<P>
 All right, so most fathers would react alarmingly to a boy in an 
ankle-skimming skirt and eyeliner. Sarah finds such a guy "beautiful." Most 
Gothics take great care in their makeup and dress, she said: "You have to have 
artistic talent to do the makeup. Everyone is so graceful, they're a work of 
art." It also takes time. Sarah spends three hours getting ready for a night 
out.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the way preppies or hip-hoppers look," she said. "This is how I 
express myself. People who get shocked are close-minded. When I first got into 
this, people would say things and I would get upset and flip them off. Then I 
realized I was lowering myself to their level, so I decided to ignore them."  
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring Gothics or their interests might not be so easy for those unfamiliar 
or confused by the very different nature of this scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Gothics read about devils, but do not worship them. They are interested in the 
battle between the extremes of good and evil. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark side of human nature is both questioned and celebrated by Gothics, as 
is death. Gothics listen to songs about death as well as write (yes, most of 
them consider themselves bards) about it. The subject might be the undead in a 
cheesy B film or those in literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the interest in death, suicide is definitely not on the agenda, they 
say. Gothics say they find nothing glamorous or heroic about such an act. To 
them, death is celebrated as a natural part of the life cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the accouterments of death: hearses, coffins, skeletons, black. 
</P>
<P>
 But the use of these symbols, along with the church paraphernalia and images 
of hell, is for the most part a lot less threatening than it seems. Most 
Gothics enlist them for their shock value with little consideration for their 
greater meaning, the same way the original punk rockers used the swastika not 
for racist reasons but simply to annoy others. Names of bands also have shock 
value: Christian Death, Dead Can Dance and Alien Sex Fiend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although younger Gothics downplay any attempts on their part to shock, 
veterans still in the scene, like Terri Kennedy, 30, admit it's part of the 
territory.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most parents did crazy stuff when they were young," said Kennedy, who co-owns 
Ipso Facto in Fullerton, a popular source for Gothic regalia. "It's about 
experimenting and finding out about yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Whitney, a marriage, family and child counselor with Coastline 
Counseling in Newport Beach, agrees. She has worked with teens who were into 
Gothic. The costuming, the androgyny, Whitney said, "may help them develop an 
identity and move on in life. (That is) as long as there's no drugs, rituals or 
threats that could prove damaging. Their role acting is all a part of the 
theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney also said there's nothing wrong with the androgyny as long as they are 
not acting out sexually.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole culture is so reserved," she said. "In Europe, people touch each 
other much more in public. Women go arm in arm. Here we keep our space, we keep 
everything suppressed inside. These are very sensitive kids; they can be very 
creative. A little freedom can be very healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 If parents support their children, try to communicate with them and not push 
them away, there's a lot less chance of problems, Whitney said. "Dressing up is 
not the problem. The problem is the behavior. Parents need to support who their 
children are." 
</P>
<P>
 Ipso Facto's Kennedy considers the themes at play in the Gothic scene a part 
of the life experience. "It doesn't mean you'll become a druggie or an ax 
murderer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Try telling that to mom and dad, you say? Kennedy has. Over her five years in 
business, she has gotten calls from parents wanting to know more about why 
their kids have become so scary-looking. Many blame the music for making their 
children depressed or turning them away from the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kennedy: "If you're worried about their safety, drive them to a show. 
Talk to them. It's better to have a parent who cares. I hear too much about 
parents who don't." 
</P>
<P>
 For Sarah and her friend, Los Alamitos senior Jessica Etter, the stuff of this 
scene has proven a lot less heavy than outsiders might think. The dramatic 
attire and mysterious attitude are basically "pretty fun," said Jessica, 16, of 
Seal Beach, a professional ballet dancer who has been into theater her "whole 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always liked to overdress and look elegant," she said. "And you can do 
that here." Recently, she dyed her sister's old prom dress black for a night 
out to Helter Skelter, a Wednesday-night Gothic nightclub at the Probe in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Sarah usually club crawl dressed in gear tougher than velvet and lace, 
such as shiny vinyl outfits accessorized with plenty of metal and leather 
jewelry.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Jessica finds the Gothic club scene "almost magical," she agrees with 
others who consider much of it pretentious. Apparently, it has changed little 
in a decade. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people try to out-Goth each other," said Anaheim resident Brian 
Gregory Atkin, 16. Because of this, Brian refuses to be labeled Gothic. But his 
attire and interests belie his intention. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Mater Dei sophomore will enter the Orange County High School of the 
Arts in Los Alamitos in September as a junior to further cultivate his talent. 
Judges at his audition were wowed by his detailed ink drawings of Gothic 
cathedrals. He exhibited the series at Ipso Facto in January; another show is 
scheduled at the boutique in early October. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the Crystal Cathedral is in his neighborhood, Brian signs off the 
massive glass structure as a "New-Age mess" lacking the beauty of Gothic 
architecture, which he has never seen in person but has learned about from 
books.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am fascinated with good and evil, life and death," he said. "Cathedrals 
have all this with their angels and gargoyles and the scenes depicted in the 
stained-glass windows." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian resembles singer David Bowie's Thin White Duke persona, complete with 
extended Edwardian cuffs on his white shirt and glossy black enamel cuff links. 
His strawberry blond hair is slicked back, brows manicured and short 
fingernails filed to a point. Whereas Bowie's Ziggy Stardust influenced Gothic 
sounds most, it's his refined, brooding Duke that some guys prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 A local kid turned Brian on to the music in third grade, but it wasn't until 
seventh that he began dressing in dark clothes, he said. Too much partying the 
following year led his parents to blame the scene for his problems. Three years 
later, Brian said he is now sober and still into Gothic: 
</P>
<P>
 "There's Gothic people hooked on drugs and without a brain. But there's a lot 
of others who are very intelligent and spiritual." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian's parents have approached their son's continuing interests with a 
mixture of support and anxiety. Though they keep communication lines open, his 
father said he still worries that "he's not into the mainstream."  
</P>
<P>
 Blue velvet breeches and a vest, lace stockings and a blousy shirt are hardly 
the elements of the average ensemble for the prom. But it's what Brian chose 
when he accompanied a friend to her school's event. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of ignorant teen-agers and adults think that unless you look like them 
they can be rude to you," Brian said. "They feel a need to bash just to keep 
their own egos up. I keep myself open to all kinds of friends. I don't really 
care if someone wants to make rash judgments of me because I choose not to have 
friends who think narrow-mindedly." 
</P>
<P>
 His dad writes off his sartorial style as part of being artsy. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's more than that, Brian said: "I see what I do as being normal."

AROUND TOWN: HE THINKS THE WORLD OF HIS ANTIQUE GLOBES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 28, Jonathan Blackman is a man of the world. Or -- forgive us -- one might 
even say he thinks globally. Blackman deals in antique globes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a small space called Interiors, he sits amid globes large and small -- 
wooden globes, glass globes, even a sort of early motel globe lamp. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary jazz plays in the background as he explains how he veered off 
course on his way to law school after getting a degree in political science 
from Brandeis University. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, he suggests, he just had to stand out from the crowd: "There are plenty 
of lawyers." Maybe he always felt cheated that his New Jersey high school 
didn't offer geography. 
</P>
<P>
 Some would consider the latter a blessing, but Blackman likes geography. Old 
globes are rarely dated and he delights in using political geography to trace 
their age through shifting national borders and evolving country and city 
names. Istanbul, nee Constantinople. St. Petersburg-Petrograd-Leningrad-St. 
Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 The world changes faster than globe makers can make globes, but that doesn't 
worry Blackman, who is "not intrigued by anything new." The beauty and 
workmanship of the old globes are what hook him. As he points out, a new one is 
outdated almost before it's out of the crate. 
</P>
<P>
 After stints as a fund-raiser for Carnegie Hall and a sports marketer for 
ESPN, Blackman, an ex-New Yorker, started in the globe trade by renting stalls 
in L.A. antiques malls. When his first globes, bought at auction and at flea 
markets, were snapped up, he "knew there was a niche." 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, he moved into a space on Robertson Boulevard, where he has 
about 30 globes ranging in age from a 1960s classroom model on a blond wood 
base to a Dutch-made early 18th-Century wooden globe inscribed in medieval 
Latin. 
</P>
<P>
 That one might be considered prophetic. It depicts California as an island. 
When Blackman bought it, it had been made into a lamp. His asking price, 
unwired: $9,500. 
</P>
<P>
 As every globe has a cartouche, telling who made it and where, why don't they 
all have dates? Theories abound. Some say it's to force people to learn their 
history and geography. Or maybe, Blackman says, it's so "people wouldn't know 
when the globe was outdated." But what kind of planned obsolescence is that? 
</P>
<P>
 Blackman's treasures include an early 19th-Century celestial globe with images 
of the constellations in the night sky, illuminated glass globes of a type 
common through the 1950s and a pair of big steel school globes from the '20s or 
'30s. Their land masses are not identified; that was up to the students. 
</P>
<P>
 Most early globes were of wood, commonly overlaid with gesso and paper. 
Blackman almost winces at mention of today's plastic models with their faux 
wood bases. 
</P>
<P>
 In their new book, "Globes From the Western World," Elly Dekker and Peter van 
der Krogt tell us the earliest terrestrial globe in existence is in Nuremberg, 
Germany, where it was made in 1492. It has a big land gap; the Americas were 
not yet known to Europeans, although they soon would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutch globe makers were the elite until the Italians came along with ornate 
globes, some of which had caryatid-like figures holding up the earth. Most 
globes in American homes were British until Vermont farmer James Wilson started 
making globes in the early 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, globes were made for cardinals and kings and were out of reach for 
ordinary folk. Today, they are a chic decorative item -- "especially in 
California," Blackman observes. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this just a designer variation on books-by-the-yard, or. . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, he suggests, perhaps people use them to plan their travels. Or maybe 
they're hooked on "Jeopardy!" Gourmet Spam Cooks Reveal Artistic Flair 
</P>
<P>
 Sing along, now: 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, give me that Spam in the blue, yellow can 
</P>
<P>
 "That is loved by all in the land." 
</P>
<P>
 Got the spirit? Then come with us to the annual Spam cook-off in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a blazing sun, the crowd is singing the praises of Spam as the eight 
contestants chop, slice and dice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm calling this Spam Aloha," says Al Chang, a financial planner from Atwater 
Village and a formidable competitor, a two-time winner of this annual 
fund-raiser for the Hawaiian Community Center Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Chunks of Spam sizzle in a pan with sesame oil and oyster sauce. When they 
have browned nicely, he arranges them atop a mound of stir-fried shrimp and 
broccoli blanketed in cream of mushroom soup and sprinkled with cashews. 
</P>
<P>
 An old family recipe, perhaps? Chang grins. "I just thought of it last night." 
Truth be told, he confides, he never touches the stuff: "They say Spam's bad 
for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Donald Kealoha, a Torrance clothing store owner, is creating Spam Hash 
from Lite Spam, tofu, bamboo shoots and mushrooms. "Everybody from the islands 
grew up with Spam," says Kealoha, who was born in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently. Cook-off judge Greg Longstreet, a Hormel Foods rep from Orange 
County, confirms that the company sells more Spam, its "flagship" product, in 
Hawaii than in any other state. Over there, where the cost of living's high, 
folks call it "Hawaiian steak." 
</P>
<P>
 The dishes are brought out for judging. Longstreet and the other judges nibble 
at each with the concentration of Julia Child at the table of Alice Waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Artfully laid out before them are Spam egg rolls, Spam in won-ton wrappers, a 
Spam mousse, Spam baked in tiny biscuits and "Spotatoes" -- spuds stuffed with 
spiced Spam. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Bunda, visiting from Oahu, is something of a ringer. After all, he's a 
cook at an island resort. His entry, a sort of Spam nouveau, is a painting. 
Spears of Spam perch gracefully atop a pyramid of vegetables and green Japanese 
noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges disappear and the crowd surges forward, eagerly downing every 
morsel on every platter. But why the long delay before the winners are crowned? 
"The people from Price Waterhouse are working on it," suggests one wag. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the suspense ends. First prize and $100 in the hors d'oeuvre division 
goes to Chris Naluai of Carson, who also gets an A+ for presentation. She 
speared a fresh pineapple with her deep-fried Spam balls and topped it with a 
radish mouse. (Someone stole the mouse.) 
</P>
<P>
 In main dishes, Al Chang is victorious once again, with Spam Aloha.

 David Letterman, on an article indicating that in the early 1980s, Rush 
Limbaugh was so poor that he actually had to choose between paying his rent and 
buying groceries: "What do you think? Which one did he choose?"

 The main character in the Disney film "The Lion King" is a young cub trying to 
capture the political power that once belonged to his father. Says comedy 
writer Mel Golob: "He's sort of a jungle version of Kathleen Brown." 
</P>

 Comedy writer Bob Mills says the voluptuous police officer who appears nude in 
this month's Playboy has been called on the carpet by New York's chief of 
police: "She was not reprimanded, mind you, just called on the carpet." 
</P>
<P>
 Mills also reports that the Supreme Court has upheld a ban on a separate 
school district for Hasidic Jews: "The vote was six 'oys' to three 'veys.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on the announcement by a major oil company that it

<P>
 For a while, he held his own, such as answering "So we can breathe," after I 
asked "Why is there air?"

 Babies in shades? That's right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids need sunglasses, especially infants and young children, because their 
eyes have not developed enough to protect them from ultraviolet rays," says Dr. 
Stuart Dankner, a Baltimore ophthalmologist and chairman of public information 
for the American Assn. for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus. UV rays can 
penetrate the retina and possibly damage the macula lutea, the area that is 
responsible for the most acute central vision, Dankner says. In addition, 
recent research is beginning to show that ultraviolet rays may cause cataracts 
in the long term if people don't get proper protection when they're young. 
Parents should choose sunglasses that are labeled 100% UV protection, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Baby Optics in St. George, Utah, has recently introduced its Weebok children's 
sunglasses line, under license from Reebok International. There are four sizes: 
newborn, baby, tots and kids, in a variety of colors and styles. All are 
constructed with almost unbreakable polycarbonate gradient lenses. Each pair 
comes with a one-year guarantee. The glasses offer 100% UV protection and are 
the best children's sunglasses he has seen, says Dankner, who is recommending 
them in his clinic.  
</P>
<P>
 Weeboks retail for $15 to $25 and are carried nationwide by selected baby 
shops and eye-care specialists. They're also available through Right Start 
(800) 548-8531 or Sensational Beginnings (800) 444-2147 catalogues. Or call 
(800) 962-6872 for an outlet in your area. E/T Bike Gets Around: 
</P>
<P>
 Bicyclists interested in roughing it on wheels should check out the E/T Bike 
introduced by Big Bear Lake's Dan Hanebrink, a longtime mountain-bike builder 
who holds the California downhill racing title for his age group. Hanebrink's 
new E/T (Extreme Terrain) bicycle is designed to be ridden over sand or snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanebrink, 54, says the E/T can handle any type of terrain -- ice, snow, sandy 
washes or rocky stream beds that would stop a standard mountain bike. 
</P>
<P>
 The E/T Bike has big tires, the same concept as an all-terrain vehicle, and 
fits riders from 5 feet, 4 inches to 6 feet, 4 inches. The finished bike weighs

</P>
<P>
 Spray a little of the new Clean & Feed on house plants and watch the dust on 
the leaves disappear. You don't even have to wipe them. 
</P>
<P>
 What you can't see is the plant absorbing the spray's fertilizer through its 
leaves. But if you spray on the formula lightly once a week, you'll observe 
positive results -- a greener, fuller plant -- in a month to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Clean & Feed, oil-free so it doesn't clog the pores of the leaves, is 100% 
organic and biodegradable. It was developed by Botanical Science, a 
manufacturer of plant-care products in Santa Ana. "Through leaf absorption, the 
fertilizer is absorbed in one to two hours," says Botanical Science President 
Marcel Ford. "Fertilizing in the dirt can take days to get it from the roots to 
the leaves." 
</P>
<P>
 Clean & Feed is available in a 16-ounce size ($4.75 plus $2.75 for shipping 
and handling) or 32-ounce size ($6.25 plus $3 for shipping and handling). 
Commercial sizes -- one or five gallons -- also are available. Contact 
Botanical Science, 3421 Fordham Ave., Santa Ana, Calif. 92704; (800) 889-7771.

MY TURN: OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; REAL TEST OF EDUCATION IS TO COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE HONG, Gene Hong is a junior at Canyon High School in Anaheim, where 
this article first appeared in the student newspaper, the Smoke Signals. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Are we being tested to death? Starting from elementary school with the CTBS 
and CAP test and continuing through high school with the SAT, ACT, ASVAB, ACH, 
AP, PSAT, finals, etc., we are poked and prodded by various tests to the point 
where some students become so exasperated that they stop trying their hardest. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are we being tested so much? Well, it's the only way colleges and 
universities can determine who the "best" students are. The tests show how 
smart we are. By smart I do not mean intelligent or creative. I mean 
knowledgeable. While some tests do gauge reasoning ability and creativity, most 
test only acquired knowledge. Therefore, the tests become forums for the 
demonstration of memorization skills only, and those who can memorize better, 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Einstein is remembered as one of the greatest thinkers of our time, not 
one of the great memorizers. He once said: "Imagination is more important than 
knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We are not tested for imagination. Indeed, we are not even encouraged to 
cultivate it. What we are encouraged to become is "testing robots." We are fed 
information; we retain that information for a short while, and then we 
regurgitate it. Is this what learning is? 
</P>
<P>
 However, we cannot place all the blame on the education system. Much of the 
blame lies on our own shoulders. Too often, we spend the free time we have 
while not numbing our brains with information by numbing our brains in front of 
the television. 
</P>
<P>
 We sometimes use the excuse that we're too tired of studying to think. Are we 
ever too tired of thinking to study? No. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the purpose of education is to give us the desire to think, so that we 
will then pursue knowledge as a firm foundation, a jumping-off point, from 
which our brains can venture. But if this is true, many of us don't realize it. 
We refuse to think or study. 
</P>
<P>
 So, are we being tested to death? No, we are not. Are we being tested too 
much? Maybe, but we are complaining for the wrong reasons. It's not the number 
of tests we should be concerned with, but the limited side of intelligence that 
they portray. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of griping, wouldn't it be better for us to comply for now, to 
dutifully study and to allow ourselves to be tested so that we can go to 
college and attain a position in society where we can reform education?  
</P>
<P>
 Or is the risk of not being financially rewarded for the sake of future 
generations too high? 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, for many of us it is. Too many bright minds are spoiled by this system, 
and too many bright minds are wasted in not being used to reform it.

INK: PUBLISHERS CATCH ON TO SPANISH-LANGUAGE TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Paul D. Colford is a columnist for 
Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laura Esquivel's "Like Water for Chocolate" has been such an extraordinary 
success that the novel's year on the bestseller lists and 850,000 copies in 
print have overshadowed the comparatively modest response to the original 
Spanish-language edition. However, when a publisher starts out with 11,500 
copies of any title, and then has to increase the total sixfold, the book 
industry notices. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubleday reports that the Spanish hardcover "Como Agua Para Chocolate" grew 
to 72,000 copies in print and has been followed by a new, mass-market paperback 
edition from Anchor Books.  
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the beguiling story of food and love in Mexico is commonly cited 
in publishing circles as the trailblazer that has led a few other major houses 
to bring out mainstream titles in Spanish editions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Delacorte Press this month will release 1.1 million copies of Danielle 
Steel's new novel, "The Gift," while Dell, a sister company, publishes 30,000 
copies of the same book in a $9.95 Spanish-language trade paperback edition. 
Publication of "El Regalo," a small-town tale of the 1950s, will be supported 
by advertisements in Spanish-language newspapers. Until now, Steel's 
Spanish-reading fans have had to wait for import copies of her novels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what my expectations are, and a lot of our key accounts don't 
know what their expectations are either," says Carole Baron, president and 
publisher of Dell / Delacorte. "But there should be a way for us to reach 
Spanish readers, and I'm willing to experiment and spend some money." 
</P>
<P>
 * In an unusual development, Penguin USA has announced it will introduce the 
next novel of Colombian Nobel Prize winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez to an 
American audience in Spanish. An $8.95 trade paperback edition of "Del Amor y 
Otros Demonios," a love story set in 18th-Century Colombia, is scheduled for 
release in August -- months before Alfred A. Knopf will publish "Of Lovers and 
Other Demons" in an English-language hardcover. 
</P>
<P>
 * In October, Vintage Books, the distinguished trade-paperback division of the 
Random House Inc. empire, plans simultaneous English and Spanish reissues of 
Esmeralda Santiago's "When I Was a Puerto Rican" ("Cuando Era Puertorriquena"), 
a coming-of-age memoir that goes from the island countryside to New York 
streets to the halls of Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also in October, Vintage will publish Sandra Cisneros' "La Casa en Mango 
Street," previously published as "The House on Mango Street," and Manuel Puig's 
"El Beso de la Mujer Arana" ("The Kiss of the Spider Woman"). 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, something is happening here," says Jonathan Wells, who runs Circulo 
de Lectores (Circle of Readers), a Spanish-language book club in Manhattan. 
"There's a trend on the part of big publishers to do something to address the 
huge Spanish market. 'Like Water for Chocolate' gave publishers a kick in the 
pants." 
</P>
<P>
 An increase in the number of chain stores willing to stock Spanish titles has 
been another incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Wells, who says his mail-order club serves about 20,000 
members in the United States and Puerto Rico, questions why most of the Spanish 
editions being published domestically are produced not in hardback, but in the 
larger-size, trade-paperback format that routinely sells for less than $10. "It 
represents a peculiar point of view, I think, that the market is poor and the 
prices should be kept as cheap as possible," he says. He argues that, "except 
in the case of pulp romances, the readers want a nice hardcover, or a trade 
paperback with French flaps on the cover, for which they're willing to pay $13 
or so." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells says he has yet to turn a profit in five years of operation -- partly 
because of the high cost of importing Spanish translations from Argentina, 
Spain and other countries.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the publication of more Spanish books out of New York should help 
reduce his expenses, the relative infancy of the Spanish-language program at 
the major publishing houses can be seen in one marketing glitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells learned not from Penguin, but from this reporter that the publisher was 
about to release the new Garcia Marquez novel in Spanish. "They are?" he said. 
"Gee, I'd take 5,000 copies." 
</P>
<P>
 An order that big suggests that the Spanish-reading audience might be larger 
than New York publishers realize. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterwords: In what is both a publishing curiosity and certain grist for Rush 
Limbaugh, a collection of poems written by former President Jimmy Carter will 
be published in January by Times Books. "Always a Reckoning" will be Carter's 
ninth book and will follow in the dormant tradition of presidential verse from 
Abraham Lincoln and John Quincy Adams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The autobiography of Elisabeth Maxwell, widow of publishing mogul Robert 
Maxwell, will be published in November by his rival, Rupert Murdoch, via the 
latter's HarperCollins. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Mind of My Own" may not be pretty. Elisabeth Maxwell "speaks of the 
ever-increasing oppression she suffered at her husband's hands," the publishing 
house says. In a mysterious incident three years ago, Maxwell was found dead in 
waters off the Canary Islands, where he had been yachting.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; A SLIPPERY TOPIC IS EXPLORED SHAPELESSLY; A NATURAL 
HISTORY OF LOVE BY DIANE ACKERMAN ; RANDOM HOUSE $23, 350 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Love is the great intangible." So begins "A Natural History of Love," and for 
good reason; love is an extremely slippery topic, one certain to resist all 
attempts at categorization or itemization. It is also, however, a reliable 
crowd-pleaser, meaning that Diane Ackerman's follow-up to 1990's best-selling 
"A Natural History of the Senses" will likely be a staple on beaches around the 
country this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 And as it turns out, that's probably the best way to read "A Natural History 
of Love," for it is surprisingly shapeless, a miscellany of vignettes and 
essays that vary between the arresting and the superficial, the illuminating 
and the irksome. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading the book, you spend half your time wishing it were better, and the 
other half captivated by those passages in which Ackerman, a poet and staff 
writer for the New Yorker, has found a particularly good lens through which to 
view her subject. "A Natural History of Love" is divided into six parts, the 
weakest of which is the first, once-over-lightly chronology of love. The 
biggest problem with this section is that it should be a book unto itself; it's 
impossible to do justice to 2,000 years of history -- Ackerman begins with 
ancient Egypt and ends in modern times -- in a hundred pages. 
</P>
<P>
 She over-generalizes madly as a result, and although she can be quite 
interesting when pausing to give detailed discussions of famous lovers such as 
Cleopatra, Ovid and Abelard, her prose can be informal to the point of 
flippancy. She calls the Dionysian maenads "punks," says Orpheus' music gave 
them "the willies"; and characterizes Abelard as a "hunk." It's difficult to 
read such descriptions without wondering the degree to which Ackerman has bent 
and selected history to suit her storytelling needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's next section is much better, for here Ackerman analyzes specific 
texts -- the ideas about love found in the work of Plato, Stendhal, Proust and 
Freud, as well as in the legend of Tristan and Isolde. This is straightforward, 
congenial literary criticism, and if it hardly summarizes the field, Ackerman 
at least stakes out the general perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next two sections -- subtitled "The Nature of Love" and "The Erotics of 
Love," respectively -- we're back on familiar ground, Ackerman producing the 
sort of comfortable nature writing familiar to New Yorker readers. She tells of 
anthropologist Colin Turnbull's sojourn with Uganda's Ik tribe, so 
poverty-stricken that members lost the ability to love; the body chemicals 
oxytocin, phenylethylamine and the endorphins, which create, intensify or 
sustain love; natural selection that favors the cute and comely; the sexual 
nature of human hair; and two perennial favorites -- the attraction horses hold 
for women, on the one hand, and the attraction cars hold for men, on the other. 
These 30 pages on hair, horses and cars are among the book's best, probably 
because Ackerman addresses them at length. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time persistent, we-never-skip readers have finished "Kissing," six 
pages repeated from "A Natural History of the Senses," they will have completed 
three-quarters of the new book and read something like 70 bite-size capsules 
only occasionally linked by meaningful argument. The moment might seem right 
for Ackerman to begin to wrap things up, to pull her themes and schemes 
together, but no: The last two sections of the book are a disorienting 
hodgepodge, Ackerman tossing together essays on topics she apparently hadn't 
been able to get to earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 She covers courtship, marriage, altruism, crimes of passion, love of pets, and 
analyst-patient transference, often engagingly but in bewilderingly different 
ways. Case in point: her account of a mission with Interplast, a medical 
organization that performs reconstructive surgery on Third World children born 
with congenital disabilities. The piece is wonderfully moving, full of life and 
heart -- but it's a magazine article and completely out of place here, even as 
an example of altruistic love. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad "A Natural History of Love" ends as it does, leaving the 
impression of a writer recycling material, virtually unchanged, into book form. 
That's acceptable in a collection of previously published essays, but one 
expects more from a volume such as this -- a consistent tone, a flowing 
narrative, a sense of a writer with a certain amount of perspective on, and 
control of, her material. 
</P>
<P>
 Word for word, "A Natural History of Love" is a pleasure, but it's a box of 
sweets rather than a convivial, satisfying meal. Ackerman can be a beguiling, 
even seductive writer, but most people who complete the book, I suspect, will 
conclude that the author and her readers should be just good friends.

SANTA ANA MAN CONFESSES TO SLAYING OF WIFE, IN-LAW; VIOLENCE: HE TELLS POLICE 
HE BECAME ENRAGED BY JEALOUSY. BUT VICTIMS' RELATIVES ARE CONVINCED THAT HE 
PLANNED TO KILL.

<P>
 A Santa Ana man confessed to investigators that he fatally stabbed his 
estranged wife and her mother Wednesday and then set fire to a lawn mower 
inside their house, because he was enraged that a man had been giving his wife 
a ride to work, investigators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuan Ngoc Le, 32, had spent the July 4 weekend trying to rescue a marriage 
racked by violence when he learned about her car-pooler and went to her home to 
confront her, police and relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He admitted to the incident," Sgt. Randy Benicky said. "It was a domestic 
violence thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Loi Thanh Phan, 30, and her mother, Sao Thi Nguyen, 69, were found stabbed to 
death in the home they shared with relatives.  
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor who ran to the house when he saw smoke coming from the windows 
about 9 a.m. discovered the bodies and a flaming lawn mower in the living room, 
he said. He also saw Le washing his hands and a knife in the kitchen, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Le surrendered to deputies when they arrived.  
</P>
<P>
 He later told them that over the weekend he and his wife had discussed 
conditions for a reconciliation, including his getting a job, Benicky said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Le told detectives he became angry Tuesday night when he learned that she 
had been accepting a ride from a man rather than taking the bus to her job at 
an Anaheim electronics firm, Benicky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phan reportedly ignored him when he confronted her at the home Wednesday. Le 
told police that he picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed her, then jabbed at 
his mother-in-law in self-defense when she jumped on his back, Benicky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators recovered a knife with a six- to seven-inch serrated blade on 
the floor near the kitchen sink. 
</P>
<P>
 But relatives disputed Le's contention that he had killed his wife out of 
jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it's jealousy, and we don't think he had a fit of insanity," 
said Phan's brother, Tam Phan, 39. "We think he's been planning this. It makes 
me so mad every time I think of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Le was aware that the man giving Phan a ride to work was a relative, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Phan's niece said she had seen Le walking to the house on her way to 
school at about 7 a.m., Phan and other relatives said they believe he had 
waited outside the house for the adults to leave for work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told my daughter that he was just coming to get some paperwork because he 
had a new job," said Tinh Dinh, who is married to another brother. "He knew our 
comings and goings because he had lived here, visited here so often. Then he 
must have done it as soon as he saw me leave to take my father to the eye 
doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives said Thursday that Le had beaten Phan when they lived in Ho Chi Minh 
City in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very hotheaded and wouldn't listen to our pleas to stop hitting her," 
Tam Phan said. "She was very timid and wouldn't think of hitting back." 
</P>
<P>
 But relatives saw a different portrait over the July 4 weekend. The couple 
took their 4-year-old daughter and the rest of the extended family to the beach 
at Corona del Mar and then to see the fireworks show at Mile Square Regional 
Park in Fountain Valley. Le had accepted $200 from Phan to help pay his rent, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a couple, they acted very well in front of us. Everything seemed fine 
between them this weekend," Tam Phan said. "We figured that he couldn't harm 
her anymore. . . . How were we to know that he hated her so much, he hated our 
family so much to do this to us?" 
</P>
<P>
 Loi Phan was the ninth of 10 siblings, most of whom had already emigrated to 
the United States from Ho Chi Minh City by the time she arrived with Le in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of her death, she and her daughter were living at the Hearth Lane 
home with her elderly parents, two brothers and their families, and oldest 
sister Lien Thi Phan, who has been unable to hear or speak since childhood. 
Lien Phan, 46, suffered smoke inhalation and burns on her feet in the fire 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Loi Phan was working for Copper Clad Multilayer Products, an Anaheim 
electronics firm, and Tam Phan speculated that Le's pride was hurt when his 
wife found a job before he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Le "had a good job" in Ho Chi Minh City, Tam Phan said. "He was used to her 
being dependent on him. Maybe he didn't like her freedom here." 
</P>
<P>
 Tam Phan said his sister had never suffered more than bruises from Le's 
beatings but had been threatened with worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me that he said, 'When I get to America, I'll buy a gun and I'll 
shoot you,' " Tam Phan said. "But we didn't take him seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 When family members returned to the house Wednesday, they found empty patches 
where carpets had been, black spots on floors and walls, blood stains on Phan's 
bed and a cracked mirror closet door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at all of us living here because we can't afford separate houses, and 
just think of how many people would be out of a place to live if he had burned 
the whole house down just because he wanted to get back at us," Tam Phan said. 
"And he took two lives. He's an animal, not a person." 
</P>
<P>
 Le is scheduled to be arraigned today in Municipal Court in Fullerton.

FREE MEALS FOR O.C. CHILDREN GO WANTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.R. DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As many as 100,000 needy Orange County children eligible for free, federally 
funded lunches are not taking advantage of the program this summer, a situation 
officials are trying to correct by stepping up publicity and signing on more 
agencies to distribute the meals. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said Thursday that they hope to 
improve last year's performance, when fewer than 8% of the eligible county 
children received free meals, but acknowledged that progress will be measured 
in small gains. Statistics for this year's program, which began in late June, 
are not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've been hearing so far this summer is that participation has gone up 
slightly," said Dick Montoya, a spokesman for the Agriculture Department's Food 
and Nutrition Service Division. "But there are still a lot of children that 
aren't being served." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, just 9,316 children in Orange County received hot meals each day 
under the Summer Food Service Program, although more than 122,733 were needy, 
according to officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Poor 
participation has been a problem not only in Orange County, but also throughout 
the country, where just 16% of children entitled to free meals receive them. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's advocates and federal officials blame the low numbers on a shortage 
of local agencies willing to sponsor the program and poor publicity for the 
program in the past. However, Agriculture Department officials say stepped-up 
outreach efforts have helped to get the word out and attract sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County for instance, there were no sponsors for the program three 
years ago, Agriculture Department officials said. This year, there are 15 
sponsoring agencies. "Three years ago, I couldn't crack Orange County," said 
Cleophus Davis, regional program manager for the Summer Food Service Program. 
"But now the program is definitely growing." 
</P>
<P>
 A major reason is that the Orange County Community Development Council (CDC) 
has received two grants totaling $25,000 a year to pay for an outreach staff 
person to promote the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Jewell, the CDC's summer food program outreach coordinator, said more 
than 70 sites in Orange County currently offer free lunches that range from 
pizza to chicken and include milk and fruit. Some also offer breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 The meals, similar to free and reduced-price lunches offered in schools during 
the rest of the year, may be the most nutritious food some children eat all 
day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewell said there is no doubt that children who do not take advantage of the 
meals program are suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm told by principals that children returning from school vacations often 
have visible weight loss, come back tired and are disinterested and lethargic 
from not having anything to eat," Jewell said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Summer Food Service Program serves about 2 million low-income children 
nationwide. Begun in 1968, the program did not become readily available in 
Orange County until 1991, USDA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lunch sites are run by local agencies such as schools, churches and parks 
and recreation facilities, which are reimbursed by the Agriculture Department 
based upon the numbers of meals that they provide. The average reimbursement 
runs about $2.25 per meal.

RARE BACTERIA INFECTS LEG OF TRIATHLETE, 35 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 35-year-old Santa Barbara triathlete stricken with a rare and virulent 
streptococcus infection -- which has become notorious as the "flesh-eating" 
bacteria -- was better Thursday afternoon, but remained in critical condition 
at the Sherman Oaks Hospital burn center. 
</P>
<P>
 The infection -- the same type that set off alarming news reports when a 
cluster of seven cases was reported in Gloucestershire, England, this spring -- 
apparently entered the man's system through a shaving cut on his leg during a 
bicycle ride Sunday afternoon and spread rapidly, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Donner, a Santa Barbara lifeguard and a popular swim camp counselor has 
already lost half the muscle tissue in his left leg to the infection known as 
"necrotizing fasciitis", physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
 But doctors are hopeful they have stopped the infection from spreading to 
Donner's abdomen, which almost certainly would be fatal, said Dr. A. Richard 
Grossman, the burn center's medical director, who is attending Donner. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner spent most of Thursday in the hospital's pressurized hyperbaric 
chamber, which forces more oxygen into the blood, in the battle against the 
necrotizing fasciitis, a deadly strain of a common and ordinarily much weaker 
germ, Group A streptococcus. Sherman Oaks is one of the few hospitals with such 
a chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Necrotizing fasciitis bacteria thrive in "an anaerobic environment," places 
where there is little oxygen, Grossman said. "They love dark, dank places." 
</P>
<P>
 Donner was taken by helicopter to the burn center Wednesday night, after 
initially being treated by doctors at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner will undergo surgery today to remove dead tissue from his ravaged leg. 
Doctors will close the wound, which extends from Donner's groin to his ankle, 
with skin from a cadaver, Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will begin to graft that wound with his own skin" on Monday, Grossman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner is lucky to be in excellent physical condition, Grossman added. 
Triathletes compete in arduous, and often long, swimming, bicycling and running 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 When Group A strep invades the softer tissue of the abdomen, Grossman said, it 
"literally ends up eating a hole in the belly from the inside out."  
</P>
<P>
 In Donner's case, "Fortunately, it stopped at his pelvis," Grossman said. "If 
we can get through the next four days, pumping him full of antibiotics, plasma, 
and getting him through the next two operations, he might be out of the woods." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Donner is also lucky his mother is a retired nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 When he became sick with nausea and vomiting Sunday night, she insisted over 
his objections on rushing him to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. He was 
admitted there about 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the toxic strep infection, Donner was also suffering from toxic shock 
caused by a staphylococcus bacteria and his condition rapidly worsened, 
Grossman said, until by 1:30 a.m., "his blood pressure was 70 over nothing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Group A infections cause nothing more than strep throat, but over the 
last five years, scientists have tracked the spotty re-emergence of a highly 
virulent strain that had been dormant for a half century or more and was nearly 
nonexistent in the late 1970s and early 1980s. British health officials say the 
lethal organisms have caused more than a dozen deaths in their country this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabloid newspapers have had a field day with "the flesh-eating bacteria" -- a 
catchy phrase that is technically inaccurate but catapulted Group A strep from 
scientific curiosity to headline disease. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. statistics are incomplete. Only 22 states require doctors to report Group 
A strep infections to health officials, although the recent furor has caused an 
upsurge in reporting. In fact, Group A was blamed for the death four years ago 
of Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in 1990, 
the last year for which it gathered figures, there were 10,000 to 15,000 severe 
cases of Group A strep in the United States, resulting in 2,000 to 3,000 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, 500 to 1,500 included necrotizing fasciitis, so called because it 
causes the death of the fascia, the tissue that binds skin to muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the incidence of the infection is up from the early 1980s, the 
numbers are minuscule compared to the many thousands of routine strep throat 
infections reported each year. The organism is so common it has been called "an 
occupational disease of schoolchildren." Experts estimate that 10% to 15% of 
all pupils are infected at any given time.  
</P>
<P>
 Grossman said Donner apparently acquired the airborne toxic strain of the 
infection through a small cut he received while shaving his legs -- a common 
practice among competitive bicyclists and triathletes -- before going out for a 
35-mile ride Sunday near Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman said he did not know the exact route Donner took on that ride, but 
said he could have picked up the bacteria "just riding along Pacific Coast 
Highway." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Donner underwent five hours of surgery to remove dead tissue 
from the infection site, his left leg from thigh to ankle. Samples of that 
tissue revealed that he had raging infections from both the Group A strep and 
staph bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner has been a well-liked summer staff member of the Santa Barbara Parks 
and Recreation Department for the past five years, said Joan Russell, the 
department's recreation programs manager.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's great stuff and we're concerned about him," she said. "He works very 
well with kids and he's very responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell said that during the rest of the year Donner, a trained private 
investigator, works for his father, who is also an investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner is a Santa Barbara native, she said. His wife, Laura, is a fellow 
swimmer he met two years ago, when both worked as counselors at a summer swim 
camp sponsored by the parks department, Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Donner's wife and his sister have remained by his side, staying in an 
nearby apartment owned by Sherman Oaks Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner's family, through a Sherman Oaks Hospital spokesman, declined to be 
interviewed.

O.C. PARA-SAILING FIRM ORDERED TO PAY DAMAGES TO CLIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury has ordered a para-sailing company to pay $100,000 to a 
25-year-old man who said his back was permanently injured in a 1991 accident 
off Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict ended a weeklong trial stemming from a personal injury lawsuit 
filed by Christopher Kiernan, a car salesman from San Juan Capistrano, against 
Capistrano Beach Parasailing Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The mishap occurred Sept. 7, 1991, when Kiernan was on his first para-sailing 
outing. Kiernan had been coasting about 200 feet above the ocean when the boat 
towing him abruptly slowed, causing him to free-fall into the water, according 
to his lawyer, Steven Zwick. 
</P>
<P>
 While submerged, Kiernan alleged, he was dragged more than 50 feet by the 
boat, causing permanent nerve damage to his back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Superior Court jury deliberated about 2 1/2 hours before 
ruling late Wednesday that the driver of the boat, owned and operated by 
Capistrano Beach Parasailing, acted in a reckless manner and caused Kiernan's 
injury, Zwick said. The jury awarded $100,000 to Kiernan for medical expenses 
and pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the damages were low, but we're happy with it," said Zwick, who 
initially sought about $325,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Andrew H. Do, who represented the company during the trial, could not 
be reached for comment Thursday. The company had denied acting with any 
recklessness and maintained that Kiernan injured his back in another way.

MIKE PENNER: WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; A WHOLE LOT OF NIL GOING ON 
</P>

<P>
 Four big football games on tap this weekend. The Orangemen are at the Cotton 
Bowl. The Vikings are in San Francisco. Two of the game's longest standing 
rivals meet in Foxboro. And Giants Stadium plays host to a classic tussle from 
the Black And Blue Division. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you haven't received your latest issue of Pro Futbol Weekly, expect to 
see four low-scoring games, dominated by strong running attacks, defense, 
tackling and ball-control. 
</P>
<P>
 And look for the kickers to decide it in the end, each and every time.. . . 
BRAZIL-NETHERLANDS 
</P>
<P>
 Site: The Cotton Bowl 
</P>
<P>
 Line: Brazil by 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches: Brazil has Carlos Alberto Parreira, the Netherlands has Dick 
Advocaat. At the moment, Parreira has very few advocaats -- not after millions 
of testy Brazilians watched their boys tie Sweden and go scoreless for 73 
minutes against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brazil has the ball: Brazilian journalists will be yammering into their 
cellular phones, lambasting Parreira for benching Rai, for starting only one 
goalkeeper, for using 11 men instead of 10 (it worked so well against the 
Americans, no?), for getting Leonardo suspended and for not playing Pele. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Netherlands has the ball: The Netherlands' two best players, Marco 
Van Basten (out, sprained ankle) and Ruud Gullit (out, sprained ego) will be 
nowhere near it. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: The Netherlands routed Brazil, 2-0, in the semifinal round of the 
1974 World Cup. This has absolutely nothing to do with players competing 20 
years later, but serious soccer journalists will insist that the carry-over 
effect is tremendous. Major edge in momentum to the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Chance for international incident: Greatly diminished since a) that 
Netherlands beat writer who joked about carrying a bomb aboard the Dutch team 
plane has been taken into custody and reprimanded, meaning no more plane 
evacuations and five-hour flight delays; and b) the Dutch are not playing the 
Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: 1-0. ITALY-SPAIN 
</P>
<P>
 Site: Foxboro Stadium 
</P>
<P>
 Line: Italy by 5/8 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches: Javier Clemente for Spain and Arrigo Sacchi for Italy. Unless Italy 
is trailing at halftime. Then it would be Javier Clemente for Spain, Arrigo 
Sacchi's top assistant for Italy and Arrigo Sacchi on the first flight out of 
Logan to Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
 When Italy has the ball: Thousands of headlines for the next day's Il 
Manifesto and Il Giorno will be written and rewritten. Baggio dribbles across 
midfield. Headline: "Viva Azzuri! " Baggio loses ball. " Woe Is Italia !" 
Baggio tackles Spaniard, regains possession. " Joy Is Ours !" Baggio slips on a 
hot dog wrapper. " Italia's Darkest Hour! " Baggio gets up, wipes himself off, 
heads ball toward Spanish net. " Comeback Of The Century! " Spanish goalie 
makes save. " Tears Of Despair Bathe Our Streets! " 
</P>
<P>
 When Spain has the ball: Fifty-eight million Italians hold their breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Spain is undefeated in games in which it scores a goal and the 
opposition does not. 
</P>
<P>
 Chance for international incident: Very good. It has been 500 years and these 
countries are still arguing about who gets credit for Columbus discovering 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: 1-0. ROMANIA-SWEDEN 
</P>
<P>
 Site: Stanford Stadium 
</P>
<P>
 Line: Romania by 0.425 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches: Anghel Iordanescu and Tommy Svensson. Let's see, who coaches where. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 When Romania has the ball: Play-by-play commentary to pop aspirin to. 
"Petrescu to Lupescu . . . over to Popescu . . . crossing pass to Dumitrescu . 
. . who waves at Iordanescu . . . back to Petrescu . . . who runs into Popescu 
. . . I escu, wasthatamiscue?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Sweden has the ball: Watch out Tomas Brolin, Sweden's preeminent 
"withdrawn striker." Which is saying something, considering Sweden leads the 
world in withdrawn strikers. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Swedes are undefeated since midfielder Klas Ingesson plowed his car 
into a moose in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Chance for international incident: Virtually nil. This rivalry's been nowhere 
since Borg and Nastase retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: 1-0. BULGARIA-GERMANY 
</P>
<P>
 Site: Giants Stadium 
</P>
<P>
 Line: Germany by 0.5667 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches: Dimitar Penev for Bulgaria, Berti Vogts for Germany. Penev coaches 
traditional European football -- pack the defense in, counterattack when 
possible, build around the goalkeeper. Vogts coaches traditional American 
football -- blitz the guy with the ball, sack him, pound him, whack him in the 
head, knock his teeth loose . . . and advance to the quarterfinals because the 
referee isn't looking. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bulgaria has the ball: It had better duck and cover, especially when it 
traipses inside the German penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 When Germany has the ball: German fans begin to yawn. What they want to see 
are Bulgarians eating grass, Bulgarians wrapped around the goalpost, Bulgarians 
getting carted off the field. Action, Berti, action! 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Germany is winless in the last two world wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Chance for international incident: Downgraded, if the reports from FIFA are to 
be believed. According to FIFA, the referee for the Bulgaria-Germany game will 
be permitted to wear a whistle, and blow it, unlike the referee for the 
Belgium-Germany game. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: 1-0 (in penalty kicks).

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; PUTTING GAMES ON LINE; PENALTY KICKS BETTER 
THAN COIN FLIPS, BUT BARELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jorge Campos was a fallen figure in a sea of grass Tuesday evening at Giants 
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. His face was down, against the turf. His arms 
were flung out, legs bent at the knees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican goalkeeper was a heap of vivid color in the middle of a giant 
stadium where moments earlier everything had gone so wrong for his teammates in 
a heart-stopping, second-round loss to Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 What could be done? Mexico was eliminated from the World Cup in the most 
disheartening of manners. After 120 minutes had produced a 1-1 tie, Bulgaria 
won on penalty kicks, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 It is perhaps the cruelest way to settle a game since FIFA, soccer's governing 
body, did it with coin flips. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least this way, everybody has a chance," said Joseph Blatter, FIFA general 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its adoption in 1970, the round of penalty kicks has been debated and 
dissected, cursed by losers, praised by winners. Penalty kicks have made 
careers, and if not exactly ruined others, certainly left scars. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have come to terms with penalty kicks; others reject the very idea. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA is expected to adopt sudden death for the 30-minute overtime period 
before the 1998 World Cup in France. But if neither teams scores, it will fall 
back on the round of penalty kicks to determine the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not seem right to determine the game that way," said 
</P>
<P>
 Wim Jonk, a Dutch midfielder, who could be called upon to do just that in 
Saturday's quarterfinal game against Brazil at the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Alberto Parreira, Brazil's coach, disagreed. He said penalty kicks are 
the best method of doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no other way," he said. "If the players can't decide it after 120 
minutes, FIFA has to drop one team. It's the only solution." 
</P>
<P>
 For spectators, it is always high drama. Five kicks for each team, taken 
alternately, from 12 yards out against the goalkeepers. If that doesn't settle 
the matter, they go to sudden-death penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 A coin toss still is needed to determine which team kicks first. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer fans still talk about how Argentina reached the 1990 final by defeating 
Yugoslavia in the quarterfinals and Italy in the semifinals on penalty kicks. 
What they mostly recall is the brilliance of backup goalkeeper Sergio 
Goycochea, who saved kicks in each game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some goalkeepers have better intuition than others," said Goycochea, who 
built his career on those games. "I don't think saving penalties is just a 
matter of luck." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the entire process has been turned into a science. Like pitchers in 
baseball, goalkeepers keep detailed statistics of opponents' shooting 
tendencies. In the brief moment before the ball comes flying at them, keepers 
must guess where it is going. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos guessed right against the Bulgarians four times, but blocked only 
Krasimir Balakov's shot. Bulgarian keeper Borislav Mihaylov did not bother 
guessing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just look at the foot of the player who's going to kick and try to move in 
that direction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Timo Liekoski, U.S. assistant coach, said the Americans wrote a detailed book 
on Brazil before their second-round game Monday in Palo Alto. The United States 
lost in regulation time, 1-0, and did not need it. 
</P>
<P>
 But coaches try to learn as much as they can about opponents to prepare their 
keepers for the penalty-kick possibility. They also emphasize penalty shots 
once the World Cup becomes a single-elimination tournament, after the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania's players spent almost an hour practicing penalty kicks Thursday in 
the Bay Area. Brazil, practicing in stifling heat in North Dallas, did not. But 
Parreira has his own method of determining who is ready to take the pressure 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We select the best shooters, those who are emotionally ready," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches often make last-minute substitutions before the overtime ends to get a 
strong penalty kicker in the lineup. Only those on the field at the finish of 
overtime are eligible to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's coach, Miguel Mejia Baron, was questioned for leaving Hugo Sanchez, 
36, on the bench at that critical moment. Most coaches say they want their most 
experienced players taking the penalty shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first shot is crucial," Liekoski said. "I would not save my best kicker 
to the fifth because a lot of times it doesn't get to the fifth guy, so you 
waste him. You also need a good kicker to go third." 
</P>
<P>
 Most agree that when the match comes down to penalty kicks, it becomes a game 
of nerves. Mexico seemed to lose its poise when it was most needed, missing its 
first three shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. coaches look for the players who want to take the shot in the 
make-or-break situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really a learned skill," Liekoski said. "If you're afraid of it, 
it's not going to work for you." 
</P>
<P>
 By putting players in simulated situations, coaches try to determine which 
ones have steely wills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who always picks his spot and doesn't change his mind," Liekoski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blatter said that from the moment FIFA adopted the penalty kick, proposals 
have been made for changes. Most have been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "This solution is so far the best, unless something revolutionary comes 
along," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply letting the match continue until one team scores could put fatigued 
players at risk of serious injury, some point out. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who endured the coin toss, the penalty kick seems like a nice 
option. Jan Van Beveren, a great Dutch goalkeeper of the 1970s, did not even 
want to think about the coin toss. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a stamp dealer in Dallas, Van Beveren first encountered penalty kicks as a 
player in the North American Soccer League. He had joined the team midway 
through the season and was not aware of the NASL shootout until his team made 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first playoff match, the game went into the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the sideline, and asked the coach, 'What is this all about?' " Van 
Beveren recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Beveren said the only way to be a successful keeper is to have a feeling 
for where the kick is going. Like other keepers, he enjoyed the intense 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the keeper, everything is on your shoulders but the pressure is not on 
you," he said. "I've never seen a keeper get blamed for letting in a goal. The 
one who misses the kicks is the goat." 
</P>
<P>
 But that is not comforting to a goalkeeper who plays for the losing side. 
Campos, the flamboyant Mexican keeper, played admirably in the tense moments of 
Tuesday's match. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was little consolation as he lay on the grass, considering what might 
have been. Bulgarians were running across the field, celebrating their victory. 
</P>
<P>
 When Campos finally stood, star forward Hristo Stoitchkov of Bulgaria put an 
arm around him, and they walked off the field together. 
</P>
<P>
 One a winner, the other a loser.

RAVELING WEIGHING OFFER TO TAKE JOB AT SETON HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 USC basketball Coach George Raveling has been offered the vacant coaching 
position at Seton Hall, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, who has two years remaining on his contract with USC, met with Seton 
Hall Athletic Director Larry Keating on Wednesday to discuss the opening, then 
met with USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett on Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Seton Hall sources, Raveling, who has coached at USC for eight 
seasons, is seriously considering the position. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked Thursday at UC Irvine, where he has been coaching the U.S. national 
team in preparation for the Goodwill Games this month in Russia, Raveling 
declined to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is inappropriate for me to get involved in a public dialogue about the 
situation at this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett was unavailable for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two weeks, Seton Hall, located in East Orange, N.J., has been 
conducting a nationwide search for a replacement for P.J. Carlesimo, who left 
to become coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.  
</P>
<P>
 The only other coach contacted by Seton Hall is Florida State's Pat Kennedy, 
who turned down the position late last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking to hit a home run and we need to do it quickly," Keating said 
of his search. "We are looking for a proven coach, who's a proven recruiter, 
and because of our location, has proven to be able to deal with the media." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, 57, has a 336-292 record in 22 years as a college head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed that Raveling, who reportedly made $200,000 last season, has 
been offered a contract worth more than Carlesimo's. That contract paid 
Carlesimo $400,000 for the 1993-94 season. 
</P>
<P>
 With three scrimmages scheduled for the U.S. national team over the weekend 
and the team leaving for Russia next Friday, Raveling is expected to make his 
decision early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, who has led three schools -- USC, Iowa and Washington State -- to 
the NCAA tournament, has a 115-118 record with the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 He has coached the Trojans to four consecutive postseason tournament berths 
but is coming off a 16-12 season in which USC finished seventh in the Pacific 
10 Conference and lost in the first round of the National Invitation Tournament 
to Fresno State.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; FOR ITALY, IT'S IN THE BAGGIO; STAR FORWARD 
SAVED THE DAY AGAINST NIGERIA, AND TOURNAMENT MIGHT NOT BE THE SAME AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clemens Westerhof, the affable Dutchman who coaches Nigeria's national soccer 
team, will catch the rest of the World Cup in Florida on vacation with his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The proximate cause of Westerhof's overnight transformation from coach to 
tourist was plain when he left Foxboro Stadium the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We allowed Baggio free for five meters, and that was the problem," Westerhof 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes indeed. After a lackluster three, almost four, World Cup games in which he 
seemed more burden than burner, Italy's Roberto Baggio suddenly ignited at 
Foxboro. He zapped a bold, ambitious, but fatally inexperienced Nigeria with an 
89th-minute equalizer, and added a penalty shot in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The goals ended a prolonged national team drought by the slender Juventus 
striker who was Europe's 1993 player of the year. Baggio had played more than 
800 punchless minutes for Italy since scoring against Estonia last Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 By virtue of two narrow victories in which it scored three goals with only 10 
players on the field, a skilled but can't-finish Italian team has staggered 
into the quarterfinals. If, at this belated juncture, Baggio is truly back, the 
Cup tide could flow Azzurri blue. Saturday's game against Spain in Foxboro 
should tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baggio is like (Brazilian forward) Romario," said Raffaele Ranucci of the 
Italian Soccer Federation. "He might even sleep for the whole game, when 
suddenly he finds a happy spark which lights up the whole team. You'll see, now 
that he's unblocked. He can carry us toward a goal which, until the equalizer 
against Nigeria, seemed closed forever." 
</P>
<P>
 As all of Italy's 57 million soccer 
</P>
<P>
 experts know, Coach Arrigo Sacchi built the Italian team around the 
introspective, 
</P>
<P>
 pony-tailed convert to Buddhism whom everybody calls "Roby." Il Manifesto, 
which speaks for the extreme political left in Italy, hailed victory over 
Nigeria with a wry banner headline: "Forza Buddha!" 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt he's our best man, who can solve every match," Sacchi said in Italy 
as he assembled Baggio and a supporting cast of 21 after having tried more than 
70 high-caliber aspirants. 
</P>
<P>
 What is manifest after four inglorious Cup matches is that when Baggio 
slumbers, Italy struggles. There have been flashes from Daniele Massaro, but 
little to cheer about from fellow strikers Pierluigi Casiraghi and Giuseppe 
Signori. Like the rest of the team, they seem contaminated by Baggio's dour 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I have scored I feel much better," said Baggio, who, at 27, has many 
notches on his shoes. He has scored 109 times in 219 Italian League games with 
Fiorentina and Juventus and now has 21 goals for the national team. Riots broke 
out in Florence in 1990 when Fiorentina sold the 5-foot-6, 155-pound Baggio to 
Juventus for a record $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, this was supposed to be Baggio's Cup. But -- like the Italy 
he rescued -- he showed little until last-minute heroics against Nigeria that 
must rank among the most dramatic moments of World Cup '94. 
</P>
<P>
 A reporter asked Baggio if Italy, down 1-0 against Nigeria with time ebbing, 
was mentally already on the plane going home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say that I was on the runway and that I pulled them off," he replied 
softly. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking stronger defense and to rest his star's aching Achilles' tendon, 
Sacchi pulled Baggio out of the game against Norway when Italy's goalie was 
ejected and the team was forced to play a man short. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio said later he understood why he had been taken out, but he left the 
field in fury apparent to all. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wouldn't have happened to Maradona," he told Italian reporters later. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy lurched to its sole goal against Norway with Baggio on the bench. 
Commentators said Sacchi had been right to pull him, that he was physically and 
mentally exhausted from the rigors of Italian League and postseason play. It 
might be better to bench him once and for all, some analysts suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 There was worse to come. Another poor showing in a dispiriting tie with Mexico 
left Italy a by-the-fingernails third-place qualifier in a group it had been 
favored to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiat's Gianni Agnelli, owner of Juventus, was quoted by Italian newspapers as 
saying that when Baggio came off the field after the Mexico game, "He looked 
like a wet rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexico was great suffering," Baggio said later. "I've never been able to 
express what I have inside me, and it's terrible,"  
</P>
<P>
 Against Nigeria, Baggio seemed disoriented. His passes went awry. Combinations 
never developed. Zealous, run-all-day defenders stripped him of the ball. 
Baggio was limping, running as little as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the press box, reporters for the Rome newspaper Il Tempo, grading players 
on a nominal scale of 10, had given Baggio a humiliating 4.5 and were ready to 
go home. Then lightning struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sacchi had the courage to leave him in the game and he was repaid," said Il 
Tempo. Baggio's final, rewritten grade: a not-bad 6.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Antonio Matarrese, president of the Italian Soccer Federation: "We 
finally found Roberto Baggio when we wanted him. He is a force who will come 
forward as we advance." 
</P>
<P>
 After the goal, a fresh, loose Baggio blossomed. He forced the penalty in 
overtime with a pinpoint pass, and he took the the penalty shot with the calm 
of a master tailor taking a stitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite cramps, I was quite calm and sure of my shot," Baggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 He might have been the only one, as it bounced in off the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigerian goalie Peter Rufai didn't try to outguess the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect Baggio a lot," Rufai said. "You don't give him any kind of chance. 
I waited until he made his move. He's a very crafty guy."  
</P>
<P>
 And a very different kind of hero -- shy, thoughtful, more whisperer than 
shouter. He was more consumed by the arrival in the United States of his wife, 
his 4-year-old daughter and his mother than he was by the disparagement heaped 
on him and his team by Italian nonbelievers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is more important than any game," Baggio said before the Nigeria game. 
"I want to win and advance in the Cup. But I haven't lost the dimension of what 
is around me." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he dedicated his goals to Juventus teammate Andrea Fortunato, a 
22-year-old defender who has leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio heads into Saturday's game with newfound confidence that could spell 
finis for Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite all the problems, we are still going ahead," he said. "We are 
beginning to believe that we can do well."

MIKE DOWNEY: IN-COURT CASUALNESS DISTURBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more reasons than one, the People vs. O.J. Simpson is the damnedest trial 
I have ever seen. Excuse me, preliminary hearing. There is an informality to 
these proceedings that I find positively repugnant, a casual quality the likes 
of which might normally be reserved for traffic court. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the laid-back murder investigation of the century. Witnesses 
called to give sworn testimony in a capital crime have taken the stand without 
suit coats, in sportswear with open collars, or, in one case, even a T-shirt. 
Principals are being referred to as O.J., rather than as Mr. Simpson, or as 
Kato, even though there is not merely a human being involved in this case who 
answers to this name, but also a dog. 
</P>
<P>
 California is a casual state. We should stamp this on our license plates -- 
"The Casual State." The few restaurants that require neckties usually require 
them of the employees, not the patrons. We order pizza by our first names, not 
our surnames. But these, these are hallowed halls of law; these are people 
detailing a gruesome crime. 
</P>
<P>
 What a laid-back courtroom it has become. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian (Kato) Kaelin, caretaker of the Simpson estate and companion of both 
defendant and one of the victims, having been rebuked under direct examination 
for mumbling "Mmm-hmmm," was instructed soberly by the prosecuting attorney 
that the stenographer had no such button. Kaelin flippantly interjected, "Maybe 
she should get one." 
</P>
<P>
 Then commenced a discussion of Jacuzzi jets that had not been properly turned 
off and of trips to a McDonald's in a Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only in Southern California," guffawed Tom Brokaw on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes; funny stuff, athlete and broadcaster O.J. Simpson listening to 
testimony as to whether he murdered the mother of his children. Maybe we could 
all be a little more glib. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Kaelin mentioned a basketball game that had been on television 
and was promptly asked which game that was. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houston and the Knicks!" he said animatedly, whereupon ripples of laughter 
cascaded through the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 A female acquaintance of Kaelin's grinned in seeming embarrassment when asked 
if she ever had been a guest of his overnight. She, too, practically laughed 
aloud at each reproof from the prosecution for answering unintelligibly, 
"Mmm-hmmm." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarcasm oozed. A detective, asked whether in his opinion a "live-in maid" 
represented someone who occupied the premises 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week, responded, "I don't know, sir. I've never had a maid." 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney and another witness got into an exchange over whether the 
bloodstain allegedly found on Simpson's vehicle could have been "dried taco 
sauce." There were more twitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, even Simpson himself failed to suppress a smile over the matter of 
literal hair-splitting, when both sides argued over how many follicle samples 
could be taken to a lab. I am sure that he was struck with the absurdity of it 
all, guilty or innocent. What he must have been thinking during Kaelin's 
testimony about the spa and the hamburgers, I cannot begin to guess. 
</P>
<P>
 I do know that the grim nature of these hearings should be making everyone 
cringe and quiver. At times, though, this lurid story seems to spin into 
"Anatomy of a Murder," with Jimmy Stewart bringing into the courtroom a puppy 
that leaps into George C. Scott's lap, causing whoops of laughter until the 
judge restores order. Perhaps others welcome these occasional comic respites in 
a real-life murder case. Myself, I find them appalling. 
</P>
<P>
 And, I'm afraid, uniquely Californian. 
</P>
<P>
 It is useless trying to modify the behavior of insensitive creatures outside 
the courthouse who peddle T-shirts inspired by someone's death, or 
self-promoting New York radio screwballs permitted to wear such rags on 
national television appearances, for nothing we say would ever seep through 
such thick skulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the courtroom, however, we should be demanding sobriety and dignity, 
yet this is the same town where the Brothers Menendez observed a trial for 
their very lives dressed as though having come straight from their sailboats. 
</P>
<P>
 My personal contemplation of this case is single-minded. If O.J. Simpson is 
innocent, what I would expect is to hear him stand up and say, "The person who 
killed Nicole is still out there!" and beseech police to get busy, because 
somebody sure as hell killed Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, this is a legal struggle in which individuals must do what they must do. 
The man from whom we wish to hear most remains mute. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, meantime, jabber away, devoid of common decency, unable even to keep a 
straight face. 
</P>
<P>
 I can scarcely fault TV anchorman Brokaw for ad-libbing that Ira Reiner, the 
former district attorney for Los Angeles County, had been urging him to 
recognize the "only in Southern California" quirks of this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people are dead, and in court they're talking taco sauce.

STRAWBERRY TAKES A GIANT STEP IN RETURN; BASEBALL: FORMER DODGER GOES HITLESS 
IN THREE AT-BATS BUT IS EMBRACED BY FANS WHO ONCE DERIDED HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTY NOBLE, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He recalled Candlestick Park as the arena he liked least during his time with 
the New York Mets. The wind. The bleary eyes he often took into day games that 
followed night games. The wind. The old chain-link fence in right. The wind. 
The cold. The wind. And the singsong "D-a-r-r-y-l" chant that eventually would 
follow him to other ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
 He heard it first in Boston in 1986. He considered it a tribute of sorts then, 
acknowledgment that he was the baddest man on the baddest team. But when the 
cold fans of Candlestick pestered him in May, 1988, it unsettled him. "They 
were mean," Darryl Strawberry said Thursday. "They were on me big and mean." 
</P>
<P>
 The same stadium sang a sweeter serenade to Strawberry on Thursday. No longer 
a member of the New York Mets that everyone everywhere once hated, no longer a 
member of the Dodgers everyone in San Francisco still hates, he was welcomed as 
if he already had done something to lift their dismal baseball team. Applauded, 
cheered, embraced and even appreciated for an out. "I guess they've been turned 
around," Strawberry said, "just like me, just like my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Darryl U-turn. What is this, the sixth? The 10th? The two-hundred 
forty-third? The calendar says he is 32. His swing, still lightning fast and 
supercharged, says 26. His mind isn't certain what to say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baseball Register says he is in his 12th season in the big leagues. Our 
memories say he's turned around more times that Nancy Kerrigan in a spin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," Strawberry said, anticipating skepticism. "And this is just another 
one. Right? I know. I know people are saying it won't work. I don't blame them. 
I'm trying to be honest with them, and I'm trying to be honest with myself. . . 
. This one better work." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, so good. Depending on perspective, Strawberry's latest about-face 
either is in its fourth month or its second day. He prefers the former view 
because he says he became honest with himself in April when he asked the 
Dodgers to help him after nine years of substance abuse. The latter view sees 
him only as player. "I'm more than that," he said after his first day back in 
the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans recognized him, not by the No. 17 he wore -- for Keith Hernandez, he 
said -- but by his physique and the power he demonstrated in batting practice. 
"Still awesome Straw-some," Lenny Dykstra said from the trainer's table even 
though he saw none of the three upper-deck jobs Strawberry launched. 
</P>
<P>
 They cheered Strawberry in batting practice. They stood and heralded his first 
walk to the plate, tolerated his two ground-ball outs and cherished the fly 
ball he hit into home run territory in nearly dead center field in the sixth 
inning. Disabled Dykstra never would have caught it; too short. Milt Thompson 
had to leap to deny Strawberry. "Only warning-track power, I guess," Strawberry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And they booed the intentional walk in the eighth inning. "Familiar sound," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was his final baseball of the day. He was removed from what became the 
Giants' 5-4 victory for a pinch- runner. More cheers. But no hits. "Is it fair 
to say you were hitless, but not hopeless?" was the question posed afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hitless but not hopeless," he said. "Yeah. . . . I like that. Not hopeless as 
a person." 
</P>
<P>
 For a player who often began his seasons with home runs, it was a modest first 
day. "It was apparent," Phillie starting pitcher Shawn Boskie said, "he wanted 
to have a big-impact game." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams' two-run homer, his 31st, highlighted a three-run sixth inning 
for the Giants, who broke a three-game losing streak and handed the Phillies 
their fifth loss in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry recalled other new beginnings at Shea Stadium and his first day as 
the hometown hero in Los Angeles in 1991. "It's better to be honest than to be 
home," he said, acknowledging that taking his career to Los Angeles was a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's taken it to the team playing in what Giant owner Peter Magowan termed 
"a very tolerant market." Magowan hoped not to pressure his newest employee but 
expressed hope Strawberry could do for the '94 Giants what Fred McGriff did for 
the '93 Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry senses his skills are undiminished by time, back surgery, the 
intake of bad stuff and a lot of late nights. Boskie marveled at the bat speed 
as once-skeptical scouts had in March in Florida. Dusty Baker, Strawberry's 
longtime friend and new manager, said he couldn't believe Strawberry was so 
finely tuned after only three games in triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry even made a pretty running catch in right field.

 St. Louis Cardinal second baseman Geronimo Pena, Montreal Expo pitcher Mel 
Rojas and San Francisco Giant coach Bob Brenly were each suspended and fined 
undisclosed amounts by National League President Len Coleman for incidents last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenly was suspended for 14 games, effective immediately, for charging the 
mound from the bullpen in a July 2 bench-clearing incident that started when 
Rojas hit Barry Bonds with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas was suspended for four games, also effective immediately.

<P>
 Pena received a five-game suspension, effective July 14 after the All-Star 
break, for charging the mound and provoking a bench-clearing incident in a June 
30 game against Colorado.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; WHAT DID HE SAY?; THEY MAY NOT SPEAK SAME 
LANGUAGE, BUT REFEREES CAN STILL PICK UP ON PLAYERS' INTENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sandor Puhl, who is Hungarian, has been assigned to referee Saturday's World 
Cup quarterfinal game between Italy and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 According to his official biography, he speaks Hungarian and German. 
</P>
<P>
 So if an Italian player calls him a goat or a Spanish player demeans his 
heritage, Puhl probably will not understand the exact terminology. 
</P>
<P>
 But he doesn't have to be fluent in Italian or Spanish to get the gist of a 
player's remarks, pull out his notebook and issue a yellow card for dissent or 
ungentlemanly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Torres Cadena of Colombia speaks Spanish, English and Portuguese. It's 
unlikely that he would know a Bulgarian vulgarity if he heard one, or that he 
would blush at a string of German curses if they were said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 He will referee Sunday's quarterfinal game between Bulgaria and Germany, and, 
like Puhl, he need not be able to chat with players to decide that one has 
questioned his authority and deserves a caution. 
</P>
<P>
 But how do referees know players are cursing them if they don't speak the 
languages of the teams whose games they are officiating? 
</P>
<P>
 "Good question," said David Will, chairman of the FIFA referees' committee. 
</P>
<P>
 And the answer is that they often don't know. Not precisely, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "FIFA doesn't give you a dictionary," said Roy Gatewood, who has officiated at 
every level in the United States and was a FIFA referee liaison for World Cup 
games played in Orlando, Fla. "You don't have time for one of those Sharp 
(pocket) translators. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a lot of instances, it's as much connotation and circumstance as what's 
actually said. It's not so much cursing as the way a player is going at the ref 
or at another player." 
</P>
<P>
 In the World Cup tournament, assignments are made based on the official's 
performances, not on the languages he speaks. His compatibility with his 
linesmen might be considered, but his fluency in the languages spoken by the 
competitors is not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even referees who speak an array of languages rarely are assigned to games in 
which they can use those skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Mikkelsen of Denmark, who speaks Danish, English, German and French; 
Mario van der Ende of the Netherlands, fluent in Dutch, English, French and 
German, and Manuel Diaz Vega of Spain, who can converse in Spanish, Portuguese, 
Italian and English, are the most versatile linguists on FIFA's tournament 
referee list. Yet even though they might be able to work as United Nations 
translators, they would need help to talk to players in most of the games they 
have officiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikkelsen worked a first-round game between Spain and South Korea. No Danish 
there. Van der Ende refereed Italy-Ireland -- he might have understood the 
Irish players, but not the Italians. Diaz Vega was assigned the Netherlands' 
opener against Saudi Arabia. If FIFA had wanted someone who could speak to the 
Saudis, it could have sent Jamal Al-Sharif of Syria, who speaks Arabic and 
English. But Al-Sharif was busy refereeing Colombia's game against Romania. His 
second-round assignment was Mexico-Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Puhl's other games included Brazil-Sweden and Norway-Mexico. No Hungarian 
spoken there. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA won't allow its referees and linesmen to talk with reporters during the 
tournament. However, Will, whose committee assigns the officials, and officials 
who have worked in top-level competition say a language barrier is not a 
problem. Boorish behavior and what Will called "visible protestation" are 
obvious no matter the language, and the rules that deal with those cases are 
equally clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bob Heilmann of Tampa, Fla., a FIFA-certified linesman who worked 
qualifying games leading up to this World Cup, "We have a handbook to help us, 
but it's not help in terms of learning what the F-word is in Spanish. It's 
survival skills, medical tips, how to say, 'Where is the bathroom?' not how to 
say, 'Go to hell!' 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure I've been cursed in other languages. Many times I've done games 
involving Greek teams, players with Greek backgrounds. They may be saying 
things about me I don't understand. My attitude is, 'Is he coming at me and is 
it dissentful and disrespectful?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Will: "The referee has to judge by the player's action and tone. It 
really comes down to dissent of the decision, if a player visibly protests in 
dissent of a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Will, who never refereed but has spent 20 years on national and international 
referees' committees, also believes referees can give players leeway when 
emotions are running high. 
</P>
<P>
 "The laws give the referee discretion," Will said. "He can shake his finger 
and say, 'That's enough of that,' or give a yellow card if he wants to make it 
formal. If (the dissent) continues, he has the right to order a player off, but 
only in an extreme case, such as if he pushes or jostles the referee." 
</P>
<P>
 To Gatewood, the key word is discretion.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the high school and college ranks, if (a player's dissent) is audible, 
it's a yellow card," he said. "In some of those games that are on TV, you can 
read the player's lips. In a larger stadium, you might be more tolerant because 
you can't hear what he's saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, it's not what a player says, but what he does. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's Stefan Effenberg displayed his middle finger to the crowd after he 
was taken out of a game against South Korea, but Coach Berti Vogts sent him 
home before FIFA could take action. Romania sent striker Ion Vladoiu home for 
committing a vicious foul against Switzerland's Stephane Chapuisat and for 
arguing with an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, general secretary of FIFA, said the organization would 
have suspended Effenberg had the gesture been reported and praised the two 
countries' actions as in keeping with the spirit of fair play. 
</P>
<P>
 Said FIFA press secretary Guido Tognoni: "We believe behavior on the field is 
improving. . . . If you look on the (field) you see many nice gestures between 
the players. This is what we like and not what we have seen too much of in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
 But he hasn't seen every game and every gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a spectator at the Morocco-Netherlands game," Heilmann said. "The 
referee was Peruvian (Alberto Tejada Noriega). Moroccans speak whatever they 
speak, the Dutch speak whatever they speak. So he probably didn't understand 
what they might have said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced some of (the seven cautions Noriega issued) were for hand 
gestures . . . a 'give me a break' kind of gesture, which is interpreted as 
ungentlemanly." 
</P>
<P>
 Heilmann learned the hard way that it's important to pay close attention to 
gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the good fortune of teaching a year in Boston and I was coaching 
hockey," he said. "There were a lot of Italian kids on the team. I made a 
physical gesture that I thought nothing of, but the boys were aghast. I didn't 
know it, but it meant something else entirely to them. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The middle finger is universal. An arm swing and slap across the biceps is 
too. Otherwise, we can pick it up and we deal with it accordingly.  
</P>
<P>
 "The great thing about soccer is it's universal. You don't need a common 
language."

YOUNG CYCLISTS FACING UPHILL BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ryan Lane is relatively new to competitive cycling. You can tell because he 
smirked and rolled his eyes after a race Thursday when a photographer asked 
whether he had time to take a picture or if he would rather "hydrate" first. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means get, you know, get something to drink," Lane said, somewhat 
apologetically. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane, from Camarillo, and Felipe Sattler, from North Hollywood, were among a 
field of 60 young riders in the Olympic Festival time trial, contested over a 
20-kilometer course along the Mississippi River. Lane, 16-year-old sophomore at 
Camarillo High, finished 38th in 28 minutes 42.31 seconds. Sattler, a 
16-year-old freshman at Grant High, came in next to last in 30:45.34. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the best finishes -- winner Brent Aucutt of Clovis, N.M., clocked 25:56.48 
-- but for two newcomers to the national scene, Lane and Sattler accomplished a 
lot by qualifying for the time trial and a 60-kilometer road race to be held 
today at Babler State Park, near Eureka, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 "They worked very hard and beat a lot of riders who have been racing two or 
three years," said Danny Van Haute, a former Olympian who is coach of the team 
from the Southwest region which Lane and Sattler both represent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have exceptional potential, that's why they're here." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to Sattler, Lane is a crusty veteran who has been riding for about 20 
months. Sattler didn't start racing until late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither rider said he was in top form physically for the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane, who downed a typical cyclist's pick-me-up of a banana and 
carbohydrate-enhanced drink before competing, complained of a stomachache. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably too many meals of pasta in the days leading up to the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been loading up on carbs all week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sattler, who, despite his high-energy diet appears frail at 5-foot-9, 103 
pounds, was battling tonsillitis. Back home, he had been under a doctor's care, 
but Van Haute said Sattler left his prescription behind when he left for the 
competition for fear of a positive drug test. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lecture on banned substances," Van Haute said. "He was afraid if he 
brought his medication with him, it would be on the (prohibited) list." 
</P>
<P>
 Sattler didn't have much time to consider his options. Originally, he was 
listed as an alternate on the Olympic Festival roster. Event organizers finally 
extended him an invitation on Monday during a 5 a.m. telephone call to his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid has a ton of heart," Van Haute said. "He was willing to come here at 
the last minute, even with tonsillitis, and give it his best shot. And he 
wasn't even going to mention he was sick until he decided to tell his coach 
what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 To a cyclist, the time-trial distance, roughly 12 1/2 miles, is comparable to 
that of a 400-meter footrace -- a prolonged sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just put your head down and go," Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both athletes entered the race as relative unknowns. To wit: 
</P>
<P>
 While the race announcer gave often long-winded biographies about some of the 
cyclists as they departed in one-minute intervals, he appeared stumped by a 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sattler rolled up to the start line, the best the announcer could offer 
was: "This is F. Sattler. This is his first time in this race . . . apparently. 
Good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting roughly five minutes later, Lane fared only slightly better with his 
introduction. Race fans were told that he was a former club soccer player who 
"enjoys surfing and skiing." Nothing about cycling, but at least the crowd knew 
his first name. 
</P>
<P>
 Racers in the time trial faced a head wind on the back leg of the competition, 
plus temperatures of 90 degrees and a matching dose of humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind made it hard coming back," Sattler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Lane: "It's too muggy and hot. I'm used to 70-degree weather and an 
ocean breeze." 
</P>
<P>
 Lane and Sattler might be spoiled by the California weather, but they 
routinely face adverse conditions indigenous to the area. Namely, California 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sattler, especially, lives in the congested East Valley, where he must 
navigate six miles on perilous city streets just to get to Griffith Park, where 
he trains six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls one man suddenly honking his car horn and vociferously ordering him 
to get off the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Sattler, who said he was well out of the man's way, kept riding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he stopped his car in the middle of the road, got out and waited for me 
to come to him," Sattler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man menacingly aimed a beer bottle as the cyclist approached, but, much to 
Sattler's relief, he never launched it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept on going," Sattler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane, who lives in a comparatively rural area, has his own horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drivers just don't like cyclists," he said. "They think we take up too much 
of the road." 
</P>
<P>
 While Sattler uses the varied terrain around Griffith Park to alternate 
working on flatland and hills, Lane traverses back roads around Ventura County 
beaches and the Santa Monica mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Both cyclists cover anywhere from 250 to 400 miles per week during training 
and estimate they each spend about $5,000 per year for equipment and travel 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to take this as far as I can go," Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
 A top-10 finish today would be a good start.

OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; SPRINTER BROWN, 33, IS STILL SEARCHING FOR GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alice Brown doesn't have to explain why she is here. But she does. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's running credentials are impeccable, even if they haven't brought her 
fame outside the track and field community. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Olympic Games, she won gold medals in both 1984 and 1988 as part of the 
400-meter relay team. She also won a silver medal in the 100 meters in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was 10 years ago, the recent gold was six, and people today have the 
audacity to ask what she is doing at the Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Some athletes would roll their eyes at such a question. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, she owns these games. She has won seven Festival gold medals over the 
years. That's the most of any track and field athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 In an event that often featured marquee names such as Florence 
Griffith-Joyner, Evelyn Ashford and Gail Devers, Brown won her share and 
finished second and third a host of other times. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast company, but not bad company. 
</P>
<P>
 And then she gets the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something I evaluate myself," Brown says pleasantly. "I come back to 
the Festival for several reasons. The simulation of the Olympic Games, 
organization and good competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The competition now is also a lot better than it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 With that statement, Brown indicates that she is looking to the future. The 
33-year-old Hacienda Heights resident is hoping to get to Atlanta in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 But things have not gone well for her in the last year. She left her track 
club to practice independently, then suffered a stress fracture in a foot and 
failed to get past the first round in the national meet. 
</P>
<P>
 She remains undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I should be getting back to times where I should be running, 11.2 or 
11.3 (in the 100)," Brown said. "It was the first time I've been injured in 20 
years. So far, I've only had four or five races, so I need to get back in a 
competitive mode and have some more races under my belt." 
</P>
<P>
 She should get a good gauge of her recovery tonight. She will be the oldest 
runner in the event, 16 years older than the youngest, Aspen Burkett. But she 
makes no apologies for being 33. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think over the last four to five years, athletes have started to realize 
that they can (compete) into their mid-30s," Brown said. "A lot has to do with 
the fact that you have to have the desire to compete. I think a lot of 
athletes, before, didn't have the desire or weren't sound enough financially to 
compete into their mid-30s. But now that we are able to, it's going to work out 
well for our athletes."  
</P>
<P>
 Financial viability is still a problem for Brown, who is able to continue in 
part because of the U.S. Olympic Committee's job program. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Cal State Northridge, Brown wants to organize a track and field 
athletes' union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think the sport is dying," she said. "There used to be meets in Southern 
California, but now there's just Mt. SAC and, indoors, the Sunkist 
Invitational.  
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't know about track and field. They wait until the Olympic 
Games, and that's all they know. If we had something that could help promote us 
-- I don't want to say a rivalry, but that's what brings the crowds in -- it 
would help.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you are capable of making the final race, you should have appearance 
money. Then if you finish in the top three, you deserve the prize money. There 
are so many athletes who get left by the wayside, even though they are capable 
of (competing). If you have a house and kid and a car payment and insurance, 
there's no way you can do it, even if you want to."

HIS ENTHUSIASM ISN'T LOST IN TRANSLATION; HOCKEY: DUCKS' DRAFT PICK TVERDOVSKY 
SAYS HE'S EXCITED ABOUT MAKING THE TRANSITION TO AMERICAN CULTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Oleg Tverdovsky's adjustment to the NHL began Thursday when he donned a Mighty 
Ducks cap and stepped to a podium to address reporters in a thick Ukrainian 
accent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, I am Oleg Tverdovsky," he said. "I am very happy to be here in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Tverdovsky, the defenseman taken second overall by the Ducks in last week's 
NHL draft, then got an assist from an interpreter as he fielded questions about 
his expectations as a pro player. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be unusual and strange to me," he said. "It's a completely 
different culture. But I'm not afraid of the transition. I'm excited." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks bill Tverdovsky, 18, as the most talented player in the draft, good 
enough for them to pass on goaltender Jamie Storr, who went to the Kings, and 
Radek Bonk, a star with Las Vegas of the International Hockey League last 
season who was taken third overall by Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen Oleg play," Duck Coach Ron Wilson said. "Like everybody else, 
I'm excited to see what he can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's ready to play, he will. I'm making plans right now that he will be 
ready. But if he needs to play in the minors or go back to Russia for another 
year, then that's fine too. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I trust what our scouts say -- that he's a real find." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks view Tverdovsky as a future quarterback for their needy power play 
-- a role the young man relishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will consider it a great honor," he said. "I will certainly do my best to 
improve the power play." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wilson: "Oleg has speed, moves the puck and has a great shot from the 
point. That's the element we lacked on a game-by-game basis last year, where 
our defensemen move the puck quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've read a lot that we should have taken Radek Bonk because of his offensive 
ability. But Bonk or anybody who plays up front knows that if you don't get the 
puck in good position, you're not going to score." 
</P>
<P>
 John Ferguson, director of player personnel for the Ottawa Senators, has 
compared Tverdovsky with Bobby Orr, considered one of the greatest defensemen 
ever. Did the comparison make Tverdovsky uncomfortable? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be compared to Bobby Orr," he said, "but I'm aware that it will 
take a lot of time and work to come near what he has done." 
</P>
<P>
 First on his list of duties is getting settled in Orange County. Wilson, who 
played six seasons in Europe, hopes to have Tverdovsky live with an area family 
to ease his adjustment to American culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hockey will be the easiest part for him," Wilson said. "The troubling 
part is what he feels the other 22 hours of the day, when he's not playing." 
</P>
<P>
 "First and foremost, you have to learn the language. You won't feel 
comfortable until you know what you're saying and what everyone around you is 
saying." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Wilson speak any Russian? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a word of it," he said. "They (Russian players) have come to our country, 
and it's in their best interests to learn how to speak English. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can see, Oleg does speak a little English, and with the players on our 
team, I think the transition should be easy."

DANA PARSONS: THE POINT OF THE 'SPIKE' HITS TAXPAYERS WHERE IT HURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I heard there was a "spiking" controversy in Huntington Beach, I was 
distressed to think that someone might be rigging volleyball games in the 
latest Pro-Am tournament by the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Would that it were that respectable. 
</P>
<P>
 No, spiking was a little game worked up around the county in recent years by 
public officials and employees and that was a lot of fun to play. Basically, 
it's a game in which the officials convinced themselves they were entitled to a 
bunch of money for nothing. You can see its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 You might be tempted to call spiking a form of white-collar welfare fraud, 
although I'd differentiate spikers from welfare recipients by saying that at 
least the people in poverty who rip off the system actually need the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Spikers, on the other hand, are sharp cookies who knew the best way to make 
money was to have money. So, they stored up vacation days, sick days and things 
like car allowances and then cashed them in a year or so before retiring. By 
counting those benefits as income, they jacked up their final year's salary, 
which is the figure upon which their pensions were based. While most were 
modest bumps, the biggest eye-opener in Orange County involved that of a city 
manager whose final-year salary went from $97,400 to $159,100 after he cashed 
in unused benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 What spikers did wasn't illegal, which no doubt led them to turn their palms 
upward and say, "Who, me?" when anyone suggested the practice was a murky one. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us not on the public payroll perhaps see the issue more clearly. 
Let's say you'd been paying into a retirement system during your public career 
and that you peaked at, let's say, $30,000 a year in salary. The system is 
geared to give you a pension linked to what you've put in. So, if you suddenly 
spike your salary to $35,000 your last year . . . well, someone is paying to 
fatten your pension, but it sure isn't you. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach City Council is now in the odd position of saying it 
doesn't like spiking but refuses to pay a bill sent by the state to collect 
money for inflated pensions. The council says the spiking that inflated the 
pensions was legally approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The figure being quoted for the ultimate cost of Huntington Beach spiking is 
$13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach is not the lone wolf of spiking. Earlier this year, the state 
Public Employees Retirement System reported that about 80 cities and agencies 
around the state improperly spiked salary figures. It cited Huntington Beach 
and Orange as among the worst offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Ogata, a spokesman for the state agency, said spiking is financially 
unsound for the retirement system, besides being unethical. One of the ethics 
problems, he said, was that spiking opportunities were not doled out uniformly 
to all employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems inherent in spiking should be cleared up by a new state law, 
Ogata said, which includes provisions that ban unused vacation days and sick 
leave as salary components. It also includes a method that should send up 
warning flags if salaries jump inordinately before a person retires, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think people who spiked their salaries would be somewhat ashamed, but 
Ogata said that didn't appear to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked him about the dollars involved. Maybe if the spikers had seen the 
figures, they would have been more ashamed of themselves. Over the typical 
lifetime of a pension payment, Ogata said, it costs the system $150 for every 
dollar above the level at which a person paid in to the system. "So the 
long-term cost could be pretty high," Ogata said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he's just a nice guy, but Ogata was somewhat circumspect in assessing 
blame. He said the problem stemmed from not having a "sound process" in place 
to monitor abuses and that local officials may not have understood "the 
long-term ramifications" of what they were permitting. Even within his own 
agency, Ogata said, "there was a lot of naivete as far as what was happening." 
</P>
<P>
 As citizens, we're not paying public officials to be naive. We expect them to 
have sound processes. We expect them to understand long-term ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
 And we're not paying them to play little games among themselves where the 
outcome is rigged, especially games where they always win and we always lose 
and where we have to pay off in real money. 
</P>

STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION; SOCIAL SERVICES: THE DISABLED GET ON-THE-JOB 
COACHES UNDER THE SYSTEMATIC TRAINING FOR EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Nicole Hamelin was a high school junior and a camp counselor for the Muscular 
Dystrophy Assn. when she realized what she wanted to do with her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at age 21, she is where she wants to be, working for people who need her. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, I had wished there was more time to do volunteer work" for people 
with disabilities, she said. "But at that point, classes came first, and every 
chance I had to work was only part time. Now it is my job and my first 
priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamelin, of Cypress, works for the Systematic Training for Employment Program 
(STEP), a state-funded program that finds jobs for developmentally disabled 
people in Orange County and gives them personal coaches to help them on the job 
and offer emotional support. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which opened its first office in Los Angeles in 1985, pays 
coaches only about $14,000 a year and requires that they have a degree in 
psychology or a related field or at least a year of experience caring for a 
person with a disability. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hamelin, who coaches Wendy Moore, 29, and Kathy Lackey, 25, isn't doing it 
to get rich. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love working with them," Hamelin said. "They are hysterical." 
</P>
<P>
 Early every Monday through Friday morning, Hamelin picks up Moore and Lackey 
at their Huntington Beach homes and heads for their bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days a week, the two developmentally disabled women clock in at a Pizza 
Hut in Costa Mesa. For two hours, they make salads, fold boxes, make pizza 
sauce and wash dishes. Hamelin remains with them to help gather their working 
utensils or just to offer a soothing hug when they need it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They work well together," Hamelin said. "Kathy is very helpful -- a little 
too much sometimes. But they are doing fantastic, and I am really proud of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 On the days when they don't work, "we'll go to South Coast Plaza, the beach or 
just anywhere where the bus goes," Hamelin said. "Those are the real relaxing 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 The STEP program serves about 200 developmentally disabled people throughout 
Southern California. In Santa Ana, 25 job coaches serve 72 people, said Los 
Angeles program director Julia Shaull. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the number of people we service is limited by the size of our 
staff," Shaull said. "Our job coaches are responsible for two -- sometimes 
three -- people at one time. But we want to keep the program small because we 
feel if it grows, we will lose the quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Some job coaches, like Hamelin, stay with their clients all day, every day. 
But others only make daily visits to their clients at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is real hard to find employers," Shaull said. "It takes a lot of 
persuasiveness and sales experience. And, unfortunately, not all companies have 
a policy when it comes to hiring people who have disabilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Pizza Hut hires about half of STEP's clients. The rest work for other food 
chains, stores and industrial companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But STEP's biggest obstacle, Shaull said, is finding high-quality coaches who 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainly, people want to go to graduate school, and they use their experience 
here to further their education," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hamelin is attending night college classes, she doesn't plan to leave 
the work she loves anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "For right now, I am really thrilled being only 21 and in this type of field," 
Hamelin said. "A lot of people don't get to do what they enjoy. I am lucky."

WAITING FOR JUSTICE TO TAKE ITS COURSE; KIN OF WOMEN SLAIN IN SHOP DEAL WITH 
FEAR, PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 For Pamela Harrington, the nightmare of her mother's murder continues to haunt 
her every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, the nights just don't end," said the 32-year-old daughter of Joyce 
Stanley, who was shot to death a year ago today inside her Fountain Valley 
embroidery shop along with co-worker and close friend Terry Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 Accused of killing the two women is Stanley's 58-year-old brother-in-law, 
Douglas Frederick Stanley, who fled Orange County immediately after the 
shootings and became the subject of a nationwide manhunt before he was arrested 
four days later in a small town in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Stanley, who was extradited to California two months after the 
killings, is scheduled to go to trial later this summer. Family members said 
Thursday that only when he is "locked up for life" will they be able to get on 
with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just fall apart sometimes," said Vasquez's mother, Nannette Adelsperger, 
66, of Temecula. "Any situation can just trigger my emotions and I won't see it 
coming. We won't be able to have any closure to this until we go to court." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington said she has lived "day-to-day, hour-to-hour" since her 52-year-old 
mother was shot on a Thursday afternoon last summer. She said she has had 
trouble concentrating on even the simplest of tasks because the memories of 
that tragic day continue to haunt her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember my dad calling me and saying, 'Doug's gone berserk and mom and 
Terry have been shot. You've got to get here right away,' " the daughter 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records depict Douglas Stanley as a desperate and despairing man who 
lived at the home of his brother's family, along with his mother. He was often 
upset and apologetic over his failure to do a better job of running his life, 
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and acquaintances described the defendant as a "survivalist type" 
who fancied guns and frequently went about making threats against people. The 
day before the slayings, Stanley called a friend in Wyoming and vowed to "take 
out" his brother, sister-in-law and an unidentified third person, police 
testified at a preliminary hearing last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington recalled that on the day of the shootings, she drove in a daze from 
the accounting business she and her husband run in Irvine to Design-It, the 
embroidery business owned by her mother and father, Charles Stanley. She said 
she arrived to the sight of numerous police cars and spotted her grief-stricken 
father pacing back and forth in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington said it was hours before police confirmed that her mother was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelsperger and her husband, Richard, said they learned of the shootings from 
a television report and had their worst fears confirmed when a San Bernardino 
County sheriff's deputy arrived at their house to tell them that their only 
daughter was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the news of the deaths was only the beginning of a four-day nightmare for 
the families, who lived in a state of fear during the time that Douglas Stanley 
remained at large. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was terror," said Harrington's 55-year-old husband, Robert. "It was a 
total relief when he was caught." 
</P>
<P>
 Since family members didn't know of a motive for the attacks, they said they 
feared that Douglas Stanley might come looking for them. The Adelspergers 
stayed in a motel for a few days, then moved to the home of a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Harringtons also stayed at a motel, while other family members remained 
under guard at the Westminster home of Charles and Joyce Stanley -- the home 
they had opened up to Charles' troubled older brother a few years before and 
where he lived free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was well taken care of by my parents," Pamela Harrington said of her 
uncle. "They were very supportive of him, providing him with a place to live 
and with a paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter declined to discuss her uncle in any detail, saying she did not 
want to say anything to jeopardize his trial, which has been scheduled for Aug. 
29 in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Stanley has pleaded not guilty to two charges of murder. Prosecutors 
are not seeking the death penalty in the case, which rankles family members. 
They said they are now hoping for a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be with us for the rest of our lives," Robert Harrington 
said. "There are many more victims in this than the two who were taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 The family members said they are at loss to explain why the slayings happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents unsealed last fall include police interviews with Design-It 
employees who told investigators that Joyce Stanley considered her 
brother-in-law, who worked as a maintenance man at the embroidery shop, to be a 
troublemaker and that she had imminent plans to relocate the business to 
Springdale, Ark., to get rid of him. 
</P>
<P>
 But family members have steadfastly denied this. In a previous interview, 
Charles Stanley said, "We would never have abandoned him, ever. That's just 
misinformation." 
</P>
<P>
 A warm letter written by Joyce Stanley to her brother-in-law and found among 
his possessions after his arrest shows how she felt about him. In it she wrote, 
"I hope I was able to get through to you that I am available to listen if you 
want to talk with someone and that I do care." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Charles and Joyce Stanley who took custody of Douglas' daughter, Lisa, 
when she was 8 years old and raised her as one of their own children, Pamela 
Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who had been married for 33 years, had already sold their 
Westminster home and were planning to leave on July 11 -- two days after the 
shooting -- for Arkansas, where they were to oversee construction of a new 
embroidery plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Vasquez and her husband, Eddie, had already purchased a home in 
Springdale and were in the process of moving from their Santa Ana home when the 
shootings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day it happened, I remember Eddie and my father sitting on the front 
steps of the police station and they decided that they were going to follow 
through with my mother and Terry's dream," Harrington said. "My dad said, 
'We've got to continue on.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And they have. 
</P>
<P>
 The embroidery business that Joyce Stanley began in the garage of her home 13 
years ago continues to thrive in Springdale and is being run by Charles 
Stanley, his 29-year-old daughter, Sharon, and Eddie Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Harrington said she has not spoken to her uncle since the shootings and 
has borne the burden of the case since the rest of her family moved from Orange 
County, leaving the painful memories behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family is all gone, so I've been doubly abandoned," she said. "I'm kind of 
here holding the bag, but I plan to attend every day of the trial -- every 
second. I know it might be hard for me and may hurt, but my mom would have been 
there if it had been me."

COUNTY FAIR ADDS A FEW MODERN FLAIRS; ATTRACTIONS: GUESTS WILL FIND AUTOMATED 
SCOOTERS FOR THE DISABLED, MORE ATMS AND WIDE ACCEPTANCE OF CREDIT CARDS. AND 
THEN THERE'S THE $50 CATAPULT RIDE. 
</P>

<P>
 For more than a century, fairs have offered folks a familiar array of 
attractions like carousels, cotton candy, animals and musical shows. 
</P>
<P>
 But today's technologically savvy public expects convenience and a thrill or 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in an attempt to lure a new generation of patrons, the 102nd edition of 
the Orange County Fair, which opens today and continues through July 24, will 
offer a few new attractions that update an event that prides itself on the 
traditional. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the Ferris wheel and the children's arena will be eight ATM's, 
automated scooters for the handicapped and the elderly, and one $50 thrill ride 
that gladly accepts American Express. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to address the needs of the people," said Jill Lloyd, spokeswoman 
for the Orange County Fair. "We live in an automated, computerized world, 
where, if you don't have a fax, you're scorned." 
</P>
<P>
 Public suggestions have resulted in such additions as: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seven more ATM posts, up from last year's one. The Bank of America, Wells 
Fargo and Orange County Fair machines accept various credit cards as well as 
ATM cards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Automated scooters, $30 a day, an added service to manual wheelchairs, which 
cost $10 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Ejection Seat, one of the fair's featured new attractions, makes its 
debut in Orange County today. 
</P>
<P>
 And everywhere they accept plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Since few people carry cash, fair-goers now can pay for a packet of tickets 
with credit cards, and most exhibitors in the Carnival of Products and the 
Parade of Products -- buildings housing booths for everything from jewelry to 
footwear -- will accept credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators of the Ejection Seat, a giant 125-foot catapult ride for $50 that 
operates on the same principles as bungee-cord jumping, will accept credit 
cards of all types. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sleeper of a ride, but as soon as you pull that handle, (there is a 
pressure of) 3 1/2 G's and you're outta there," said John Suiter, 26, an 
Ejection Seat operator who says crowds have lined up at other carnivals for the 
thrill. 
</P>
<P>
 Beefed-up security and mandatory drug testing of employees also are 
contemporary additions. 
</P>
<P>
 The new security measures are aimed at preventing the kind of incidents that 
occurred last year, when a carnival worker fondled five children in a haunted 
house and eight people were injured in a roller coaster accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The haunted house has been removed and an additional 35 security officers have 
been hired for the duration of the fair, an increase from 130 last year to 165 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, quick thrills and high technology will always be overshadowed by the 
fair's true purpose, which is to educate and remind the public of its 
agricultural roots, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Orange County, there is less agriculture to see, and you tend to forget 
about it," said Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolchildren who visit Centennial Farm, a one-acre miniature farm and 
permanent fixture at the fairgrounds, learn to associate eggs and milk with 
chickens and cows, not with grocery stores, said Lloyd, who believes that many 
children today lack the basic knowledge of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's to remind people that (farming) really does go on," Lloyd said. "You may 
not see (the farmers), but they exist." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's theme, "Saddle Up For Fun," a salute to horses and hay, is geared 
to bring people back to the basics, which often get lost in a sea of glitzy new 
inventions, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a cattle drive on Fairview Avenue here July 15 when more than 
100 participants will herd 250 cattle. Also, every building on the fairgrounds 
will honor different horses, with the horse penned near the building for 
children to see and pet, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 And with luck, the ATM machines will blend in among the hay stacks and the 
chuck wagon.

O.C. BLUES FESTIVAL CREATORS LOCKING HORNS IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it the battle of the blues festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Former partners who split up acrimoniously after creating last year's 
inaugural Orange County Blues Festival are planning rival large-scale blues 
shows on successive weekends in Dana Point this fall -- and their squabble has 
ended up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 John Christian and John Dew filed a complaint in South County Municipal Court 
this week claiming the rights to the festival name and asking $100,000 in 
damages from former partner Jim Oakes. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's apparently not stopping the show -- or shows -- from going on. 
</P>
<P>
 State rangers confirm that Christian and Dew are planning a two-day blues 
concert at Doheny State Beach on Oct. 1 and 2. And Dana Point officials are 
discussing whether to allow a blues festival produced by Oakes at scenic 
Heritage Park -- where the event was held last year -- on Sept. 24 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a tourist city and these are the type of events that are good for Dana 
Point," Planning Commissioner Lynn Dawson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dawson added, "I don't know how good two of these festivals 
back-to-back will be for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 In the legal dispute, Christian and Dew claim they were victims of fraud and 
mismanagement because Oakes allegedly spent money without authorization that 
left some creditors still unpaid nine months after the 1993 festival. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe, and Oakes agrees, that last year's festival lost $30,000 despite 
a three-day attendance of about 22,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the (certified public accountant) in charge of the accounting," 
Christian said. "He is solely responsible for what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Oakes, however, contends that Dew, Christian and another former festival 
organizer, Eric Jensen, worked for him and were fired for improperly spending 
revenue from the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after the event, I sent a memo to the city saying I was no longer 
associated with these people in any way," Oakes said. "I own the name (Orange 
County Blues Festival) and they've never paid me to use that name." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the rival group contend that they and Oakes were part of a 
corporation that owns the rights to the name. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name belongs to the corporation," Christian said. "We will file an 
injunction if necessary to prevent (Oakes) from using that name." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, not all is serene in Dana Point over the prospect of another blues 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Several homeowners upset over the noise created by last year's festival in 
Heritage Park strongly opposed Oakes' application for a special events permit 
at a Planning Commission hearing Wednesday night.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission postponed action on the matter until July 20, but heard 
testimony from several residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we don't want is to fight this annual autumn festival every year," said 
Ed Smyth, a neighborhood resident who helped design Heritage Park. "This park 
was never meant for such heavy commercial use. To hear this noise bombard us 
from such close range is inexcusable." 
</P>
<P>
 Many expensive homes ring the park, which is situated on a bluff overlooking 
Dana Point Harbor. Residents say that besides the noise, they had to put up 
with people throwing trash and urinating on their lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakes, who did not speak at the public hearing, said the festival was for the 
common good of the community, not just for the approximately 50 residents who 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their feeling is 'not in my back yard,' " Oakes said. "Then why did they buy 
(a home) next to a park?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the residents backed the idea of a blues show at Doheny State Beach, 
as did Commissioner Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in a place that's far away from residential areas," she said. "It'll 
make money for the state, which badly needs revenue these days, and it'll bring 
business to Dana Point." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Doheny State Beach show is not under the jurisdiction of the 
city, "and we've been told by our city planners that we can't consider it as a 
factor" in the Heritage Park festival, Commissioner Robert Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Park Ranger Mike Tope said backers of the Doheny State Beach show still 
need to work out traffic and law enforcement plans, "but everything seems to be 
going along smoothly. I don't see any problems so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Christian said the concert will be held in a four-acre section of the 62-acre 
park. He added that confirmations from several major blues acts have been 
received and contracts will be signed soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California already has several major blues festivals in early fall, 
including the Long Beach Blues Festival, which was held the weekend before the 
Orange County event last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But drawn by several quality national and local blues acts, the first Orange 
County Blues Festival surprised several area concert promoters who had 
predicted oversaturation and a poor turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakes said he felt that having his Heritage Park show take place first would 
be an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our date is the same as it was last year and people get used to coming out at 
the same time every year," he said. "I think our show happening first will be a 
significant advantage in itself."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ARTISTS GIVE CLINIC DOSE OF HISTORY 
</P>

<P>
 Using paintbrushes and the memories of Orange County residents, a group of UC 
Irvine students has transformed a Santa Ana medical clinic's bland waiting room 
into a colorful blend of art and history. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mural, dedicated in a ceremony last week, highlights the role in Mexican 
culture of non-traditional medicine such as spiritual healers and herbal 
remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal was to liven up the space and address the Latino" community, said 
Debra Padilla, an associate of UCI Prof. Judith Baca, who oversaw the mural 
project. "They wanted it to be about healing . . . and the healing process that 
is so prevalent in Mexicanheritage." 
</P>
<P>
 The students researched the topic by interviewing nurses, doctors and patients 
at the Clinica Medica Familiar de Santa Ana on Main Street. The clinic serves 
people from around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients shared memories of growing up in rural Mexico, where their 
grandmothers used herbs to heal ailments, said Padilla, who works with Baca at 
the Social and Public Art Resource Center in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 The interviews resulted in a colorful mural filled with Aztec and Mayan 
images. The mural also includes portraits of Nelson Mandela, Emiliano Zapata 
and Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural displays a variety of herbs and plants known in Mexican folklore for 
their healing powers. A woman is pictured holding some herbs in her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 At the bottom of the mural, children standing next to urban housing projects 
are shown talking with children from a rural area. Padilla said the scene was 
placed at the bottom of the work so that the clinic's young visitors could 
easily view it. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural cost about $1,000 to design and paint. The owner of the clinic paid 
for most of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are enrolled in UCI's studio arts program. Baca is a well-known 
urban muralist who is now designing a half-mile-long mural on a concrete water 
channel in Los Angeles. Her mural charts the ethnic history of California, 
Padilla said. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY OKS FUNDING FOR ROLLER HOCKEY COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the popularity of roller hockey increases, city officials plan to spend 
$29,000 to make it easier and safer for teen-agers to play the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently approved the allocation when it adopted the 1994-95 
fiscal year budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the move is part of a larger effort aimed at providing 
productive activities for youths. In the past year, the city has spent 
thousands of dollars to improve after-school programs and athletic activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Roller hockey is a popular sport among youths, in part because it can be 
played on any large concrete or asphalt surface. Players wear in-line skates. 
</P>
<P>
 Teens use empty parking lots, tennis courts and even residential streets to 
play the game, City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to use the funds allocated to either create a permanent roller 
hockey court at a local park or buy a portable court.  
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to prevent teens from playing hockey in dangerous areas, where 
they could be hit by cars or cause accidents, Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 "An increasing number of (teens) . . . play this sport," he said. "We want to 
find a way to accommodate athem." 
</P>
<P>
 The council added the roller hockey funding to the budget just before it 
approved the document at a meeting last week. Money for the program will come 
from the personal aide accounts of each council member. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing more youth activities was a key recommendation of the Safe Community 
Task Force, a group of city and school officials that last year studied ways to 
reduce teen violence in thecity. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force also suggested beefing up police presence at local schools. 
Toward that goal, the new city budget allocates $95,000 to pay for a drug 
prevention officer to work with middle school students. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; EARLY SAN ONOFRE CLOSURE ENDORSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city, which declared itself a "nuclear-free zone" in the mid-1980s, has 
endorsed the early closure of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's 3-2 vote Tuesday night came two weeks after the San 
Clemente City Council landed on the opposite side of the issue, voting to keep 
the plant open. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach council members cited public safety as their main reason for 
supporting the proposed closure of the state's oldest nuclear plant, on the 
coast between San Clemente and Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Public Utilities Commission has recommended that the station be 
shut down by 1998, 15 years ahead of schedule, on the grounds that it is too 
expensive to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's 15 years less we have to worry about a major incident," Councilman 
Robert F. Gentry said. "It just seemed to me the smartest thing to do is to 
protect the citizens of Laguna Beach and support that early closure and give us 
more time without the threat of a major incident in San Onofre." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison, which runs the plant and is the largest 
shareholder, is opposing the closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the closure say it would be cheaper to shut down the station and 
switch to alternative energy sources, including solar power and natural gas. 
Opponents, however, say the plant provides $250 million in annual revenue for 
surrounding communities and closing it would further deflate an already sagging 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Before voting, the Laguna Beach council heard testimony from residents, 
including plant workers worried about losing their jobs and locals concerned 
about a possible nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentry said his major concern involves the plant's evacuation plan, which 
calls for Laguna Beach residents, in case of emergency, to "stay in our homes 
and close our windows" while residents closer to the station are evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very concerned that it was unworkable," Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Wayne Peterson, who along with Kathleen Blackburn cast the 
dissenting votes, said the council had "absolutely no facts" upon which to make 
a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of emotional discussion by a very limited segment of the 
community and no real facts," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In drafting their motion, the council majority also said they favored 
retraining the plant workers. San Onofre, which supplies 12% of the power used 
by Southern California Edison customers, provides some 3,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison owns about 75% of the plant while San Diego Gas & 
Electric Co. and city-owned utilities in Anaheim and Riverside own the 
remainder. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action is only advisory. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; APARTMENT FENCING, LANDSCAPE LAW OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has passed an ordinance regulating security fences and 
landscaping for apartment buildings, despite a last-minute plea from the 
Apartment Assn. of Orange County to delay the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The association did not receive enough advance notice of the public hearing to 
study the law and make arguments, spokesman Richard Lambros said later. 
</P>
<P>
 The association had no concern about "the spirit or intent" of the law but 
worried about some of the details, Lambros said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin O'Rourke told council members he learned about the 
association's request for a 30-day delay from a letter dated Tuesday. The 
letter said the ordinance includes regulations that might prove "costly and 
unworkable" for apartment owners. 
</P>
<P>
 But some apartment owners in Buena Park, who had been working with the city on 
the ordinance and postponing their own improvements until it passed, would be 
inconvenienced by a delay, Councilman Arthur C. Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about apartment owners here in this city," he said. "I don't 
see any reason to put an imposition on people waiting for this to pass so they 
can upgrade their apartments." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Bone, who has voted against the proposal since the public 
hearing, has said he was worried that under the new law, older apartment 
buildings would have to undergo major renovations if owners ever submit plans 
to upgrade some aspect of their property. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the city staff would work with the association and, if 
necessary, amend the code later. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; CITY DECLARES IMPASSE IN POLICE UNION TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has decided to stop contract negotiations with the police 
officers union and is now poised to impose a one-year contract that would take 
effect this month. 
</P>
<P>
 But union officials said Wednesday that they may decide not to accept the 
contract or may challenge it in court. Officials said they do not intend to 
call for a "sickout" or other labor actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll wait and see," said Terry Selinske, a member of the union's negotiating 
team. "All possibilities are open. We'll have to evaluate what we have to do 
next." 
</P>
<P>
 The 154-member Westminster Police Officers Assn., which has been working 
without a contract since December, had rejected three city proposals since 
contract negotiations began in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, city negotiators presented a final one-year offer that included a 
salary increase ranging from 3.5% to 6%, but police union officials said the 
package was not good enough and requested to continue the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did the best we can under the circumstances," Mayor Charles V. Smith said 
after the council voted 4 to 1 to declare an impasse in the negotiations. "But 
it was obvious that we could not reach an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Craig Schweisinger opposed the impasse. He said it was wrong to 
give the police union a raise and that the city should go back to the 
negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider imposing the one-year contract on Tuesday. If 
approved, it will be retroactive to July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract provides for a salary increase that will take effect in January, 
according to Acting City Manager Robert J. Huntley. The raise could be as high 
as 6% because city officials have agreed to make the salaries of city police 
officers between the fifth and sixth highest in Orange County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City police officers currently earn between $3,000 to $4,000 a month, said 
Selinske, a police detective. He said that according to their latest survey, a 
6% raise would put the city behind Fullerton and ahead of Costa Mesa salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the pay increase, police officers would receive higher pay for 
working at night, one additional paid holiday, one extra day of accrued 
vacation after 25 years of service, and special assignment pay available to all 
department employees. 
</P>
<P>
 But union officials said they would lose more than they would gain under the 
contract that city officials are considering imposing. 
</P>
<P>
 City contributions for medical coverage, for example, will be slashed from 
$581 monthly to $465. The police union had proposed that the city contribute 
$510 monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 Overtime pay would be curtailed. Also, employees would be allowed to convert 
into cash unused sick leave of only up to 240 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, city employees could cash out whatever unused sick leave that 
they have accumulated over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that its medical and overtime expenses and the unlimited 
sick leave cash-out policy are driving the city to bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just going out of sight," Smith said.BERT ELJERA

 "I kind of listen to (angry phone callers) and try to get them to the right 
person," said Lua, who works as an administrative assistant in Mayor Tom Daly's 
office. "Because I am not the right person." The mayor is "nice," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers are among 410 young people working for the city this summer 
under the federal Jobs Training Partnership Act. The city received $1 million 
in federal money for the salaries and administrative costs of hiring youths 
from low-income families who otherwise would have little chance of obtaining a 
summer job. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get to earn your own money," said Aguilar, a recreation supervisor at 
John Marshall Park. "I'm going to buy some back-to-school clothes and put the 
rest in the bank." 
</P>
<P>
 This year the program had 750 applicants vying for clerical, maintenance, 
child care and recreation jobs. To be eligible for the program, now in its 13th 
year, candidates must be 14 to 21, live in Anaheim and come from a low-income 
background. Participants earn the minimum wage during the 10-week program, 
which started June 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing the difference you'll see," said program coordinator Tom Bayard. 
"At the beginning they can come in here sullen, withdrawn and with a little of 
an attitude, but then you give them some responsibility and success and you can 
really see a positive change." 
</P>
<P>
 In years past, the program hired applicants on a first-come, first-served 
basis. This year, however, the city awarded jobs based on need, Bayard said. 
Those employed include former gang members, teen-age parents and high school 
students with third-grade reading levels, Bayard said. 
</P>
<P>
 A major goal is to prepare youths to enter the work force. Toward that end, 
youths will attend classes this summer on how to write a resume and on gaining 
work maturity skills. The work maturity course stresses the importance of 
timeliness, how to deal with supervisors and co-workers and wearing appropriate 
attire to the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "This job gives you an inside look at how City Hall works," said Aileen 
Bedolla, 15, an administrative assistant for the Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for the program, the youths say, the summer would be boring and 
less materially rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd probably be at home," said Chavez, in her third year with the program. 
"And I wouldn't be shopping so much." MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; MAN ABANDONS PLAN FOR GROUP HOME 
</P>

<P>
 The would-be operator of a group home for developmentally disabled adults has 
decided to withdraw his application after protests from neighbors made him fear 
for the well-being of the home's residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled out because, frankly, I was concerned about the quality of life of 
people residing in the home," Bob Valenzuela said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unrelenting opposition from neighbors of the house on Vista del Sol convinced 
him that the residents would not be allowed to live a quiet life, Valenzuela 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing in particular that caused me to (withdraw the application), 
it was just continual opposition, with no real break," Valenzuela said. The 
neighbors "have already made their minds up about who would be living in the 
facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela said that for the past three weeks he had received phone calls from 
neighbors, and while he would not reveal specifically what was said, he 
characterized the callers as "emotional and full of misinformation." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela applied for a license from the state Department of Social Services 
in March to operate an adult facility for a maximum of six residents. State law 
prohibits cities from banning or restricting such facilities, but neighbors of 
the proposed facility went to a City Council meeting last month and asked the 
city to prevent the facility from opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We request immediate city action to deny access to the property," said 
Jameson Garrett, who lives around the corner from where Valenzuela hoped to 
operate the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Taylor, community services planner for the agency that places residents 
in group homes, said it was unusual for an applicant to withdraw from the 
process because of neighborhood opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's highly uncommon," Taylor said. "I have never heard of it happening 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela said he had not decided whether to open the home elsewhere in the 
city or attempt to open the home in another community. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; COMMUNITY CENTER FEE CHANGES REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week rejected changes proposed by the Parks and 
Recreation Commission in a fee and use policy for the Community Center, saying 
the rules failed to address concerns of several local organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had asked the commission to review the Community Center fee 
schedule after representatives of local organizations complained about the 
rates charged for using various rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new proposal would not have given hobby groups and neighborhood 
organizations the same reduced rates that other nonprofit groups enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate centers on the commission's definition of nonprofit organizations. 
Local groups with nonprofit standing approved by the state Franchise Tax Board 
are allowed to use meeting and conference rooms for as many as 14 times a year, 
for as long as four hours, and are charged only a nominal fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional uses by nonprofit organizations are billed at a rate of $10 to $70 
per hour plus a set-up fee of $10 to $75, depending on the room used. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizations without nonprofit standing do not receive free use of the 
facility. They pay hourly rates of $20 to $100 and set-up fees of $15 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rudometkin, director of Parks and Recreation, said requiring groups to 
have nonprofit standing from the state is the simplest way of determining which 
groups are truly nonprofit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill Soukup, a member of Classic Cruisers Car Club, said gaining nonprofit 
status would cost his group about $800. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Schwing said an inequity exists when the city lets youth 
sports organizations use fields at no charge but makes hobby groups pay for the 
use of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The council sent the fee policy back to the Parks and Recreation Commission 
for more revisions and set a public hearing on the fee policy for Sept. 6.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; VOTERS TO HAVE CHOICE OF TERM-LIMIT PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week set up a competition between November ballot 
measures designed to limit council members' terms in office. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 3-2 vote, the council agreed to offer voters a three-term limit measure 
as an alternative to the two-term limit it had placed on the Nov. 8 ballot last 
month. The limits in both measures apply only to consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli, Councilman Jeffrey Thomas and Councilwoman Tracy 
Worley voted Tuesday night to place the new option before voters. Councilmen 
Jim Potts and Michael J. Doyle voted against the new proposal, saying that 
three full terms -- 12 consecutive years -- is too long a period to serve on 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley cast the swing vote on term limits and another hotly debated issue to 
also go before voters: how the city's solid-waste collection contract should be 
awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Potts and Doyle contended that city voters should decide whether or not the 
contract, now held by Great Western Reclamation Inc., should go out for open 
bidding every seven years. But Saltarelli and Thomas argued that the issue 
should be decided by council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley said she was originally leaning toward keeping the issue off the 
ballot. But she said her mind was changed after she heard a series of 
presentations by trash industry representatives, who said that the lack of open 
bidding was driving up prices for residential and commercial customers in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really seemed like other cities are not putting it out to bid," she said. 
But with a voter-mandated open-bidding process, all the qualified trash haulers 
would be eligible for consideration. "I just don't believe in monopolies," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Potts warned about cities signing "sweetheart deals" with "shady" trash 
haulers. An open-bidding process "takes away the schmoozing" between trash 
haulers and city officials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Worley made it clear that she supported putting the trash contract issue 
before the electorate, Saltarelli and Thomas joined the other council members 
in voting unanimously for the measure. Thomas added that he had grown tired of 
"going to the mat" in council debates, and offered to work peacefully with 
Potts on future city matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel kind of purged, you know," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council must approve the new term-limit measure and the trash measure on 
second reading later this month before they can be placed on the ballot. ALAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; HEPATITIS PATIENTS SOUGHT FOR STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Researchers at UCI Medical Center need 20 hepatitis C patients to participate 
in an 18-month study of an interferon drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease must have been diagnosed at least six months ago, but patients 
must not have received any treatment, nurse and study coordinator Barbara 
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests will be run under the supervision of Dr. John Hoefs, director of the 
UCI Liver Disease Program. All treatment will be free to test patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Hepatitis C is a chronic disease caused by a virus and mainly affects the 
liver, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot get over it by yourself, as with hepatitis A, and you cannot be 
vaccinated against it, as with hepatitis B," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors have had a test for hepatitis C since 1991 and the disease previously 
was referred to as non-A, non-B hepatitis, she said. Lack of treatment will 
lead over time to cirrhosis, liver disease and death. 
</P>
<P>
 The test drug Roferon has been used to treat hepatitis C in Europe and to 
treat other diseases in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not experimental," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested patients should call Walker at (714) 456-7821 or nurse Kristi 
Burnham at (714) 456-6558. LESLEY WRIGHT

WIDER TUBERCULOSIS TESTING ORDERED; HEALTH: RISING INCIDENCE OF DISEASE, 
INCLUDING LA QUINTA HIGH SCHOOL OUTBREAK, PROMPTS POLICY OF TESTS FOR ALL 
STUDENTS ENTERING SCHOOLS FROM OUTSIDE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to an upsurge in tuberculosis cases in Orange County, health 
officials have ordered expanded testing of students this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy requires TB testing of students from outside Orange County who 
transfer into any public or private school in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 State law already requires TB testing of all students entering the first 
grade. The county's new policy expands the testing to cover grades one through 
12, if the student is moving into Orange County. Since 1985, Los Angeles County 
has had a similar policy for mandatory tuberculosis testing of transfer 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've ordered this because I think it's important for the health and 
well-being of the people of Orange County," said Dr. Hugh Stallworth, the 
county's director of public health. "It's mandatory for public and private 
schools as of Sept. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth said Orange County's new policy does not affect intra-county 
student transfers. But if the student is moving into Orange County from another 
county, another state or a foreign country, he or she must be tested for TB 
before being admitted, Stallworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County has required that transfer students from outside the state 
or country be tested for tuberculosis, in addition to all first-grade students. 
Health officials in Los Angeles said that unlike the new Orange County policy, 
that of Los Angeles County does not require a TB test for a transfer student 
from another California county. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth said the new Orange County policy was "developed to deal with 
rising TB cases." He added, "We've, of course, had a tuberculosis outbreak at 
La Quinta High (in Westminster), and we've also had some other cases in other 
high schools, middle schools, as well as some lower grades." 
</P>
<P>
 A school-by-school breakdown of TB cases in Orange County was not available. 
County health officials, however, said that the number of TB cases countywide 
is rising this year. There were 162 TB cases diagnosed in the county from Jan. 
1 to June 30 this year, compared to 148 cases during those six months last 
year. From 1990 through 1993, the number of new cases of tuberculosis in the 
county increased by 71%, from 258 to 440. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta High became the focal point for much of the county's concern over 
rising tuberculosis infection after active cases of the disease were diagnosed 
in 17 students. In addition, 106 students and staff members at the high school 
tested positive for infection with the bacteria, meaning they might have the 
disease in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The new order to expand TB testing has been transmitted to all school systems 
in Orange County, and the reception has been overwhelmingly favorable, 
Stallworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked with school superintendents and parents, and we've gotten no 
significant resistance," he said. The consensus of parents and educators, 
Stallworth added, is that expanded TB testing "is a win-win situation for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One system, the Huntington Beach City School District, has enthusiastically 
backed the county's new directive by adopting it as district policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's a good idea to test all new students, as well as the 
first-grade students," said school board member Trustee Shirley Carey. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey, who is a nursing consultant, said she wishes the required TB testing 
also included kindergarten students. 
</P>
<P>
 "State law doesn't require testing of kindergarten students because 
kindergarten isn't mandatory," she said. But Carey added that she urges parents 
of kindergarten students to have them tested for TB before entering them into 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Landry, a registered nurse who is the administrator for health for the 
Orange County Department of Education, said "tuberculosis is something we've 
kind of minimized over recent years, but it's something we do need to be 
concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
 Landry said the skin test for tuberculosis is done with a needle "and doesn't 
hurt any more than pinching." She said parents who cannot afford to have the 
test by a private doctor can have it done at a community free clinic or the 
county Health Care Agency. The county clinic, at 1725 W. 17th St. in Santa Ana, 
offers free tuberculosis testing for school-age children on Mondays and 
Wednesdays from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and on Tuesdays from 10 a.m. to 5:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The skin test requires two clinic visits: one for the needle injection and a 
follow-up visit for the reading of the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth said TB is a bacterial disease "that can exist in any organ of the 
body, but most commonly is found in the lungs." He said the disease is 
transmitted "by someone who has tuberculosis, coughing, sneezing or singing."

BRUSH FIRES BLACKEN GRASSLAND IN IRVINE, FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two brush fires at opposite ends of Orange County, both believed to have been 
set, scorched several acres of grassland near occupied structures Thursday, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, illegal use of fireworks blackened about three-fourths of an acre 
of hilltop near Concordia University, Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman 
Kathleen Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which investigators believe was caused by a smoke bomb, was reported 
at 1:10 p.m., Cha said. Witnesses told investigators they saw two juveniles 
running from the scene, in the 1500 block of Concordia, about that time. 
</P>
<P>
 While the smoke bomb that may caused the blaze is classified as "safe and 
sane" fireworks where such sales are permitted, Cha said, it is banned in 
Irvine. Regardless of the classification, she said, fireworks are "a heat 
source. If you misuse it, or put it in the wrong area, there are going to be 
problems. Luckily, this remained a small grass fire." 
</P>
<P>
 It took 45 firefighters using a water-dropping helicopter about 35 minutes to 
control the blaze. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 About two hours later, a brush fire broke out near a Fullerton housing 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire at West Coyote Hills Tree Park near Parks Road and Avenida del Norte 
came within 100 feet of several houses, Fire Marshal John Clark said. They were 
saved because the homeowners had cleared the brush near their structures 
earlier this summer as part of the city's weed abatement program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked just like it was supposed to," Clark said. "There were some nervous 
people here though." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the cause of the fire was under investigation, but he speculated that 
it was "set by a human."  
</P>
<P>
 About 30 firefighters worked nearly 35 minutes to control the brush fire, 
Clark said.

ON THE UP BEAT; DESPITE A LONG PARTNERSHIP IN L.A.'S DEADLIEST POLICE PRECINCT, 
THESE GUYS ARE MORE LIKE MAYBERRY'S ANDY AND BARNEY THAN THEY ARE DIRTY HARRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Officer Cliff Lloyd yanks the black-and-white patrol car to the curb at 48th 
and Hoover. Half a dozen people, some of them sipping beer, sit in a circle on 
folding chairs and plastic milk crates in the balmy, late afternoon shadow of 
the Caribbean Market. 
</P>
<P>
 They turn their heads and seem anxious until they recognize Lloyd and his 
partner, Officer Roger Gaylord, climbing out of the car. Azalea Usher, wearing 
a T-shirt that says "I Survived the 6.6 Tremor," reaches out and hugs Lloyd. 
One guy knocks over his drink as he stands to shake hands. 
</P>
<P>
 On the streets, they are known as "OGs" -- Old Gangsters. Their names -- 
Gaylord and Lloyd -- befit a Vegas magic act, and it's true that they sometimes 
work from a bag of tricks, stuffed with bits and pieces of street-cop wisdom 
from the 77th Division, the deadliest precinct in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 They have learned that sometimes it is best not to play things strictly by the 
book, and sometimes police work is a crap shoot -- like the time Gaylord, 
working alone, wandered into a park where Rolling 40s gang members were 
drinking and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't gonna arrest everybody, 'cause I only got two handcuffs," he 
recalls. He decided to deal with them on their own terms. "Tell you what," he 
told the group. "I roll seven, you guys take it somewhere else. I don't roll 
seven, I'll leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaylord rattled the dice and, sure enough, he shook out a seven. Everybody 
left smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Gaylord and Lloyd unique is that they have been partners for eight 
years in a division where officers constantly are shuffled to fill gaps. In 
most cases, partnerships are measured in months rather than years. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult for them to define their relationship: two heavily armed 
people who spend much of their lives distanced only by the width of a Chevy 
seat, who ride together through dark corners of Los Angeles. Who lay down the 
law in a quiet, human way that contrasts sharply with the shoot-'em-up image 
that dominates headlines and TV drama. Who love each other like brothers.  
</P>
<P>
 They work as a team, like two basketball players who know instinctively when 
the other will fake right, go left and cut for the hoop. They complement each 
other. When the only way into a building is through a window, it is the beefier 
Lloyd who will lift Gaylord on his shoulders to climb through and open the 
door.  
</P>
<P>
 When they were younger, they bulldozed through the hook 'em and book 'em 
years, but those days are long gone. They could have busted a couple of people 
at the Caribbean Market. But without mention, the alcohol seems to have 
disappeared, allowing Gaylord and Lloyd to get on with what they do best. Lloyd 
pulls up a milk crate while Gaylord engages in a separate conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd is 49 and has worked in South L.A. for 21 years. Gaylord is 40 with 12 
years experience in the 77th. That, too, separates them from their younger, 
less seasoned cohorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be young to work down here," says Sgt. Phil Jackson. "The pace is 
very fast. It's constantly boom, boom, boom. You have to be young to keep up 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 So, where does that leave Gaylord and Lloyd? 
</P>
<P>
 "They pace themselves because they're no spring chickens," Jackson says. 
"That's one of the benefits of maturity and experience. You know how to pace 
yourself and get the job done as opposed to bam, bam, bam like a Ping-Pong ball 
and burning yourself out in a couple hours." 
</P>
<P>
 On the boom-boom-boom, bam-bam-bam streets of the 77th, experience has taught 
Gaylord and Lloyd that there's a time to boom, a time to bam, and a time to 
pull up a milk crate and shoot the breeze. It is amazing, they say, how many 
crimes can be solved by merely getting to know people and developing a sense of 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
 They once were stopped by a man who tipped them off about a burglary that was 
to take place that night at the Northridge Fashion Center. After the entire 
plan was laid out to them, Gaylord and Lloyd contacted the Devonshire Division. 
Suspects were arrested en route to the shopping center in stolen vehicles, and 
the heist was prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, Gaylord and Lloyd are throwbacks to Mayberry, where officers 
sipped lemonade on front porches, hunted down lost cats and, on those rare 
occasions when trouble drifted into town, chased down and chastened criminals 
in unlikely and humane fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are not Andy and Barney, and the 77th Division of South-Central Los 
Angeles is no Mayberry. 
</P>
<P>
 More homicides and other violent crimes are committed in these 12 square miles 
than anywhere else in the city. A history of distrust between police and 
residents has created ongoing tension. On the surface and in the headlines, 
South-Central is fused to such tensions: gang against gang, ethnic group 
against ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaylord and Lloyd, however, know a different side of the city. They have 
watched children grow up here, taught them how to ride bicycles and catch 
baseballs with both hands, given them rides home when they were out too late at 
night, gone to their birthday parties . . . their funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 They have stood on street corners and in alleys, visiting with prostitutes, 
whom they refer to as "unlicensed physical therapists" but never as whores. 
They see their job as keeping the peace, and sometimes that means bending the 
rules. Oftentimes it means taking time to resolve confrontations with 
discussion rather than comeuppance. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it comes down to," Lloyd says, "is having a sense of humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, shortly before the riots, they received permission to work foot 
patrol. If they had their way, they would still be walking the streets and 
alleys, but lack of personnel has forced them back into black-and-whites. It 
was while they were on foot that they came to know the people at the Caribbean 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd, with neatly trimmed graying hair and bushy mustache, is talking to 
Harrington Trapp, 45, a musician with two-foot dreadlocks. Trapp, like the 
others in front of the market, is a native of Belize. They take up a 
conversation about law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cops are trained to be cops," Trapp tells Lloyd. "But you can't just be a 
cop, you have to be a humanitarian, deal with people regardless of what they 
look like." 
</P>
<P>
 All agree: Gaylord and Lloyd are different. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen cops like this in my life," Trapp says. He pulls a cigarette 
out of his shirt pocket. "My mother knew I smoked but I never smoked around 
her, out of respect, and it's the same with them." He returns the crumpled 
cigarette to his pocket. "We respect them because they respect us." 
</P>
<P>
 A compact car stops in front of the market and a young woman shouts, "Hey 
Lloyd." 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd looks ups, returns her greeting and waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's Gaylord?" the woman shouts through the window, waiting for the light 
to change. It's the first question people ask when they see one without the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd shrugs, then points across the street. "I think he's over there 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably written in some book about how to be a cop that officers should 
always know where their partners are. But Gaylord and Lloyd did not learn how 
to be cops from a book. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as it turns out, Gaylord is indeed in the park across the street -- on 
the monkey bars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once they pull out of the parking lot -- Gaylord in a patched up 1974 
Volkswagen Thing, and Lloyd on a bull-sized Suzuki motorcycle -- they are 
through being cops. 
</P>
<P>
 In his personal life, Gaylord talks about the water, the times he has sailed 
freely in the wind and swum with dolphins. Lloyd, the quieter of the two, 
speaks of poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Were I learned and eloquent and had the minds of other men, 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I could put my thoughts to words; and my words I'd put to pen." 
</P>
<P>
 So begins a poem he titled "If I Could Write." 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Miquie, live quiet lives where they can sit in the back yard 
at night and see the stars, hear the owls and the frogs, and an occasional 
barking dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd enjoys reading, especially Clive Cussler thrillers and Westerns. In both 
appearance and demeanor, he could a sheriff in a Louis L'Amour novel, the 
strong, silent, deep-thinking type. Even as he rides through town in the 
black-and-white, he greets people with a wave, sometimes with a pinch of 
tobacco in his mouth and a "Howdy." 
</P>
<P>
 He admits that there is longing in his voice when he talks about the years he 
spent growing up in Alaska, about the wooden streets, homes without 
televisions, ponds where he and friends would gather to float on halibut crates 
in summer, to ice skate in winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could probably do real good retiring someplace like that," he says. "I 
don't need a city life." 
</P>
<P>
 It was shortly after his first wife, Linda, died of a heart attack in 1985 
that he teamed up with Gaylord, someone he found easy to talk to and lean on. 
From Day One, they say, there was a sense of trust and confidence between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd and Linda were married 19 years, had three children. Losing her was an 
uncertain, turbulent time, and what got him through it was the recognition that 
there are things in life over which a person has no control. Things happen that 
must merely be accepted or, at least, survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "You realize that life doesn't just stop, and it does no good to be bitter or 
angry." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of his wife's death is one he shares often with people in tragic 
situations. It is his way of letting them know he understands. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd could have retired last year but chose to continue working. He says he 
still feels young, still enjoys the work and can still chase down bad guys when 
he has to. His decision to retire, he says, is likely to be made with the wind 
in his face some glorious day. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of these days," he says, "I'm likely to head off for work on my 
motorcycle and tell myself, 'I think I've had enough, and there's this place 
Miquie and I haven't been to for coffee in a long time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So he will turn his bike around. And go home. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaylord also knows the feel of wind on his face. Much of his childhood was 
spent in a 10-foot-by-10-foot room at his great-grandfather's home on Catalina 
Island, and much of his free time now is spent on his 31-foot sailboat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You separate me from the water," he says, "and I might as well die." 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived at police work following three years in the Army as a member of an 
anti-terrorist group. "Our job was to go in and just (mess) everything up. It 
didn't matter what it was, just get in there and (mess) it up. . . . It was 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 He tries to remember the good times in the military, even though there were 
plenty of bad times: friends who were killed, people he killed. He is shielded 
from those memories by a thick crust, which also allows him to deal with the 
harsh side of police work. 
</P>
<P>
 His first marriage ended in divorce after 14 years and two children. He is 
engaged to a woman he met while working foot patrol. They plan an October 
wedding. It's a new beginning, and there will be another new beginning when his 
partner retires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to spend the rest of my career with Cliff. I couldn't think of 
anything better, but I know eventually he is going to say enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Children come running out of the house on 47th Street. Within seconds, 
Shangrila Wright, 12, and her sister, Supreme, 8, have wrestled their way into 
handcuffs. Gaylord gives them the old line about not having a key. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gaylord and Lloyd were taken off foot patrol, Shangrila and Supreme took 
a petition around their block in protest. It wasn't enough, however, to change 
the minds of police officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to have them on foot patrol," says Capt. Larry Goebel of the 77th 
Division. "They are ideal for that. They can sit down and talk to the most 
hard-core gang banger out there and break down barriers, or they can spend time 
with the little old lady who just wants to chat. They don't come any better as 
far as beat cops are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 But with limited personnel, Goebel says, it's more important to have them in a 
car so they can move quickly as needed. Even so, their black-and-white seems to 
be parked much of the time. They're usually out in the street with children, on 
the sidewalk with parents, in the bars checking in with owners and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of their job is to gather information; but equally important, they say, 
is answering questions about the police. On a call about missing Power Ranger 
figures, Gaylord and Lloyd are greeted by a woman and her young son, the 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 They ask a few questions and are told that the youngster suspects his friend 
next door. They knock, and the suspect's mother invites them in. They take a 
look around but come up empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not in there," Gaylord says. They strike up a conversation on the 
sidewalk about expensive toys and kids, when a man from down the street 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Power Rangers? Don't you guys have something more important to be doing?" 
asks Sadale Johnson, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not be important to you or me, but it's pretty important to him," says 
Lloyd, pointing to the young owner of the missing dolls. "Does it always have 
to be a shooting or something like that when the police come?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually is," Johnson says. "We already have the perception of police that 
when y'all come that it's gonna be trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that was the nice part about when we walked," Lloyd says. "We could 
just talk to people about things. We didn't need a reason to be somewhere. . . 
. There's a helluva lot of good people here, and I enjoy being around them." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go home, does it take you about an hour, hour and a half?" Johnson 
asks. "A lot of the cops that come by here live in the San Fernando Valley, and 
sometimes I think, 'How much can they care?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't care, I wouldn't have been here 21 years," Lloyd says. "And say I 
lived here. I've put a lot of people in jail over 21 years. Now, what would 
happen if I put myself and my family in this area? Retaliation. Plus, it's just 
like any other job. When the day gets over, you want to get the hell away from 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The jingle of an ice cream truck is interrupted by gunfire just outside the 
77th Street Division headquarters. Lloyd curses as he and Gaylord head out on 
foot. He raises his left arm and Gaylord reacts, crossing 77th as the two of 
them head toward Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Black-and-whites pour in from all directions. A helicopter circles. A suspect 
is arrested in a nearby apartment building within 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A cop's job in South-Central can turn from pleasantry to tragedy in a snap. 
Says Lloyd: "You can turn a corner here and be in the deepest (trouble) of your 
life." They have talked often about turning that corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger knows that if we come out here and shooting ensues, I get hit, I go 
down, he's not coming out and playing John Wayne," Lloyd says. "It's not gonna 
do any good to have two of us shot. I've been hurt enough times, I've run 
through 10 broken bones in my body, I've had 30 something stitches in my head 
from various things. I know what pain is, so I'm gonna take care of myself, as 
long as I'm conscious." 
</P>
<P>
 The two of them have worked just about every kind of case there is to work in 
law enforcement, plumbing or mechanics. Their stories are sometimes gruesome, 
filled with bullets and bodies, but like most officers here, they have never 
fired their weapons on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 They describe how neighborhoods here have grown close and strong out of 
necessity, unlike many suburban areas, where neighbors isolate themselves. The 
bars that cover windows and doors may be viewed as scars of crime, but they 
also represent a determination to withstand, to protect precious peace. 
</P>
<P>
 In simplest terms, that is how Gaylord and Lloyd view their role as police 
officers, to help people live in peace. They are happy being who they are: a 
couple of coppers out on the street. They don't have their sights set on a desk 
job, or anything that would require wearing a necktie. They aren't out to prove 
how many people they can arrest, how many tickets they can issue. Both admit 
that the books of tickets they carry are outdated and rarely used. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are guys who go out there and hook and book and throw people in jail. 
Great. They're doing their job and doing it right, but are you really solving 
the problem?" Gaylord says. "Cliff and I try to solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 They soon will be separated as they begin training a couple of rookies right 
out of the academy. After them, there will be others. It could be years before 
they get back together, if they ever do. In the meantime, they will be paying 
particularly close attention to their radios. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will always consider Roger my partner," Lloyd says. "Even if we're not in 
the same car, if one of us gets in a hot situation, the other one will be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what being partners is all about.

THE GOODS; WILL YOU BE SAFE OR SORRY?; PEPPER SPRAY? SMELL REPELLENT? A STUN 
GUN? OR SIMPLE PREVENTION TECHNIQUES? EXPERTS RATE WHAT'S BEST AT STOPPING 
CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Personal protection devices -- those gadgets that may make you feel safer on 
the street -- are a bewildering array of inventions, some of which seem the 
stuff of low-budget adventure cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 You can purchase foam dyes that turn an assailant's skin green. "Stinky vials" 
make you smell disgusting to discourage attackers. Then there are the old 
standbys -- Mace, pepper spray, stun guns and noise alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times asked for opinions on the devices from Lt. Chris West, a crime 
prevention specialist with the Los Angeles Police Department, Lt. Chuck Jackson 
of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and Warren Clark, a former 
California Highway Patrol member who lectures in the criminal justice 
department at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Chemical Mace. A brand-name tear gas that irritates the eyes, nose and 
throat. The container can be clipped to a belt, purse or key ring, or carried 
in its own pouch. Suggested retail price is $14.95. You need training and a 
state certificate to purchase Mace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because Mace sprays as a mist, you have to be fairly close to your attacker 
and there's a danger you will come in contact with the gas," Jackson says. 
"It's effective as long as it makes contact with an assailant's eyes or mouth." 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We carried it in the California Highway Patrol," Clark says. "If you handled 
a garden-variety combatant, it would work. If you handled someone highly 
intoxicated with cocaine, PCP or alcohol, you'd get them angry and probably 
were in for a pretty good fight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Pepper Spray. Derived from red pepper plants, this substance disables by 
forcing the eyes shut and restricting breathing. Acute symptoms subside within 
10 to 15 minutes and usually disappear within an hour. Sold in a small can with 
a clip, it's the most popular personal protection device sold at three outlets 
contacted by The Times. A state certificate is required for purchase. Suggested 
retail price is $15.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we particularly like is that it has a very thin, long spray 
and you can stand 10 or 12 feet away from people and zap them," West says. "You 
don't have to get close. Another thing that makes pepper spray different is the 
liquid that carries the stuff evaporates quickly. With Mace, the residue is 
much more virulent and long-lasting." Pepper spray is more effective than Mace 
when used on people under the influence of drugs or alcohol, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Clark: "It's very effective. It completely debilitates an individual. It 
pains them immediately and they go right down to their knees. Then with a 
little water, you can wash it off." 
</P>
<P>
 "After training, pepper spray is simple to use whether you're 115 pounds or 
315," Jackson says. "Point, push the button and the stream goes out. In the 
Sheriff's Department, it was effective about 87% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Stun Guns. These battery-operated devices can be held in one hand and 
deliver an electric shock when metal prongs touch an assailant. Prices start at 
about $40. 
</P>
<P>
 Says West: "You must be so close to assailants with the device, you can reach 
out and touch them. If you get that close, they'll be very effective. You'll 
drop (the assailant) like a hot potato. 
</P>
<P>
 "But surprise counts for a lot. Unless you can get straight through to them 
right away, (attackers) may take you down hard. If they get a good, solid grip 
on you, you might shock yourself. And if the person is wearing a heavy-duty 
leather jacket, and especially if they're big and strong, there's a strong 
chance you won't be able to debilitate them." 
</P>
<P>
 * Noise Alarms. These devices produce an ear-splitting noise designed to sound 
an alarm and frighten an assailant. They can be carried in a pocket or purse, 
attached to a belt loop or worn around the wrist. Some will not stop until 
deactivated by a private code. Prices start at about $17. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea with the noise alarm is to get someone's attention," Jackson 
says. "If you're in a mall parking lot where they could hear and come to your 
aid, it's a great system. But if you're in a subterranean garage at 9 or 10 at 
night all by yourself, who's going to hear you?"  
</P>
<P>
 "They have limited effectiveness," West agrees. "How much attention do you pay 
to car alarms? Is it better than nothing? Sure. But we don't consider it the 
be-all and end-all. The better ones have a nifty little clip (that) attaches to 
the outside of a purse. It's real easy to activate." 
</P>
<P>
 * Foam dyes. Aiming and spraying the contents of a canister can turn an 
assailant's skin a different color. The device can be carried in a pocket or 
purse, or clipped to a pocket or waistband. One brand, Dye Witness, sells in 
one store for $45. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a more benign version of Mace," West says. "It comes out in a big 
goopy mess. It will make a Martian out of your crook. It usually lasts a while 
as well. I have the same issue with it as any of these devices: Are you ready 
to use it? It may be difficult because there's no required training." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Clark: "I don't think it's going to deter a rapist that much. If an 
individual is bent on serious crime, there is nothing in this device (that) 
induces a form of pain or a deterrent." 
</P>
<P>
 "Since it has no debilitating effect, you might make someone real mad at you 
and increase their assaultive behavior," Jackson says. "So I don't see this as 
a real good preventive device. I see it as an outstanding way of identifying 
and capturing a suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Smell Repellent. These ampuls, manufactured by KBA Inc. in Atlanta under the 
brand name Rapel, contain a foul-smelling fluid originally designed to help oil 
companies find leaks in pipes. Squeeze the ampul, and a glass bubble breaks and 
releases the stench on your skin, making you repulsive to attackers. The tiny 
device, just over an inch long and the size of a pencil, can be clipped to a 
bra strap. Men can wear it on underclothes or on the back of a tie. Available 
by mail order for $19.95 plus shipping and handling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they would be of limited use," West says. "If somebody wants you or 
your money and they're high on drugs, they're going to take what they want. 
They're not going to leave you alone just because you smell bad." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any debilitating effect from this device that would drive the 
assailant away," Jackson says. "The odor might cause some criminals to run away 
but others to get mad at you. I don't have any personal familiarity with this 
device, but those are my opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say no matter what product a consumer buys, good preventive techniques 
are most important in foiling crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strong position is that you can avoid the vast majority of problems that 
you get into by employing good crime prevention techniques and thus not having 
to rely on these devices," West says. 
</P>
<P>
 These techniques start with being alert. "The robber typically avoids people 
who are alert," says USC professor Marcus Felson, a specialist in criminology.  
</P>
<P>
 It's also important to appear confident. "That's readable by people," Jackson 
says. "Sometimes that's enough to keep people from going forward with an 
assault."

<P>
 Tired of being called a petrochemical blight on the environment, the plastics 
industry is stressing its green points.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to emphasize the environmental attributes of plastic," says Jimmy 
Hendricks, spokesman for the American Plastics Council, which has issued a new 
booklet, "Shop Recycled! A Consumer's Guide to Recycled Plastics" that lists 
brand names of dozens of products made with -- or packaged in -- recycled 
plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are aware that motor-oil containers or detergent bottles can become 
recycled bottles," says Hendricks, "but often quite amazed that things like 
hiking boots and sleeping bags contain recycled plastic fibers." 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet is a spin-off from a more comprehensive "Recycled Plastics 
Products Sourcebook," with more than 1,000 listings of products and 
manufacturers. Updated regularly, it is used by government and industrial 
purchasing officers shopping for environmental products. 
</P>
<P>
 Both guides are free from APC (call (800) 2-HELP-90), which designed a 
promotional T-shirt made from recycled plastic bottles to dramatize its point. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Merson, president of Eco-Expo, the country's largest show devoted to 
environmental products, agrees that the parade of recycled plastic products has 
picked up noticeable speed in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are shirts, pants, sweaters and jackets showing up at Eco-Expo 
booths, he said, but also the filling that goes into a variety of clothing, 
such as down jackets, is increasingly being made from recycled plastics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know about the unglamorous things like recycled bottles," he said. "But 
what's more exciting is that they are taking plastic, breaking it down into 
pellets of resin and re-spinning it into fiber. In fact, fashion is probably 
the single fastest-growing segment of our show." 
</P>
<P>
 Scratching Fleas: The summer war against fleas has a new and all-natural 
weapon: worms. Tiny worms called "beneficial nematodes," are now mass-marketed 
in a form you can spray on your lawn. Why spray the lawn with worms? Because 
the soil nematodes attack pre-adult fleas outside.  
</P>
<P>
 Usually a pet owner's yard works like an incubator for flea eggs, larvae and 
pupae, which make up 95% of the flea population. Once a pet ventures outside, 
the slightest vibration on the ground causes the new adult fleas to leap onto 
the pet and move indoors to reinfest the home.  
</P>
<P>
 Nematodes nip all that in the bud, says Chrystie Heimert of Veterinary

 State laws regulate the use of Mace, pepper spray and stun guns. To carry Mace 
or pepper spray, a consumer must acquire a $17 state certificate by passing a 
30-question test, watching a 30-minute video, or attending a certified class at 
a police station, community college or private academy. 
</P>
<P>
 The written test and video are available at many gun or uniform shops, or 
security firms where the products are sold. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a misdemeanor to carry a pepper spray not certified for sale in this 
state. (Only one pepper spray, First Defense MK-6C, has been approved.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's an infraction, punishable by a fine of up to $100, to carry Mace or First 
Defense without a certificate, and a misdemeanor or felony to use the sprays in 
a non-defensive capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Stun guns are forbidden to anyone who has been convicted of a felony or a 
crime involving assault, but there is no waiting period to buy one. 
</P>
<P>
 Stun guns differ from Tasers, which in California may be used only by law 
enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Stun guns have metal prongs that must touch an attacker's skin to deliver a 
shock, while Tasers propel barbs attached to wires through the air so they can 
penetrate an attacker's skin and deliver a shock from a distance. GARY LIBMAN

FINALLY, A STABLE PROFESSION; CAREERS: BRET ROTH TURNED TO SHOEING HORSES AFTER 
BEING LAID OFF FROM AEROSPACE JOBS. NOW HE DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT THE POLITICAL 
WINDS. 
</P>

<P>
 In case the similarities between shoeing a horse and machining hydraulic brake 
components for the space shuttle weren't clear, Bret Roth lifted the horse's 
hoof and pointed out the thin, white line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drive the nail in a sixteenth of an inch on the inside and you draw blood," 
he said. "A sixteenth of an inch on the outside and the hoof splits." 
</P>
<P>
 Hydraulic cylinders may be measured in thousandths of an inch, but that's 
relative, Roth said. In the end, attention to detail is equally important in 
the two fields. 
</P>
<P>
 What's different is job security. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, when the 36-year-old Toluca Lake resident was laid off for the second 
time, this time from his job as a hydraulics technician for Sterer Engineering 
in Burbank, he took his horse to have it shod. While that was happening, he had 
a minor epiphany. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was observing the shoers," he said. "They were working and I wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 He toiled away at a few more $5-an-hour jobs -- in a futile wait for the 
aerospace industry to cease mourning the Cold War's end -- before making up his 
mind and heading East, to Bud and Kathie Beaston's Oklahoma Farrier College 
outside the one-horse, four-stoplight town of Sperry. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wanna learn how to shoe horses, that's the place to go," Roth said 
Thursday afternoon, pounding a shoe across an anvil and into shape at Bar S 
Stables in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had "helped a guy pull a shoe once" and did own a horse, the 
lifelong Angeleno admitted to being a bit green upon his arrival at Bud and 
Kathie's. They considered him a West Coast urbanite, likely to know more about 
palm trees than haystacks. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent seven months learning "the second-oldest profession," which, 
according to a dusty text he keeps in a shed at Bar S, began not long after 
horses were first domesticated around 3000 BC. Then, the Persians and Egyptians 
began protecting their war horses' battered hoofs by swathing them in grass and 
reeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, on a good day, he can service seven or eight horses -- cleaning and 
trimming, filing and custom-fitting everything from aluminum jumping shoes to 
iron flat shoes. It's backbreaking work, most often performed under a merciless 
Southern California sun, and brings in $55 or $60 per horse. 
</P>
<P>
 So why would a city dweller with $60,000-dollar-a-year experience in guided 
missile and satellite technology become a farrier? 
</P>
<P>
 Hunching over to file smooth the hoof of a restless mixed breed named Smiling 
Ed, Roth attempted to explain. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, he likes the creatures -- "some better than others," he said, 
and Smiling Ed here isn't exactly a favorite -- and he prefers working outside 
even on a hot day such as this one. But more than that, when he was unemployed, 
shoeing appeared to him a profession, "an art," that had little to fear from 
the political turbulence that brought his employer and himself to their knees. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Los Angeles, where horses may wear out their shoes trotting across 
movie lots instead of across the range, they need to be shod. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could call it job security," he said. "All the guys I knew that 
were shoeing horses . . . are still shoeing."

CSUN PUSHES FOR LIBRARY REOPENING IN THE FALL; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS FEAR EXODUS 
OF STUDENTS AND FACULTY IF QUAKE-DAMAGED OVIATT FACILITY IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR 
START OF CLASSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fearing that the lack of a permanent library might trigger an exodus of 
students and faculty, Cal State Northridge officials have decided to push to 
reopen the university's earthquake-damaged Oviatt Library this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is a switch from a decision made in May when officials said they 
would replace temporary on-campus library facilities with a warehouse-type, 
tilt-up concrete structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The tilt-up structure would have cost about $4 million to build, about half 
the cost of reopening Oviatt, said Doug Davis, CSUN's associate dean of 
libraries. It would have held only about one-quarter of Oviatt's collection, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got to the point where we could fully analyze everything, we realized 
(reopening Oviatt) was a far superior solution," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Construction is under way to make about 60% of Oviatt usable by Aug. 29, the 
first day of fall semester classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to cost about $7 million, CSUN spokesman Mike 
Hammerschmidt said. About 90% of the cost will be covered by a grant from the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency. The balance will be paid with tax money 
from previous bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The work includes structural repairs to the 220,000-square-foot Oviatt Library 
and consolidating all of its 1.1 million volumes into the original 
130,000-square-foot center of the building.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the quake damage was to the two newer wings of Oviatt, CSUN's only 
on-campus library. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bit of a squeeze, but a huge improvement over what we had in the 
spring," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that it may still be two years or more before the entire 
library is usable. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's enrollment had already been slipping when the Jan. 17 temblor heavily 
damaged the campus, and officials were concerned that the lack of a permanent 
library would prompt some of the university's more than 25,000 students and 
faculty members to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Oviatt's collection of books and reference materials is now housed in two 
emergency facilities on campus -- a 15,000-square-foot hall known as the North 
Annex and the 13,000-square-foot Lindley dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Both facilities will continue to be used this fall for some library activities 
and study space, Davis said. Another dome will also be built next to Lindley 
dome, providing additional study space.  
</P>
<P>
 The university also had established a shuttle service for students and faculty 
to use the UCLA library in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the decision to reopen Oviatt came at a meeting between CSUN's top 
administrators, faculty representatives and the university's consulting 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge campus incurred an estimated $350 million in quake-related 
damage.

EXTRADITION HEARING SET IN KIDNAPING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man suspected of kidnaping and sexually assaulting a Val Verde real estate 
agent is likely to be transferred from Utah, where he was apprehended, to Los 
Angeles to face federal charges, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Daniel Shue, 38, will appear in federal court in Salt Lake City today 
where he will have the opportunity to challenge efforts to extradite him to 
California, said his court-appointed attorney, Reid Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
 If Shue resists, prosecutors seeking extradition would have to convince a 
federal judge or grand jury that there is probable cause he committed the 
kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert, who had not met with Shue as of Thursday afternoon, was not 
optimistic his client would prevail in an extradition hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate one way or another he'll be back in California," Lambert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue, a resident of Cadillac, Mich., faces life in prison without parole if 
convicted of kidnaping Paula Harrington, 26, from Val Verde on June 29 by 
posing as a prospective home buyer, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Debra Yang in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was found tied up in a motel room three days later in Gila Bend, 
Ariz., a small town 68 miles southwest of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue is the suspect in several similar cases, including the kidnaping, rape 
and robbery of at least four women in the Midwest this year. He is also the 
suspect in an assault on a Medford, Ore., woman on June 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials want Shue brought to Los Angeles for prosecution because the 
alleged abduction of Harrington "is the most recent episode on his part as far 
as the witnesses and evidence," Yang said. "For us it's all fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said that although extradition to California is likely, its not 
guaranteed because Shue faces federal charges for fraud and unlawful flight in 
Michigan. Several state and county law enforcement agencies also intend to 
pursue charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be one of those situations where he may well go from 
jurisdiction to jurisdiction," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Paul Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 If a federal judge orders the extradition and Shue does not challenge the 
ruling, he could be brought to California by next week, Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue was arrested about 2 a.m. Wednesday when he allegedly displayed a handgun 
to a dancer in a topless club in Ogden, Utah, said FBI spokesman Jack Callahan. 
</P>
<P>
 He was paroled from a Michigan state prison in July, 1993, following a 
conviction for armed robbery.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; CBS WILL REQUEST VARIANCE TO EXPAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS will ask the city for permission to embark on a major expansion of its 
studio facilities at a zoning hearing today.  
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the television network wants permission to build seven sound 
stages on residentially zoned land and to build above height limits on Radford 
Avenue in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 The 245,000-square-foot project includes dressing rooms, storage areas, 
production support areas and 1,202 parking spaces. The CBS proposal also 
includes a bridge over the Los Angeles River to connect the existing and new 
lots. Network officials predicted the expansion would create 800 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will be at 9:30 a.m. at the Sherman Oaks Women's Club, 4808 Kester 
Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 sound stages at CBS Studio Center are at capacity, according to the 
network. Among the shows produced on the lot are "Seinfeld," "Roseanne" and 
"Dave's World." 
</P>
<P>
 The studio center is on 30 acres bounded by the Los Angeles River to the 
north, Colfax Avenue to the east, the alley behind Ventura Boulevard to the 
south and Radford Avenue to the west.  
</P>
<P>
 CBS proposes building on 11.5 acres of property across the river on land being 
used for parking and truck storage. 
</P>
<P>
 The network has met with the Studio City Residents Assn. to present its plans 
and sound out concerns.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our concerns are about traffic and about the visual impact of the project," 
said association President Tony Lucente. "How high are the buildings? Are they 
going to be visible from surrounding residential areas? How much additional 
traffic will be generated by this project? And how are they going to deal with 
those increases?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lucente added that he feels confident that CBS will address neighbors' 
concerns. KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CINEMA ZONE IDEA DRAWS CITY'S INTEREST 
</P>

<P>
 The Glendale City Council asked for more information from city staff this week 
about a proposed cinema zone that would allow movie theaters to be located only 
along the Brand Boulevard corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager David Ramsay said the council will receive a report at its July 
19 meeting on a proposed moratorium on cinemas and the results of a survey of 
cinema owners conducted to gauge their interest in the zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsay said the city is interested in designating a cinema zone to revitalize 
the city's downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often cities have found theaters to be a catalyst to facilitate a lot of good 
things happening," Ramsay said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cinema zone concept emerged from discussions between the Redevelopment 
Agency and city consultants about how to create a "24-hour downtown" in 
Glendale, said Jeanne Armstrong, director of redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move to draw more people into the downtown area, the city's economic 
adviser, Keyser Marston Associates Inc., recommended that officials modify 
zoning requirements to allow movie complexes only along Brand Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Glendale currently has two theater complexes and a total of 12 
screens, they are not close together, eliminating the "critical mass" needed to 
draw patrons to the area, Keyser Marston representative Dick Botti wrote in a 
letter to the agency. Multi-screen cinemas can help revitalize sagging retail 
centers, Botti said, citing Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade and 
Pasadena's Old Town, two thriving areas that were "virtually devoid of any 
retail activity" until theaters opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Patronage at restaurants in Burbank jumped 25% after an AMC theater was 
expanded from 10 to 14 screens, according to Keyser Marston figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Although council members approve of the cinema zone concept, they questioned 
the Krikorian cinema proposed for the third floor of the former Robinson's 
department store. The theater would be on Wilson Avenue, about three blocks 
from Brand Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsay said his report to the council will include an update on the Krikorian 
proposal. JENNIFER OLDHAM

 The Media City Center mall in Burbank banned all indoor smoking this week, the 
last major shopping center in the San Fernando Valley to impose such a 
restriction. 
</P>
<P>
 Lighting up has been prohibited at the Fallbrook Mall, Northridge Fashion 
Center, Sherman Oaks Galleria, the Promenade at Woodland Hills, Topanga Plaza 
and, more recently, at the Glendale Galleria and Sherman Oaks Fashion Square. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban at the Burbank mall took effect Tuesday and restricts smoking to

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; FUND-RAISING DRIVE STARTED FOR LIBRARY

<P>
 Bracing for expected budget cutbacks, the manager of the Los Angeles County 
Library branch in San Fernando has started a fund-raising campaign in which she 
has been "hitting the streets" for donations and trying to resurrect a support 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need some grass-roots support," said library Manager Judith Babka, who 
came to the San Fernando City Council meeting Tuesday night to sell T-shirts 
and buttons as part of the fund-raising effort.Several city officials bought 
shirts or buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 County budget cuts last year forced the library to cut the days it is open 
from six to three and the number of hours a week from 48 to 21. The library is 
open Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Babka said she is expecting more cuts soon. She has raised more than $900 in 
the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she hopes to bring back the Friends of the San Fernando Library, a 
community support organization started in 1979 that has been inactive since the 
mid-1980s. The first meeting of the new group is scheduled at 9 a.m. Saturday 
at the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of the Library raises money for children's programming, equipment and 
other library projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Babka said she hopes that such a group will give feedback to the library. "I 
need to know what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 The library has a collection of 30,000 materials. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; COUNCIL TO LET VOTERS DECIDE PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rather than approve cost-of-living salary increases for themselves, San 
Fernando City Council members decided in a 3-2 vote to let voters decide. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting two weeks ago, Councilman Raul Godinez suggested that council 
members receive raises on the condition that the money be diverted to 
recreation programs.The council gave its tentative approval to that idea. But 
Tuesday, Councilwoman Joanne Baltierez came out strongly against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I've been on the council long enough to deserve a pay raise," 
said Baltierez, who with Godinez was elected in April. "We should put it on the 
ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 Godinez countered that he was not asking for the raise for current council 
members, but for those who serve in the future. He said earlier that the 
council has had only two raises since 1980 -- a 34% raise in 1986 and a 5% 
raise in 1988. Council members now are paid $378 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltierez said the council does not deserve the pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a merit raise, but a cost-of-living raise," Godinez said. "That's 
all it is, to keep the position current with inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 He had argued that the council raises would take the burden off of those who 
would seek a seat on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pledge not to take any of the money for myself," Godinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a 3-2 vote the council decided to put the issue on the next local 
ballot election in April, 1996. Godinez and Councilwoman Rosa Chacon voted 
against the action. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; PUBLIC INVITED TO REHAB GRADUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 People hoping to help someone who suffers from drug or alcohol dependency are 
invited to a graduation and picnic Sunday for students of a Van Nuys recovery 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, hosted by the Inter-Agency Drug Abuse Recovery Programs, will allow 
the public to ask questions about recovery from chemical dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows somebody who is chemically addicted," said Kathie Mathis, the 
organization's program director. "One addict affects a minimum of 50 other 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 A barbecue, softball game and live band will entertain throughout the event, 
which runs from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Reseda Park, at the corner of Victory and 
Reseda boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit agency will graduate 17 clients at 11 a.m. Mathis said the 
agency, which has offices in Van Nuys and Newhall, treats about 200 clients 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only do we provide services for the addict, we provide services for the 
family members, friends and loved ones," Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost for the four- to seven-month outpatient treatment program is done on a 
sliding scale, Mathis said. Chemically dependent clients can receive clinical 
assessment, counseling, drug testing and other services from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A donation of $5 per person for the picnic is requested. JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MILLIKAN TEENS LEARNING FROM SUMMER JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sandpaper, power drills and paintbrushes they wield look ordinary, but the 
15 Millikan Middle School students sprucing up their campus this summer are 
actually toiling in the experimental. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the Summer Youth Employment Program run by the Los Angeles Unified 
School District and the city of Los Angeles, Millikan and four other campuses 
in the district are testing a work-based learning program that teaches 
real-world skills to at-risk and low-income teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 200 hours this summer, the students at Millikan will pour concrete benches, 
build 85 classroom podiums, fix sprinkler systems and repair plaster cracks 
from the Northridge earthquake. For $5.47 an hour, they will paint classroom 
doors, repair leaky sinks and make wooden hall passes for the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this I would be staying home, doing nothing," said 16-year-old Avetiz 
Alepyan after sanding a wooden hall pass. "Now, I can stay out of trouble, stay 
off the streets and get paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the majority of the district's 125 summer offerings, the work-based 
learning program integrates job training with other subjects. For example, 
mixing concrete doubles as a mathematics lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't just want people to be cleaning the campus and leaving with no 
skills," said Millikan Assistant Principal Norman Isaacs. "My hope is these 
kids will have an understanding of the reason they are in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the district's push to beef up its summer work programs is a 
$300-million federal School-to-Work Transition Act passed this year, aimed at 
blending school work with work skills. 
</P>
<P>
 But funding for the current work-based programs comes out of the district's 
regular summer youth programs that are already funded with $500,000 in city and 
federal funds. In addition, San Fernando Valley community organizations 
assisted Millikan administrators with the cost of busing and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 James Konantz, the school district's director of career development, said the 
need for such programs is greater than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work force is changing," he said. "Students need to understand the 
structure of the new system and see the relevancy of what they learn in 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd Jones, who is teaching the Millikan program, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the things they learn in school are not always applicable to their 
jobs," he said. "I hope they are going to learn some basic work ethics like 
showing up on time and having a good attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeping the shop room floor after her second day on the job, 15-year-old 
Yunea Cruz said she wanted to sign up as soon as she heard about the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to baby-sit this summer," Cruz said. "But I wanted to learn 
something else." SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; LIBRARY BRANCH TO REOPEN MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The dangling lights have been reattached and the bookcases bolted to the 
floor, and the Northridge branch of the Los Angeles Public Library will reopen 
for business Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaken by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, the library at 9051 Darby Ave. 
has been closed nearly six months as crews completed $110,000 worth of repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage was mostly cosmetic," senior librarian Lina Daukas said, with 
light fixtures shaken from ceilings and cracks splitting the walls, but no 
structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The falling lights could have impaled patrons, had any been in the building 
when the early morning temblor hit, Daukas said. So the fixtures have been 
recessed into the ceilings.  
</P>
<P>
 For workers at the library, the temblor brought building improvements they had 
sought for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been repainted after 20 years and we now have carpeting," Daukas 
chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
 Library hours will be 12:30 to 8 p.m. Mondays and Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:30 
p.m. Tuesdays and Saturdays and 12:30 to 5:30 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays. ERIC

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; PLAN FOR ADVERTISING ON FREEWAY REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Senate Transportation Committee has rejected a bill that would have 
allowed businesses in Agoura Hills to place their logos on special signs along 
the Ventura Freeway as a possible test case for cities statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee voted 6 to 3 against the bill Tuesday, with two members 
abstaining, effectively killing a bill that Agoura Hills officials hoped would 
give them a chance to try a type of advertisement used in most other states. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was opposed by the powerful billboard and sign lobbies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really outgunned," said Kelly Gould, senior consultant for 
Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Encino), who introduced the bill last year. "The 
sign industry was very busy, and there were a couple people who changed their 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
 As approved by the Assembly last year, the bill would have permitted freeway 
signs bearing commercial logos along three miles of the freeway in Agoura 
Hills, on a five-year trial basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat of the measure comes after voters in November overwhelmingly upheld 
an Agoura Hills law banning advertisements atop tall poles. That law, as well 
as the logo sign bill, was opposed by a handful of business owners in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners without pole-mounted signs along the freeway generally 
supported the logo sign idea, said Councilwoman Louise Rishoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of businesses in our city which do not have pole signs and 
now have been denied an opportunity to make themselves known to all that 
traffic on the 101 freeway," Rishoff said. "It's a real business loss to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, 10 merchants who have pole-mounted signs filed lawsuits against the 
city in an attempt to block the law banning them. A citizens group has 
responded by organizing a boycott against those businesses. KURT PITZER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS ORDERED FOR AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank Airport will conduct a structural analysis of its main terminal to 
comply with a local seismic safety ordinance, officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport was given notice by the city of Burbank that it must complete a 
detailed engineering study by Aug. 1.The analysis is required for all 
non-reinforced masonry structures built before 1933. The airport's main 
terminal opened in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport spokesman Victor Gill said the airport has hired an engineering 
consultant to assist with the study, which will also outline plans to retrofit 
the building to seismic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the airport was first notified three years ago that it would have to 
perform a structural analysis, officials declined to do so, calling it an 
"unnecessary expenditure" for a facility soon to be demolished for a new 
terminal. However, last month the city told the airport it would have to 
comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have agreed to conduct the analysis, airport officials note that 
the terminal has been strengthened in past years and that the building suffered 
no damage in the Northridge earthquake. Officials estimate that retrofitting 
the building could cost millions of dollars. HENRY CHU

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: YAROSLAVSKY SEEKS GARAGE SALE LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a complaint about garage sales at multi-unit buildings, Los 
Angeles Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky recommended this week that the city draft an 
ordinance limiting the number of garage sales in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Yaroslavsky's proposal, no more than three days of sales would be 
allowed within a six-month period at each property and no more than two per 
seven-day period.A resident holding a garage sale would only be allowed to sell 
used items owned by that resident. The measure would prohibit the sale of new 
items or items owned by someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, to be considered in about two weeks by the council's Planning 
and Land Use Committee, would amend a garage sale ordinance proposed in 1989 by 
Councilman John Ferraro and approved by the city's Planning Commission in May. 
The City Council has yet to approve the Ferraro motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Alisa Katz, Yaroslavsky's chief deputy, said the Ferraro ordinance is "too 
loosely worded" and would allow for dozens of garage sales at multi-unit 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's proposal was prompted, Katz said, by a complaint from a resident 
of a North Hollywood apartment complex who said residents in her building had 
numerous garage sales, creating traffic, parking and litter problems in the 
neighborhood. HUGO MARTIN

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SUPERVISORS OK SHOPPING CENTER; DEVELOPMENT: 
THE MALL WOULD BE THE LARGEST IN THE SANTA CLARITA VALLEY. LOCAL OFFICIALS 
OPPOSE THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans for the Santa Clarita Valley's largest shopping center were approved 
Thursday by a 5-0 vote of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia Marketplace is to be located west of Santa Clarita, between McBean 
Parkway and Pico Canyon Road. The plans call for it to include 830,000 square 
feet of retail space, including department stores, large discount stores and 
about 35 smaller retail shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Riley/Pearlman/Mitchell Co. of Brentwood projected that the new mall 
would generate at least $1.6 million in annual tax revenue for Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 In documents submitted to the board, the developer also said the mall will 
provide 2,144 jobs. Construction could be completed, the developer said, as 
early as October, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's existing regional mall, the Valencia Town Center, opened in 
September, 1992, and is about 10% smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval of the Valencia Marketplace plans by the board was considered the 
last major hurdle for the project. The matter will be back before the board for 
final approval in a few weeks, but a rejection at that point in the process 
would be highly unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita City Council members and city planners opposed the project, 
saying it would create traffic and law enforcement problems and also take 
customers from local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sick," City Councilwoman Jan Heidt, who owns a small bookshop in Santa 
Clarita, said after hearing of the approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "When is there enough development? It's going to be the beginning of the end 
for small business." 
</P>
<P>
 Heidt earlier told county supervisors that 10 additional sheriff's deputies 
would be required to patrol the Valencia Marketplace because its easy freeway 
access and multiple ATMs could invite crime. No additional deputies were 
assigned to the center by the board, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors took no action on Santa Clarita's request for 80% of the center's 
tax revenue to offset the expected impact on roads and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really a part of the budget process rather than the planning process," 
said Don Culbertson, county supervising regional planner. "The board left that 
out of the equation now." 
</P>
<P>
 Also opposing Valencia Marketplace was an environmental group, the Santa 
Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment, whose leaders unsuccessfully 
argued for the preservation of a wildlife corridor on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 SCOPE leaders were further frustrated that Riley/Pearlman/Mitchell Co. will be 
allowed to cut down and replace 105 oak trees on the property, even though each 
tree removed will be replaced by two others. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, you can't make up for cutting down old oaks with planting little 
oaks," said Lynne Plambeck, SCOPE vice president.

 Hour after hour, detail after detail, crackpot theory after crackpot theory, 
wild goose chase after wild goose chase, it's live television coverage of the 
You Know What case. Welcome to . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The Dilemma Before the Crisis: Helluva Hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Switching on the set, we find our favorite newscast already in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Al: And that completes the latest recap of our recap. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Sue: Meanwhile, it's time for me to suppress laughter while 
breathlessly introducing our regular Simpson culture segment. Tonight, "O.J., 
O. Henry and J. Edgar Hoover: The Common Thread." 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Al: But first some inane breaking news. Our Chopper Lou is live over 
the Simpson estate where nothing is swiftly continuing to dramatically happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Chopper Lou: And we'll remain here for you exclusively as the story continues 
not to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Chopper Mel: And I'm now over Anchor Lou. I can see him waving to me as I wave 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Sue: If any of our viewers know of something not happening concerning 
this case we invite them to call our special "Nothing to Report" 900 line and 
tell us about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Al: As I try to stretch our meaningless babble to the next commercial 
break by introducing our Psychic Dr. Sally's nightly analysis of the vibrations 
surrounding the Downtown Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Sue: Which she'll undertake when we wake her up. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Al: While I try not to crack up laughing as our profusely sweating 
special consultant, Lawyer Lester, explains the nuances of this case that has 
him completely baffled. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Lester: I'd bet my mail-order degree on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Sue: And I'd bet that our mindless special O.J. fashion consultant, Mr. 
Bernard, has an opinion on courtroom wardrobes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Bernard: Marcia Clark, honey, cut it out with those miniskirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Al: And speaking of the deputy district attorney, I'll pretend I'm not 
getting a migraine while teasing our weeklong exclusive series: "'A Thousand 
Clarks." Coming up later tonight, "Marcia Clark and Petula Clark -- Singing a 
Different Tune." 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Sue: But first I'll try not to puke while announcing it's time for our 
regular O.J. round-table. Tonight's issue: "If O.J. Escapes." 
</P>
<P>
 Chopper Lou: If he did escape, and if he traveled the No. 10 Freeway, I'd be 
above him right now, exclusively following the route he'd be taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Chopper Mel: And I'd be over Chopper Lou. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Al: And Weatherman Ned, what kind of temps could O.J. expect if he 
chose to escape tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
 Weatherman Ned: Well, Al, if he wants to stay cool he'd better have his car 
air conditioner switched way up. And he'll be fleeing under party cloudy skies 
with a 10% chance of measurable precipitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Al: Uh oh. And if he wants to feel fresh? 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Bernard: I'd recommend soft and comfortable jersey shorts with a casual 
knit shirt underneath a rugged, machine-washable travel vest in 100% cotton 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Sue: Thank you, fools, for that illuminating discussion that affirms 
that we've all lost our marbles. Tomorrow night's round-table topic: "If 
Madonna and Michael Jackson Were to Marry, Would They Invite O.J. to the 
Wedding?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Bernard: And if he attended, what would be appropriate attire for him? 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Sue: A wedding consultant will be with us tomorrow to sort out the 
exclusive details. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Al: Meanwhile, I'll pretend to have all my faculties while announcing 
Part 3 of our series titled "Sh." Simpson defense attorney Robert Shapiro and 
actor Omar Sharif reportedly haven't met. But if they did meet, what would they 
talk about? To get a fresh perspective, we went to a shopping mall and asked 
people who have never heard of either of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Sue: But first, this just in. Chopper Lou is again circling the Simpson 
estate where nothing is continuing to happen with increased ferocity. 
</P>
<P>
 Chopper Lou: Yes, there is just no letup. I've never seen something not happen 
so relentlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Sue: Meanwhile, I'll try not to wet my pants while announcing that our 
special report comparing Brentwood, Hollywood, Westwood, Rosemary Woods and Bob 
Woodward will be coming up later preceded by our deranged probe of the non-link 
between O.J.'s white Bronco, Bronko Nagurski and the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Al: As I try not to notice the puddle under your chair while 
introducing our nightly O.J. "Discussion of a Sensitive Issue" by our lunatic 
staff. Tonight's searing topic: "A Dog's Plaintive Wail." 
</P>
<P>
 Weatherman Ned: You could say Moby Dick was a plaintive whale. 
</P>
<P>
 Chopper Mel: But a different animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Sue: Yet one also capable of feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Lester: And we all have to wonder how different things might have 
turned out had there been a whale at the murder site instead of a dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Sally: I sense that the neighbors would have complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Chopper Lou: And if those neighbors were Eskimos, would they have harpooned 
the whale? 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Sue: And if they did, wouldn't they be charged with animal cruelty? An 
Eskimo rights spokesman will be here to address that question tomorrow night. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Bernard: And if he's on the ball, he'll be wearing a fashionable linen 
blazer, fully lined and gently shaped with front darts. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Al: So many unpredictable twists to this story. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Sue: Meanwhile, it's time for me to say good night while ignoring that 
Dr. Sally is now comatose and Lawyer Lester and Weatherman Ned are playing gin 
rummy. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Al: And time for me to remind viewers inexplicably not appalled by us 
to tune in our tasteless 11 p.m. newscast when our O.J. coverage will include 
"The Score Card: Who's Winning?," "Here's What We Didn't Learn Today" and "What 
If a Giant Monster From the Center of the Earth Ate the Criminal Courts 
Building?" 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Sue: But first, this just in! Chopper Lou has relearned exclusively 
that nothing is happening at the Simpson estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Al: Or in this newscast.

 Does the world need any more jokes about bad haircuts, airplane food or 
7-Elevens? The answer, from a growing number of talented, offbeat stand-up 
comics, is an emphatic no. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as punk rockers gleefully gutted the excesses of arena rock, and as 
small, furry mammals celebrated the demise of the dinosaurs, the performers of 
the alternative comedy scene are happily deconstructing business-as-usual in 
the world of stand-up. Their aim is to revitalize the art of being funny. 
</P>
<P>
 The best stand-up comedy has always led to insight as well as laughter. But 
since the comedy boom of the '80s, many comedy clubs across the country have 
tended to value conventional acts over those deemed too heavy, personal, 
challenging or even verbal. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at upstart venues such as the Uncabaret, Hot Cup of Talk, Incognito and 
Think Tank, rule-bending performers have a respite from life on the road, and 
they're setting out to prove that audiences can have a great time thinking and 
laughing at the same time.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our motto is 'Good entertainment for a nasty world,' " says Beth Lapides, the 
gracious mistress of ceremonies at the Uncabaret. "For me, that means comedy 
that acknowledges that there's something wrong with the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
 The freewheeling Uncabaret has had a home since last October at LunaPark in 
West Hollywood, where standing-room-only crowds regularly pack the Sunday night 
shows. Quality comedy is the goal, but the shows unfold in a loose and 
irreverent fashion. Audience members may have their "Gripe of the Week" slips 
read by the hostess. They are also eligible for giveaway prizes, which have 
included old Monkees albums, plastic cake decorations and pages from Lapides' 
junior high school journal.  
</P>
<P>
 Comic stars such as Margaret Cho and Bobcat Goldthwait have taken the stage at 
the Uncabaret, but they must play by house rules. Polished material and 
character bits are frowned upon. Extemporaneous spleen-venting is encouraged. 
This leads to such inspired moments as Dana Gould and Andy Kindler's 
hilariously savage "Dueling Lenos" and Judy Toll's frenetic, channel-surfing 
re-enactment of scenes from "My Breast" and "The Joan and Melissa Rivers 
Story."  
</P>
<P>
 "The basic rule is that you need to be an original voice, and you can't do 
your regular club act," Lapides says. "We get a great mix of material, from the 
intensely personal to the extremely political. But it's definitely stand-up, 
and the point is to get the audience laughing. We're putting on a comedy show, 
not a therapy session."  
</P>
<P>
 "It may seem like the hot new thing," Gould says, "but it's really the old 
thing. This is what comedy clubs were like at the beginning, back in the '60s, 
when Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl and Shelly Berman were performing high-minded 
material for jazz aficionados. I'm still a big fan of regular comedy clubs, but 
I can do a set at the Uncabaret that kills, and at the Improv it just sits 
there. There's a different rhythm at these alternative comedy shows, and the 
audience feels more like a bunch of your friends. It's a great chance to graze 
with your own herd."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so jokey, jokey, jokey," Kindler says. "We're in the middle ground 
between Spalding Gray and the Catskills."  
</P>
<P>
 Toll was one of the first performers to support the Uncabaret, and she 
continues to cherish the opportunity to work there: "It's like a happy little 
mental institution. We're the underground team. The performers are really 
supportive of each other and that makes it so much more fun than anything 
else."  
</P>
<P>
 Comic Taylor Negron was ready to forgo stand-up to concentrate on writing and 
film work (he can be seen in the forthcoming "Angels in the Outfield"), but 
early Uncabaret shows changed his mind. "I'm very grateful for the Uncabaret. 
Comedy crowds have changed. They want loud. They want the Christians and the 
lions. Stand-up is very slight, and was never meant to be performed in a rock 
'n' roll environment. It's got to be performed in small rooms to people who 
want to be there -- not just a sea of dates in chairs killing time before 
intercourse."  
</P>
<P>
 An alternative approach to comedy is also taken at "Hot Cup of Talk," a 
stand-up show that ran Wednesday nights in June and will be returning Aug. 24 
for a four-week run at the Groundling Theatre in Hollywood. Performers there 
include Julia Sweeney of "Saturday Night Live" and "Reservoir Dogs" director 
Quentin Tarantino as well as many of the Uncabaret comics.  
</P>
<P>
 Groundling Kathy Griffin organizes the shows, at least partly to give herself 
a comfortable venue for performing. "I love doing stand-up, but I don't ever 
want to do it in a club again. I respect club comedians, but I can't do it. I 
tend to bomb big time. But these shows are less about jokes and more about 
presenting material that's honest and powerful. We stay away from stuff that 
begins 'Hey, I was at the gym today' or 'Hey, have you seen that commercial?' . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of comedy is beginning to show up in intimate, somewhat unlikely 
settings. Alternative stand-up is presented Saturday nights as part of Klub 
Uvula at the Variety Arts Center. And at the Lava Lounge in Hollywood, a free 
show is presented every Monday night. Offering an alternate take on sketch, 
character and improv comedy, Dave Rath of Messina/Baker Entertainment produces 
"Incognito" every Thursday at the Diamond Club in Hollywood. Wednesday nights 
in July the Diamond Club also presents spoken word and comedy performances 
called "Tantrum," hosted by Laura Milligan. And comic Karen Kilgariff brought a 
free Uncabaret-style show, "Think Tank," to the Union at UCLA this spring.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've done stand-up at airport Holiday Inns," Kilgariff says, "and that's 
where you feel like you're doing comedy for people that hate it. At these shows 
the performers and the audience are equally excited about what's taking place." 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the alternative comedy scene is in that connection between comic 
and audience. Performers who might work up a flop sweat trying to entertain a 
random sampling of the public discover they can soar when playing to just the 
right mix of the hip, the smart and the maladjusted. 
</P>
<P>
 With 21 years of stand-up experience, Rick Overton has a keen appreciation for 
the sense of community and shared sensibilities at the Uncabaret. "My comedy 
has a kind of dimmer switch with a 'survival' setting -- on the road you just 
leave it on 3 and hate yourself on the walk home. Uncabaret is an oasis of 
'Hmm' in an ocean of 'Huh?' It's like taking a vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 Overton also thinks the performers of the alternative comedy scene may be part 
of a larger pop culture moment. "You hear about every era having a round-table 
of artists, and every art getting their version of that. Well, Generation X 
finally gets one and this is part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Kindler jokes that focus groups have determined his target audience to be 
"men, my age, who are me." But at the Uncabaret, he has found a receptive 
crowd. "I still feel comfortable at the Improv -- there's a respect for the 
process there. But the target audience I want is at the Uncabaret." 
</P>
<P>
 Kindler also hopes that the notion of "alternative" comedy doesn't scare 
anybody away. "People think, 'If it's alternative comedy it must not have much 
of an audience,' but that's so wrong. I think there's a huge audience out there 
looking for this kind of comedy. There's tremendous talent among this group of 
comics. We're stretching the form, but we still want to entertain and get the 
laugh. I may be an 'alternative comic,' but I'd have to admit I'm still a Don 
Rickles fan too."

THEATER REVIEW; DISCOVERING HIDDEN CORNERS IN 'TENNESSEE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 Irish playwright Brian Friel is great because he acknowledges the 
insufficiency of language. When the talking stops and his characters bow to the 
power of music -- or silence -- Friel's plays overflow with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1990 play "Dancing at Lughnasa," which just closed at the South Coast 
Rep, five sisters resigned to unending rural poverty come alive when a 
broken-down radio momentarily blasts out a danceable tune. Friel's 1993 play 
"Wonderful Tennessee," in its West Coast debut at the Old Globe, reveals that 
simple folk tunes and hymns contain a whole canon of profound emotions, even 
(or maybe particularly) when sung by six friends at 3 a.m. on a chilly stone 
pier with nothing but a humble accordion for accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry (George Deloy) has purchased an island off of a northwest Donegal pier, 
and his friends are waiting to have a look, but the ferryman -- Carlin -- never 
arrives. As with any gathering of friends in their 40s, this one is rife with 
enough problems to fill a soap opera script. Terry's wife, Berna (Robin Pearson 
Rose), is being treated for depression, probably because her husband is in love 
with her sister Angela (Deborah May), who is not only beautiful but, unlike 
Berna, fertile. Angela's husband, Frank (Tim Donoghue), is an academic resigned 
to what he regards as his unimportance and his wife's attraction to the 
charismatic Terry. Trish (Deborah Taylor) knows that her husband, accordion 
player George (Thomas S. Oleniacz), has only three months to live, so she 
endures his harsh rejections, even though to the others he is the sweetest of 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 What separates "Wonderful Tennessee" from "Days of Our Lives" is Friel's 
attention to the unexpected, hidden corners of these relationships. Under Craig 
Noel's sensitive and lucid direction, the ensemble forms a community as 
intricate and authentic (excepting the accents) as Dublin's Abbey Theater, the 
company for whom Friel writes and who performed the play on Broadway last year. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Rose is a heartbreakingly aware Berna, especially when she claims that her 
nephew has become frightened of her. Rose lets you see the cost of Berna's 
depression, what a pleasure this character could have been, almost was and 
never will be. When she sings a hymn: "O, Mother, I could weep for mirth/Joy 
fills my heart so fast . . ., " it is more a wish than a testament, and she is 
joined most fervently in her song by Angela, the very source of her problems. 
Friel meticulously respects the unexpected and illogical allegiances of 
melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor is an affecting Trish, a woman who loves to prompt the others to tell 
stories but who unconsciously rewrites her own tale. She recalls her wedding 
day, attributing the groom's lateness to his playing in a band. When Terry 
points out that George had in fact given up his band three weeks earlier to 
better support her, she crumbles, astounded at the insistence of her own false 
memory and her husband's sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 Friel strips the story bare by stranding his characters on the pier overnight. 
The elusive island in the foggy distance stands for the state of being almost 
happy that Berna believes is man's eternal fate. The food in their hamper is 
ridiculously exotic (brandied peaches and Romanian truffles), but it doesn't 
fulfill their basic needs, just as the island will never change their lives in 
any concrete way. The warmth of their community -- despite its intrigue -- is a 
gathering against the coming cold of night, and the imminent death of their 
friend George. In Oleniacz's moving portrait, George's deep sadness is evoked 
through his accordion playing; his poor bandaged throat hardly scratches out 
the few words he can manage.  
</P>
<P>
 When Friel's characters attempt to express their feelings, poetry rises from 
his words like the fog from set designer Greg Lucas' appropriately inhospitable 
stone pier. But just as often they are driven by the need for ceremony that 
haunts much of Friel's work. A passing-the-time game with stones turns 
organically into a rite of prayer. A life-preserver stand in the form of a 
wooden cross becomes -- without a word from anyone -- a shrine on which the 
characters hang pieces of their clothing to mark the time they've spent there, 
and, more importantly, the emotions they've felt there. When Terry refuses to 
leave his shirt, the others turn on him with the savagery of the children in 
"Lord of the Flies" -- their behavior just as inexplicable and also as 
strangely understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wonderful Tennessee" is somewhat less dramatic than its plot might imply. The 
emotional underpinnings take time to establish, and, likewise, the epiphanies 
take time to unfold. This play requires patience, and a love for, and 
familiarity with Friel's work doesn't hurt either. But the payoff is a deep, if 
melancholy, evening that is, ironically, a writer's recognition of the need to 
mark our passage with something other than words. 
</P>

STAGEHANDS MAY PICKET 'THREE TENORS' CONCERT; LABOR: KEY ISSUE IS UNION WAGES 
FOR WORKERS AT THE JULY 16 DODGER STADIUM EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A labor dispute between the local stagehands union and producers of "Encore! 
The Three Tenors" concert at Dodger Stadium may result in a picket line 
greeting the expected sold-out audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, set for July 16, the evening before the World Cup championship 
soccer match, features world-class tenors Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and 
Luciano Pavarotti, with Zubin Mehta conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Local 33 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage 
Employees are concerned that the concert producers may hire stagehands at 
non-union wages to work alongside stagehands working under an agreement between 
the union and the Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Union attorneys faxed a three-page letter to "Tenors" impresario Tibor Rudas 
on Tuesday informing him of "certain problems" between IATSE and Rudas 
representatives, to tell him of existing collective-bargaining agreements 
covering stagehand work for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and to ask what Rudas 
plans to pay additional stagehands at the Dodger Stadium event. 
</P>
<P>
 Local 33 Business Representative John F. Beringhele has for several weeks been 
attempting to work out an agreement to cover wages, hours and other conditions 
for the staging of the event, says attorney Bob Cantore. 
</P>
<P>
 If the union finds that wages and benefits being paid stagehands are less than 
would be the case by union standards, Cantore says, "the union will peacefully 
picket and inform the public through leaflets that they have paid up to $1,000 
for tickets and the producer is then paying substandard wages with all of that 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 The stagehands union, which has 1,200 members in Los Angeles County, has done 
other concert work at Dodger Stadium, Cantore says, as well as when singers 
Carreras and Domingo appeared at the Greek Theatre and Music Center Opera, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Philharmonic is proceeding with respect to this performance 
just as it does in respect to others done away from the Music Center complex 
and Hollywood Bowl, says Dennis Vaughn, the lawyer representing the 
Philharmonic in this matter. The orchestra "is employing stagehands in a normal 
fashion, under the collective-bargaining agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn confirmed that he had spoken with IATSE attorney Cantore, however. "We 
discussed our respective positions about the union's claims about work at the 
performance. Naturally, the Philharmonic wants and expects to see the show go 
forward on a normal and undisturbed basis. Certainly we don't believe that the 
picketing activity should be conducted, and have so advised the union." 
</P>
<P>
 The IATSE board will take all this under consideration at a Tuesday board 
meeting, Cantore says, and he agreed to let Vaughn know their decision then, if 
not sooner. "We have a longstanding relationship with the Philharmonic," 
Cantore says. "It was never our intent to put them in the middle of the thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about demands made by Local 33, "Tenors" concert general manager Wayne 
Baruch would say only the following: "We are following all normal and legal 
procedures and producing the show according to the highest possible standards." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody at the Rudas Organization will discuss expected concert income, but 
reliable sources estimate it could gross $12.5 million to $15 million should it 
sell out. More than 40,000 seats at $15 to $150 reportedly sold out long ago, 
but an undisclosed number of tickets at $300 and up are still on the market. 
Baruch would say only that "very few" tickets remained for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket sales were apparently also an issue in the cancellation of Elizabeth 
Taylor's post-concert supper to raise funds for AIDS-related services. The 
actress sent a fax to The Times saying that she "did not realize" the face 
value of each concert ticket would not reach her foundation. Taylor's 
foundation had been offering packages ranging from $2,500 to $5,000, which 
included concert and dinner tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Baruch declined to comment, saying he had not seen Taylor's fax.

IT'S STILL A RIDDLE WHY KEATON DIDN'T STAY 'BATMAN FOREVER'; MOVIES: DISPUTES 
OVER MONEY AND ARTISTIC CONTROL ARE REPORTEDLY THE REASONS FOR THE STAR NOT 
RETURNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Riddle me this, Bat-fans: Who really pulled the mask off Michael Keaton's 
plans to don the cape a third time in "Batman Forever"? And who were among the 
ready to jump in his boots as the dual persona? 
</P>
<P>
 The second question has a shorter answer: Val Kilmer, Kurt Russell and Billy 
Baldwin. While Warner Bros. sources say Kilmer was always the first pick on the 
short list after Keaton bowed out, others close to the project say Russell was 
a long-shot favorite as well. Baldwin, younger brother to Alec, had become an 
afterthought since he wasn't old enough to play mentor to sidekick Chris 
O'Donnell's Robin. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilmer, whose breakthrough film was the 1986 "Top Gun" and who played Jim 
Morrison five years later in Oliver Stone's "The Doors," grabbed director Joel 
Schumacher's attention for his recent portrayal as the tubercular Doc Holliday 
and sidekick to Russell's Wyatt Earp in the box-office success "Tombstone."  
</P>
<P>
 "Val was my first and only choice (after Keaton)," Schumacher said. "People 
always assumed Michael was doing the movie but he didn't have a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So thrilled with Warner Bros.' expectations for Kilmer, the studio has already 
signed him to appear in future sequels as the dark knight. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Keaton's bailout, the actor and Schumacher reportedly just didn't see 
eye to eye on the quality of screen time millionaire Bruce Wayne and his alter 
ego Batman were getting in this third take on the Gotham City hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher would only say: "Michael had contractual and financial lifestyle 
considerations as well as some artistic considerations that Warner Bros. and I 
had to consider. We also had the time to consider other possibilities. 
Hopefully this will be a fresh start for Michael and for 'Batman.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some studio and project sources said early on the actor complained he wasn't 
getting enough money. He reportedly expected to receive $15 million for the 
role, plus a percentage of the gross box-office receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 The money talk started when Warners passed on Robin Williams to play the 
Riddler in favor of Jim Carrey, who exhibitors were pushing, extolling Carrey's 
performance in the upcoming "The Mask." 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, rumors surfaced that Keaton was miffed that his co-stars would 
not only upstage Batman on screen but on payroll as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But those close to the actor insist Keaton did not forgo the role for money. 
They say Keaton was promised and felt he deserved and had earned the right to 
have some say over Batman's story the third time around. In the two previous 
films, the villains -- Jack Nicholson's Joker ("Batman") and Michelle 
Pfeiffer's Catwoman ("Batman Returns") -- were always the draw and, in the 
words of one Warners' source, "Batman could have been anybody in a mask." 
</P>
<P>
 In the words of a Keaton source, "Michael wanted to breathe more life into the 
Batman character. This wasn't a matter of ego. It was a matter of making the 
story better and the character more interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Studio sources say Keaton complained about the amount of screen time given to 
his co-star villains, Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey "Two Face" Dent and Carrey as 
the Riddler. 
</P>
<P>
 But Keaton's camp say those rumblings are ridiculous, that he was committed to 
do the role. He reportedly became disenchanted after a meeting with Warners 
executives failed to materialize. The purpose of the meeting was to allow 
Keaton the chance to express his ideas for Batman's role. Later there was a 
meeting with Schumacher that afforded him that opportunity but proved 
fruitless, Keaton sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Keaton's prepared statement dodged his decision to dodge Batman for a third 
time, but wished Warners well on another sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 And one more Bat-note: Rene Russo is still Schumacher's top choice to play the 
love interest in "Batman Forever," but a schedule conflict may bump the "In the 
Line of Fire" co-star. 
</P>
<P>
 If things don't work out with Russo, the top contenders are said to be Jeanne 
Tripplehorn ("The Firm") and Linda Hamilton ("Terminator").

'FORREST GUMP' OFF TO FAST START AT BOX OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Hanks' character Forrest Gump may not be the brightest of fellows, but the 
movie "Forrest Gump" looks to be the brightest hit in the market this week, 
based on a remarkable Wednesday opening estimated box-office gross of $4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar amount represented 26% of all movie business on Wednesday, with the 
romantic comedy showing broad appeal in all markets, whether upscale or blue 
collar, urban or suburban, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Gump's" apparent appeal holds, some analysts not associated with the 
Paramount Pictures release are predicting a Friday-Sunday gross topping $20 
million. That would make "Gump" the third highest summer opening weekend, 
behind only $40.9 million for "The Lion King" and $37.2 million for "The 
Flintstones." Such other summer hits as "Wolf," "Speed," "Maverick" and "The 
Shadow" each had opening weekend business that was less than $18 million. 
"Gump" is also the only major release opening this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phenomenal thing about the gross is that the film did one-quarter of all 
the business in North America for Wednesday in one of the most congested 
marketplaces anyone can remember," said Barry London, Paramount's president of 
worldwide distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 London said Wednesday's $4 million was achieved with 1,332 prints in the 
market and despite a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes, which reduces the 
number of daily showings from five to four. On Friday, London said Paramount 
will boost the number of prints to about 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 The film was considered a "tough sell" because of the central character's 
quirkiness. London said the studio got around that by using a number of 
different approaches, including extensive TV pitches and a print campaign that 
plays up the popular Hanks, for whom this is the first film since his 
Oscar-winning role in the AIDS drama "Philadelphia." The simple campaign said 
"Hanks. Gump. July 6." Last summer, Hanks starred in the hit comedy "Sleepless 
in Seattle." 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, written by Eric Roth who adapted from the novel by Winston Groom, 
Hanks plays a simpleton with winning generosity and optimism. Robert Zemeckis 
directed.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: REALTY COMPANY CHARGING CLIENTS $250 
'SERVICES FEE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing increased costs, Jon Douglas Co. has begun charging real estate clients 
a $250 "professional services fee" on top of agents' usual commission. It is 
believed to be the first time a brokerage in Southern California has levied 
fees on clients.  
</P>
<P>
 The company said it is imposing the fee regardless of whether a client is 
buying a property or selling one. In real estate transactions, only the seller 
pays a commission, typically 6% of the sales price. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills-based brokerage said it expects competitors to follow its 
move. However, one rival brokerage said it has no intention of doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having trouble with the idea of hitting a buyer for $250 when interest 
rates are up a bit," said Fred Sands, president of Fred Sands Co. of West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee signals that although the real estate market has picked up somewhat, 
brokers are still having a tough time. Prices remain below the peaks of five 
years ago, meaning brokerages make less money than they used to on each 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Douglas said the fee will help cover the cost of improving its technology 
and services offered to clients. The company said the fee replaces a 5% 
transaction charge levied on agents to help cover overhead. Other brokerages 
charge their agents similar fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Piatt, executive vice president of Jon Douglas, said no customers have 
balked at paying the fee since it was instituted two weeks ago. He said the fee 
is insignificant compared to the price of a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently Douglas agents having good luck with tips contained in a booklet 
Jon Douglas distributed to them when it announced the fee. In the booklet, 
titled "Agents' Guide to Professional Services Fee," agents are advised how to 
handle client objections. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are trained to sell, and we expect you to get the professional services 
fee from the client. . . ," the booklet says. "Compare this fee to all the 
other fees associated with a closing: escrow fees, title fees, loan processing 
fees, appraisal fees, etc." 
</P>
<P>
 Agents are also told not to worry about losing clients to brokerages that 
don't levy fees. Competitors "will most likely introduce their own professional 
services fee as soon as we've shown the way," the guide says. "We feel that 
clients will simply take the fee in stride." 
</P>
<P>
 Agents are cautioned that they will be required to pay the fee if the client 
refuses to do so.

 When the cat gets out: The case of the missing cat aboard a Tower Air jetliner 
offers a reminder that airlines treat lost pets as baggage claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 3-year-old Tabitha apparently escaped from her cage in the plane's 
cargo hold and disappeared into a space that separates a storage compartment 
from the fuselage. Owner Carol Ann Timmel of Beverly Hills could not persuade 
Tower Air to ground the plane until Tabitha could be found. The airline did 
allow the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to set 
traps for the cat. 
</P>
<P>
 The cat has not turned up. Timmel has little recourse but to file a 
lost-baggage claim. Travelers who lose pets are compensated for what the pet is 
worth, up to a maximum of $1,250. 
</P>
<P>
 The airlines say about 500,000 pets travel each year and that few are lost. 
The Transportation Department does not track missing-pet reports, but it said 
it has received one consumer complaint about a missing pet during the first 
five months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers with very small pets can keep an eye on them when flying. According 
to the Air Transport Assn., an industry group, most airlines permit travelers 
to stow pets under cabin seats if the cages are small enough, although 
arrangements must usually be made in advance.

 The bear facts: A Pasadena company has redesigned its bear-shaped honey 
bottles to make room for a new nutrition label. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack's Honey Bee Products is hoping the labels will give its products an edge 
over competing brands. As reported here in May, honey packagers using 
bear-shaped bottles are exempt from the government's new nutrition labeling 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The new labels are required for most foods and contain information about 
calories, fat, sodium, carbohydrates and certain other nutrients.  
</P>
<P>
 Jack's Honey President C. Byron Capps doesn't think consumers will be deterred 
by the revelation that honey contains 60 calories per tablespoon -- more than 
sugar. Capps points out that the nutrition label also tells consumers that 
honey contains no fat. "That's what people really care about," he said.

CYBERSPACE COPYRIGHT PROPOSAL DRAWS PRAISE; TECHNOLOGY: THE ADMINISTRATION'S 
DRAFT WOULD EXTEND PROTECTION TO ON-LINE SERVICES AND DIGITAL BROADCASTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Endorsing a first, tentative step toward modernizing the nation's intellectual 
property laws, the entertainment and information industries today welcomed a 
draft recommendation from the Clinton Administration on extending copyright law 
to cover on-line services and other corners of cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 Record companies, film studios and book publishers have been increasingly 
concerned about illegal copies of musical recordings and texts being exchanged 
over electronic networks. And the broader question of how to protect 
intellectual property amid a sea of technology that makes copying easy and 
cheap has become a critical issue for both creative artists and their corporate 
masters. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendments proposed by a Commerce Department task force would limit 
unauthorized copying of software and other intellectual property, making it 
clear that existing copyright protections applied to the electronic realm. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force also recommended outlawing the manufacture and importation of 
devices used to crack anti-copying encryption codes. And in a proposal that 
brought a swift rebuke from the broadcasting industry, it said copyright owners 
should be given a "performance right," which would enable musicians and other 
performers to collect fees for digital broadcasts of their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has done little with the nation's copyright laws in nearly 20 years, 
but the Administration plans to unveil legislation based on the task force 
recommendations later this year, after the Commerce Department holds a series 
of public hearings on the piracy problem. The hearings are to be held in 
Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Copyright laws already make clear that music, writing, software and other 
forms of creative expression can be legally protected, giving the owner an 
exclusive permit to reproduce and distribute the work. But when material such 
as books and recordings are posted on on-line services such as Prodigy or 
CompuServe -- where any computer user can gain access -- the law is murky. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry groups applauded the Administration's proposals but warned against 
widespread controls on data transmission. 
</P>
<P>
 "While some fine-tuning of current copyright law may be desirable, overall the 
Administration has made it clear that the laws governing the use, 
redistribution and manipulation of data should not be tampered with," Kenneth 
B. Allen, president of the Information Industry Assn., a Washington trade 
group, said in a statement. "Without our industry's products and services, the 
information superhighway will be an expressway to nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The Recording Industry Assn. of America, which represents Sony, PolyGram, MCA 
and other companies, said extending current copyright laws to cyberspace will 
prevent digital broadcasting firms from offering performances over cable 
television wires without compensating the artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report finally puts intellectual property protection four square" into 
the Administration's blueprint for a National Information Infrastructure, said 
Hilary Rosen, president of the recording industry group. Industry analysts have 
observed Internet users distributing snippets of Aerosmith and Nirvana songs 
without permission, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line services have said that responsibility for enforcing copyrights lies 
with the owner of a work, not the bulletin board on which it is posted. Some, 
like America Online, based in Mclean, Va., ask subscribers to agree not to 
redistribute copyrighted material and not to post such work on public forums, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed amendments could eventually force on-line services and computer 
users to pay fees each time they download or transfer text, graphics or other 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 If industry leaders are fearful of unauthorized copying and distribution, they 
will be less inclined to make their works available, said Bruce A. Lehman, who 
chaired the Commerce Department task force. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to ban anti-encryption equipment is likely to draw opposition 
from electronics manufacturers, who fought a long battle with the recording 
industry over new digital taping formats. The equipment vendors eventually 
agreed to a modest royalty on blank digital tapes and disks, as well as taping 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Home Recording Rights Coalition, an anti-royalty lobbying group led by 
electronics manufacturers, said in a statement that it is "reserving judgment" 
on the recommendations and will examine how they might "affect consumer access 
to and enjoyment of new electronics, information and entertainment products and 
services."

LOYALTY: CHECK IT OUT; SUPERMARKETS TRACK TOP PATRONS, REWARD THEM WITH CUSTOM 
DEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to stem massive customer defections, supermarkets are electronically 
tracking each shopper's purchases to tailor special deals for individual 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, supermarkets are shedding a longstanding reluctance to treat 
customers differently and are moving toward a tiered pricing system in which 
loyal shoppers pay less. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about different prices for different people," said Brian P. 
Woolf, president of the Retail Strategy Center of Greenville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the best customers at Snyder Foods in Oklahoma City get special 
"power coupons" with deep discounts not available to other shoppers. In 
Milwaukee, shoppers entering a Pick 'N' Save Mega-Food Center store receive a 
"shopping list" with deals tailored to them. Members of Vons' frequent-shopper 
club get breaks on dozens of grocery items. 
</P>
<P>
 Supermarket consultant Carlene Thissen predicts that within five years, 80% of 
the nation's supermarkets will offer frequent-shopper programs that give loyal 
shoppers better deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will become as common as scanning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grocers are embracing reward programs to win loyalty from often-fickle 
shoppers. The industry-sponsored Food Marketing Institute reports that a 
quarter of supermarket shoppers switch grocery stores each year, mostly to take 
advantage of bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for a better deal is also driving many shoppers to membership 
warehouses, discount stores and specialty shops such as Petco, the pet supply 
chain. According to Nielsen Marketing Research, a quarter of all grocery 
shopping is done at stores other than supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supermarkets are facing some pretty terrible competitive problems," said 
Thissen, president of Chicago-based Retail Consulting Systems. "They really 
need to do something to keep their customers." 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, Lucky, Ralphs, Alpha Beta and Food 4 Less are 
installing a system from Catalina Marketing of St. Petersburg, Fla., that scans 
purchases and sorts customers into such categories as "cherry pickers" or 
"high-potential shoppers" and dispenses coupons at the checkout. People who buy 
only advertised specials (cherry pickers) get different coupons than those who 
spend a lot but shop infrequently (high-potential shoppers). 
</P>
<P>
 Vons is testing an enhancement of its frequent-shopper program that would give 
customers special coupons and points that could be redeemed for jewelry, 
electronic equipment and other merchandise. The test is being conducted by 
Advanced Promotion Technologies of Pompano Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other supermarkets buy software from Manasquan, N.J.-based DCI Cardmarketing 
that allows them to develop their own promotions, which could include 
discounts, sweepstakes, special coupons and cash rebates. Micro Enhancement 
Technology of Spokane, Wash., developed the system used at Pic 'N' Save. 
</P>
<P>
 Many consumers currently receive coupons at the checkout counter, but these 
are not based on a specific customer's purchases over time. Some of these 
coupons are printed on the back of register receipts while others are dispensed 
from a different kind of Catalina machine. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing new about rewarding loyalty. Department stores, for example, 
have offered special credit deals and "private sales" to their best card 
customers for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, supermarkets have avoided those tactics. In advertising, many 
supermarkets stress low prices. Special deals for select customers could 
confuse a low-price image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like segregating customers according to how much they spend or how 
often they come in," said Jack H. Brown, chairman of Colton-based Stater Bros. 
supermarkets. "I think it is more positive when your promotions are available 
to all customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the industry's reluctance to target their best shoppers appears 
to be fading. In a survey of 106 supermarket companies, 60% told the Food 
Marketing Institute that they would have frequent-shopper programs by the end 
of 1994. In 1993, only 26% of those companies had such programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study funded by the Coca-Cola Research Council suggests that loyal 
shoppers are worth courting. According to the study, 30% of a store's customers 
provide 75% of the sales. "This logically leads into making different offers to 
different customer segments," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides allowing grocers to reward customers, the systems give supermarkets a 
better look at how sales are going. For example, the Catalina tracking system 
will allow Lucky to monitor sales of groceries at individual stores, a task it 
cannot do now. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we notice that sales of dog food are high in a particular store and we're 
not selling cat food, we can target people who live around that store in a 
different way," Lucky spokeswoman Judy Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tracking systems raise privacy concerns. Shoppers at stores using the 
Catalina Marketing system don't know they are being tracked. Catalina 
representatives say their system does not invade customer privacy because 
shoppers are not tracked by name or address. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers who join frequent-shopper clubs supply names, addresses and other 
demographic information. The applications usually contain "opt-out" clauses 
allowing consumers to have their names deleted from marketing lists, but the 
clauses are often cryptic. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the opt-out clause on Advanced Promotion's application advises 
consumers to check it only if they do not want "paper coupons, free samples, 
special offers or information based on your purchases and application 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Givens, director of San Diego-based Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, isn't 
troubled by electronic marketing, but she says most opt-out clauses are 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 "They make it sound like, 'Check here if you're some kind of idiot and you 
don't want all these special offers,' " Givens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reward programs aren't without techno-glitches. For example, Catalina 
Marketing's "smart scanner" recognizes only credit cards, debit cards and 
check-cashing cards. It does not know customers by name. Therefore, shoppers 
using a credit card one week and a debit card the next would be viewed as two 
different people. A spouse using a different card would have a separate 
electronic identity. People paying with cash would not be tracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier technologies have flopped. Citicorp, GTE and S&H, the trading-stamp 
company, have abandoned as too costly their high-profile frequent-shopper 
programs. Analysts said these companies grew impatient because the programs -- 
which offered customers discounts and shopping points toward prizes -- caught 
on too slowly with grocers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some programs appear to be working. Take Big Y Supermarket of Springfield, 
Mass. Three years ago, it eliminated clip-out newspaper coupons in favor of 
electronic discounts for frequent shoppers. It regularly runs sweepstakes and 
contests for frequent shoppers, entering them automatically when they shop. Big 
Y says its sales have increased by a third as a result of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intuitively, you know that database marketing approaches make you smarter," 
Terry Peets, Ralphs senior vice president of marketing, said at a recent 
industry conference. "It is not yet nirvana, (but) you know over time this is 
the way to go." High-Tech Marketing By the end of this year, more than half of 
the nation's supermarket chains expect to offer frequent-shopper programs in 
which stores use scanner information to tailor incentives to a shopper's needs. 
The use of other electronic marketing tactics will also increase. Percent of

MOST MAJOR STORES POST SALES GAINS IN JUNE OVER '93; RETAILING: WOMEN'S 
CLOTHING AND HOME FURNISHINGS LEAD THE WAY. SEARS, WAL-MART AND TARGET ARE THE 
BIGGEST BENEFACTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Robust sales of women's apparel and home furnishings contributed to strong 
June sales for most of the nation's biggest retailers, who persuaded customers 
to spend by offering attractive discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, Wal-Mart and Target reported some of the biggest gains in same-store 
sales, which are sales at stores open at least a year. Those figures are 
considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's health. 
</P>
<P>
 Department stores were able to lure customers in June with Father's Day sales 
and clearances on summer merchandise, said industry analyst Walter Loeb, 
president of Loeb & Associates in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "This demonstrates that if there are really substantial markdowns, if real 
values are offered to consumers, then consumers will take their hands out of 
their pockets and buy," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail 
Consulting Group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Department stores that sell items for the home, such as consumer electronics, 
furniture and bedding, benefited from a boost in those categories, Barnard 
said. Seasonal items, such as barbecues and air conditioners, did well as 
summer weather settled in across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears was the leader among department stores, with same-store sales increasing 
8.4% in June. Same-store sales grew 6.8% at J.C. Penney, while May Department 
Stores, which operates Robinsons-May stores, reported a 5% gain over the same 
month last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dayton Hudson Corp., same-store sales rose 6.8%. The retailer's Mervyn's 
division, where sales have been weak due to California's sluggish economy and 
inventory problems, posted a 1% decline, but the company's Target discount 
division's same-store sales rose 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated Department Stores, which owns Bloomingdale's and other chains, saw 
its same-store sales rise 2.6%. Gottschalks, the Fresno chain that operates 
department and specialty stores on the West Coast, also saw sales rise 6.8% 
compared to June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Broadway Stores was not part of the boom: Its same-store 
sales rose a mere 0.1%. Broadway spokesman Bill Ihle said sales were depressed 
because two floors of the Broadway store in Sherman Oaks remained closed for 
most of June due to earthquake damage, and the Northridge store will be closed 
until November. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, said same-store sales increased 9.3%. 
Kmart's sales rose a modest 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Specialty apparel stores did not fare as well last month, in part because they 
lacked the "value-oriented summer promotions" found in department stores, Loeb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Limited, the country's largest specialty apparel chain, saw same-store sales 
fall 5%. Sales at San Francisco-based Gap's stores rose a modest 2% over June, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Taylor stores were the exception. Sales for the New York-based specialty 
retailer jumped 16.4% last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, wholesalers reported that stockpiles of unsold goods grew 1.6% from 
April to May, the largest increase in nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said the higher inventories reflect optimism on the part of 
wholesalers that consumers will be buying more in the coming months. That, 
combined with strong retail sales and a 0.3% increase in wholesale sales in 
May, is another indication that the economy is on a spending rebound, said 
Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.

 Meanwhile, the number of new claims for state unemployment benefits around the 
country totaled 332,000 last week, a decline of 21,000 from the week before and 
the biggest drop in 10 weeks. However, the number of claims in California 
increased by 4,529, the largest increase of any state.

 IBM to Terminate European Accord: International Business Machines Corp. said 
it will end the 1984 agreement that settled a European Commission investigation 
of the company's alleged anti-competitive practices. IBM had agreed with the 
commission to supply information to rivals on product attachments, computer 
memory and software. But the computer maker said those commitments are no 
longer necessary in an age of "open" computer systems.

HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE REMEDIES SOUGHT; COVERAGE: SAN FRANCISCO GATHERING LOOKS 
INTO POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO THE DEARTH OF NEW POLICIES. ANOTHER MEETING IS SET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Amid fears that the near shutdown of the California homeowners insurance 
market will upset the economy, state officials, insurance executives and 
consumer advocates hashed out ideas for solutions at a meeting in San Francisco 
on Thursday, but they emerged without a concrete legislative proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a very strong sense of urgency around the table," Richard Baum, top 
deputy to Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, said of the three-hour session 
at Garamendi's headquarters. Garamendi set another meeting for next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing huge claims from the Northridge earthquake, most of the state's largest 
insurance carriers recently either stopped writing new homeowners and 
earthquake insurance entirely or imposed severe restrictions on new business. 
Most insurers are renewing old policies as they expire. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurers are pushing for repeal of the state law requiring companies that 
sell homeowners policies to offer earthquake coverage also. Such a de-linkage, 
they say, would let them resume writing homeowners policies and allow 
policy-makers to focus on the real problem: earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Garamendi opposes immediate de-linkage on grounds that it will make a 
tough market for earthquake insurance even worse, Baum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baum said the group did reach a consensus on some general issues, such as that 
the ultimate solution is a national disaster program. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there is little evidence that the insurance availability crunch has 
hurt home sales. Allstate Insurance Co. and other big carriers have said they 
will write new policies for current customers who are buying new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's broken any deals yet," Jim Stewart of Brentwood Escrow Co. 
said Thursday, "but it is putting pressure on people. They're scrambling to 
find insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 There were reports that the mortgage industry was poised to require earthquake 
insurance as a condition of qualifying for a home loan in California. However, 
two of the biggest players in the secondary mortgage market -- Federal National 
Mortgage Assn. (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac) 
-- have no such plan. A spokesman for Freddie Mac said that organization had 
considered the idea but rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
 As a stopgap measure, Garamendi ordered the California Fair Plan, the 
industry-financed high-risk pool for property insurance, to extend its fire and 
earthquake insurance statewide, effective July 1. A Fair Plan representative 
told officials at Thursday's meeting that while the Fair Plan has received many 
requests from insurance agents for information and documents, so far there have 
not been many new applications for the coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. will propose legislation to create 
a statewide pool as the sole provider of new earthquake insurance. But with the 
Legislature about to leave for a three-week summer break, the measure will not 
be taken up until at least mid-August.

CHEVROLET GEARING UP TO REGAIN NO. 1 POSITION; AUTOS: GENERAL MOTORS DIVISION 
IS BOOSTING PRODUCTION OF THREE BEST-SELLING MODELS. UNIT'S SALES ARE STILL 
FALLING BEHIND 1993. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. said Thursday that its flagship Chevrolet division is 
powering up production of critical new models that could put it back on top of 
the market next year, despite skidding sales that show little evidence of a 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevrolet officials said production of the 1995 Lumina, Cavalier and Blazer -- 
three of its best sellers -- will put it in a position to challenge Ford Motor 
Co. for the top-selling nameplate. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Chevy built the best-selling cars in the United States. Ford 
claimed the top spot in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1995 calendar year, we should be right in the battle to take back the 
title," said Ron Sobrero, Chevrolet general sales and service manager. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that for the rest of 1994, however, Chevrolet will be plagued 
by slow output of the new models. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Chevy's sales fell 4.5% from June, 1993, to 235,064 cars and trucks, 
largely because virtually all 1994 Luminas had been sold and Chevy has been 
building very few 1995 models because of production problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first half of the year, the division's sales rose 6.6%, compared to a 
10.7% increase for the auto industry as a whole. "The new products are coming, 
but we have to take a lot of downtime to get them," Sobrero said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicles have been a long time coming. For most of the 1990s, Chevrolet 
dealers have had to make do with a tired lineup as investment dollars went into 
other GM divisions, notably Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevy's problems started "when (GM) decided to take that $3 (billion) or $4 
billion and put it in Saturn," said Chevrolet dealer Lou LaRiche of Plymouth, 
Mich. "It hurt everybody. It hurt Oldsmobile, it hurt Chevrolet, it hurt Buick 
-- everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 But the change has forced Chevrolet to shift its focus back on its original 
mission: to be a seller of value-oriented, affordable cars and trucks. At 
first, the division was forced to slash prices to guard its market share 
against encroachment from the superior Saturns. 
</P>
<P>
 The new model lineup, with simpler designs and more efficient production 
methods, is allowing Chevrolet to build in more value for lower prices, 
industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Cavalier, for example, offers dual air bags and anti-lock brakes as 
standard features. It has an attractive redesigned body with added interior 
room. It handles better and offers a much better ride than its predecessor. The 
starting price for the line will be about $10,515. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that price, the car's going to be tremendously successful," said Chris 
Cedergren, an analyst with AutoPacific Group. "The main thing Chevrolet has 
going for it is that you get a hell of a lot of bang for your buck." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some critics have panned the 1995 Lumina's conservative styling, it 
also offers many significant improvements over its predecessor. It comes with 
dual air bags and a 160-horsepower engine for a base price of $15,995. Ford's 
1995 Taurus sedans will start at $17,585. 
</P>
<P>
 GM aims to sell more than 300,000 Luminas and similar Monte Carlo models 
annually. Even if the cars are not wild successes, the lower production costs 
will mean higher profits for GM. 
</P>
<P>
 J.P. Morgan analyst David Bradley estimated a $500-a-car profit on the 1995 
Lumina line, in contrast to an estimated $2,500-a-car loss on the earlier 
models. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also expect Chevrolet's 1995 Blazer to compete more effectively than 
past models with Ford's Explorer and Jeep's Grand Cherokee in the compact sport 
utility market.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW RISES AS MARKET AWAITS NEWS ON JUNE JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue chip stocks rose for the fourth straight day Thursday while bonds held 
steady, on expectations that June employment figures due out today will be weak 
enough to hold off another interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 13.92 points to 3,688.42, and the 
broad market joined in the mini-rally: Winners topped losers by a solid 3 to 2 
on the New York Stock Exchange, as trading volume picked up to 259.7 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq Stock Market composite index of mostly smaller companies rose 5.53 
points to 706.53, helped by rebounding technology issues. The technology sector 
had been under pressure for several days since a merger announcement involving 
Wellfleet Communications and SynOptics Communications was poorly received. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales reports from the nation's major retailers suggested that economic 
activity remained high in June. Industrywide, business was respectable for 
stores, but retailers that didn't do as well as the majority witnessed a 
selloff in their stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market neither helped nor hurt stocks Thursday. Bonds languished 
through a listless session, as traders treaded cautiously ahead of the release 
of monthly employment statistics. The key 30-year Treasury bond's yield was 
nudged up to 7.60% from Wednesday's 7.59%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed held policy meetings Tuesday and Wednesday and apparently decided to 
leave short-term interest rates unchanged for now. Even so, market players were 
mulling the potential for a negative surprise in the June economic report 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Alexy, a market strategist at CS First Boston Corp., tied some of 
Thursday's caution in the bond market to some traders gambling on 
better-than-expected job growth figures for June. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists believe the economy gained about 285,000 jobs last month but 
that unemployment edged up to 6.2% from 6% in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors will also be watching for developments from the weekend conference 
of leaders of the major industrial countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Group of Seven government leaders are meeting in Naples, Italy, 
where they are expected to discuss the dollar's recent slump in relation to 
other major currencies and how it might influence economic policies. Group of 
Seven members are the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Canada 
and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar continued to fall Thursday against the Japanese yen, as 
participants in the G-7 summit indicated that a combined effort to support the 
greenback is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar eased to 98.75 yen from 98.95 yen Wednesday. The 
dollar also closed at 1.575 German marks, up from 1.569. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Some retail stocks bounced after reporting upbeat June sales figures. 
Dayton-Hudson rose 1 to 81 7/8, Wal-Mart gained 7/8 to 24 3/4 and Bon-Ton 
Stores added 1/4 to 9 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other retailers did not fare as well. J.C. Penney dropped 2 5/8 to 48 1/2. 
It reported a same-store sales jump of 6.8%, but Wall Street had expected a 
bigger gain at both its stores and its catalogue business. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Buy lost 3 1/4 to 25 3/8 and TJX tumbled 2 7/8 to 19 1/8. TJX warned Wall 
Street that its second-quarter net income will be lower than last year's 
because sales in May and June were below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the energy group, Phillips Petroleum fell 1 1/4 to 31 7/8 after it 
reported disappointing results from the closely watched Teak sub-salt oil field 
in the Gulf of Mexico, of which it owns 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Anadarko Petroleum, which owns the other 50% of the Teak well, tumbled 6 5/8 
to 50 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among rebounding technology shares were some recently hammered computer 
networking stocks. 3Com rose 2 3/4 to 48 1/2; Wellfleet Communications advanced 
1 3/16 to 20 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Software company Gupta fell 1 to 8 3/4 after it said it would probably lose 45 
to 55 cents a share in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Steel stocks were mostly higher, led by Inland Steel, up 1 to 36 1/4. Inland 
announced a price hike that is expected to be followed by other steelmakers. 
Bethlehem Steel rose 1 1/8 to 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets were mixed. London stocks ended higher with the Financial 
Times 100-share average rallying strongly to end 17.7 points up at 2,964.4. In 
Frankfurt, the DAX-30 average closed at 2,043.85, up 8.15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average finished off 9.01 points at 20,620.02. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, the Bolsa index rallied for a second day, finishing 24.40 points 
higher at 2,334.39.

 SEC Joins Probe of Ex-Fed Governor: A Federal Reserve probe into whether 
former Fed Gov. Wayne Angell leaked secret central bank information for profit 
has been sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Fed Inspector General 
Brent Bower handed his report on Angell to the SEC earlier this week, Rep. 
Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), noted in a letter to SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt 
Jr.Gonzalez is chairman of the House Banking Committee. In the letter, he urged 
the SEC to widen the Fed's investigation to see what Angell told fee-paying 
clients about Fed policy shortly after he left the central bank in February. 
Angell was reported in April to have given clients key information about 
interest rates that he may have learned at the Fed.

8.77%.The average hit a 25-year low of 6.74% in October. Lenders were asking an 
average initial rate of 5.56% on one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages, up from

 General Mills Resumes Cereal Production: The Minneapolis-based food maker 
resumed full production of oat cereals about three weeks after halting 
shipments of products that were treated with an unregistered pesticide.General 
Mills stopped shipping Cheerios and other oat cereals in mid-June when a 
routine check by the Food and Drug Administration found traces of 
chlorpyrifos-ethyl, an insecticide approved for wheat, corn, apples and other 
crops but not oats. General Mills said an independent licensed contractor 
improperly treated some of its raw oat supplies. The FDA and the Environmental 
Protection Agency have said the products made from the improperly treated oats 
pose no health hazard.

 AT&T to Reserve Numbers for New '500' Service: The long-distance company said 
it will begin taking reservations Tuesday for its "phone number for life" 
program, a personal phone number that tracks down customers wherever they 
are.The numbers will be based on a new 500 area code reserved for customers who 
want one phone number for their homes, offices, cars and boats. Customers will 
be able to keep their 500 numbers no matter where they move and use them to 
receive calls on a variety of devices. AT&T will begin giving out those numbers 
to consumers next week, though it still needs Federal Communications Commission 
approval to begin the service, scheduled to start in the fall.

DRAWSTRINGS TO BE REMOVED FROM CHILDREN'S GARMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly two dozen apparel makers have agreed to remove drawstrings from the 
hoods and necks of children's garments in an effort to prevent strangulation, 
the Consumer Products Safety Commission said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawstrings that caught on playground equipment, cribs, fences and an 
escalator have been blamed for the deaths of 12 children and the injury of 27 
others since 1985. The children were between 15 months and 11 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Washington, commission Chairman Ann Brown said the 
agreement is potentially lifesaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drawstrings on children's clothing are a danger that can catch and kill," she 
said. "It is entirely preventable." 
</P>
<P>
 Garments involved in the agreement are those designed for children between the 
ages of 6 months and 14 years. The agreement will remove the strings from 20 
million garments annually. The size of the children's market for hooded sweat 
shirts, jackets, T-shirts and capes isn't known. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said 21 companies have agreed to eliminate the drawstrings 
beginning this fall or next year. Among the companies agreeing to redesign 
clothing are Haddad Apparel Group, makers of several lines, including Bugle Boy 
and Hush Puppies; Walter Jerome & Co., makers of Tidykins; Oshkosh B'Gosh; 
Nike; L.L. Bean; Levi-Strauss, and Health-Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many other manufacturers are not on the list, a commission 
spokeswoman said Thursday's announcement is merely the start of a drive to 
eliminate hazardous drawstrings from children's clothing entirely. She said the 
commission has received agreements from most of the companies it has approached 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's staff is preparing a "briefing package" for the three-member 
panel suggesting various ways it can prod the industry to remove the 
drawstrings. The commission could impose a ban, though the process usually 
takes years.The options could be available by next month, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission advised parents to either remove drawstrings from their 
children's clothes or modify them to make them less hazardous. The commission 
said parents can sew a seam through the drawstring at the middle of the hood 
and neck so that neither end can pull out and catch on an object. Parents are 
advised to cut the strings as short as needed to close the garment.  
</P>
<P>
 Attending the news conference was Thelma Sibley, mother of a 5-year-old girl 
who died in January when the string on her jacket caught on an elementary 
school slide in Ann Arbor, Mich.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; SONY'S 'INVISIBLE MAN' SHOWS HIS FACE; 
STUDIOS: ALAN J. LEVINE STEPS INTO THE LIMELIGHT, PROMPTING SPECULATION HE MAY 
SEEK TO SUCCEED GUBER AS CHAIRMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At Sony Pictures Entertainment, Hollywood's most colorful and contentious 
studio, Alan J. Levine enjoys a remarkable degree of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sony president and chief operating officer has functioned so quietly 
during his five-year stint that colleagues privately refer to him as "the 
invisible man." And even a close friend confesses, "I'm sorry, but I'm not 
really sure what he does." 
</P>
<P>
 That's shielded Levine from much of the criticism directed at Sony over the 
years for its financial performance and propensity for treating senior managers 
like temps. But it's also left him with an identity crisis, which may explain 
why the 47-year-old executive is finally emerging from his silky cocoon inside 
Sony's famous Thalberg building to assume a higher profile. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine recently joined colleagues in promoting to state lawmakers a report on 
Hollywood's contribution to the Southern California economy. He's also stepped 
out in the media to defend Sony's image and his own achievements -- which has 
led to speculation that he's trying to better position himself to eventually 
succeed Sony Pictures Chairman Peter Guber. 
</P>
<P>
 When that question is raised, Levine lives up to his reputation for being 
personally cautious and conservative. He sidesteps any mention of his goals -- 
saying "the COO's role is to be the center of gravity . . . and a mediator" -- 
but he is quick to challenge criticism of Sony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've done a very good job of building a strong company," he said. 
"The headlines always have to do with the movies, but the scope of this 
business is much bigger than that." 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence, Levine points to Sony's growing theatrical exhibition division 
and its new-media operations, the latter of which has recently started drawing 
spillover business from George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic. Moreover, he 
says, Sony has a thriving video unit and potentially lucrative partnerships in 
the Latin American-based HBO Ole and Viva, a German music channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine also contends that critics tend to ignore Sony's strong position in TV. 
With hits such as "Mad About You" and "Married . . . With Children," Columbia 
TriStar Television had operating profit of about $100 million in the last 
fiscal year ended in March, according to sources. The group has also placed 
nine shows on the upcoming fall network schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine says technology will create even more opportunity for a company that, 
for now, certainly isn't setting the world on fire financially. Sources have 
said the studio is a major money-loser for Sony Corp. The Tokyo-based 
conglomerate reported that Sony Pictures suffered a 7% drop in revenue, to $3.2 
billion for the latest fiscal year, which was attributed to movie losses and a 
lull in TV revenue. Overall pretax entertainment earnings, which include 
independently run Sony Music, fell to $646 million from $904 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As the studio searches for its bearings, sources say Levine's most important 
contribution may be his role as a stabilizing presence. They also point out 
that he enjoys a strong working partnership with the flashy, hyperactive Guber 
-- the polar opposite stylistically of Levine, who favors conservative business 
suits and is known for his slavish devotion to golf. While Levine concentrates 
on pure business issues, Guber focuses largely on the creative side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alan has done a real good job of holding things together there through some 
real tough times," said one supporter. "And in chaos, there's often 
opportunity. We'll see where he lands, but for now he's a real strong No. 2 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Guber with his characteristic flair, "Sometimes lightning only hits the 
lightning rod . . . but that doesn't mean (that Levine) is less intrinsic to 
the operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine joined the studio shortly after Sony Corp. purchased it for roughly $6 
billion, counting debt, in 1989. A former entertainment lawyer at Armstrong, 
Hirsch & Levine -- where he was mentored by Hollywood power attorney Barry 
Hirsch -- Levine was given the Sony front-office job after negotiating for 
then-clients Guber and Jon Peters to become co-chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years that followed, the three executives put the once-ailing studio 
back on the map by expanding its management ranks, pumping untold millions into 
high-priced talent deals and even embarking on a massive renovation of the old 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lot they took over. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sony's hopes of duplicating the Warner Bros. model of management stability 
and steady growth were foiled by unrelenting executive turmoil -- including the 
messy and expensive departures of Peters, Columbia Pictures Chairman Frank 
Price, TriStar Pictures Chairman Mike Medavoy and, most recently, motion 
picture group President Jonathan Dolgen. 
</P>
<P>
 In most of those cases, sources say, Levine played the hatchet man, which 
opponents offer up as further proof of his deceptively strong role at Sony. 
Levine's reputation as a tough guy (which he calls "one-dimensional") was 
sealed when he pushed Peters out of the executive suite three years ago, 
following repeated clashes between the volatile producer and Sony Corp. 
executives. "This guy did Jon, and Jon wasn't easy to do," says one Hollywood 
colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine also ran Sony's in-house investigation when company executives were 
linked to alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss last year in reports never 
substantiated. And it was Levine who led Sony's unsuccessful efforts to acquire 
hockey's Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say he blew the deal that would have put Sony into the sports business 
by playing hardball with former Kings owner Bruce McNall. Others say Sony 
walked away from the deal when McNall's financial problems surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 In either case, Levine reportedly amassed even more power last spring after 
Dolgen left to run Paramount Pictures and other entertainment operations for 
Viacom Inc. Not everyone was pleased. He has been accused of contributing to 
Sony's diminished box office presence by being too tightfisted with development 
and production money. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's basically a bean counter," said one source. "And that slows the process 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 But Guber says Levine possesses solid management skills, calling him "a 
knowledgeable business person and one who has the faith and confidence of the 
employees of the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine has other supporters outside the company. Castle Rock Entertainment 
Chairman Alan Horn, whose sat across the table from Levine when Sony's stake in 
Castle Rock was bought out by Ted Turner, says, "I really feel that Alan Levine 
is a fellow who understands our business." And former TriStar Chairman Medavoy 
calls him "a bright, very quick study." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine himself, whose contract runs through 1998, says most if not all of the 
old raps against Sony will fade as it moves into the future. He insists the 
company still has the strong support of its corporate parent and that it is 
fully financed for the future, even if no one takes it up on its 
well-publicized effort to sell a 25% stake in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question in our minds that our plan is on track, and that does 
not include any type of issue regarding change of control or ownership," he 
said. "We have always had all the money and support we needed."

COMPANY TOWN; SALHANY-MURDOCH DISCORD FINALLY HIT THE BOILING POINT; 
TELEVISION: 'SHE WASN'T HAPPY AND MURDOCH WASN'T HAPPY,' INSIDER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three months ago, bedeviled by rumors that she was about to be replaced as Fox 
Broadcasting chairman, Lucie Salhany approached Fox Inc.'s Rupert Murdoch and 
demanded a vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving that vote, an emboldened Salhany invited skeptics to have the 
rumor debunked by Murdoch himself. "Go ahead, call him," she advised one 
person. "I'm not being replaced." 
</P>
<P>
 But now it turns out the reprieve only masked a deeper schism between Salhany 
and Murdoch over the direction of the upstart fourth network -- which resulted 
in Salhany's formally leaving her post Thursday after 18 months on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recent high-profile gains such as snaring the National Football League 
and investing $500 million in New World Communications Group to convert a dozen 
stations to Fox affiliates, the network under Salhany had suffered a number of 
setbacks, including lower ratings and the disastrous bid to create a late-night 
talk show around Chevy Chase. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Salhany was said to be frustrated by Murdoch's intensely 
hands-on management style and the shifting corporate politics of News Corp., 
where Murdoch in recent months has moved several longtime trusted managers from 
the newspaper side into television. 
</P>
<P>
 Irritated by what she perceived as poaching on her turf by other Fox 
executives, Salhany finally forced the issue with Murdoch over the weekend, 
even though her contract had less than a year remaining. "She wasn't happy and 
Murdoch wasn't happy," one insider said. "It was time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources now say Murdoch had been casting about for a new head of Fox for some 
time. Several months ago, he held talks with longtime ABC News President Roone 
Arledge. He also considered moving Sam Chisholm, a trusted manager who oversees 
News Corp.'s non-U.S. TV operations, to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Salhany's departure, Fox has reorganized the studio's TV 
operation. Chase Carey, executive vice president of Fox Inc., has been handed 
the largest chunk of the empire, including oversight for the network, the 
studio's owned TV stations, domestic syndication and the new cable TV network 
f/x. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Chernin, the former Fox Entertainment head who now runs motion pictures, 
will assume responsibility for network TV production. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves underscore the suddenness with which Fox and Salhany came to a 
parting of the ways -- although Carey has been put in charge of the 
consolidated TV operations of the studio, no replacement was named as head of 
the network. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey, a Harvard MBA with a handlebar mustache and the build of the champion 
rugby player that he once was, is strong on finance and administration but has 
had limited experience on the creative side of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Carey said the core team of Fox executives -- Sandy Grushow in 
programming, Preston Padden over affiliate relations and John Nesvig overseeing 
advertising sales -- will remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Salhany, a successful TV syndication executive who is credited with launching 
"The Arsenio Hall Show" and revitalizing "Entertainment Tonight" while at 
Paramount, is expected to rebound quickly. Sources said she is already 
discussing the possibility of joining CBS if it completes its merger with QVC, 
as head of the network's expansion into the syndication business. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdoch's more direct involvement at Fox began three years ago, when the 
jet-hopping global media baron decided to base himself in Los Angeles and make 
his U.S.-based entertainment operations the focus of his attention. Murdoch's 
presence was at least partially responsible for two previous high-profile 
departures: those of Chairman Barry Diller and film studio chief Joe Roth. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-year-old Fox network has been undergoing a strategic shift over the past 
year. Originally conceived as a mini-network best known for its youth-oriented 
programming such as "The Simpsons" and "Married . . . With Children," Murdoch 
has sought to broaden its reach with football and news. 
</P>
<P>
 Such moves have given Fox at least a temporary boost. In the recently 
concluded "upfront" selling market, the fourth network sold $750 million in 
advertising time for the 1994-95 season, a 50% increase over last year. The NFL 
deal was also a prime reason New World switched its affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with limited new programming successes and seven nights of programming 
to fill, Fox executives face a difficult task in making sure the network 
doesn't slip any further than it did this past season. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a spunky upstart, the network is now approaching -- in television years 
anyway -- comfortable middle age.  
</P>
<P>
 Its status as the spoiler is challenged by rival networks being launched by 
Paramount and Warner Bros., and the prospect of former progenitor Diller now 
running CBS is said to have Murdoch deeply concerned. In that sense, the future 
of Fox may have as much to do with who is on the outside as with who is running 
things inside.

EXECUTIVE SUITE: COMPANY TOWN; ZISKIND TO FOX? PRODUCER ISN'T SAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Producer Laura Ziskind is the latest executive rumored to be headed to 20th 
Century Fox, to run a new mature-films wing. Ziskind, who just wrapped "To Die 
For" and has another 1 1/2 years to go on her production deal at TriStar 
Pictures, said she is surprised by the talk. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the division, sources say, is to make adult-relationship movies 
that appeal to women. Fox already has a family film division and is in the 
midst of putting together a unit that will concentrate on art movies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fox executives call the labels silly and say the purpose of the new 
divisions is to churn out even more films. The studio's long-range goal is to 
bulk up the production load to 40 movies a year. 
</P>

worked out within the past few days, clearing the way for the September release 
of an album that will be largely based on recordings the newly reunited group 
made earlier this year for an MTV program. The album will be released by Geffen 
Records. The deal will also resolve a dispute between group co-founder Don 
Henley and Geffen, and another dispute involving group co-founder Glenn Frey 
and MCA Records. The group will reportedly receive a very generous $10-million 
advance against sales. JAMES BATES

 Who said vanity labels don't succeed? When Madonna announced the formation of 
her Warner Bros.-distributed Maverick Records just over two years ago, jaded 
industry insiders laughed it off as just another toy for a superstar.Once 
again, it's the Material Girl who's having the last laugh. Maverick, headed by 
Madonna's longtime manager, Freddy DeMann, has earned industrywide praise for 
introducing Seattle's Candlebox, whose debut album is heading toward double 
platinum (sales of 2 million copies) and climbing steadily. The single and 
video "Far Behind" also continue their rise.

U.S., CANADA STILL FISHING FOR AGREEMENT ON SALMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Increasingly at odds over everything from wheat to wood, U.S. and Canadian 
trade officials tried but failed Thursday to defuse their fish war. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators sat down at the table for three hours and emerged with little to 
say except that new talks will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a useful and productive dialogue," a Commerce Department spokesman 
said. "Another meeting is scheduled." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over salmon erupted in May when the two sides failed to agree on 
this year's Pacific harvest and abruptly called off negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 A Canadian official played down Thursday's slim results, saying the two sides 
will meet again next week in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think brilliant breakthroughs were expected today. This was just a 
start," the embassy aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the two sides remain at loggerheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada says U.S. vessels are catching too much of its prized sockeye salmon, 
hauling in the Canadian fish as the salmon try to return to spawning grounds in 
the rivers of British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's resumption in talks followed the personal intervention of Vice 
President Al Gore, rarely a player in international trade matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, however, Gore told Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin that 
Washington would return to the table if Canada lifted a contentious $1,125 
license fee it slapped on U.S. fishing boats last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington had complained that the fee -- imposed on U.S. boats between the 
Pacific Northwest and Alaska -- was inconsistent with international law and 
forced cash-strapped fishermen to take dangerously to the open seas. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada, in turn, said the get-tough approach was the only way to bring the 
Americans back to the negotiating table. Indeed, the tactic appeared to work, 
even if the dispute was not resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks pitted U.S. Commerce Deputy Undersecretary Douglas Hall against 
Canada's Deputy Fisheries and Oceans Minister Bill Rowat and Assistant Deputy 
Minister Pat Schamut. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks on the 1994 sockeye harvest quotas stalled in May, and time is running 
short before the season opens in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada says all it wants is equity; it complains that U.S. overfishing nets 
Americans $49 million more in Canada-bound salmon than Canadian vessels catch 
in U.S.-bound sockeye. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest U.S. quota proposal -- offered under a 1985 harvest treaty -- would 
only serve to boost the imbalance to $75 million and endanger already-depleted 
Canadian stocks, officials there say. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with fish, the two sides are embroiled in a host of other trade spats. 
And while each one amounts to but a blip in the big picture -- a $210-billion 
two-way trade flow -- any one could spawn a wider retaliatory trade war.

TRUMP OWNS HALF OF EMPIRE STATE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Empire State Building has new owners -- and one of them, Donald Trump, 
wasted no time Thursday in shouting his involvement from the top of its 102 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump, the flamboyant owner of the Plaza hotel, Trump Tower and three Atlantic 
City casinos, cut a deal with a group of Asian and European investors to snap 
up the highest point in mid-town Manhattan's famous skyline. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement did not cost Trump a dime, the developer said. In return for 
arranging equity financing for NS America, the group that bought the building 
for $45 million in October, Trump took over 50% ownership of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trump Buys Empire State Building," blared a news release from the developer's 
publicist. NS America, which invited Trump aboard, was mentioned only after 
Trump's name had appeared five times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offshore people don't have much experience with New York real estate," 
said lawyer Henry Bubel, who represents NS America. "They thought Mr. Trump 
would be helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 While Trump was proclaiming his latest move, sources in his organization were 
speculating that there might be a showdown between Trump and the current 
leaseholder, a group led by real estate investor Harry Helmsley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my intent to take the actions necessary to restore the Empire State 
Building to its rightful position as a world-class real estate asset. . . . I 
intend to make my position worth a fortune," Trump said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The lease on the building runs through the year 2075 and gives the buyers an 
annual return of 5% -- a low figure for such a large commercial property 
investment. The lease now pays $1.9 million a year and drops to $1.7 million in 
2013. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building has not been run as the lease requires," the Trump source said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. "There may be a renegotiation of the lease. 
There's the potential for cancellation of the lease." 
</P>
<P>
 There's already bad blood between the two sides. Trump once denounced Harry 
Helmsley's wife, Leona, as "a disgrace to humanity" and "a vicious, horrible 
woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Leona responded by calling Trump an "S.O.B." and "a skunk," adding, "I 
wouldn't believe Donald Trump if his tongue was notarized." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fifth Avenue building, which opened May 1, 1931, holds 2.24 million square 
feet of office space and is at 85% occupancy. The Trump source said a plan to 
convert the upper stories into apartments is one possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Fran Friedman, a spokeswoman for Helmsley and his wife, Leona, dismissed that 
speculation and said the new owners should have no effect on the lease.

CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT TARGETS FIRST PENSION OWNERS, OTHERS; COURTS: FOUR 
INVESTORS SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES IN O.C. MORE PLAINTIFFS MAY JOIN, AND 
ADDITIONAL DEFENDANTS COULD BE NAMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four investors who say they lost more than $200,000 of their retirement funds 
in the failure of First Pension Corp. filed a class-action lawsuit Thursday 
against the owners of the Irvine pension management company, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, alleges that former First 
Pension President William E. Cooper, along with other companies and 
individuals, violated securities laws and engaged in fraud, deceit, negligence 
and unfair business practices. The suit seeks unspecified actual and punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has alleged that First Pension operated 
an elaborate pyramid scheme, misleading clients into investing in mortgages 
that did not exist. As much as $124 million of investors' money may have been 
lost to fraud and outright theft, the SEC has said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which had an estimated 8,000 clients and accounts valued at $350 
million, filed April 22 for liquidation under federal bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of money lost with First Pension, and it's been nearly two 
months since this first came out," said James C. Krause, one of the lawyers for 
the four investors bringing the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got the SEC doing their thing, the FBI doing a criminal investigation, 
and the bankruptcy trustees," Krause said. "But none of those entities have as 
a primary charge getting money back for investors. . . . That's what we're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego lawyer Rochelle J. Felitti, who filed Thursday's lawsuit on behalf 
of Richard Ting and Patricia Ting of Irvine and Karmele Murray and Joseph T. 
Murray of San Jacinto, said she expects more First Pension investors to join 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, she said, other lawyers are studying the case, and more defendants -- 
such as related banks or accounting firms -- may be added. 
</P>
<P>
 "As things become known," she said, "we will amend the complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiff Richard Ting, who with his wife, Patricia, may have lost as much as 
$130,000 in First Pension mortgage pools that investigators now allege were 
phony, said the couple's aim in filing the lawsuit is to recover their money. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortgage pools were operated through First Diversified Financial Services 
Inc., the parent company of First Pension. 
</P>
<P>
 First Diversified has not filed for bankruptcy. The SEC has the authority to 
appoint a trustee to evaluate its assets but has not done so yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no one doing anything about the mortgage pools," Ting said. 
</P>
<P>
 In early May, the SEC alleged that First Pension's three principals -- Cooper 
and his two long-term associates, Robert E. Lindley and Valerie Jensen -- 
operated a scheme that used money from new investors to pay dividends to 
earlier ones. The three recently agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges, 
which have yet to be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's lawsuit states that "defendants Cooper, Jensen, Lindley . . . 
knowingly and/or recklessly failed to disclose that the trust deeds securing 
the limited partnerships failed to exist." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also names other companies in which the three defendants were 
involved, including First Diversified. It also names other individuals, among 
them Terri Cooper, William Cooper's wife; and Sandee Russell, his secretary.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: PRINTRONIX STOCK CLIMBS 25% ON DOUBLED EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Printronix Inc.'s stock soared 25% to hit a 52-week high in Nasdaq trading 
Thursday, a day after the printer manufacturer reported better-than-expected 
earnings for its latest quarter.

<P>
 The Irvine-based maker of industrial and office printers credited higher 
orders from existing customers for its better performance in the quarter ended 
June 24.The company reported Wednesday that its profit more than doubled, to

for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue rose 38%, to $33.5 million from $24.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Printronix stock closed Thursday at $11.25 a share, up $2.25. About 182,500

gainer on the U.S. composite index and the fourth-highest gainer on the Nasdaq 
system.

BRIEFCASE: WORKPLACE; ACCOMMODATING DISABLED EMPLOYEE WAS NO BIG DEAL

 Calvary Chapel in Anaheim didn't have to do major remodeling when it decided 
to employ a woman who is a paraplegic with cerebral palsy. All the church 
needed to do was make small accommodations, like raising a desk so a wheelchair 
could fit underneath, providing telephone headsets and allowing the new office 
worker to have a flexible work schedule so she can visit her doctor regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary's experience shows that employers can hire people with disabilities 
without always having to make costly adjustments, said Rick Travis, chairman of 
the Orange County Employment Advocacy Network, an organization of 24 county 
agencies that help people with disabilities land jobs. "There's a lot of 
low-tech things employers can do that they probably do for regular employees," 
Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary was one of more than 30 employers recognized by the network recently 
for its commitment to hiring people with special needs. Travis said an 
increasing number of people with disabilities are finding jobs locally. Twelve 
network member agencies reported placing 592 people with developmental 
disabilities in 1993 -- more than double the number in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Travis said, unemployment for people with severe disabilities remains 
well over 50%. And in keeping with the general labor trend of the '90s, he 
said, more people with disabilities are finding that much of the work they can 
get is just temporary.

 Alpha Microsystems: The Santa Ana information technology products and services 
company said it lost $149,000, or 2 cents a share, for the first quarter, 
contrasted with a profit of $29,000, or 1 cent a share, for the first quarter 
of the previous year. The company attributed the loss to increased expenses 
from investment in new product and marketing programs and from investigating 
potential acquisition candidates. Revenue for the quarter ended May 29 was $10 
million, up from $9.5 million.

 Job Jeopardy: Many unions in recent years have been negotiating "successor 
clauses" in their labor contracts to give workers a measure of job security if 
a company is sold. Teamsters Local 952 in Orange now wishes it had done so. 
</P>
<P>
 The local represents about 80 drivers and warehouse workers at Consolidated 
Beverage Distributors in Tustin. Miller Brewing Co., which owns Consolidated, 
recently agreed to sell the Tustin distributorship to Harbor Distributing Co. 
in Long Beach. When the deal closes this summer, Harbor could void the contract 
and put the 80 workers out on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that this might happen, Teamsters members last week struck 
Consolidated, temporarily disrupting Miller beer delivery in Orange County. The 
union's hope was to get Miller to put in successor language in the existing 
labor contract. What it got was a recommendation letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says the Teamsters called an end to their walkout over the weekend 
after the beer company agreed to send a letter to Harbor urging it to employ 
union workers at Consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor won't say what it plans to do. Teamsters officials have declined to 
comment.

 Security in the Office: What do you do if you're a receptionist and this 
happens? 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-year employee who was fired last week stalks into your reception area, 
where several important clients are waiting for appointments.He pounds on your 
desk and demands to see the personnel director. When you tell him that the 
director has left for the day, he pushes over a potted tree and starts yelling 
about how the company has ruined his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Solutions to that and other potentially explosive situations will be discussed 
at a seminar later this month in Anaheim. Called the Receptionist's Guide to 
Front-Desk Security, the program reflects the growing concern over issues of 
violence in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar is sponsored by Keye Productivity Center, a Kansas City, Mo., 
division of the American Management Assn. The all-day session will also deal 
with such issues as how receptionists can command attention and respect, how to 
recognize when callers are fishing for confidential information and how to stop 
people who try to slip by the front desk. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the seminar is $139. For more information, call (800) 821-3919.

 The path to economic recovery has been a rough one for Orange County 
workers--and the businesses that hire them. By May, the latest month for which 
Orange County figures are available, the recession had resulted in the loss of 
64,200 jobs from the all-time high of 1,182,100 in December, 1990--the year the 
economic slump began. That's a 5.4% cut in employment, with the construction, 
manufacturing and retail industries hardest hit. But the hemorrhaging seems to 
have stopped, with 16,600 new jobs created since January to raise May 
employment in Orange County to 1,117,900. Economists at Chapman University and 
Cal State Fullerton say they expect this year to be the first since 1990 to end 
with an increase in overall employment. Jobs Are Up This Year

STRONG FAMILY ROOTS HELP ASPLUNDH GROW AS TREE EXPERT; BUSINESS: THE COMPANY 
HAS BECOME THE NATION'S LARGEST IN CLEARING VEGETATION FOR UTILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When hurricanes ravage Florida, when ice storms paralyze the Southeast, when 
snow buries the West, power companies know the value of the family tree holding 
up the Asplundh Tree Expert Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has grown into the nation's largest expert in tree trimming and 
vegetation clearing for utilities in the 66 years since Griffith, Lester and 
Carl Asplundh combined their degrees in forestry, electrical engineering and 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains in family hands today, employing 18 relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The company started with $2,500 in borrowed money and a handful of tree 
climbers driving used trucks. Today, 19,000 employees work in all 50 states, 
parts of Canada, England, Ireland, France, New Zealand, Australia and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always wanted a family-controlled and family-led business," company 
President Christopher B. Asplundh said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the values of a tightknit family, the Asplundhs take their 
business personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our customers know us and that's why we're successful," Asplundh said. "When 
we foul something up -- and we do -- it's almost like you personally did it and 
you got to get in there and correct it." 
</P>
<P>
 During last winter's brutal Southeast ice storms, at least 2,000 Asplundh 
crews were out in force trimming, pruning and removing trees in and around 
power lines. Their bright orange and black trucks took to the roads from east 
Texas to the Delmarva Peninsula, which connects Delaware, Virginia and 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 To make it in the company, men and women connected to the name -- which means 
"a grove of aspen trees" in Swedish -- need to prove themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 No one joins the company until earning a college degree, and each member 
starts at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us grew up trimming trees," he said. "We can relate with our employees 
and they feel comfortable with us and we feel comfortable with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Asplundh said no relative receives any preferential treatment during the 
eight-year family training program. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never work in the area where their father is responsible for," he said. 
"They must work for six different managers before they can come into the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 Asplundh said the company posted estimated sales of $700 million in 1993, but 
he declined to reveal profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In Forbes magazine's 1993 annual edition of the 400 largest privately held 
companies in the country, ATE was ranked 298, jumping 43 notches from 341 in 
1992. Asplundh predicted the company will shoot to about 125 by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really dominate their business," said Peter Davis, a former family 
business consultant to the Asplundhs. "It's one of those great niche 
businesses. They are a well-managed and well-organized company." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Handler, another family business expert, said Asplundh has shown a rare 
longevity for a family-owned company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, three out of 10 businesses make it to the second generation," 
Handler said. "And when one out of 10 make it to the third, it's a feat in 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 ATE receives high marks from utilities in Philadelphia, New York, Seattle, Los 
Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asplundh is on the forefront and a trendsetter in this business and they 
deliver a quality product for a competitive price," said Steve Hallmark, a 
forester at Puget Power Co., which services the Seattle area. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Swank, a spokesman for Florida Power and Light, said Asplundh's 
performance recently won the company an extended tree-trimming contract in an 
area encompassing half of the state's population. 
</P>
<P>
 On the West Coast, Asplundh proved its worth when abundant rain started a 
growth spurt a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We contacted other tree trimmers but no company other than Asplundh was able 
to come up with a plan and a solution for the fast-growing trees," said Charlie 
Basham, a spokesman for Southern California Edison Co. "In three weeks, they 
trimmed 10,000 additional trees, which helped us greatly in maintaining the 
reliability of our electrical system." 
</P>
<P>
 The company distributes cut limbs and branches for uses ranging from firewood 
to golf course mulch. 
</P>
<P>
 Asplundh compared his company's tree-trimming procedures to strategic military 
operations, which calls for preparation, timing and quick reaction to weather 
conditions and natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a storm center here, not just for the big storms but for local 
weather," he said. "We track these storms." 
</P>
<P>
 On a national level, Asplundh's sole competitor is the Ohio-based Davey Tree 
and Lawn Care Co., an employee-owned and operated company that has utility 
contracts in 40 states and five Canadian provinces. Davey Tree produced $225 
million in sales last year, according to company President R. Douglas Cowan. 
</P>
<P>
 When discussing competition, Asplundh again used personal terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very, very personal with all of us because we've gone right up 
against competition, but it's not competition as usual," he said. "If you're 
good at something . . . it's a referral system." 
</P>
<P>
 Asplundh spoke fondly of the company's founders and said he felt duty-bound to 
improve what they started. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a unique structure here," Asplundh said. "The second-generation 
executives are running it now."

<P>
 The key to finding the right college and gaining admission to it is to plan 
ahead, stay organized and keep on schedule, say those who have succeeded in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 When should you start? Right now if you're a member of the Class of '96.  
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the steps college-bound juniors should take in the coming 
months and through their senior year. It is a methodical process, starting with 
a broad look and eventually focusing in on a few schools. Keep separate files 
on each school in which you are interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Year 
</P>
<P>
 JULY/AUGUST 
</P>
<P>
 * Start writing for college brochures 
</P>
<P>
 * Visit a few prospective campuses 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider taking an SAT preparation course or start preparing on your own 
</P>
<P>
 * Take advantage of a scholarship and/or career search at your local 
college/career planning center 
</P>
<P>
 * Start looking into scholarship opportunities 
</P>
<P>
 * Start a filing system for prospective colleges and scholarships.  
</P>
<P>
 Starting now helps you know early on what you're up against. You'll be 
thankful in the end that you got a head start on the college game. 
</P>
<P>
 SEPTEMBER 
</P>
<P>
 * Inquire/sign up for the October PSAT/NMSQT. Taking the PSAT can be good 
practice for the SAT even though their formats differ in length and difficulty. 
 
</P>
<P>
 * Meet with a high school guidance counselor to review current course load and 
plan for senior year. It is important to plan your academic schedule to meet 
the requirements for graduation and eligibility for college admission. Check 
individual colleges for special requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTOBER 
</P>
<P>
 * Take PSAT/NMSQT 
</P>
<P>
 DECEMBER 
</P>
<P>
 * Visit college campuses. Take campus tours, stay overnight, talk to admission 
counselors. Winter break is a good time to check out some of the schools. 
Visiting campuses may help determine, among other things, if you will go away 
to college or commute from home. It will also help you tell if the community 
and campus are places where you would be comfortable spending four years. 
</P>
<P>
 JANUARY 
</P>
<P>
 * Sign up for April SAT 
</P>
<P>
 MARCH 
</P>
<P>
 * Write to any additional colleges 
</P>
<P>
 * Sign up for May/June ACH or April ACT 
</P>
<P>
 APRIL 
</P>
<P>
 * Take SAT or ACT 
</P>
<P>
 * Begin narrowing down your list of colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 It's good to have options when choosing a college, but having too many schools 
to choose from can become a problem. It would be wiser to narrow the choice to 
a reasonable number -- which will make researching and applying easier. If you 
don't narrow your options, you may find you don't have time to really get to 
know any schools ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 MAY 
</P>
<P>
 * Attend a college fair (usually held at high schools) 
</P>
<P>
 * Take Advanced Placement exams (if appropriate) 
</P>
<P>
 * Take ACH (if appropriate) 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider enrolling in a class at a local college, pursuing a summer school 
program at home or away, taking an SAT prep course if you haven't already. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay on track in your quest, but don't let your college goals become your 
motives for everything you do. It is just as important to do the things that 
you enjoy.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to academics, colleges often take note of varied interests and 
community service in evaluating applications. Many want students who are 
well-rounded and willing to give something back to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 JUNE 
</P>
<P>
 * Plan additional college visits in the summer 
</P>
<P>
 * Take ACH (if appropriate) 
</P>
<P>
 JULY/AUGUST 
</P>
<P>
 * Visit colleges 
</P>
<P>
 * Continue to narrow choices 
</P>
<P>
 * Write for application forms 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Year 
</P>
<P>
 SEPTEMBER 
</P>
<P>
 * Sign up for November SAT or October ACT 
</P>
<P>
 * Review your personal records with a guidance counselor to ensure accuracy 
</P>
<P>
 * Request additional applications 
</P>
<P>
 * Make plans to visit colleges if you haven't gotten to them 
</P>
<P>
 * Continue scholarship search -- there are many possibilities from federal, 
state and private sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that you're not alone in the ordeal called college preparation. If 
you have any questions or worries, don't hesitate to talk to a school guidance 
counselor or a college admissions counselor -- or even an undergraduate who has 
already been through the process. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTOBER 
</P>
<P>
 * Attend a regional college fair. They are usually announced at school and in 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Request teacher recommendations. Provide a sheet with your personal 
interests, goals and academic background for teachers to use in preparing 
letters on your behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 * Begin sending in completed applications for schools you know you are 
interested in and for those that have early deadlines. Keep copies of 
everything you send. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sign up for December/January ACH or December ACT 
</P>
<P>
 * Take ACT (if appropriate) 
</P>
<P>
 It is very important to make and keep copies of all your application forms in 
your personal records. It helps you keep track of where you are in the process 
and, if you've made an error that you discover later, you will be able to send 
corrected information. Also, documents can be lost, either in the mail or 
during the reviewing process at the school. It's better to be safe than sorry; 
imagine having to reconstruct an application from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 NOVEMBER 
</P>
<P>
 * Take SAT (if appropriate) 
</P>
<P>
 * Continue filing applications 
</P>
<P>
 * Obtain the free application for federal student aid and/or the financial aid 
form if appropriate 
</P>
<P>
 DECEMBER 
</P>
<P>
 * Take SAT or ACH or ACT 
</P>
<P>
 * Expect to hear from early decision schools 
</P>
<P>
 JANUARY 
</P>
<P>
 * Request transcript to be sent of first-semester grades (if appropriate) 
</P>
<P>
 * Take ACH test (if appropriate) 
</P>
<P>
 APRIL 
</P>
<P>
 * Decide on college and send in tuition deposit 
</P>
<P>
 * Notify other colleges of selection 
</P>
<P>
 MAY 
</P>
<P>
 * Take Advanced Placement exams (if appropriate) 
</P>
<P>
 * Send final transcript 
</P>
<P>
 * Look into housing, orientation course selection, etc., at the campus of 
choice

<P>
 Sitting down and writing an essay for your college application can be 
daunting. The same goes for sifting through all the colleges to select the one 
that's right for you. Application Essay 
</P>
<P>
 Most colleges require applicants to write an essay on a specified topic. Some 
of the most frequent topics: write a personal statement that gives the 
admission committee a sense of you as an individual; write about a life 
experience that has influenced your personal and intellectual growth; write 
about your educational objectives and/or your career objectives, or choose a 
prominent person you would like to interview and explain why. 
</P>
<P>
 A common regret among seniors who fall victim to procrastination during the 
college application season is that they didn't leave enough time do a strong 
essay -- including the time to revise and carefully edit it. The application 
essay can be a simple task or a traumatic ordeal, depending upon how you decide 
to go about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Time becomes an important factor for the essay and the entire application 
procedure. As many college-bound seniors will tell you, starting early is wise 
if you want time to overcome any unexpected obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be afraid to talk yourself up. The main goal is to sell yourself to gain 
admission. However, remember to be sincere and be yourself. Admission officers 
read hundreds of essays and can easily spot a fake. 
</P>
<P>
 Also remember that, in order for the admission panel to get an idea of who you 
are, they need to know not only what you do but what you think. So try to 
express your thoughts and reactions, both positive and negative. A laundry list 
of facts won't tell them enough about you. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be afraid to ask a teacher, family member or friend to read your essay 
and give you some constructive advice. And always make a copy of your essay for 
your files, just as you should for all your college application documents. 
Choosing Colleges 
</P>
<P>
 Picking the college that you may one day attend for four years of your life is 
difficult. The importance of this decision is the main reason why you should 
explore all of your options. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it shopping for the colleges that best fit your personality and 
expectations. Like any consumer, you should take into consideration your budget 
and what is on your shopping list. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, your shopping list should include characteristics of the 
college, including size, location, student population, social life on campus 
and academic programs. Ask lots of questions. What is the average class size? 
The available majors? Are dorms co-ed or single-sex? What is the ratio of males 
to females? How do students get around? What is the community like? What are 
the recreational possibilities? 
</P>
<P>
 Always try to visit a campus before applying. If that's not possible, at least 
make sure that you visit the campus you agree to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 While you are on campus, try to sit in on some lectures to get a handle on 
what it will be like if you decide to attend that college. Check out the dorms, 
libraries and other facilities. Also, talk to some students to get the lowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students get caught up in college shopping and lose sight of the main 
objective -- to find the college that will best prepare them for the working 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is important to shop around, you should thoroughly research which 
campuses offer your major (if you've decided on one) or courses that interest 
you. Remember, this is four years of your life, and you want to get the most 
you can out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students regret not going to the college of their choice -- they were 
encouraged by others, most often their parents, to attend a different school. 
</P>
<P>
 While you and your parents should discuss what college you should attend, it's 
undoubtedly to your advantage to go to the college you feel best about. 
However, it is imperative that both parties keep an open mind so that a 
compromise can be made. 
</P>
<P>
 When looking into colleges, consider all the possibilities, such as a college 
in another state or even another country.  
</P>
<P>
 As you visit colleges you have your eye on, keep your shopping list close at 
hand; it will help you be a smart shopper.

THE FIRST FOOT IN THE DOOR IS USUALLY AN INTERN'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do presidential adviser George Stephanopoulos, Washington Post journalist 
Bob Woodward and Tabitha Soren of MTV news have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 They all started their careers as interns. 
</P>
<P>
 Internships have long been important channels into careers for high school and 
college students or recent graduates. But how does that aspiring journalist or 
government bureaucrat find the best one? 
</P>
<P>
 Two recent graduates of Stanford University in Palo Alto have compiled a book 
that attempts to answer that question. 
</P>
<P>
 "America's Top 100 Internships" (Villard Books, $16) promises to help make 
life a bit easier for students seeking the best internships in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The title is a bit of misnomer. The 100 companies named in the book offer more 
than 11,000 openings for high school, college and graduate students. 
</P>
<P>
 The book was researched and written by Mark Oldman and Samer Hamadeh, who say 
they wanted to compile something more than "phone book directories" and data 
bases that they encountered in their own search for internships. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is indexed for job type and geographical location. The entries tell 
the potential intern everything from selectivity and compensation to quality of 
life at the various internships. There is also a "busywork meter" showing the 
level of menial tasks that may be required. 
</P>
<P>
 Oldman says doing chores can be beneficial in the long run. "Some industries, 
such as entertainment, have a lot of busywork," he said. "What makes it worth 
it is that you get to network and meet top minds in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The authors interviewed former interns from all the internships and give 
fairly in-depth accounts of what each job is like. From Lucasfilm in San 
Rafael, the production company of "Star Wars" mastermind George Lucas, to 
Microsoft, Marvel Comics, the National Basketball Assn. and the Central 
Intelligence Agency, students get a taste of what's available. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the essential information, each entry usually has colorful descriptions 
of "perks" available to interns. For example, Boeing interns get to "test-fly" 
planes in the company's flight simulator, while Robert Mondavi Winery interns 
are invited to evening wine tastings. 
</P>
<P>
 Interns at Apple Computer set their own hours, participate in seminars and 
sporting events, receive discounts on Apple products and "great pay" ($600 to 
$1,100 a week). Interns at Intel, which produces computer chips used worldwide, 
earn $450 to $1,000 a week, get round-trip travel, housing options, rental 
cars, seminars and a crack at a permanent position. By 1996, according to the 
book, 70% of all college graduates Intel hires will come from its intern 
alumni.

THINKING REVIEW ; A 'THINKING' MAGICIAN PLOTS NO-FRILLS HEAD TRIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Penn and Teller have made a career of telling their audiences the truth about 
magicians, but it bears repeating: The magician's world has long gone 
corporate, the stuff of big touring rock concerts in which David Copperfield 
and Doug Henning seem to need arenas and stadiums to contain their 
extravaganzas. 
</P>
<P>
 In this regard alone, magician Max Maven is a relieving throwback to a more 
modest era. His show, "Thinking in Person," at Way Off Broadway, includes 
himself, three chairs and maybe four props. Even Steve Andreno's lights, though 
sometimes dramatic, are deliberately spare. 
</P>
<P>
 As the title suggests, Maven is after something quainter and more cerebral 
than buzz-sawing curvaceous blondes in half. 
</P>
<P>
 My companion (among several members of the audience called to the stage on 
Saturday) noted Maven's resemblance to Orson Welles: From the all-black couture 
to the highly manicured beard to a voice rich in sarcasm and basso profundo 
menace, Maven suggests Welles' famous magician persona. 
</P>
<P>
 With one major exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Welles' act, whether it was on "The Tonight Show" or his film on magic and 
fraud, "F Is for Fake," played on our collective skepticism of magic while 
acknowledging its grand tradition. Magic, for Welles, was like cinema or, 
indeed, his "War of the Worlds" radio broadcast: an elaborate act of 
illusionism, deft trickery on the senses. 
</P>
<P>
 Maven, on the other hand, insists to us that he really can read minds. These 
are not simple card tricks, he tells us during his not-so-simple-looking card 
tricks. Of tricksters, he says, with theatrical gravity, "I am with them, but 
not of them." 
</P>
<P>
 So, since Maven insists that this is not just an act, but genuine mentalism, 
he's got a lot to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth about Maven's show comes early on, when he says that he can 
influence the behavior of anyone. He might add that he also can predict some 
behavior, as when three audience members perform musical chairs just as he 
anticipated. Indeed, the pattern of switched chairs, at least on this night, 
was not at all unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 The real test for Maven's, or anyone's, paranormal claims is a scientifically 
controlled double-blind experiment, which prevents any kind of outside 
manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On stage, though, Maven's persona commands respect while daring us to see if 
he can fail. 
</P>
<P>
 He sometimes did Saturday, especially during a complex bit involving "telling" 
men about their past trips abroad. He also missed on identifying two serial 
numbers on a concealed dollar bill, and oddly, drew the same image of a house 
that had been drawn by an audience member, only in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 As Carl Sagan says, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and 
while Maven didn't provide it Saturday, he pulled off a perhaps neater trick: 
letting the audience unwittingly make his show a graceful and classy affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Maven's improvisational skill is enhanced by a charismatic animal magnetism: 
He makes an audience want his act to succeed, if only because we don't want to 
see such a Wellesian charmer slip and fall. Maven may not be reading the 
audience, but he knows what it wants. 
</P>

Ana. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends July 16. $15. (714) 547-8997.

IRANIAN COMEDY: LOTS OF TALK, NO PRATFALLS; THEATER: TWO WORKS IN FARSI AT THE 
IRVINE BARCLAY WILL FLAVOR THE LAUGHS WITH A STRONG DOSE OF REALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Comedy is coming to the Irvine Barclay Theatre tonight and next week. Iranian 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But seriously, folks . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I go to comedy clubs, and watch stand-up comedians on (American) television, 
and I often see people laughing for no reason at all," said Ali Fakhredin, 
writer, director and a star of "A Man in His Dreams," a play billed as a "dark 
musical comedy." It will be presented by the Persian Society on July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see good material sometimes, but most of the time the guy is using dirty 
language as if nothing could (make people) laugh better than this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot even use one single dirty word because that would be the end of my 
career," said Fakhredin, who has been in the U.S. since 1977. Iranian 
audiences, he said, "would kick me out. I would get beat up by eggs or a 
tomato. . . . Supposedly I'm on the stage doing comedy. If you see Eddie 
Murphy, 75% (of his show) I would never let my daughter or child watch that 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fakhredin, who has appeared in a number of Iranian and American 
TV programs, often under the stage name Ali Dean, there are more than 2 million 
Iranians in the United States and 500,000 on the West Coast. Many are in 
self-imposed exile. 
</P>
<P>
 "My people need laughing matter; they are very upset and depressed," Fakhredin 
said. "If I portray a chiropractor practicing in L.A., I make fun, but in the 
right way -- not by giving my character lots of bad words. They want something 
pure, they want reality with their humor. That is the difference between 
Western and Eastern humor." 
</P>
<P>
 "A Man in His Dreams" will be performed in Farsi, as will tonight's offering, 
the Nosrat Vahdat Group's play "The Puzzle." The proximity of two Persian plays 
on the Barclay schedule is coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comedians here often make people laugh with the way they fall down or the way 
they act or make faces," said Sam Vahdat, co-producer of "The Puzzle." "In 
Persian comedy, they make people laugh with talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Vahdat should know. He has spent a great deal of time with the star of "The 
Puzzle," once one of Iran's premiere actor-comedians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying this (only) because he's my father -- he's (been) called 'the 
Bob Hope of Iran,' " Vahdat said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Nosrat Vahdat, 71, began acting when he 16, and was invited to work at 
Tehran's biggest theater when he was 30. He made 45 motion pictures, producing 
and directing all of them. He continued at the theater for a year after the 
1979 revolution in which the shah was deposed, but when war broke out with 
Iraq, he felt performing was too dangerous, and he stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Vahdat came to the States recently to visit his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved here 20 years ago and didn't see my father until he came to see me 
nine months ago," said Sam Vahdat. (The Iranian government wouldn't let Nosrat 
leave the country, and Sam, a U.S. citizen, would have been pressed into 
military service had he returned to Iran to visit. Since the government 
approved Nosrat Vahdat's U.S. visit last year, he has been staying with his son 
in West Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we walk in the street," Sam Vahdat said, "Iranians see him, stop 
him, talk to him, and say, 'When are we going to see you perform?' " Nosrat 
Vahdat took that as his cue to form a theater troupe here. 
</P>
<P>
 "He trained some amateur actors here -- really amateur -- for 3 1/2 months 
before he felt they could go on," Vahdat explained. "He wrote 'The Puzzle,' and 
we've been showing it all over the United States and Canada. It goes to London 
in August, then (my father) returns to Iran." 
</P>
<P>
 The story line of "The Puzzle," about a businessman and his young wife, is 
simple: The woman lies to her husband, creating a number of problems, and asks 
the manager of the businessman's company, played by Vahdat, to cover her lies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is that couples must be honest with each other," said Sam Vahdat. 
"Nothing political, nothing complicated. All of my father's movies and plays, 
the families go with the kids and they laugh for two hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Fakhredin's "The Man in His Dreams" is more complex. It opens with stand-up 
comedy focusing on how the Iranian community in the United States relates to 
the people, culture and language here. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first act, I do all the different characters, with singing and 
dancing," Fakhredin said. "In the second act, there are two characters. One is 
an Iranian reporter working for CNN wanting to interview the other character, 
(an official in the Ayatollah Khomeini's government) who is arriving at Orange 
County airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second character, Hajagha Meir Anarake, might be a minister of defense or 
prime minister. Haji doesn't understand English, so he takes everything the 
wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fakhredin believes that of all Western playwrights, Iranians hold 17th-Century 
French dramatist Moliere in the highest esteem.  
</P>
<P>
 "He is very close to our culture; he is a similar spirit," Fakhredin said. 
"How he creates characters, and the whole play, has a touch of the Eastern, and 
he was key in bringing the culture of the West to the East. Moliere has lots of 
humor; he's No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
 "Moliere wanted to be an actor. But he was very short and ugly, and he 
couldn't get into the acting business, so he started to write. He wrote plays 
for 12 years, unknown, never performed in the big city, always in the villages, 
doing everything by himself. . . . All of this is very familiar to our 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fakhredin, when Persians traveling to Paris saw Moliere's 'The 
Doctor in Spite of Himself" there were translations immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many parallels," he said. "I haven't been in Iran for 17 years, 
but I know that there are lots of people now who call themselves professional 
who aren't professional, who trick other people and take advantage. In the 
villages of Iran, 'The Doctor in Spite of Himself' is a real story." 
</P>
<P>
 The parallels don't stop there. Fakhredin explained that his Eastern 
Production company is one of seven under the aegis of the Los Angeles-based 
Persian Society, which promotes the arts in the Iranian community. Fakhredin's 
own take on "The Doctor in Spite of Himself," also presented by the Persian 
Society, sold out at the Irvine Barclay in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gaining speed," he said. "You're going to see lots of our shows in this 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not easy. We do not have an auditorium or playhouse. We need a 
permanent quarters for Iranian productions, but nobody is stepping forward. I 
talked to Barclay (management for) six months to get this date. I've been 
acting full-time for 16 years, on the road every year for 10 years. For now, 
(it's) just like Moliere." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Nosrat Vahdat Group performs "The Puzzle" tonight; tickets, $20 to $25. 
The Persian Society presents "A Man in His Dreams" on July 17; tickets, $15 to 
$20. Both shows will be performed in Farsi and begin at 8 p.m. in Cheng Hall at 
Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. (714) 854-4646.

ATTENDANCE INCREASES IN CERRITOS CENTER'S SECOND SEASON; VENUES: MANAGER 
ATTRIBUTES SLIGHT RISE TO PROGRAMMING AND TO AUDIENCES' INCREASED FAMILIARITY 
WITH THE FACILITY.

 Paid attendance during the first full season at the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts averaged 81% of capacity, up two points from last year's 
inaugural, abbreviated season, center officials announced Thursday. The 
center's 1993-94 season ended in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Center general manager Victor Gotesman said he was pleased with the new 
numbers, given that paid-attendance rates for new performing-arts facilities 
typically decline as the venue's newness wears off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're great," Gotesman said, attributing the slight rise largely to 
second-year programming as well as to audiences' increased familiarity with the 
center. The percentage of sold-out shows during the latest season jumped to 
61%, seven points better than the center's five-month debut season, he added. 
"It's hard to beat that." 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos tallied 103 performances during the season that opened last August. 
Among the most popular attractions were Whitney Houston, George Benson, Paul 
Anka and the Vienna Choir Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket revenue for the season totaled roughly $4 million, Gotesman said. For 
the 1994-95 fiscal year, the city of Cerritos, which owns and operates the 
center, has approved a budget of $8.4 million, up $600,000 from the previous 
year. And, as it has annually, the City Council allotted $2 million in 
programming subsidies and another $2 million for operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Center officials also reported that about 30% of 159,946 available tickets 
have been sold for the coming season, which starts Sept. 16. That exceeds the 
number of advance tickets sold by the same time last year, said center 
marketing director Walter Morlock. It brings current ticket revenues to $2.1 
million toward this year's goal of $5 million in advance sales.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased," Morlock said. "We're shooting to be at 50% of our total 
ticket revenue goal by the end of this month."

 Clarification -- A June 30 Calendar story reported that Ticketmaster adamantly 
opposes listing service charges on the face of each ticket. The firm's 
objection was specifically related to Pearl Jam's March 13 Chicago performance 
and does not represent Ticketmaster's standard policy, which is to print 
service fees separately on each ticket.
