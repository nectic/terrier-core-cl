 "It is strange how deeply colors seem to penetrate one, like scent." 
</P>
<P>
 This quote from "Middlemarch" -- the frontispiece to Alexander Theroux's "The 
Primary Colors" -- is the most apt of intros for this playfully profound, 
one-of-a-kind book. Theroux's lengthy essays on blue, yellow and red -- one 
essay per color -- seem to spring from an almost pagan worship of everything 
that color can inspire in us. Reading the book can be a heady, intoxicating 
experience -- you have to put it down every 10 pages or so and take a deep 
breath -- because Theroux gives his words the same tactile, almost talismanic 
shimmer as the colors he invokes. 
</P>
<P>
 The invocation draws on personal memories and literary anecdotes, fragments of 
art history, military history, politics, movie references, archeological 
tidbits, gossip, poetry, prejudices, scientific arcana, sporting lore. It draws 
on just about everything, promiscuously. 
</P>
<P>
 Theroux's style is a puzzlement: Discursive and singsong, yet ferociously 
driven. There's real propulsion to his free-associative japes and aperc us. He 
probably could have continued adding association to association forever but he 
knows when to draw the curtain on his three acts. This is no rambling, 
dolled-up database of a book, no mere cataloguing of caprice. It's something 
far stranger than that -- despite its surface calm it's almost a mad book. For 
Theroux, there's something anthropomorphic about color; color has its own life 
in a way that's powerfully unsettling and sensual. His feeling for the primary 
colors (for all color, really) is so piercingly intimate that it's creepy. He 
makes us feel pretty stupid for looking at, say, the color blue in our everyday 
lives and seeing . . . the color blue. 
</P>
<P>
 When Theroux looks at the primary colors he sees an entire latticework of 
connections. (His book is a mansion of filaments.) Here is Theroux on yellow: 
"It is the color of cowardice, third prize, the caution flag on auto speedways, 
adipose tissue, scones and honey, the nimbus of saints, school buses, urine, 
New Mexico license plates, illness, the cheeks of penguins, the sixth dog's 
livery in greyhound racing, highway signs, Pennzoil, and the oddly lit hair 
before adulthood of all Aborigines. Easter is yellow, so is Spring, and much of 
the beauty of autumn. It is redolent of old horn, dead coins, southernwood, and 
the generous sun. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 This is more than a checklist: It's practically an incantation. Theroux has 
written novels and poetry, and there's a novelist's ardor for the precise 
detail in these words, as well as a poet's unblinkered eye ("the cheeks of a 
penguin"). His perceptions call up overwhelming emotions for us because he 
recognizes how color and feeling are twinned. Colors are our madeleines. 
Theroux doesn't really create new emotions in us; he connects us to our own 
private emulsion of mood and memory. He makes us register images we never 
thought we knew ("the cheeks of a penguin"). We don't necessarily make the same 
connections he does but we can recognize his passion for getting it all out. 
It's a passion that goes beyond will, as if he were a medium for a torrent of 
imagery that, finally, has its own wild, whorled life. 
</P>
<P>
 This may explain why "The Primary Colors," while it may seem to be a species 
of personal memoir, is also an oddly distanced book. We don't feel we really 
"know" Theroux after we've read it, and that may be part of his magician's act. 
Now you see him, now you don't. The book is both intimate and imperial. It's 
something of a tease. He brings us very close to the root of his mood: He 
writes how the snowfall was blue the day he was engaged to be married; of a 
blue bistro he remembers in Montparnasse. But he also talks -- in virtually the 
same breath -- of how hallucinations on mescaline are supposed to be blue, how 
blue is not mentioned in the Bible, how a blue spot (which gradually 
disappears) can be found on the lower back of newborn Asian babies. There's 
something closed-off about Theroux's openness. Perhaps it's because he's 
employing his own life as a kind of poetic conceit. His fantasias are 
experienced on the same level as his privacies. 
</P>
<P>
 Theroux doesn't have a generalizing mind; he's not trying for a Unified Color 
Field Theory. Even though his book deals with primary colors -- colors that 
can't be made by mixing other colors together and from which nearly all other 
colors are mixed -- he understands that a color can be too pure. He prefers a 
mongrelization of tones in his primary hues; it suits his poetic mongrel style. 
Impurity brings out the portraitist in him. He quotes an L. E. Sissman poem 
that begins, "My mother, with a skin of crepe de Chine/ Predominantly 
yellow-colored, sheer/ Enough to let the venous blue show through. . . ." He 
cites Melville on Queequeg's face in "Moby-Dick," "of a dark, purplish yellow 
color, here and there struck over with large, blackish squares." (Theroux has a 
great instinct for the unfamiliar quotation from the familiar writer.) 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer catholicity of colors -- the way they can embrace a yin and yang of 
form and feeling -- has an engulfing power for Theroux. Yellow, he writes, can 
accommodate size -- a 10-wheeler truck or a kernel of corn. Red symbolizes east 
to the Chippewa, the direction west in Tibet. It is "a color with a strange 
gigantic life, an enigma encompassing everything from sunsets to the roseate 
tint of our insides." Blue is "primordial simplicity and infinite space which, 
being empty, can contain everything and nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Theroux has his chichi, mushy-mystic side -- everything and nothing don't 
always add up to something. But he's set himself a large and fundamental task 
here. He's trying to get across how colors affect us in ways we can't fully 
acknowledge. He's trying to find a language to express the inexplicable and 
he's probably right in reaching for a fervid fanciness in the prose. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the fanciness is grounded. Theroux isn't afraid of examining colors 
in the light of hard scientific fact. For him, analyzing the chemical 
composition of a color only increases its strangeness. The further you delve 
into science the more you get into philosophy -- into the inexplicable. "The 
Primary Colors" doesn't close out our interest in the subject, it's an opening 
out into a numinous mystery.

THE GENIUS OF AN AGE; THE FLOWERING OF INTELLECTUAL TALENT AND BURST OF 
ORIGINALITY IN ITALY AND FLANDERS AT THE START OF THE 15TH CENTURY STILL 
RETAINS ITS POWER TO IMPRESS US?; THE CIVILIZATION OF EUROPE IN THE 
RENAISSANCE, BY JOHN HALE (ATHENEUM: $35; 648 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 Why should we thrill to "the Renaissance," a period that evokes so much more 
than the dictionary definitions: renascence = rebirth; renaissance = revival of 
art and letters under influence of classical models in the 14th-16th centuries? 
In America, without the survival of firsthand evidence outside of museums, the 
Renaissance remains more idea than reality. 
</P>
<P>
 But we are thrilled because this flowering of intellectual talent in Italy and 
Flanders at the start of the 15th Century spread throughout Europe and retains 
the power to impress us. It was a burst of originality that harnessed the 
classical past, a vaulting ambition that did not overleap itself but was highly 
disciplined, an innovation that has few comparisons today. Everything was new 
and open to experiment in that searing radiance that precedes a storm when 
everything is clear before the rain muddies it. With today's materialism and 
political correctness, the very word Renaissance beckons us back to a Golden 
Age that seems the purer. The answer one looks for from John Hale is more a 
confirmation: Is Renaissance just a nebulous word like genius, or is it an 
enduring part of our heritage? 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, emeritus professor of Italian History at University College, London, 
convinces us that an ideal in a vulgar world was turned into reality by the 
noblest Romans of them all. Even the philosophy and morals of the ancient 
Greeks, such as Plutarch, were respected as their high ideals were adapted. 
Filippo Brunelleschi, for instance, was inspired by the Roman ruins, while Leon 
Battista Alberti, in his design for a Renaissance church in Mantua, embraced 
the classical to enhance the new. 
</P>
<P>
 D. H. Gombrich, in his definitive "The Story of Art," points out that the 
painters of the Renaissance "were so convinced of the superior wisdom of the 
ancients that they believed these classical legends must contain some profound 
and mysterious truth." He cites Botticelli's "Birth of Venus," commissioned by 
Lorenzo de Medici. (Lorenzo later subsidized another one of his employees -- 
Amerigo Vespucci -- to go even farther.) 
</P>
<P>
 All Renaissance artists adapted with styles of their own, Hale writes, though 
united by their sympathy with the past. He quotes Alberti's phrase, "I am never 
less solitary than when alone." 
</P>
<P>
 To know that the Renaissance was indeed a genuine and apt term rather than a 
convenient and expanding label, the roll-call is conclusive: Donatello; 
Ghiberti; Mantegna's Triumph of Julius Caesar, 1500; Leonardo's Last Supper, 
1495-8; Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, 1508-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the greatest was Piero della Francesca, perpetuating Giotto's 
perspective and advancing beyond. Sir David Attenborough once told me that he 
feels "blessed" whenever he stands before the Baptism of Christ in London's 
National Gallery. Aldous Huxley regarded Piero's "Resurrection" as the greatest 
picture in the world, and Dame Freya Stark agreed, feeling that one can take 
this painting "as the embodiment of European civilization, a sort of 
highlight." 
</P>
<P>
 It is this sense of joy that I needed from Professor Hale, who is so admired 
by his fellow academics, but that is not his game. He does not take the easy 
option -- and at times his qualifications take us on so many detours that one 
wishes he did -- but proceeds on a higher, intellectual plain. 
</P>
<P>
 This can, of course, be a great strength. Managing to place Europe in 
perspective regardless of creed, religion or war, Hale sees evidence of a far 
greater Ottoman influence on Europe than most of us in the West have been 
classically taught. 
</P>
<P>
 In his "Utopia" (1516), Thomas More referred to political behavior "in Europe 
. . . and especially in those parts where the faith and religion of Christ 
prevails." In that reference, Hale writes, More was accepting "that the Ottoman 
Turks were likely to remain the masters of Greece and the Balkans, much of 
Albania and the whole of Bosnia. By the time Sultan Suleiman in the 1530s added 
to his other titles 'Lord of Europe,' they had moved up from Bucharest, 
Belgrade and Budapest to within a few days' march of Vienna. There they were 
held. In a medal struck at about the same time, the bust of Emperor Charles V 
was shown supported by an angel and haunted by the turbaned profile of 
Suleiman. That summed up what was to remain the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a revelation, for though I have studied Turkish history I had no idea 
of the close affinity between the Christian rulers of Europe and the Sultans. I 
knew of Suleiman's invasion, which was bogged down, literally, at the gates of 
Vienna by a quagmire of mud due to torrential rain. How astonishing the outcome 
if the sun had shone for Suleiman and the Renaissance had been largely Ottoman. 
Instead, the Turks withdrew, leaving their sacks of coffee, a novelty which the 
Viennese put to their advantage by creating a delicacy in the shape of the 
Turkish crescent, which they could dunk in this delicious new beverage: the 
croissant. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale reaches the Renaissance after 200 pages, dating it between 1450 and 1620. 
In 1492, Marsilio Ficino described it as a Golden Age that "restored to light 
the liberal arts which were almost extinct: grammar, poetry, painting, 
sculpture, architecture, music." It witnessed the most concentrated wave of 
intellectual and cultural energy that had yet passed over the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale explains that as Europe's population grew, so did the need for material 
possessions of the highest quality, and cites Leonardo's whirlwinds, which 
hurled down consumer objects like clocks, spectacles and wine barrels. Leonardo 
"anguished over the intellectual difficulty of relating art to nature," Hale 
writes, "but accepted money to use his art to divert a court with emblems, 
pageant floats and backdrops for entertainment," as well as his own material 
comfort: "O human misery -- how many things must you serve for money." 
</P>
<P>
 As a counterpart to Leonardo's whirlwinds, Falstaff cried, "Let the sky rain 
potatoes" as he embraced Mistress Ford in "The Merry Wives of Windsor," though 
apparently this referred to "the new luxury vegetable imported from America, 
which for a while, because of its testicular shape, was considered an 
aphrodisiac." Professor Hale gives us a number of pleasantly salacious 
observations like this along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 In my ignorance I thought of the Renaissance as primarily Italian (and still 
do in spite of Hale's broader view), centered around the genius produced by 
Florence, Venice, Mantua and Rome, which was not derived from countries 
outside. I appreciate that the European influence became far-reaching, but am 
not convinced it did so from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
 In his chapter on the transformation in architecture, Hale does concentrate on 
Italy, where "there was a continuity of contact with the works of antiquity, a 
shared approach to their characteristics and a constant experimentation with 
them by architects in one city well aware of what was being built in another." 
But while he examines examples of architecture and paintings scrupulously, 
sometimes their bearing on the Renaissance seems incidental. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes 321 pages before Hale concedes that in spite of the originality of 
the Netherlands artists "it is Italy that has traditionally been seen as 
representing the cultural tone of Renaissance Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 I feel hesitant to tilt at such erudition, which makes the reader feel 
inadequate with so many names dropped and nothing left out. Generalization 
swamps the interesting particular. And though this is hardly a picture book at 
a length of 648 pages, the illustrations are poorly reproduced and none are in 
color. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeniably, this tome is academic, admirable, epic . . . all such things, but 
if only it was less overwhelming! Tragically, Sir John Hale suffered a severe 
stroke on its completion, leaving him unable to edit as he might have wished; 
perhaps he would have pruned the beast down. A colleague stepped in nobly and 
did the work for him, but he was plainly and understandably reluctant to cut a 
paragraph. 
</P>
<P>
 The book ends with a happy quotation from Raphael's father, the painter 
Giovanni Santi: 
</P>
<P>
 In this splendid, noble art  
</P>
<P>
 So many have been famous in our age  
</P>
<P>
 They make any other time seem poor. (1490)  
</P>
<P>
 I cannot help but wish that Hale had taken this as his thesis from the outset 
instead of arriving at it at the end by such a zigzag route.

FOOD, GLORIOUS FOOD; THE BOOK OF INTIMATE GRAMMAR, BY DAVID GROSSMAN . 
TRANSLATED FROM THE HEBREW BY BETSY ROSENBERG (FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX: $22; 
363 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Geoffrey Wheatcroft, Geoffrey Wheatcroft, a British newspaper columnist, is 
completing a book about Zionism and its effect on Diaspora Jewry. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one way, I sometimes sense, American Jews envy the Israelis. With all the 
problems of life in Israel, the difficulties and the dangers, the anxieties and 
the moral ambiguities, its people are living out a great historical drama. They 
have been watched and encouraged from afar by those who are not only now the 
largest Jewish community on earth but also a community that has achieved a 
level of security and prosperity quite unknown in previous Jewish history. And 
yet life in California or New York is just too secure and prosperous to be 
challenging or exciting; hence the secret envy. 
</P>
<P>
 And living out a passage of history is a bonus for writers, almost unfair 
advantage. Some South African writers of the last 40 years have been overrated 
(in my judgment, and as I believe literary posterity will also judge) because 
they have been granted a Big Subject, one whose historical and moral importance 
can make our own novels of urban Angst or suburban adultery seem footling. 
Something of the same is true of Israeli writers. Not that they are necessarily 
overrated, individually or collectively. But they would have to admit that they 
are never short of subject. 
</P>
<P>
 David Grossman's specialism is to approach that subject through the eyes of 
childhood. He did so in his last novel, the remarkable though maybe a mite too 
ambitious, "See Under: Love." He has done it again in his new novel "The Book 
of Intimate Grammar." It is a novel of adolescence, the passage from childhood 
experienced by one boy. We meet Aron Kleinfeld at his home in Jerusalem not 
long before his bar mitzvah. Aron is no Huck Finn or Holden Caulfield, but a 
reversed, dreamy boy fascinated by Houdini. Life sets him more and more at an 
angle to his vulgar and plebeian parents. He is not so much solitary as 
introspective: He has a gang of friends from school, but his real life is led 
inside his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman remembers uncannily what it was like to be 12. The discovery of sex 
comes about in fits and starts and sometimes by accident. Well before Aron 
falls in love for the first time, he finds a packet of pornographic photographs 
behind his father's sock drawer, and studies them with understandable 
puzzlement and wonder. He wonders as well about the meaning of life, if there 
is one. "Has anyone ever actually seen a soul? Maybe people like Winston 
Churchill and Albert Schweitzer and Ben-Gurion have souls. Okay. They're 
spiritual giants, but what about the others? Does Papa have one? Does Mama?" 
</P>
<P>
 As the author accurately recalls, the real dominant passion of early 
adolescence isn't lust but gluttony. This book has a -- in the correct sense of 
the world -- Dickensian relish for food of all kinds: scrambled eggs, salami 
sandwiches (eaten illicitly with butter by his father), "peppery Yemenite skhug 
," falafel after the movies followed by pumpkin seeds, and then frozen custard, 
Creambo and chocolate twisters at the Cafe Allenby. Aron's mother even turns 
instinctively to culinary imagery when she explains what virtue meant in the 
days when she was young and unmarried. Her husband-to-be "never laid a finger 
on me, not him or anyone before him, not like girls these days who serve the 
compote before the forspeiz." 
</P>
<P>
 More even than taste, the book is shot through with descriptions you can 
almost feel and smell. Aron is sometimes obsessed with foul odors. Or he 
presses himself against his mother's body, "into her soft, saggy waistline, her 
heaving bosom, and the perspiring nest under her arms. . . ." There is a good 
deal of this almost painfully precise detail in the subplot of Papa's rather 
humiliating connection with Edna Bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all of Grossman's books, his two fascinating works of reportage as well 
as fiction, "The Book of Intimate Grammar" is forcefully and strikingly 
well-written (and, like his two previous novels, it is quite excellently 
translated from the Hebrew by Betsy Rosenberg). Now and again his intoxication 
with language carries him away: a sentence that reads "Like egg white folded 
evenly into batter so his days were stirred into time" might be a candidate for 
the old "Block that metaphor" column in the New Yorker. And occasionally there 
are signs of inattention. Although the author doubtless meant to tell us that 
Madame Nikova the ballet teacher spoke with a thick Russian accent, he maybe 
didn't mean to tell us this twice within 20 pages. But these are lapses. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning of the novel we know where we are, in a country where roads 
are still strewn with burnt-out wrecks of vehicles from the War of 
Independence. Slowly we learn when we are. References to politicians are echoed 
by references to movie stars such as Sean Connery and sportsmen like Cassius 
Clay; this is the mid-1960s. (And there is, by the way, one other lapse of the 
author's own youthful memory. Aron plays fantasy soccer with "the legendary 
George Banks as goalkeeper." Legendary is the word; I can assure Grossman that 
the goalie of the England team that won the 1966 World Cup was Gordon Banks.) 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the last chapter, the date -- though still not mentioned as such -- 
becomes precisely clear. One of Aron's friends says: Why doesn't the war just 
start so they can get it over with, "and it wasn't hard to guess what he was 
saying, that we have to smear those Arabs once and for all." It is 1967. The 
country is on edge and living on its nerves, Aaron's father's army knapsack is 
packed, national sport is suspended and . . . but, although this isn't a 
thriller, it would be wrong to give away the denouement of the last chapter. 
Here is the Big Subject, which has been implied but never stated all the way 
through. A final problem is set for Aron, in his all-absorbing role as Houdini, 
to escape from. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers of Grossman's books will know what a skillful writer he is, and he 
shows it yet again. He doesn't consistently resolve the novelist's first 
technical problem; through whose eyes are we seeing events? And even at the 
end, I felt, not disappointment but dissatisfaction: This very gifted writer 
had once again come close to writing a perfectly finished masterpiece, but 
instead merely written a most poignant and engaging book.

RICHARD EDER: A PLACE FOR POETS; THE FADING SMILE: POETS IN BOSTON, FROM ROBERT 
FROST TO ROBERT LOWELL TO SYLVIA PLATH, 1955-1960, BY PETER DAVISON (ALFRED A. 
KNOPF: $24; 346 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 We think of our major cities as metropolises -- New York, Los Angeles, 
Chicago, Seattle -- and by that measure Boston doesn't begin to qualify. It is 
relatively small by population and economic clout. It has bounce but not much 
bounce-back; and the booms and rebirths it manages, from time to time, 
dissipate as inevitably as early-season Red Sox leads. The New York Times has 
bought its flagship paper, the idiosyncratic Globe; and though it still has a 
railroad, the long-distance trains all run to New York, apart from one shaky 
departure daily to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Boston has an undeniable hold on the nation's imagination. There is 
history's nostalgia, of course; and the fact that Boston manages to look and 
act so much the way nostalgia wants it to look and act -- not like a theme park 
but cockily, and enjoying it. There are the universities and the tidal vigor of 
tens of thousands of students washing in from all over the world and washing 
out again -- on a cultural foreshore small enough to boil up at a weather 
change, and too big for an umbrella. There is, still, the literary legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in a while, legends reignite. Peter Davison's "The Fading Smile" is a 
chronicle of a notable instance. In the mid-1950s, as he writes, Boston became 
"one of the most vital milieux for poetry in the history of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 For six or seven years the Boston area -- including Cambridge, of course -- 
saw a remarkable confluence of poets. There was Robert Frost from the 
generation of the Titans. And, for longer or shorter periods, with profound or 
more casual attachments and interactions, there were many of the principal 
figures of a later generation: Robert Lowell, Richard Wilbur, Sylvia Plath, Ann 
Sexton, Stanley Kunitz, Donald Hall, W. S. Merwin, Adrienne Rich and a 
half-dozen others. And although Elizabeth Bishop didn't settle in Boston until 
somewhat later, she was something of a presence through her vital poetic links 
with Lowell. 
</P>
<P>
 Davison, a poet and editor who was one of the group, centers upon the five 
years between 1955 and 1960. For some of the poets -- Lowell, Sexton, Plath, 
Rich -- it was a time when they would achieve or begin a transition from older 
styles of work into the intense, stripped-down emotion of what has come to be 
called confessional poetry. Others -- Wilbur, Merwin and Hall, for example -- 
were writing quite differently. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a school but a set of trails converging on a water-hole, diverging 
afterward and marked by the meeting. Davison and Philip Booth were among the 
young writers regularly enlisted for "Getting Frost Home Before Midnight." The 
old poet was so revved up after his readings that he had to be walked up and 
down Cambridge "talking his way back to earth again." The young Adrienne Rich 
would regularly attend upon Frost, who didn't take women poets seriously and 
tended to ignore her. Later, after a close relationship with Donald Hall, she 
abandoned the poet-pack, disappeared, and re-emerged in her fiercely lucid 
feminist splendor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexton and Plath studied writing under Lowell and met afterward for martinis 
at the Ritz, along with George Starbuck. When Lowell began one of his terrible 
breakdowns in class, Sexton was quick off the mark to put it in verse. "I find 
this boily creature in your place," she wrote, "find you disarranged, squatting 
on the window sill, / irrefutably placed up there, / like a hunk of some big 
frog / watching us through the V / of your woolen legs." 
</P>
<P>
 At work on "Life Studies," the lurching, patrician Lowell -- who consulted 
everyone on his first drafts and itinerant lines as if the world of poetry were 
his yacht and all hands were expected to turn to -- forged a close link with 
Kunitz, a generation older. Richard Wilbur, whose subtle celebratory writing 
made him the golden poet of the early 1950s, was eclipsed by his gut-busting 
confessional juniors. They couldn't disregard him but they were patronizing. 
"Mr. Wilbur never goes too far yet he never goes far enough," Randall Jarrell 
wrote. Sylvia Plath remarked that to read Lowell after Wilbur "is like good 
shocking brandy after a too lucidly sweet dinner wine." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Britain's Bloomsbury, they are strenuously documented. They wrote 
letters, memoirs and sketches about themselves and each other; so did their 
friends, spouses and lovers. Davison avails himself of what has been published 
and attributes it scrupulously. But he does more. "The Fading Smile" is the 
work of a man who revisits his college class 30 years later. He has his own 
stories and memories, and the shared memories of his old classmates. He has his 
own perspective, that of someone who for half a lifetime has been one of the 
most faithful and discriminating poetry editors in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Son of a minor English poet who became a leading poetry bureaucrat in this 
country -- he ran the writing program at the University of Colorado -- Davison 
was brought up as a PAP (Poetical American Prince.) All the leading poets came 
to his home; he recalls his mother expelling the young Lowell for rudeness. 
Dinners were continual recitations by his father and others. By the time he 
moved to Boston, he had left poetry behind and taken up theater. Soon the 
ferment brought him back, notably in the avid person of Plath. 
</P>
<P>
 Davison portrays their brief affair compellingly and with a touch of comedy. 
She seems to have found him insufficiently scary. He found her too scary; after 
she told him of a suicide attempt he took to his bed for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 When Davison showed Frost his poems the old poet grunted out a memorable 
caution to a young poet's self-important pain: "Not too much sadness. Not so 
much of the sadness." There is a diverting account of the Poet's Theater, which 
put on works by Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, as well as a 
hard-to-visualize version of "Finnegan's Wake." There are sympathetic portraits 
of Merwin, Sissman, Booth and Kunitz, among others; and edgier accounts of 
Wilbur, Sexton and Donald Hall. Davison is best when edgy. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a wonderful conversation with William Alfred, a playwright ("Hogan's 
Goat"), a long-time English professor at Harvard, and one of the book's saintly 
figures. (Another is John Sweeney, who ran Harvard's Poetry Room and provided 
kindly support to struggling poets. When a depressed Merwin said he needed to 
find a real job, Sweeney told him of a cemetery that was moving and needed 
workers to shift the corpses: "It might be a very good job for a writer.") 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred described Lowell struggling onstage during intermission at the Old 
Howard burlesque house and delivering the first public reading of "Skunk Hour" 
between strippers. Alfred was a devoted friend, and helped soothe the poet when 
police took him to the hospital after a violent breakdown. "The heartbreaking 
thing about anyone who is very sick is that there are moments when the same 
person looks out from the mad face and asks for some kind of collaboration," he 
told Davison. He also recalled the driven Lowell telling him that the true 
needle in the flesh, cited by St. Paul, was not concupiscence but ambition." It 
was heartbreaking.

A BIOGRAPHER'S BIOGRAPHY; DR. JOHNSON AND MR. SAVAGE, BY RICHARD HOLMES 
(PANTHEON: $23; 272 PP.)  
</P>

 We can see them walking together around St. James's Square in London, exalted 
by their shared tastes in literature, high-spirited, exchanging anecdotes and 
allusions with all the brio of those learned in the world as well as books. And 
yet the friendship between Samuel Johnson and Richard Savage has seemed, to the 
doctor's more learned biographers, to be a rare moment of weakness when he left 
Parnassus in order to lie in the gutter. Boswell described Savage's character 
as one marked by "profligacy, insolence, and ingratitude," although he himself 
should have recalled that such people are often the best company in the world. 
The facts would seem to be on his side, of course; Savage was about to be 
hanged for murder when he was granted a royal pardon, and he ended his life in 
a debtor's prison. What could he possibly have to do with the Great Cham, the 
compiler of the Dictionary, the editor of the Rambler and author of "The Vanity 
of Human Wishes"? 
</P>
<P>
 This is the conundrum that Richard Holmes attempts to solve in "Dr. Johnson 
and Mr. Savage;" he describes it as "the biography of a biography," since he is 
concerned with removing the accretions of literary mythology and pious 
memorializing that are supposed to have covered these two early 18th Century 
writers. So let us go back to the nights in St. James's Square, where Johnson 
and Savage patrolled the streets together among what Holmes depicts as "the 
tavern signs, the shuttered house-fronts; the moonlight and the dark alleys; 
the slumbering beggars, the footpads and the Night Watch." Johnson is in his 
late 20s (Savage is approximately 10 years older), a strange, large, shambling 
man, prone to nervous spasms, ugly, half-blind, marked by scrofula. He is also 
subject to moods of melancholy, depression and despair. He had achieved very 
little as a failed schoolmaster in his native Lichfield; he was the unhappy 
husband of a woman 20 years his senior, and he could see very little ahead of 
him except the monotonous grind of hack work for London publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes describes the relationship between Johnson and Savage as one resembling 
pupil and teacher, but it is likely that Savage could educate Johnson in 
nothing but the darker secrets of the London world. Another explanation for 
their strange friendship might be found in the mere fact of companionship -- 
Savage had found a lonely provincial literator who would listen to his stories 
without feeling the need to correct them, while Johnson had found a 
high-spirited and exciting friend who could literally, to use an anachronistic 
phrase, "take him out of himself." Savage had confronted, and mocked, the world 
-- just as Johnson, with all his physical and nervous disabilities, longed to 
do. The two men found an ideal relationship, providing comfort and inspiration 
in equal measure. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Holmes' contention, then, that Johnson was hardly "a sage from boyhood" 
but an awkward and impressionable young man. That in itself is hardly 
surprising, but the strength of Holmes' book resides in his determined efforts 
to recapture the living figures who tend to prove so elusive in literary 
biography. He is very good, in particular, with Johnson's thwarted sexuality; 
it seems likely that the younger man was deeply affected by Savage's own ready 
and open acceptance of sexual experience and, although he does not go so far as 
to state emphatically that they visited brothels together, the implication is 
clear enough. But there was more to their relationship than the pursuit of 
erotic adventure. Holmes has a marvelous chapter entitled "Night," for example, 
in which he suggests that the two men were twin subversives, political radicals 
who despised the claims of wealth and the prerogatives of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Here we must concentrate upon the career of Savage himself, at least as it 
appears in Johnson's own "Life of Mr. Richard Savage": "He lodged as much by 
Accident as he dined and passed the Night, sometimes in mean Houses . . . 
sometimes in Cellars among the Riot and Filth of the meanest and most 
profligate of the Rabble." His story, according to Johnson, is as wretched as 
any in the history of English literature -- Savage was the abandoned child of 
Lady Macclesfield, who disowned him at birth, tried to have him shipped off to 
the American plantations, but then consigned him to a London cobbler where he 
might live "in Poverty and Obscurity." But this was only the beginning of 
Savage's misfortunes; when he was condemned to death for committing a murder in 
a brothel, his mother urged the Queen to carry out the sentence without thought 
of pardon. It is no wonder that Richard Savage, the poet and playwright, should 
spend much of his literary skill in railing against wealth and privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 That, at least, is what Holmes describes as "the romantic drama" that Johnson 
helped both to maintain and to popularize. It is not necessarily accurate, 
however, and "Dr. Johnson and Mr. Savage" is on one level an instructive 
corrective to the prevalence of literary legends. It seems probable that Lady 
Macclesfield was in fact a loving and attentive mother to her acknowledged 
children, who was herself victimized by Richard Savage in a campaign of 
"terrorizing and persecution;" Savage himself may have in fact only suffered 
delusions that he was an abandoned child, and his real character was 
"dangerous, unstable, ambitious, irascible." It then becomes one of Holmes' 
contentions that Johnson's insecurity and thwarted ambition led him to identify 
with Savage, and thus collude in the romantic fictionalization of his plight. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Holmes throws a quite different light upon the neglect and poverty 
with which he is associated in Johnson's plangent biography. Savage was not 
obscure at all; he was the object of general London attention and was often the 
recipient of gifts from various patrons. Certainly he had enough money to keep 
rooms at Westminster while simultaneously renting what Holmes calls "spacious 
lodgings" in Richmond, outside London, so that he might be close to Alexander 
Pope as well as to a rising generation of nature poets, of whom James Thomson 
was the most illustrious member. What was the source of these funds? The truth 
seems to be that, through intermediaries, Savage had managed to extract 
blackmail money from Lady Macclesfield by promising to suppress a malicious and 
scandalous preface on her conduct. This is the man of whom Johnson wrote, "For 
his Life, or for his Writings, none who could candidly consider his Fortune, 
will think an Apology either necessary or difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Then of course there is the little matter of the murder of which he was found 
guilty and for which he only narrowly escaped hanging; it was the result of an 
affray in a whorehouse, according to Holmes rather than Johnson, where Savage 
behaved in a threatening and ultimately violent manner. After his pardon by the 
Queen, he found yet more of the notoriety for which he always sought, and in 
the process he managed to extort even more blackmail money from Lady 
Macclesfield's relatives. Nothing could save him from himself, however, and he 
died within the walls of a debtor's prison in Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
 So what has happened to this dissipated and disreputable blackmailer? He has 
vanished into the mists of time, to be replaced by the memorable and almost 
mythical figure who is at the center of one of the greatest literary 
biographies ever written in English. Yet Samuel Johnson's "Life of Mr. Richard 
Savage," imaginative memorial as it is, is now perfectly complemented by 
Holme's own volume, which acts as a Baedeker through the reeking purlieus of 
18th Century Grub Street, while at the same time bringing fully to life two of 
the most complex and fascinating characters of English letters.

'THE FELL CLUTCH OF CIRCUMSTANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I eagerly turned to the July 31 cover story, "The Man in the Iron Lung" (by 
Brenda Bell) because I have been powerfully affected by two emotions concerning 
polio: extreme fear of contracting it and profound gratitude to have been 
spared. I try each year to express to my high school history students what it 
was like to live in the shadow of polio, when every unexplained ache was cause 
for alarm. Always I include the reminder that any definition of heroes must 
include the patients and doctors who fought this silent enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, I was caught by surprise as I read through tears to the end; seldom 
has an article so moved me. As Mark O'Brien's contemporary, I saw what my life 
might have been, and I finally understood completely what the pianist Arthur 
Rubinstein meant by his simple creed: "Love life for better or for worse, 
without conditions." He could have been speaking directly of this singular and 
courageous response to what William Ernest Henley called "the fell clutch of 
circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 While I am sorry for what happened to Mark O'Brien 39 years ago, I do not pity 
so interesting and creative a person.

 On the Sunday morning that "The Man in the Iron Lung" appeared in the 
newspaper, I had walked more than a mile to take care of business at the 
pharmacy, automatic teller and supermarket. I arrived home tired and sticky. 
With the car in the shop and buses on strike, there was a depressing feeling of 
helpless immobility. Then I read about Mark O'Brien. Silly me.

 Thank you for the moving article "The Man in the Iron Lung." I had polio, but 
my time in the iron lung ended after four months at age 4. Your research into 
the post-polio syndrome was well presented and your description of the polio 
personality very perceptive.

 Ventilator-dependent patients I know strive for independence, and living at 
home is less restrictive for them than living in an institution. When 
independence is compromised physical loss is magnified. Home-care programs, 
which are so reassuring for the disabled, should be funded with adequate 
resources.

 After reading Bell's article on the extraordinary existence of Mark O'Brien, I 
found that I could not stop thinking of this remarkable man, whose plight could 
be shared by countless others like myself, now in our 40s and having lived 
through the polio epidemic of the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 I've thought a lot about what I could do to make O'Brien's life better and I 
did have one idea. I couldn't help thinking that with Mark's being the big 
baseball fan that he is, wouldn't it be great if the professional baseball 
players got together and set aside a small percentage of their yearly incomes, 
which we know are tremendous, for a trust fund for Mark?

 "The Man in the Iron Lung" did little to enlighten the already negative and 
prejudiced attitudes toward people with differences and disabilities. Bell 
focused on Mark O'Brien's polio and all of its horrific aspects, rather than on 
Mark and his family's accomplishments, which are remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 Today there are more opportunities than ever for people with disabilities, as 
evidenced by the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act and funding for 
home and community-based care. However, our biggest barriers still lie in 
society's exclusion and devaluation of people with disabilities. The use of 
words like "crippled" and "handicapped" throughout the article serve to 
illustrate this. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien just wants what all of us want in our lives; to be considered as a 
person first, to be engaged in productive work and to enjoy satisfying personal 
relationships. That he doesn't seem to have all this is certainly not a 
reflection on O'Brien personally, but on our society.

 Was the point of "The Man in the Iron Lung" to provide a therapy session for 
the non-disabled writer to emote about how awful disability is? We disabled 
people are so tired of the non-disabled using us as subject matter so they can 
reveal their fears. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as if O'Brien was an excuse for Bell's uneducated observations about 
disabilities. O'Brien is a poet, yet his talents as one were hardly mentioned. 
The article was a prime example of the stereotypical stories published about 
the disabled. Why don't you hire disabled writers to write about disability?

COVER STORY: MAKING IT ON MTV; A LOOK AT THE FRESH CROP OF VJS WHO TALK THE 
TALK AND HOPE THEIR NEXT JOB IS EVEN MORE HIGH-PROFILE

 You want your MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 And audiences have wanted it enough to catapult many MTV VJs into 
celebrityhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Basic formula for stardom: If they stand out, they're a success. 
</P>
<P>
 Many we have known have become well known. Cindy's on TV commercials and 
magazines. Daisy's a Revlon girl and has a CNBC talk show. Bill's gonna jam 
with his stand-up on Showtime. Eric lived in "The Real World" in its first 
season. Kennedy, who started at L.A.'s KROQ radio station, recently was named 
one of the women Esquire does not love. Tabitha talked to President Clinton. 
Dr. Dre and Ed Lover got a movie deal out of it. Dan chows down in Burger King 
commercials, searched for his soul on "Route 66" and hounded hoods on "Traps." 
</P>
<P>
 But MTV has new blood in its sinewy 13-year-old veins, with a new breed of VJs 
looking to invade that popular music-vid territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, MTV execs hope the new guys and gals on the rock block will follow 
in their more illustrious predecessors' footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 But just how does one become a beacon of light for the MTV generation? As Joel 
Stillerman, an MTV production vice president, explains it, the most important 
aspect is the least tangible, and probably the most obvious: star quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for someone who really jumps off the screen," he says from his 
New York office. "And they're the hardest to find. But I think we've done a 
good job so far." 
</P>
<P>
 The ones who do get the jobs, he emphasizes, are "the ones who bring a 
different mentality to it. If we do our jobs right (in selecting them), they're 
the ones who stand out. They become well-known in a short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 MTV also wants dynamos who are fun, attractive and knowledgeable about music. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no secret formula," adds Doug Herzog, senior vice president of 
programming. "It's an ongoing effort. We turn over every rock." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest finds: John Sencio, Ed Marques and Idalis. 
</P>
<P>
 Each brings a different edge, a unique side for the restless MTV audience. 
</P>
<P>
 John Sencio, 24, winner of last fall's MTV VJ search, first appeared on the 
network last Thanksgiving. The day before he was still working two jobs: a day 
job in the media department at Harvard University and his four-year night 
position as a doorman at the Hard Rock Cafe in Boston. On a lark, he made a 
quick tape. Two weeks later he got a call that he had the job. "I really 
thought it was a friend joking around," he says. He calls the unexpected stroke 
of luck "very bizarre, that divine finger at play." One day, "I was holding a 
door open for people and the next I was in 60 million homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Stillerman describes Sencio as "the guy who got sucked into the other side of 
the TV set. He epitomizes a lot about our audience that makes him very 
relatable. He's funny, he loves MTV and wants nothing more than to be on it on 
a daily basis, and that shows. He's Every Guy, he's not over the top. He's 
someone you'd hang with. He's got a friendly quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Sencio "has a very credible way of talking to the audience and makes his 
points in a very laid-back way," Herzog adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Marques, on the other hand, talks to the audience in an often rambling, but 
always cerebral, mishmash that viewers seem to have glommed onto. The 
31-year-old San Francisco native and stand-up comedian first appeared on the 
network as host of the comedy special "Comikaze," which eventually led to his 
current contract. He's been a VJ for nearly five months, but has quickly 
established his self-described "bizarre personal sociological experiments" on 
camera. If Ed's depressed, he'll tell you. If Ed's tired, he'll tell you. If Ed 
has something on his mind . . . well, you know the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Stillerman describes Marques as "a little darker than the average MTV on-air 
personality. He brings a really twisted point of view to things. He's 
appreciated, in part, I think because he's the antithesis of that sort of 'frat 
mentality.' He's not a 'whoo-whoo' kind of guy. He's just very cerebral and 
gives you food for thought. But he still makes you laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Newest VJ Idalis is "super fun and super enthusiastic," Stillerman says. "The 
party follows her wherever she goes. It's very hard to be bummed out around 
Idalis. She brings a smile out of anyone and functions best in a party-like 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing she likes parties, because she -- and Sencio and Marques -- have 
spent much of their tenure at party central: MTV's Beach House in the Hamptons, 
where the network has aired most of its programming during the summer and 
continues to do so through Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Without specific set assignments, all three VJs, who currently have a very 
high profile, introduce videos and also host the various video shows "Rude 
Awakening," "MTV Blocks," "Prime Time," "Most Wanted" and "MTV Jams." That's a 
major difference in what's required of Sencio, Marques and Idalis and what was 
required of their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog -- who points out he's been with MTV 10 years, adding wryly "that's 
longer than any VJ" -- says: "When we first went on the air, the original five 
(Martha Quinn, Alan Hunter, Nina Blackwood, Mark Goodman, J.J. Jackson) did 
everything. They introduced videos, hosted specials, read the news." The new 
programming has allowed for diversity, including adding MTV News as well as MTV 
Sports departments. 
</P>
<P>
 And of the approximately 25 VJs who've been on the network's airwaves, some 
certainly didn't break out. Remember Carolyn Heldman or Lewis Largent? Neither 
do we. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've definitely had people who just didn't work out," Stillerman says. "It's 
been different things for people, mostly those who, frankly, haven't blown us 
away on the personality level, people who don't understand the way we work." 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog adds, "It's a sense we get from the audience, that they may not be the 
best on-air personality." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the newest VJs who may be on his way out is comedian Randy Kagan. After 
10 months, instead of getting a higher profile, he's become what Herzog calls 
"a part-timer." Even Kagan refers to himself as "a stringer," sent out to 
whatever assignment MTV doles out -- and those gigs appear to be fewer and 
fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a VJ doesn't work out," Stillerman says, "we figure out an amicable way to 
split up, so they can go on with their career, and we can go on with our 
business. We're not here to let people gather dust because we have a contract 
with them and it didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Kagan, he does have something else lined up -- if things just 
don't work out. His one-man show, "Watering the Grass in the Rain," begins 
production at the Powerhouse Theater in Venice next week. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Stillerman stresses is that MTV "requires a fairly large commitment 
from these people. It's not like they're on a sitcom and are working certain 
hours and on certain days. There's no hiatus here and they have a hard time 
doing other things. It's a completely full-time job." Indeed, Marques, Sencio 
and Idalis can be seen hosting any number of segments and shows throughout the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the revolving door of VJs, Herzog says, "It's a very fluid thing. We 
have a lot of crossover. They either decide they want to leave or we decide 
they should. It's an evolutionary process. It has more to do with contractual 
obligations than anything else. We're constantly refreshing." He says the best 
analogy he can think of is "Saturday Night Live." "We exchange one good person 
for another, or replace one who's not working out with one who might," says 
Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news," Stillerman adds, "is that we have a lot more successes than 
the ones who don't work out." Both Stillerman and Herzog cite Bill Bellamy and 
Kennedy as examples of the most recent breakouts. "They just work ," Stillerman 
explains. 
</P>

 "They're ready to break on through," Herzog asserts, implying that they may 
follow some of their predecessors to film and network television careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd love to see some of the new folks achieve their level of success," 
Stillerman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sencio's hoping some of that success will come his way. Even though he has a 
degree in film directing, he wants something to happen with his music and maybe 
his acting: "In a utopian MTV society," he offers, "I can make an album and a 
couple of movies. But then, who wouldn't? Maybe I'll get the chance, who 
knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some of that success for Marques could mean a trip to Los Angeles to star in a 
sitcom and do some cartoon voice-over work. "I'm just finding things for me to 
get good at," he says. "Hopefully, when I'm good at doing stuff, at 79, I'll 
turn into a perfect orange ball of light and float up to heaven," he laughs. "I 
just love to work. I want longevity." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Idalis, she says: "I'm hoping I can get some film roles. MTV is a great 
stepping stone. I've watched others become stars and that's what I want to do. 
I'm perfect for it." YOU SAW THEM HERE FIRST 
</P>

 Idalis, MTV's newest veejay, is unquestionably hot. 
</P>
<P>
 With her rapid-fire delivery, easy colloquial manner and sultry persona, six 
weeks into the job it's obvious she's well-suited to the MTV world. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting there wasn't easy. "It was a six-month audition process." Idalis 
thought she was a shoo-in: "I was crazy confident," she says, "But then I also 
didn't care if I didn't get it. I was so used to, as an actress, to go out on 
auditions and not get them." 
</P>
<P>
 She was a member of the musical trio Seduction. The band broke up four years 
ago because of "fighting and egos getting in the way," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've performed in front of 10,000 people," she recalls. "I've had celebrity 
thing, I made my mistakes, had my temper tantrums." Now, she says, in 
street-speak, "I'm not going to go there" (read: She won't be acting that way 
again). Her resume, before and after Seduction, seems typical for acting 
hopefuls: bartender, hostess, acting classes, part-time actress. 
</P>
<P>
 Idalis, 31, who calls herself a "New Yorkican" (that's a New York-born Puerto 
Rican), hopes "to keep that Latino stuff alive on MTV! The first segment I did, 
I was like, 'Yo!, It's MTV in the house! I'm a Puerto Rican girl born in the 
Bronx, raised in Brooklyn!' " She hopes to inspire. "When I was growing up, I 
had no role models at all. I kept wondering why my mom didn't look like 
Florence Henderson." 
</P>
<P>
 She lived in the projects until she was 10, when "my mother married a Jewish 
man and we moved into an Italian neighborhood. I'm diverse. I've met so many 
people, who've brought me to so many different places, my heart is 
international." All of these elements, she says, help her relate to the MTV 
audience. N.F. MENDOZA

 AN EMPIRE OF THE EAST: Travels in Indonesia by Norman Lewis (Henry Holt: $25; 
244 pp.) Norman Lewis, now 85, may once have been "one of the best writers . . 
. of our century," as Graham Greene put it. You wouldn't guess it from this 
volume, however, for "An Empire of the East" is an intermittently interesting 
but unexceptional travel book, one marred by an all-too-English tone of 
superiority. Not that Lewis isn't sympathetic to the native Indonesians he 
meets, far from it; but he is prone to sweeping generalizations ("The Chinese 
have a crow-like avidity for the collection of foreign ceremonies for 
incorporation in the mixed bag of their own social pleasures") and 
condescending judgments (a porter's grin "reminded me of the ingratiating 
foolishness carved on the face of the Mickey Mouse (doll) lying on its back"). 
The two encounters just quoted occur while Lewis is driving around Sumatra, and 
that may be part of the problem, for he proves much better company off the 
road, as in East Timor and Irian Java (the Indonesian half of the island shared 
with Papua New Guinea). In East Timor, while staying in an orphanage run by 
Catholic nuns, Lewis learns the details of Indonesia's well-hidden massacre of 
the Timorese beginning in 1975; it included the physical encirclement of 
guerrillas with a "fence of legs" composed of perhaps 80,000 dragooned men and 
boys. In Irian Java he spends time with both the hardscrabble Yali and more 
prosperous Dani tribes, and witnesses one of the ritual battles for which the 
tribes are famous; Lewis's main guide, Catan, happily doffs his Western clothes 
to participate, but his wife confesses her displeasure at his dressing up in 
the traditional penis gourd and little else.One hopes she holds another, more 
damaging Dani tradition in equal disdain -- the custom among women of cutting 
off their fingers and ears to express bereavement.

 THE GREEN TREES BEYOND: A Memoir by R. D. Lawrence (Henry Holt: $25; 318 pp.) 
R.D. Lawrence may be best known for his writings about nature -- "The White 
Puma" was widely hailed a few years ago -- but it's the war scenes that make 
"The Green Trees Beyond" unforgettable. Lawrence, half-English but born and 
raised in Spain, joined the anti-Franco forces in 1936, at the age of 14 (he 
claimed to be 16); two years later, and after recovering from a head wound, he 
fled under attack across the Pyrenees. That would seem to be enough combat for 
anyone -- but not Lawrence, who subsequently enlisted in the British Army 
(again lying about his age) only to be seriously wounded a number of times in 
the course of evacuation from Dunkirk, firefights with Rommel's tanks in North 
Africa, and the invasion of Normandy on D-Day. Lawrence's account of his 
wartime experiences are shattering, in part because they are so compact, and 
have the untoward effect of making much of the rest of the book anti-climactic, 
despite the fact that Lawrence's later, less bloody exploits in his adoptive 
Canada would, in another context, be equally absorbing. Homesteading in frigid 
northern Ontario, befriending local wolf packs, surviving a hurricane, 
exploring British Columbia's Inside Passage: Lawrence also holds jobs in 
journalism, and eventually becomes a prolific writer of books, but it's clear 
he works primarily to buy time in which to savor and study the natural 
world.Lawrence has been called northern Canada's Gerald Durrell, but he's no 
humorist, and is at bottom the better writer; Lawrence goes deep into 
emotionally difficult territory at times, as when he professes never to have 
felt love until his mid-30's, and then only toward his mortally wounded dog. 
The first half of "The Green Trees Beyond" can justly be compared to Orwell's 
"Homage to Catalonia," but on the whole it's more like a Picasso portrait put 
into words, beautiful not in spite of its ungainliness but because of it.

 DISCOVERING AMERICA: Stories by Liza Wieland (Random House: $20; 268 pp.) In 
the first and perhaps best story in this collection, "Tommy Wadell," friends 
tell the adolescent narrator Augusta that she should sign up for ballroom 
dancing because "We're all clumsy larvae, and they want to make us into social 
butterflies."Augusta knows better: "I get this picture in my head of 
butterflies becoming moths," she says, "flying into lit candles and coming out 
with their wings singed, then sending themselves straight back into the 
flames." Yes, most of the stories in this collection cover familiar 
love-and-growing-up territory, but they are invariably accomplished, often 
dealing with odd and difficult love and maturation that occurs surprisingly 
late in life. The cloistered young women in "The Columbus School for Girls" 
have crushes on their English teacher, but get an inkling of love's complexity 
when they become acquainted with his wife on a field trip to Emily Dickinson's 
house; in "Lessons and Carols," a treehouse-building tomboy doesn't want her 
favorite lumberyard to go out of business, but its condemnation allows her to 
see that the supposedly low-class lumberyard workers meant something to her 
mother. Some of the tales are quite funny -- in "Faye Gold's Story," a widow 
recalls her courtship and marriage to an illiterate, leathered motorcyclist -- 
and one is almost epic in scope, the novella-length, somewhat unfocused title 
story. It's the language rather than the plots that keeps this collection 
moving along, though -- along with the occasional insights, as when the 
precocious high school student says, "Tests are the easy part. It's what you 
have to learn on your own that causes all the trouble."

 HERE: Stories by Elizabeth Inness-Brown (Louisiana State University Press: 
$19.95; 113 pp.) Loss, grief, sorrow, heartache -- those and similar pains 
often bring out the best in writers, presumably because they push writers to 
explore the far corners of understanding, to try to articulate the 
inarticulable.That's certainly the case with Elizabeth Inness-Brown, whose most 
memorable stories, in this collection at least, involve leave-taking. In 
"Addison," a professor hears of the death of the long-time waitress at his 
local diner, and realizes she provided his world with a centering ballast; in 
"Happy Father's Day," a son honors his father's memory by planning to take his 
grown children fishing, perhaps even lobstering, at the family's summer 
cottage; in "Really Love Him," a woman hoping to leave her friends and current 
lover wonders what could make her stay, contemplates the connection between 
perfect, solitary moments and lasting partnerships. Many of the stories in 
"Here" seem unfinished or insubstantial, containing characters and ideas 
waiting for a larger canvas, but others are fine just as they are, describing 
how little we know about our lives until pushed to the edge. That's made most 
clear, perhaps, in "Sleepwalker," and it's too bad the title diffuses much of 
the story's impact; what's disturbing a young couple's routine condominium life 
isn't a poltergeist but their own, half-sleeping selves, telling them to follow 
their dreams while they still can.

 VERTIGO PARK and Other Tall Tales by Mark O'Donnell (St. Martin's Press: $9.95 
paper; 146 pp . ) "The future is only the present left to run wild," writes 
Mark O'Donnell in the title story of this including-the-kitchen-sink collection 
of stories, quizzes and cartoons, and boy, does he let his horses run free. 
"Vertigo Park" is one of a handful of relatively conventional stories here, and 
successful on its own terms if you take your humor black, with an acid chaser; 
a newly elected U.S. president wants to walk his inauguration route 
blindfolded, for example, his steps guided by the shouted utterances of the 
people. O'Donnell, a playwright and former writer for "Saturday Night Live," 
gives full reign to word play in this book, often to good effect -- "Her head 
swam, and not very well" -- but do we really need a soap-operatic playlet 
composed entirely of fractured dialogue? (Best speech: "My shaft is at rancor 
in the harbor, and they gave me whore leave. I heard you were engorged, and I 
just wanted to slop by and pave my regrets.") O'Donnell's work, being willfully 
over the top, is necessarily hit-or-miss, but considered how pointless many of 
the failures seem, one longs for a greater sprinkling of bull's-eyes. The humor 
here can be undernourished -- if you're going to imagine Emily Dickinson 
writing poems for an advertising agency, you should do it up right -- but when 
O'Donnell gets going, as in his wild vignette on a latter-day Paul Bunyan named 
Johnny Business (son of broad-shouldered Ma Bell), he can be a 
marvel.O'Donnell, you might say, is a Shawn-era New Yorker satirist on acid . . 
. and you'll certainly think of James Thurber when you arrive at the cartoon of 
a caged puma sleeping next to a zoo sign saying, "Please Do Not Disillusion the 
Animals."

OUD MAN OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Bilezikjian is an undiscovered musical treasure ("Musician, Play 
Thyself," Palm Latitudes, by Joseph Hanania). Not only does he play more than 
40 instruments, he is the world's foremost virtuoso on the oud.Everyone from 
Zubin Mehta to the Grand Ole Oprey has been astonished at what this man can do 
with this instrument, the granddaddy of the guitar and therefore the sire to 
almost the entire contemporary music industry. 
</P>
<P>
 I have had the good fortune to know Bilezikjian since 1970. I first saw him at 
a party, sitting on the floor playing "She Came in Through the Bathroom Window" 
on the oud, employing some of the most outrageous contrapuntal rhythms I had 
ever heard. We became instant friends. 
</P>
<P>
 I have seen John play, write, direct, conduct, teach, invent and do everything 
possible within the spectrum of music, all with a profound genius and deep love 
for his craft. Yet in spite of generally wide "insider" recognition, public 
exposure and acceptance have somehow eluded him.

 STRANGERS AND FRIENDS: Photographs 1986-1992 by Thomas Struth. (The MIT Press: 
$39.95; 108 pp.) German photographer Thomas Struth has chosen city streets, 
museum interiors and family portraits as his subjects. The streets are mostly 
empty, but the museums are usually crowded and chaotic. The portraits punctuate 
the book, like this 1988 portrait of his friend, Janice Guy, sewing. In his 
postscript Richard Sennett, a professor in the humanities at New York 
University, admires the directness of the camera's gaze, and its emphasis on 
the viewing process, rather than an Avedon-style psychological revelation. They 
are a little chilly, these photographs, but precise and eerie. Susan Reynolds

<P>
 It started with the Greatest Hits album,

 of nostalgia and wine, toll-free 
</P>
<P>
 in the middle of Notorious , just after

 Claude Raines started poisoning Ingrid Bergman. 
</P>
<P>
 In a room at the top of a long 
</P>
<P>
 flight of stairs she was weakening, 
</P>
<P>
 thinking all the while how much she 
</P>
<P>
 wanted, needed, and loved Cary Grant,

 who was taking too long to understand 
</P>
<P>
 it was now or never. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he rescued her,

 our album was being processed

 Everything worked out well,

 Victim of Love: The Shannon Mohr Story (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a 1993 TV 
movie, is based on the true story of a couple who turned to "Unsolved 
Mysteries" audiences for help in convicting their son-in-law (Dwight Schultz) 
in the murder of their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14th James Bond adventure, 1985's A View to Kill (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is 
a so-so affair, with Roger Moore beginning to look a little weary in his last 
outing as OO7. Christopher Walken plays the villain who wants to destroy 
Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 Fire Birds (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) wastes Nicolas Cage and Tommy Lee 
Jones in a lean, mean but empty tale of an attempt to break up South American 
drug trafficking via the U.S. Army's Apache attack helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyes of a Witness (CBS Friday at 9 p.m.) is an embarrassingly shallow 1991 TV 
adventure movie starring Daniel J. Travanti and Jennifer Grey as an estranged 
father and daughter battling poachers in East Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1987 Back to the Beach (KCOP Saturday at 4 p.m.) imagines that the Annette 
Funicello and Frankie Avalon of all those "Beach Party" movies of the '60s got 
married and settled down in Ohio. There, Frankie has become a workaholic car 
salesman and Annette a model housewife and mother. What gets them back to 
Malibu after more than 20 years is a visit to their daughter (Lori Loughlin). 
What's surprising is that the film is deft and funny, nostalgic without being 
embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Noyce's 1989 thriller Dead Calm (KCOP Saturday at 6 p.m.) is a spare, 
smart, seductive piece of filmmaking with (almost) every loophole covered. It 
offers enough tension to keep viewers hyperventilating for hours. Sam Neill and 
Nicole Kidman, recovering from the death of their child, are on an extended 
South Pacific voyage when they cross paths with an insane Billy Zane. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET on Saturday is screening the evergreen Yankee Doodle Dandy with James 
Cagney as show biz legend George M. Cohan (8 p.m.), and the obscure but 
intriguing 1933 Lady Killer (11 p.m.), in which Cagney plays a gangster who 
becomes a movie star. Airing in between the two movies is a Michael J. 
Fox-hosted retrospective on Cagney. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990 Back to the Future, Part III (NBC Saturday at 8:30 p.m.), Marty 
McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels back to the Old West, circa 1885, to try to 
rescue Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) before he's shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 The mediocre 1989 Far From Home (ABC Saturday at 9 p.m.) is notable only as 
Drew Barrymore's first movie as a teen-ager, playing a girl targeted by a 
stalker.

 BEYOND THE BURNING CROSS: The First Amendment and the Landmark R.A.V. Case by 
Edward J. Cleary (Random House: $25; 301 pp.) In June 1990, an African American 
family found a small cross burning on the lawn of the house they had recently 
bought in a working-class neighborhood of St. Paul, Minn. Countless local 
residents were shocked, and after 17-year-old Robert Anthony Viktora 
(identified only as R.A.V. because of his age) was arrested for the crime, they 
were pleased to learn he would be prosecuted under a recent city ordinance 
making it a misdemeanor to display a symbol "one knows or has reasonable 
grounds to know arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of 
race, color, creed, religion, or gender." Edward J. Cleary, a St. Paul attorney 
specializing in criminal defense, was himself angered at the cross-burning . . 
. but soon angry in a different way, when he discovered, as Viktora's 
court-appointed lawyer, that he would be almost alone in his battle to have the 
ordinance declared unconstitutional on the grounds that it grossly infringed 
the First Amendment. "Beyond the Burning Cross" is Cleary's account of his 
unpopular and controversial case, one he would win resoundingly with a 
unanimous decision from the U.S. Supreme Court, and if the writing in the book 
is only workmanlike, it illuminates well the legal complexities and political 
conflicts of much constitutional litigation. Cleary settles some old scores -- 
against illustrious law professors who wanted to replace him, against 
civil-liberties organizations that proved unsupportive -- but the book's 
over-riding point is well taken: that liberals often shoot their own cause in 
the foot by promulgating "politically correct" ideas and legislation.Patriarchy 
or not, racist regime or not, by this time you'd think everyone would agree 
that dissent must be allowed regardless of its political or social origins -- 
that the cure for damaging speech, to paraphrase Louis Brandeis, is not more 
laws but even more speech.

 Tom Shales is flogging the message because he doesn't like the messenger ("TV 
Nation: Making a Point or Just Making Fun?," TV Times, Aug. 7). The only people 
humiliated on Michael Moore's "TV Nation" (NBC) are the ones who think they're 
acting in a reasonable manner but aren't.No one has to go before Moore's 
cameras! In doing so, they humiliate themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The NAFTA piece updated us as to what's gone on since NAFTA passed. The 
segment on the cab drivers passing the "good" black guy in favor of the "bad" 
white one doesn't make fun of anyone. It just highlights how stupid racial 
stereotypes are. We didn't find the story about the Prairie Correctional 
Facility critical of the citizens who built it. We found it an example of the 
spend-craziness of lobbying the government for new facilities when others are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 We appreciate this worthwhile program but fear that unjust panning by Shales 
will get it scrapped in favor of more mindless entertainment.

THE WOMAN IN THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My spirits soared with joy yet also cried out in despair as I read Jeff 
Spurrier's article "Las Gringas of San Miguel de Allende." That women have 
found a place to come together and support each other in the ancient feminine 
ways -- creating from the heart, healing one another, honoring the crone and 
communing with nature -- gave me reason to rejoice.But that they must seek 
their solace outside of their own country and at the expense of another basic 
feminine need -- children and male companionship -- breaks my heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully your article will shed light on our society's urgent need to balance 
its harmful tenets (destruction of nature for profit, subversion of the 
feminine spirit, institutionalized poverty of women and children and 
status-based consumerism) with the primal feminine. Thus the millions of women 
who feel as the gringas do but choose to live here can do so in peace and 
safety and with the support of the larger community.

 Your article on San Miguel de Allende was informative but has left my 
retirement plans in a shambles. My wife and I were planning on spending our 
waning days in that city, which we imagined from travel brochures to be a 
perfect combination of low prices and traditional Mexican culture. Now we know 
that our retirement haven is overrun with whining, self-absorbed, 
psycho-babbling Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The smug tone of the article was itself quite revealing: Mexican women 
imitating Charo in their dress are a subject of derision, while "croning" 
represents an advanced level of human development. No doubt Mexican culture, 
with its emphasis on reproductive sexuality, the church and the family, has 
quite a bit to learn from these dropouts from American society.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; CALLING ALL GOOD DRIVERS AND BOMB 
DEFUSERS FOR FAMILY GAME SHOWS 
</P>

<P>
 Fast on the success of Nickelodeon's "Legends of the Hidden Temple," "GUTS," 
and "Wild & Crazy Kids" come two more game shows for kids. The Family Channel 
premieres both this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The basics for the new game shows are the same as Nickelodeon's: overcoming 
obstacles to win a prize and/or title. And why not? It's a tried-and-true 
formula. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, Maximum Drive, offers something kids love: motorized vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Family Channel came to us with some research that showed kids would love 
some form of motorized vehicle race," says Vin DiBona, executive producer. 
Further research by DiBona and partner Eyton Keller (producers of "America's 
Funniest People") revealed that off-road racing is popular with families. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Maximum Drive," teams of three kids age 12 to 14, race in relays on 
motorized bikes, all-terrain four-wheeled vehicles, six-wheeled Argo vehicles 
and Wave Runners -- motorized water vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Argo is like driving a tank," explains DiBona. "On the different 
vehicles, on various courses, they go through mud pits, all kinds of obstacles 
and bodies of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredible opportunity for kids to fulfill a fantasy that everyone 
has had when they were a child," Keller says. "They don't just drive these 
vehicles but race them safely -- and they're not just going around and around a 
track. There's an amazing obstacle course set up. It's not about speed, really, 
but skill." 
</P>
<P>
 DiBona adds that in the 20 episodes shot so far, no injuries have been 
reported. "Everything is very well-supervised," he says. Competitors, culled 
from clubs and at official specialized off-road racing arenas, have all raced 
or ridden motorized vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of each show, the winning team gets a prize, ranging from video 
games to CD players. When a showdown brings the best teams together, the big 
prizes are complete computer setups for each contestant. 
</P>
<P>
 Says DiBona: "We want to keep the prizes fun for kids, but not something that 
makes them overly competitive. The prizes are kid-oriented and kid-usable." 
</P>
<P>
 In Masters of the Maze, there's a countdown for kid contestants as three teams 
vie to disarm the intricate mastery of a multitiered "time bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 Team members use interactive equipment to guide each other through mazes with 
actual and digitalized barriers. In the final stage, two teams battle each 
other by shooting revolving targets for points and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday also marks the Family Channel's new weekday lineup for kids, which, in 
addition to the two new game shows, includes: Popeye, 7 a.m.; Inspector Gadget, 
7:30 a.m.; Xuxa, (beginning Sept. 12) 8 a.m.; The Legend of Prince Valiant, 
8:30 a.m.; Heathcliff, 3 p.m.; Super Mario Brothers Super Show, 3:30 p.m.; 
That's My Dog, 4:30 p.m.; Rin Tin Tin K-9 Cop, 6 p.m., and The New Lassie, 6:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maximum Drive" and "Masters of the Maze" premiere Monday. "Maximum Drive" 
airs weekdays at 5 p.m., Saturdays at 9:30 a.m. and Sunday s at 10:30 a.m. 
"TimeBomb" airs weekdays at 5:30 p.m., Saturday s and Sundays at 10:30 a.m. on 
the Family Channel. For ages 6 and up. Another Family Show 
</P>
<P>
 As The Adventures of Pete & Pete (Saturday 8:30 p.m. Nickelodeon) enters its 
second season, the brothers named Pete offer a look at "What We Did On Our 
Summer Vacation." R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe and the B-52s' Kate Peirson show up as 
guests. For ages 6 and up.

THE MOST EXPENSIVE COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the essay, Blue, in Alexander Theroux's The Primary Colors: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue was always the most expensive pigment for painters, meant, first of all, 
for supernatural beauty, perfection, glory. The goldlike flecks of pyrite 
crystals in lapis lazuli have often been compared to stars in the sky.(A 
certain magic attaches to lapis: It is always supposed to be fingered when 
reciting Chapter 26 of the Egyptian Book of the Dead.) Imagine what those rich 
delphinium-dark blues, never mind the use of matching gold, cost Duccio and 
DaConegliano and Fra Lippo Lippi and the Lorenzettis! Imagine the cost to 
Raphael, to Titian, to Giovanni Bellini simply to dip into that blue for the 
robes of those Madonnas! What niggardliness wouldn't be forgiven in places 
where its application could be avoided? What hectoring not understood when 
students wasted it? Penny-pinching painters squeezed the very last dabs out of 
that pigment. An artificial ultramarine was generally used in the 19th Century, 
although that was not always the case. While painting a mural commissioned and 
paid for by the university in the Oxford Union, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, working 
with William Morris and Burne-Jones, Pre-Raphaelite painters all, knocked over 
an entire potful of lapis lazuli, which surely must have cost a fortune, 
leaving a huge, beautiful, useless pool of dark blue leaking into the floor. 
The committee in charge of paying their expenses, which was staggered by the 
bill they ran up for soda water alone, almost died!

IT'S THE WHAT OF HOLLYWOOD NOVELS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to David Ehrenstein's review of "Playland" by John Gregory Dunn 
(Aug. 14): If a Hollywood novel that could top Nathanael West's "The Day of the 
Locust" could be written, it would be interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 I personally don't think it can be done -- the only thing that outranks that 
novel are the true stories of those stars such as Frances Farmer, Jean Harlow 
and Judy Garland, in West's day, and later Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and Jim 
Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
 West's book is so visionary and most others seem trite and banal in comparison 
to it. It's "The Heart of Darkness" of Hollywood novels. 
</P>
<P>
 ALEX MORGAN, LOS ANGELES 
</P>
<P>
 All right, so reviewer David Ehrenstein doesn't care all so much for John 
Gregory Dunne's novel "Playland." But to mention F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The 
Last Tycoon," Budd Schulberg's "What Makes Sammy Run?" and Nathanael West's 
"Day of the Locust" and omit richly deserved mention for Joan Didion (Dunne's 
wife) and her great, spare, elliptical novel "Play It as It Lays" does the 
review reader who may be unaware of this artwork a disservice. It is "The 
Grapes of Wrath" of Hollywood novels.

NEITHER HAPPY NOR GAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again you puzzle your readers of average, normal nature, your readers 
most numerous, with the absurd (language) reflected in Wayne Koestenbaum's 
"review" of that literary treasure, "Gay New York" by George Chauncey (Aug. 7). 
Was it not only two weeks ago a featured review in your Book Review Section 
took your avid reader through the wonders of two books introducing us to the 
world of black male homosexuality? I think it was only two weeks ago. It seems 
like yesterday! 
</P>
<P>
 You can't imagine how few of us need to be reminded of the "continuing 
centrality of gender inversion to gay culture; the flaming fairy, though he 
seems a mere stereotype to be discarded or 'transcended,' is actually a 
resonant provocateur, ignored at our peril." 
</P>
<P>
 Ignored as whose peril? 
</P>
<P>
 Very few of your readers really feel that "we should look to fairy culture for 
guidance" as suggested by your reviewer's deep analysis, vis a vis: 
</P>
<P>
 "In the history of homosexual identity one sees repeated the brutal story of 
the fairy's expulsion: As middle-class men sought to define their masculinity 
around heterosexuality, the fairy, with his deliberate effeminacy, became the 
easy scapegoat. We reprise that scape-goating when we banish femmes from 
gay-affirmative discourse. Masculinity needs to be eroded; in dismantling 
masculinity, we should look to fairy culture for guidance." 
</P>
<P>
 More frightening still is this reference to "normalcy" and "fascism," no less, 
as per your reviewer -- (emphasis this writer's): 
</P>
<P>
 "However, we should remain aware of the potentially subversive relation that 
homosexuality bears to the stultifying regime of 'normalcy.' When we demand 
that gays resemble the 'norm,' we banish eccentricity and individuality; and 
when we banish perversity, we retreat into prototypes of fascism." 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult for your unsuspecting reader who stumbles onto this absurdity 
to know whether it is George Chauncey, the author of "Gay New York," or your 
reviewer who transports the fascist-like masculine-heterosexual to the 
never-never world of freakishness with which your editors are so taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you consider devoting more space to reviews of say, a Tom Clancy, a 
Rudyard Kipling, a P. D. James?

 SOUTH OF HAUNTED DREAMS: A Ride Through Slavery's Old Backyard by Eddy L. 
Harris (Touchstone: $11; 254 pp.). The author of this engaging journal traveled 
through Dixie to explore the past of his family and ethnic group: "I did not 
travel across Africa to find my roots.I traveled the South to find them. For 
the South, not Africa, is home to Blackamericans, and Blackamericans as a race 
are essentially Southerners." To his considerable surprise, Harris liked much 
of the contemporary South: The muggy, oppressive backwater populated by bigots 
that he expected never materialized. In an understated epiphany, Harris 
discovers he has been as guilty of thinking in stereotypes as the racists he 
expected to find, confirming the idea that the best travel narratives describe 
journeys of self-discovery.

 THE HOLDER OF THE WORLD by Bharati Mukherjee (Fawcett/Columbine: $12; 286 
pp.). In her latest novel, Mukherjee continues the exploration of the clash 
between Oriental and Occidental civilizations she began in "Jasmine."The search 
for a fabulous diamond that belonged to the Emperor Aurangzeb leads 
"asset-hunter" Beigh Masters to chronicle the life of Hannah Easton. Born in 
colonial America, Hannah married a dashing British adventurer, but found 
herself when she became the mistress of a Hindu rajah. The shifts in Hannah's 
nature are reflected in the triumphs and scandals that rock the Coromandel 
coast of India in the late 17th Century, when European traders, entrepreneurs 
and pirates matched wits with their Asian counterparts for control of the 
lucrative textile trade. Although Mukherjee handles the shifts in time and 
place skillfully, the flinty Hannah is a less beguiling heroine than the subtle 
Jasmine.

 THE LANDS OF CHARM AND CRUELTY: Travels in Southeast Asia by Stan Sesser 
(Vintage: $12; 306 pp.). In these geopolitical profiles of five countries, 
Sesser wonders how the gracious, cultivated peoples of Southeast Asia could 
produce some of the most cruelly repressive regimes on the planet.He praises 
the shrewd economic planning that has turned Singapore into an incredibly safe 
and prosperous city-state, but notes that life there is so minutely regulated, 
people are fined for forgetting to flush public urinals. In Borneo, he 
documents the ruthless exploitation of the island's rain forests by Japanese 
industrialists who wastefully use the rare hardwoods for plywood concrete 
molds. In the most depressing piece in the collection, Sesser mourns the plight 
of Burma, a potentially rich country reduced to penury by a brutal cadre of 
military dictators.

 THE LOST BOY by Thomas Wolfe (University of North Carolina Press: $9.95; 81 
pp.) . Wolfe's novella takes the form of a four-part fictionalized portrait of 
his older brother, his mother's favorite, who died in childhood. Previous 
anthologies bowdlerized the text, omitting the mother's proud recitation of how 
Grover insulted an African American servant. Wolfe describes Grover walking 
through a small Southern town, seeing "the union of forever and now": Grover 
and his real counterpart stand fixed in memory like an insect in amber -- 
eternally the boy with great, untapped potential.

 PORTRAITS OF NATIVE AMERICANS: 23 Postcards from the Field Museum photographs 
by Charles Carpenter (The New Press: $9.95; 48 pp., paperback original). During 
the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exhibit (the fair Judy Garland visits in "Meet Me 
in St. Louis"), indigenous peoples from around the world were displayed in 
artificial villages like zoo animals. It's surprising that these dignified 
portraits emerged from that setting. Carpenter obviously respected his subjects 
and sympathized with their plight: His emotions remain evident 90 years later.

 THE CONCISE OXFORD DICTIONARY OF PROVERBS by John Simpson (Oxford University 
Press: $8.95; 316 pp.) . Simpson traces dozens of adages, saws and bromides to 
their often surprising origins. "Haste makes waste," was coined by Chaucer in 
the "Tale of Melibee" (1386). But the often parodied "The family that prays 
together stays together" was invented by advertising man Al Scalpone, and used 
in broadcasts for the Roman Catholic Family Rosary Crusade in 1947.

 FOUR GOTHIC NOVELS: The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole; Vathek by William 
Beckford; The Monk by Matthew Lewis; Frankenstein by Mary Wollstonecraft 
Shelley (Oxford University Press: $11.95; 606 pp.; paperback original) and 
FRANKENSTEIN by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, illustrations by Barry Moser 
(University of California Press: $15.; 254 pp.). Like Robinson Crusoe, Don 
Quixote and Alice, Frankenstein's monster has taken on a life that is 
independent of the original book. Shelley's tormented, vengeful creature is 
very different from the familiar, inarticulate movie monster with bolts in his 
neck. Obviously influenced by Lucifer in "Paradise Lost," this monster is a 
noble savage driven to evil by the mistreatment he has received from his maker 
and others. The Oxford collection of Gothic novels puts the story in context: 
Shelley's vision is no darker than the pseudo-Orientalism of "Vathek" or the 
vague Satanism of "The Monk." The latter also reveals the anti-Catholic 
prejudice that persisted in England: In his description of a Mass, Lewis 
comments, "in a city where superstition reigns with such despotic sway as 
Madrid, to seek for true devotion would be a fruitless attempt." Barry Moser's 
stark, black-and-white woodcuts make the UC Press reprint of the Pennyroyal 
edition a handsome gift for readers awaiting the Kenneth Branagh film.

PALM LATITUDES: BENG THERE; SLEEP AND THE SINGLE GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Raphael 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't apnea or anything exotic. I just couldn't sleep. It was the neighbor 
with the drum set, the boyfriend saying he lost the tickets for the Traffic 
concert, the gun going off next door ... the usual L.A. problems. 
</P>
<P>
 So I went to the Cedars-Sinai Sleep Disorders Center, where therapist Anthony 
Reading determined that I had psychophysiologic insomnia (gardenvariety, 
no-big-deal sleeplessness). He gave me some tips anyone can use -- cut back on 
caffeine, use the bedroom only for sleeping and sex, take a morning walk to 
keep my circadian rhythms in tune, turn in around 11 -- and told me to come 
back in two weeks for a biofeedback session. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumpy and coffee-less, I return. I am wired to a biofeedback machine that is 
supposed to help me learn to relax. Reading has stuck sensors on my fingers to 
measure my galvanic skin response, an indication of what he calls my "arousal 
rate." It's actually my anxiety rate, and it's high: The biofeedback setup 
makes a noise linked to my arousal rate -- the higher the anxiety, the louder 
the noise. The goal is to compel my body to relax, to silence the tone, 
smothering it with pure relaxation. "We train you to control the tone so you 
can activate the response at night," Reading says. Tone? That nerve-racking 
buzz? How can I relax with that noise? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about surrendering to relaxation. Letting go," he says. OK, I'll 
surrender. I'll let go. I'll think about -- the neighbor ... BZzzzzz.... OK, 
the boyfriend ... Wonder if he's really taking someone else to the concert? ... 
I'll take a gun to his head! BZZZZZZ! As if reading my mind, Reading says, "You 
don't have to acknowledge every thought. Greet them like people on the street 
and walk on by." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor with the drum set floats into the ozone. BZzzzz. ...The boyfriend 
vaporizes. (I'll deal with him later). . . . The gunshot? Well, he wasn't 
aiming at me. . . . Mmmmmmm. ... Lower andlower. . . . Hey, now that the 
buzzing's gone, maybe I can get some sleep around here. Judy Raphael

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; SAY BIG CHEESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sharon Whitley 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most photo albums are filled with such gems as Aunt Hortense holding two 
fingers above Uncle Delbert's head. But when Paul Walton of San Diego pulls out 
his pictures, nobody yawns. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Walton posing with Tom Cruise. Seinfeld. Oprah. Janet Jackson. Bill 
Clinton. Yasser Arafat. George Burns. Walton, 38, has been retired for six 
years -- ever since receiving a $1.7-million out-of-court settlement from a 
former employer, who Walton says withheld his sales commissions. So, with no 
job or wife or kids to cramp his lifestyle, Walton can live off the interest 
and investments while chasing celebs around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 He spends about $70,000 annually on his hobby, racking up "at least a million" 
frequent flier miles to hang around star-studded gatherings and political 
events, from this year's Academy Awards ("Clint Eastwood used my cellular 
phone") to last year's breakthrough Middle East peace conference in Washington, 
where he met Yasser Arafat at the National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I shook his hand, I introduced myself to him as Paul Walton, Jewish, San 
Diego. I didn't know what his reaction would be. He clamped my hand with his 
other hand and said, 'We're cousins! We're cousins from way back! We were never 
meant to be enemies!' I was shaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Walton has at least 50 photos showing him with entertainers and political 
figures, "but I have hundreds of other photos with part of the head missing," 
he sighs. "I'm disappointed more often than ecstatic." Which just goes to show 
that you've got to be careful whom you let handle your camera. "When I met 
President Clinton at Hotel del Coronado a few months ago, a stranger took my 
photo with his camera, and I had to follow him home to get the negative." 
Walton's technique? "I treat celebrities normal, with respect," he says. "If I 
get a picture, great; if not, OK." Walton says he has been turned down only 
once: "Demi Moore said no. She was nursing a child at the time, so I don't 
blame her." Walton has been on Oprah (twice), NBC's "Today" show and on 
Australian TV. However, Walton notes that not everyone is taken with his 
adventures. "My dad says, 'I wish he'd just settle down, meet the right girl 
and have children. Bill Clinton, Yasser Arafat -- who cares?' " Sharon Whitley

PALM LATITUDES: VERBATIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From a press release sent by the Kjellberg Studio in New York: 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you know that your favorite shapes and colors are the keys to 
understanding your personality -- even down to finding the fragrance that will 
enhance your lifestyle? Did you know that you can hear fragrances in music and 
see them in certain shapes and colors? 
</P>
<P>
 "Haarmann & Reimer knows it and they've proven it scientifically, with 
research on thousands of women around the world. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 If all those women are really hearing fragrances, they need Thorazine, not 
perfume.

SEARCHING FOR NGUYEN TAN HUNG; FOR THE DAUGHTER OF A SOUTH VIETNAMESE ARMY 
CAPTAIN MISSING IN ACTION, THE HARDEST PART IS NEVER KNOWING. OR IS IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lily Dizon, Lily Dizon is a staff writer for The Times' Orange County 
edition. She leaves this week for six months to study the Vietnamese language 
and culture at the University of Ho Chi Minh City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The military cemetery here in Bien Hoa was once known for the two rows of 
graceful willows that swayed gently in the breeze. During the Vietnam War, when 
this small town was the headquarters of the South Vietnamese army, sentimental 
visitors would wax poetic about the willows crying in tribute to the heroic 
soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the name of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, the graves marched in precise white lines through carefully 
tended grass. Flowers and incense sticks decorated the grave sites. A shrine -- 
an imposing slate monument depicting a tired soldier whose M-16 automatic rifle 
rests on his lap -- greeted visitors at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '70s, my mother came often to this cemetery, a half-hour's drive 
north of Saigon. She walked among the headstones, reading their inscriptions, 
looking for the name of her husband, my father -- Nguyen Tan Hung, a captain in 
the Army of the Republic of Vietnam -- who had been reported missing in action 
in 1972 in the Central Highlands. She came here just in case the army had made 
a mistake and somehow buried him without informing her. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a monument to patriotism and to the fallen heroes who had fought against 
the Communists of North Vietnam, the Military Cemetery of the Republic of 
Vietnam is a wasteland today. Most of the willows are gone, the slate shrine 
destroyed. The endless rows of tombstones are overrun with wild grass and 
tangled, thorny shrubs. The gray and white headstones have been defaced, 
overturned, some urinated upon.  
</P>
<P>
 Like my mother, I, too, have come here, tracing the rows of graves, trying to 
find out what happened to my father. Like her, I find no answers, and the one 
clue the ruins yield about my father's fate is hardly bearable: Here, in the 
land that he fought for, Father is not simply missing and presumed dead, he is 
despised, and even worse, forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 MY NAME IS NGUYEN TAN BANG PHUONG. I AM THE eldest daughter of Le Xuan Hao and 
Capt. Hung. But I am also Lily Dizon, adopted daughter of Alejandro Dizon, a 
former American civil service employee who married my mom and raised her four 
children as his own. In April, 1975, as Saigon fell, my mother, my two brothers 
and my sister and I were airlifted out of the chaos to a refugee camp in Guam 
and finally to a new life in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 We left behind a crumbling nation, scores of relatives and my mother's long, 
frustrating search for information regarding my father. At the end of that 
year, she put the past behind her and remarried so that her children could grow 
up in a stable family. Nineteen years later, prompted by a reporter's curiosity 
and a daughter's duty and fortified with my second father's encouragement and 
my mother's blessing, I decided to take up the search again. 
</P>
<P>
 I began where my memories ended. I knew my father's face from photographs and 
a little girl's blurry memories. I remembered a man dressed always in fatigues, 
who was often away from our home in Qui Nhon, on South Vietnam's central coast, 
off fighting the Communists, the "red devils" trying to take over our country. 
</P>
<P>
 I remembered being carried on his shoulders; I remembered the life-sized doll 
he brought me when he returned from training in America; I remembered him, not 
the maid, sweeping the floor -- "No one can sweep it as well as I can," he 
would explain to me as he went about the task. Most vividly, I remembered a 
seemingly forgettable scene: It was in the evening. Father was carrying me in 
his arms when he suddenly asked me how old I was. I proudly held up six 
fingers. "No, my daughter," he laughed, mussing my hair. "You're 5." 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, I asked Mom why this bit of banter would stick in my mind. It was 
March 8, 1972, she told me, and I had turned 5 that day: "We went out for 
dinner to celebrate. Your father left the next day to report to duty, and he 
never came back." She didn't have to remind me what happened next. The morning 
he left, Father insisted on taking family photographs. "I want to engrave your 
faces on my heart and mind," Mom remembers him saying, "just in case." He had 
gone to combat many times before, she says, but never with such foreboding 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, Father called from Fire Base Tan Canh, near the Laos and 
Cambodia border, to say that he would be delayed. A bridge had been blown up 
and reinforcements were late. He said he'd be home by April 22. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 24th, there were six or seven military Jeeps parked in front of our 
house when Mom came home from her job at an American supply base. She rushed 
into the house, where a number of officers were sitting or pacing. When she 
didn't see Father, she brushed by them. He was playing hide-and-seek, she 
thought, as he had done so many times before. 
</P>
<P>
 But an officer asked her to sit down. The maid ushered me and my siblings into 
the kitchen and closed the door. I cracked it open and peeked. A lieutenant 
colonel began by saying he didn't want to be there, but Mom covered her ears, 
ran to the kitchen door and opened it to face her bewildered children. In the 
background, the lieutenant colonel tried again: Enemy forces had overrun Tan 
Canh and the whereabouts of my father were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just Capt. Hung but the whole division that has been reported mat 
tich ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 " Mat tich ," Mom repeated numbly, puzzled. It was the first time she had ever 
heard that term -- "missing in action." "So Hung is not dead?" 
</P>
<P>
 We don't know, the man repeated. We have no more news. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers left. My mother began to cry, and so did my 3-year-old brother. 
My 2-year-old brother tugged at my hand. I bit my lip as Mom clutched my baby 
sister to her heart. She was 24 the day she lost her husband. He was 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Mom abandoned friends who came to console her and took the four of us 
to the beach. We walked barefoot on the sand, held hands and closed our eyes as 
Mom offered up what must have been the first of thousands of prayers. She 
appealed to the Buddha, to God, to the genies of the land and the spirits of 
our ancestors to bring Father home safely. 
</P>
<P>
 MY PLANE LANDS IN THE NEW VIETNAM IN APRIL, 1994, AND MY OLD HOMETOWN of 
Saigon (no one calls it Ho Chi Minh City) is in the midst of a suffocating 
tropical spring heat wave. It is 22 years to the month that my father 
disappeared; 19 years, again to the month, that I left this land. I have a 
one-month visa and boundless hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day for two months, I have been studying military histories and 
journalistic accounts of the battle at Tan Canh; I have even interviewed two of 
its survivors, now living in San Jose. ("I didn't know your father," they each 
tell me, though one of them can hardly stand to disappoint me. In the mess 
hall, he tells me, "we must have laughed together at funny American movies, 
your father and I. I know we must have at least once shared a beer.") 
</P>
<P>
 And I have written letters -- my mother painstakingly translating my queries 
into Vietnamese, a language I can speak fluently but have difficulty writing -- 
to a multitude of diplomats and bureaucrats. It is my hope that they will help 
me in my search, perhaps even open their files and allow me to see what my 
mother never saw -- ARVN military records, or better yet, the archives relating 
to the North's Vietnamese POWs. After all, the war is long over; perhaps I can 
reap some benefit from the long and controversial attempts to finally heal its 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saigon, Huynh Duong Chinh, a representative of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, tells me he admires me for my sense of filial duty and my journalistic 
desire to call attention to Vietnamese MIAs, who have so often been left out of 
the MIA debate in the United States. I meet with Chinh for three days, and he 
sends me on to Hanoi, and foreign affairs press officer Nguyen Duy Linh. 
</P>
<P>
 My task is sensitive. I must somehow convince the Vietnamese government, via 
Linh, that all I want to do is find out what happened to my father so that I 
can lay his memory to rest. I am not here to write a typical American MIA 
story. I am here to chronicle a Vietnamese woman's search for her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Linh turns out to be an arrogant 26-year-old. He is courteously uncooperative 
from the beginning, telling me not to expect any help from his bosses, who do 
not want to call attention to the fallen South Vietnamese government. Linh will 
later bill me $600 -- a ransom in a country where an average citizen makes $20 
a month -- for doing little more than giving me the runaround for three weeks. 
After days of listening to his rhetoric, I resort to a veiled threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, you understand that if this story is told right and I can write of 
how helpful the government was in my endeavors, then Vietnam would get good 
press, especially during these times of diplomatic discussions with the U.S.," 
I suggest to Linh, who this afternoon is sitting in my air-conditioned hotel 
room, puffing heavy cigarette smoke in my direction. "The way things are going, 
I will have to write that the government was not cooperative and did not 
support what I am doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Linh, the only son of a high-ranking diplomat, stubs out his third cigarette 
on the linoleum floor. "That's fine. And it is true," he smiles benignly. "You 
must understand -- you're not in America. Things are done differently here." 
</P>
<P>
 I have been warned about the bureaucracy here many times. Robert J. Destatte, 
who heads the research section of the U.S. MIA office in Hanoi, prescribed the 
course of action I was trying to follow: "Be polite, persistent and patient." I 
do everything Linh tells me to do. I sit by the phone when he instructs that I 
should wait for his calls. He asks, and I provide, outlines of what I plan to 
write. He demands, and I make, a list of questions I would ask officials. I 
have meeting after meeting with him. I even beg. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, six days into my stay in Hanoi, my patience really snaps. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting in my hotel room, I press Linh once again on when officials will 
meet with me and if anyone will be able to give me records of my father's 
imprisonment or tell me definitively that no such records exist. If I do not 
get answers on this trip, would I eventually on the next, or the next? 
</P>
<P>
 Linh gazes at me for long seconds through the cigarette haze and says 
offhandedly: "You know, you've done this all wrong. If you had told me in the 
first place you want to meet with people who could tell you about your father 
instead of requesting interviews with officials, I would have devoted my time 
looking for people who may have information about your father." 
</P>
<P>
 I am sure I have misheard him, or that my Vietnamese is not as fluent as I 
thought. But when I ask him again, he repeats his rubbish almost verbatim. So, 
I confront him with copies of every letter, every answered request he and his 
superiors have demanded from me. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would have been the most effective was a personal appeal from you to 
Defense Minister Doan Khue," Linh says, ignoring the copies. "I can only do so 
much, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 That is when I tell him, along with a few choice words, that the only thing he 
has done well is waste my time. And when I hand him a copy of my letter to the 
defense minister, Linh won't even touch it, claiming he never knew of its 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, he continues, I made a mistake when I returned to Vietnam as a 
reporter. If my task had been less political -- "nothing a reporter writes 
about the MIA issue is nonpolitical," he says -- maybe it would be easier to 
find out what happened to my father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brother Linh," I use the appropriate politesse, "you're saying that if I had 
knocked on your door -- not as a reporter but as a Viet Kieu (overseas 
Vietnamese) -- telling you what I was trying to do, asking for yours or any 
other official's help, you would say, 'I'll see what I can do'?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course not," he replies scornfully, "I would ask you who you thought you 
were to make that kind of a request." 
</P>
<P>
 IN 1972, SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER TAN CANH FELL, MY mother took a bus to the 
Central Highlands in search of my father. "I can't explain my mind-set at the 
time, why I even thought I could find him," she told me recently. "I wanted to 
find out the truth. I wanted to be at peace. I also wanted to make sure that if 
he had died, that he would be at peace. How can a spirit rest if his family 
doesn't know if he lived or died?" 
</P>
<P>
 But her bus was stopped in the remote province of Kon Tum in the Central 
Highlands, about 25 miles south of Tan Canh. Travelers could go no farther 
because of fighting in the area. She returned home dejected, but that was only 
to be the first of her many attempts to find out what happened to Father. Most 
of her efforts included me. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after Father was reported missing in action, we moved south to 
Saigon. Qui Nhon Regional Area Exchange, the U.S. supply base where she had 
been working as assistant manager of the cafeteria, was being shut down, so she 
was transferred to the base at Tan Son Nhat Airport.  
</P>
<P>
 In Saigon, our search began again. Every weekend, Mom went to the military 
headquarters in Bien Hoa, where they updated lists of soldiers who had been 
confirmed dead or who managed to make it back to the south. Mom showed Father's 
pictures around, asking returning soldiers if they had seen him. No one ever 
recognized him and his name remained on the MIA list. 
</P>
<P>
 On the days I had to be at school, Mom's trek home was always the same. As I 
stood outside our house waiting for her, I would see a lonely figure, dressed 
in black, walking unsteadily down a dirt path. Once she reached me, Mom would 
crumple at my feet and cry, chanting through her tears, "Mom couldn't find your 
father." I would get down on my knees to help her get up. And we would cling to 
each other for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 In March of 1973, as a provision of a cease-fire treaty, North and South 
Vietnam exchanged prisoners of war. On the designated day, Mom and I went to 
the Ba Chieu district outside Saigon, where a military camp was set up, and 
joined throngs of people also waiting for the release of their loved ones. As 
families tearfully reunited all around us, we felt certain that Father was 
going to run toward us at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Mom saw faces she knew, officers and soldiers in the same artillery unit 
as Father's at Tan Canh. There were seven of them and one by one, they all said 
they didn't know what happened to him. The unit commanders, Lt. Col. Trinh Le 
Trien and Maj. Trinh Thanh Khue, confirmed that Father had been captured with 
them. However, they told Mom, when they reached their destination, a prison 
camp in Hanoi, he was nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 We wandered into a medical tent. There, Mom spotted Father's driver, Corp. 
Nguyen Van Dong. "Ma'am, the captain died" were his first words. Mom swayed and 
fell, hitting her head against a wooden chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "You saw my husband die?" she weakly asked, as I helped her steady herself. 
"How did he die?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, Ma'am. I didn't see that he died. I just assume so because the 
last time I saw him, the captain was so weak," he replied. According to Dong, 
Father had become ill en route to the camp, and his captors had to drag him by 
rope part of the way.  
</P>
<P>
 In the days and months to come, the military grapevine was full of such tales. 
Someone said a rocket missile struck Capt. Hung's artillery gun during the 
initial attacks on Tan Canh. Another remembered that as everyone surrendered, 
only Father continued to fire at the enemy and was finally captured at 
gunpoint. Even my father's older sister said she saw a soldier on television 
tell a reporter he overheard a "Capt. Hung" challenge his captors on a bridge 
during the journey to the prison camp; the North Vietnamese, the man reported, 
shot the prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom tracked down the sources of all the stories. But they never turned out to 
be anything but gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone told me he was shot or had died, but they also said they were not 
certain," Mom told me. "They made me despair, then they gave me hope. Every 
once in a while, I would hear stories of men who returned home even after they 
had been given up for dead. So I just went on hoping." 
</P>
<P>
 IT IS ANOTHER HOT MORNING IN HANOI, AND I AM SITTING in the office of Vietnam 
Veterans Association Magazine, trying, once again, to be patient and polite. 
Since 1991, this magazine has published supplements listing names and photos of 
missing Communist troops, Viet Cong guerrillas and grave sites. The idea is to 
encourage readers who may remember a name, a face or a battle to contact family 
members or the magazine. To date, the magazine has established the fates of 
more than 600 of those reported missing in action in the North's cause. The 
listing is free, assistant editor-in-chief Tran Ngoc tells me, and family 
members looking for their husbands, fathers and sons "who died for the 
country's liberation" are never turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was a Vietnamese officer who fought for a cause he believed was 
right for his country," I remind him. I offer to pay to have my father's name 
included in the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Ngoc gazes at me for several seconds, then replies evenly: "We're not as 
opened as that yet. The purpose of our magazine is to find our soldiers first. 
Once we've accounted for all our people who are still missing, then perhaps we 
can begin to look for others." 
</P>
<P>
 Nghiem Xuan Tue, a spokesman with the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social 
Affairs, is a little less diplomatic when I finally talk to him. His agency 
mounts searches for Vietnamese MIAs. "The only MIA number we have is 300,000, 
and they're the brave soldiers who fought for the country's liberation," says 
Nghiem. "The others, they don't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a shock to hear it said so plainly. The United States lists 2,233 
Americans missing in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, including 1,642 in 
Vietnam proper. The search for these casualties is ongoing and the issue has 
been so influential that it has prevented Capitol Hill from establishing 
diplomatic ties with Hanoi. Hanoi itself has begun to look for answers to the 
question of what happened to its own 300,000 MIAs. These two old enemies have 
even begun to share battlefield information in search of their missing. But no 
one is counting my father, no one is sharing information about him, and no one 
is going to. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Vietnamese believe in so, destiny. Some consider it preordained; others 
think that with guidance, they may be able to shape it themselves. I consider 
myself thoroughly Western in this regard -- my life, I tell myself, is 
determined by my own actions, my own choices. But now I decide to do as the 
Vietnamese do. I seek out a fortuneteller. 
</P>
<P>
 I have tried this just once before, in Saigon, while I waited for my official 
invitation to Hanoi. The soothsayer there dispensed wisdom from an alley 
doorway, flashing a toothy grin and burping as he sipped a cola. Tracing the 
lines on my right palm, he prophesied that I would be involved in a "big 
accident" by year's end, that I would receive great accolades having to do with 
my work, that if I wasn't careful, I would die drowning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your father is still alive," he told me, and I am embarrassed to admit that 
my heart skipped a beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may have been kept from home against his will in the beginning," the man 
said, counting the joint lines on his fingers, apparently to determine how 
Father's and my destinies were intertwined through our birth dates. "But for a 
long time now, he does not want to return to the people who knew and loved him. 
He's too ashamed. He has lost everything that means everything to a man, his 
home, his pride, his belief in himself." 
</P>
<P>
 I turned to go, but the fortuneteller would not release my hand. He stared at 
it a little longer before saying: "Father and daughter will see each other 
again. He will find you." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in Hanoi, I find myself in another alley, knocking on another door. The 
employees at my hotel swear by this woman, Vu Thi Xuan, a 36-year-old Buddhist 
who reads destinies in cards. I am invited to sit on a straw-mat-covered bed. 
When I tell her I am looking for my father, I reveal no details of his 
disappearance. Three different times, she tells me to shuffle the cards and to 
turn over nine of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying to be sure," she says, explaining why she has me shuffle so many 
times. "Every single time, your cards say your father is still alive. He has 
been living with a son all these years, a son who is around your age," Xuan 
says, fingering the playing cards individually. "Without this son, your father 
would have no home, no one to care for him. As it is, he still has nothing. His 
fate has always been that he would be separated from his family." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't know you are looking for him, Xuan tells me. But rest assured, "he 
will read in an advertisement that you're looking for him and he will find 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 I tell Xuan I don't believe in fortunetellers. At her silent, questioning 
look, I say, "I don't know why I'm here." Then: "Am I to just take you at your 
word?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll receive news by November," she responds quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not tell her that I have heard such a prediction before, I do not say 
that every other avenue of inquiry has come up dry; I simply leave. 
</P>
<P>
 IT IS A WEEK INTO MY STAY in Hanoi before Linh finally gives me some good 
news: He can take me to Tan Canh, the battlefield where my father was last seen 
alive.  
</P>
<P>
 During an eight-hour drive on the narrow highway that cuts through the heart 
of the Central Highlands, I quietly soak in the scenes around me. I savor every 
bump and twisting turn on the highway, knowing I am on the same path Father 
took countless times en route to combat.  
</P>
<P>
 This was once a jungle, before B-52 raids cleared the land. Now the government 
has decided it should be cultivated, and we drive through wooded hills and 
small orchards of rubber, banana, jicama and pear trees. We pass Pleiku, the 
province where I was born. We drive through An Khe, a lush, rural hamlet of 
emerald-green rice paddies where my maternal great-grandmother lived until she 
died more than a decade ago. As a child, I used to climb trees in her orchard 
and ride the water buffaloes in her rice field. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere, military graveyards with ornate signs invite visitors to stop and 
pay their respects to the liet si , the "heroes who sacrificed their lives for 
their country." Even viewed through the window of a moving van, I can tell that 
these cemeteries -- the final resting place of Vietnam's "liberators": the Viet 
Cong and the army of the North -- are well-kept and dignified, nothing like the 
lonely graves at Bien Hoa. 
</P>
<P>
 To take my mind off depressing thoughts, I casually ask Linh about the 
country's perception of men like my father. I know he studied history at the 
University of Hanoi, and I pose my question as a journalist seeking background, 
overview, a sense of the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, Linh speaks sincerely and without condescension. "In the 
War Against Americans," he begins, "Vietnamese who took up arms against their 
fellow Vietnamese are phan nuoc , traitors." 
</P>
<P>
 I am less shocked than battered by the words. In the long silence that 
follows, I want to tell Linh that he is wrong, that his history is incomplete: 
My father is Vietnamese just as he is, just as his father and all the other 
"liberators" are. His beliefs were different but they were no less noble. He 
was willing to die for a cause he believed in and chances are, he did. I want 
to ask, doesn't any of that count? But I keep my anguish to myself. 
</P>
<P>
 The road trip blessedly ends when the van has to wait its turn to cross a 
bridge. I am certain that this is the Bo Ko Bridge, the same one blown up by 
Communist soldiers 22 years ago, ensuring that my father never returned home. I 
tell the driver to let me out.  
</P>
<P>
 I walk slowly across the unsteady frame of steel bars and creaking wood 
planks, staring at the deep, flowing water that was the divide between Father 
and home so long ago. On the other side and farther down the road, a huge 
concrete sign proclaims, "Historical Ruins . . . Victorious Battle." 
</P>
<P>
 What used to be Tan Canh firebase is now an empty expanse at the top of a 
plateau, one of the highest points in the strategic Central Highlands. 
Geographically belonging to South Vietnam, this region separated northern 
Communist Vietnam from the towns and provinces of the south. For most of 
Father's 10 years in the army, he was stationed in the Highlands. He spent the 
last two years at Tan Canh under the ARVN 22nd Infantry Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight for Tan Canh was a small part of the 1972 Easter Offensive -- a 
series of strategic attacks the Communists launched across all of Vietnam in 
April that year. South Vietnamese who lived through that season, when fires 
from the battles scorched most of the countryside, call it Mua He Do Lua -- Red 
Fiery Summer. At Fire Base Tan Canh, 6,000 Communist troops crushed the 
3,500-strong ARVN 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
 I have already heard the story of the battle from the American point of view. 
"The officers were not trained well," U.S. Army historian Dale Andrade has told 
me in a telephone interview from his Washington, D.C., office. "They just 
wouldn't fight. Some of the men just ran pell-mell to Kon Tum. Many deserted 
the army, just went home to their family." 
</P>
<P>
 But I also have heard another version from Tam Vu and Khoi Ha, the ARVN 
veterans I visited in San Jose. "For two days, rocket missiles rained and 
pounded on our bunkers," Vu, now 54, told me. "I was scared. We all were. But 
we still shot back, at what we didn't know. The more we fired, the more they 
came." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who survived the onslaught surrendered or were captured, 
according to Vu, an infantry captain who escaped as he was being led to a 
prison camp. Some, like Vu's friend Khoi Ha, also an infantry captain, did 
indeed "run." "For every one like me," remembered Ha, 58, "there were 10, 20, 
30 men who were killed. Maybe I shouldn't have run. Maybe I should have stayed 
and died. But I did run and I lived to fight another battle." 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never forget Tan Canh," Vu said. "I fought for more than 10 years up 
until then, and Tan Canh was the first time I knew our side was going to lose. 
We didn't have enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to match Vu's horror-filled memories with the sweeping field of 
dirt that is now Tan Canh. It is scattered with bushes, trees and tumbleweeds. 
There are pieces of rusted metal here and there, and a few bomb or bunker 
craters in the ground, but those are the only visible reminders of the battle. 
It is also hard to hear Vu's voice in my ear as Col. A Minh, president of the 
local chapter of the Vietnamese Veterans Assn., gives me a tour. "This was one 
of our most glorious battles," Minh tells me. 
</P>
<P>
 I had hoped that being where my father was last seen would give me a sense of 
peace, a measure of closure. But the voices of my escorts intrude. They stand 
in the shade of a tree watching me. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does this Vietnamese foreigner expect to find here," one of them, a 
local, asks the others loud enough for me to hear. "She goes abroad and she 
comes back thinking that anyone would help her find her father, a traitor to 
his people? It's very funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Heading back toward Bo Ko Bridge, I look again at the sign that marks the 
battlefield. The passing years and scorching sun have faded much of its 
blue-gray paint, but nothing dims its preamble -- "On the morning of April 24, 
1972, our forces overran (Tan Canh) firebase" -- or its purpose, to celebrate 
the day I lost my father. 
</P>
<P>
 BACK IN SAIGON, I WAKE UP at 4 a.m. on the last day of my journey. I want 
ample time to find Dong Ba Pagoda, the temple where Mom had set up a shrine for 
Father on the third anniversary of his disappearance, the day before we left 
the country in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 In most Vietnamese homes, an ornate red-and-gold altar is set up so that 
family members can pray to the spirits of the dead. But because my father had 
never been found, dead or alive, and had no burial place, my great-grandmother 
advised Mom that a shrine at home wouldn't do any good; it would only invite a 
restless spirit to steal his children to keep him company in the nether world. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing in great-grandmother's wisdom, Mom had purchased an altar for Father 
at a temple instead. From there, if he were dead, his spirit would still be 
able to guide us. If he were alive, the shrine would serve as a permanent 
prayer for his return. 
</P>
<P>
 The pagoda turns out to be an unassuming two-story, wood-and-concrete 
structure. I arrive before the opening hour, so the gatekeeper and his wife run 
to awaken the nun in charge. A gentle smile spreads across her face when I tell 
her why I am here. 
</P>
<P>
 She takes me upstairs into a loft, where two large and dusty hardwood tables 
dominate the room. Propped on them are hundreds of pictures memorializing the 
dead. I lean across the tables, poring over each image. Here and there are 
photographs of men in military uniform. I know that Mom had used a copy of a 
picture of Father's graduation from military school. I have seen it countless 
times. I would know it in my sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 But even here -- as in the rest of my journey -- I am unsuccessful. My 
father's picture is nowhere to be found. Downstairs, the nun and I riffle 
through the temple's tattered record books for Father's name. Again, nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want you to be disheartened before you looked, so I didn't tell 
you," the nun says as she bundles the books back together. "Some of the records 
were lost or burned. We tried to safe-keep all pictures of military officers, 
but many were taken and destroyed after liberation." 
</P>
<P>
 THE SEARCH FOR MY FATHER would end almost exactly where it began -- in memory 
and in resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 When I had first arrived in Saigon, I briefly reunited with my uncle, my 
father's oldest brother, Nguyen Quoc Hung. I couldn't know it then, but finding 
Uncle Hung was the closest I would come to finding my father in Vietnam. 
Listening to his comrades in the United States, meeting his adversaries on the 
battlefield, hearing the old conflicts debated again through the differing 
stories of Tan Canh -- all of that taught me about his time, the why and how 
associated with his disappearance. But it was my uncle's recollections, stored 
now with my own and my mother's, that helped make my father come alive in my 
heart and mind. 
</P>
<P>
 From Uncle Hung, I discovered that my father's fate might have been completely 
different but for his stubbornness. When Father was 18, Uncle Hung told me, he 
was turned away from the military because, at 120 pounds, he didn't weigh 
enough. Undaunted, Father bought a long steel rope and wound it snugly around 
himself. On his second try, he tipped the scale at the minimum required, 135 
pounds. His zeal, according to my uncle, came not so much from wanting to fight 
as wanting to help rebuild a democratic Vietnam. But first he had to get 
through the war. 
</P>
<P>
 As happy as Uncle Hung was to see me in Saigon, after 19 years of separation, 
my return also reminded him of the emotional burden he had been carrying. "For 
several years after 1975, every time I heard a knock on the door, my heart 
would stop and I would run to greet the visitor -- just in case it was your 
father coming home," Uncle Hung told me, staring out the opened door into the 
humid night. "I never believed, in the beginning, that he died. So, I kept 
hoping, and praying to the Buddha, that he would come home. After a while, I 
stopped running to the door when someone knocked. For my peace of mind, I gave 
up hope. But, as you know, the hardest part is never knowing." 
</P>
<P>
 That night, as I began my journey, I agreed with him -- not knowing was the 
hardest part. But three weeks later, I had learned that there was something 
harder, something worse than not knowing. "When the living forget the dead," 
one of the nuns at the Dong Ba Pagoda had told me, "the dead die once more." 
</P>
<P>
 In Vietnam, my father and thousands of heroes like him have been dying -- and 
disappearing -- again and again for two decades, without memorials, without a 
tally, with hardly an official ripple. And in the United States, the land of 
his allies, my father also continues to vanish. My discovery saddens my mother, 
who is more disappointed for me that I did not find anything concrete. Mom says 
she came to terms over Father's disappearance a long time ago. She hopes I can, 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 As for me, I have to admit that I have not yet given up hope. Even though my 
intellect tells me otherwise, some small part of me still clings to the 
unrealistic hope that he is alive and that the soothsayers' prophecies will 
come true.  
</P>
<P>
 But whatever my hopes, whatever my ambivalence, I keep coming back to the 
nun's words, and the real discovery at the end of my search: If nothing else, I 
can find my father in memory. If nothing else, I bring him home alive by never 
forgetting.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time Bong Hwan Kim met Karen Bass, they sat across the table from 
one another at Roscoe's House of Chicken & Waffles at Manchester and Main in 
South-Central Los Angeles. It was January, 1992, more than two months before 
the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass, executive director of the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse 
Prevention and Treatment, was getting ready to launch a campaign against 15 
liquor stores in South-Central, at least 10 of them Asian-owned. It was an 
issue that could easily disintegrate into traditional inter-ethnic politics. 
African Americans on one side, Korean Americans on the other. One group ravaged 
by the American system, another trying desperately to become a part of it. Bass 
wanted to prevent that polarization. She had heard that Kim, director of the 
Korean Youth and Community Center, was something of a renegade -- independent 
from his Korean-born elders, who were determined to fend off any effort to 
infringe on the autonomy of the liquor-store owners. By agreeing to work 
together, the pair were neutralizing the liquor stores as a racial issue. The 
colors had begun to blur. 
</P>
<P>
 By the first week of May, however, they confronted more than the question of 
15 problem stores. Some 200 South-Central businesses selling fortified wine and 
malt liquor burned to the ground in the aftermath of the Rodney King trial. As 
the fires raged, Bass and Kim talked by phone. Bass knew the neighborhood would 
fight the reopening of the liquor stores, and, again, she needed an ally in the 
Korean community. For Kim, the issue had become more troublesome. 
Korean-American liquor-store owners had been targeted, and they needed to be 
compensated. Bass agreed. Once again, they were trying to bridge the divide. 
</P>
<P>
 The informal alliance between Bass and Kim is an example of what is happening 
on a small but significant scale across ethnic Los Angeles. A few African-, 
Asian- and Latino-American leaders are declining to use the race card with one 
another or with the white minority. Divisive notions like "the new majority" 
send them into philosophical contortions. "It makes us sound like we're going 
to be the new oppressors; we want to do something different -- to change the 
paradigm of social interaction," says Arturo Vargas, vice president of the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and a fellow consensus 
builder. 
</P>
<P>
 Brick by brick, leaders like Bass, Kim and Vargas are knocking down the walls 
that separate their communities. They get guidance, friendship and mentoring 
from others such as Ron Wakabayashi, the newly named executive director for the 
county's Human Relations Commission; Joe Hicks, the executive director of the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Los Angeles, and Stewart Kwoh, 
president and executive director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are consciously straddling different worlds," Xandra Kayden says of the 
members of these coalitions. "They are for their group but not against others." 
In an article for The Times' Opinion section last year, Kayden, a senior fellow 
at the Loyola Marymount Institute for Leadership Studies, wrote that, in the 
absence of a citywide consensus builder, Los Angeles has "translators": 
articulate, usually young people whose task is to represent their group's 
interests to the broader world. 
</P>
<P>
 But things tend to get lost in translation, and straddling two worlds can 
leave you without a foothold in either. Kim says Korean Americans need to be 
"new players in the game that will redefine race relations in America." At the 
same time, he volunteers that people who share his vision of a multiculturally 
diverse but harmonious Los Angeles are still on the "lunatic fringe. Not only 
do we face possible repercussions from our own," he adds, "but we still have to 
deal with the mainstream. There's not many safe places for people like us."

 VISITORS TO THE COMMUNITY COALITION ON THE CORNER OF 85TH Street and Broadway 
must be buzzed in. Inside, Bass, in a flower-print dress, her Afro clipped 
short, wastes little time letting a reporter know where she stands. She pulls 
out an old issue of this magazine and opens it to a photo essay showing 
Korean-American store owners and their Latino and African-American customers. 
She points to a photo taken behind a counter. A young black boy, the manager's 
son, is sitting on the Korean store owner's lap. A rifle stands nearby. "Look 
at that gun. That kid could reach over and grab it," she says. "We're supposed 
to celebrate this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bass, 40, was born in South Los Angeles. When she was 10, her father, a postal 
worker, and her mother, who'd owned a beauty parlor in Watts, moved to the 
Venice-Fairfax area so their children could attend better schools. There Bass 
watched whites "nearly fly out" as black families like hers moved in. She went 
on to study philosophy at San Diego State and then became a physician 
assistant. Along the way, she married a Chicano activist, had a child, got 
active in the anti-apartheid movement and continued working in civil rights and 
Latin American solidarity groups. She considered herself an "internationalist," 
as comfortable in Latin America as she was in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass divorced and ended up teaching health communication in USC School of 
Medicine's physician assistants program. She'd planned to stay there, raising 
her daughter and restricting her activism to after-hours, but in the mid-1980s, 
her world was shattered by crack. "We'd been good on critiquing the War on 
Drugs," she says of her activist friends, "but I'd never experienced anything 
like this. Coke crossed class and gender lines. I watched people all around me 
fall out." When a close family member developed a crack habit, Bass decided she 
needed to learn more about addiction. She organized a conference on crack. 
Then, she says, "I did something I never thought I would do -- I went after 
government funds to do organizing." The U.S. Center for Substance Abuse 
Prevention funded more than 250 groups interested in organizing around 
prevention. Bass' group was one. She opened shop in 1990 at 8500 Broadway in 
South-Central and began going door-to-door to find out how to improve the 
quality of life in a neighborhood where drugs, violence and poverty are 
endemic.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, she manages a staff of 14, some of the recovering drug addicts and 
alcoholics. She bristles at the low expectations outsiders have of blacks and 
Latinos, so she sets her standards high. She insists that staffers adhere to a 
dress code -- jeans are taboo in the office -- and show up for meetings on 
time. There's a weekly agenda, and everyone, even the shy high school students 
who try to avoid it, must report on their projects. Staffers are encouraged to 
travel and see how other cities handle their prevention programs. It's hard to 
pick out the few on her staff who hold college degrees because everyone is 
articulate and prepared as they talk on everything from alcohol-prevention 
programs to neighborhood canvassing to assess the needs of residents in the 
wake of the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake or no, the needs are immense. When the coalition opened its doors 
in 1990, Bass was surprised to find the neighborhood nearly abandoned. In the 
early '60s, the merchants had been Jewish; now they were Korean with English a 
poor second language. The neighborhood then had been entirely black; now nearly 
half the residents were Latino, with as slim a grasp of English as the Koreans. 
And poverty and drugs threaten to waste whole sections of the remaining 
African-American community.  
</P>
<P>
 When Bass' Latina assistant director, Sylvia Castillo, did Spanish-English 
translation at neighborhood meetings where they discussed the coalition's 
program, she says, some of the cultural tension dissipated. But words went only 
so far in improving their lives. After the meetings, residents returned home 
down the same seedy commercial strips where illegal sales outnumbered legal 
ones, the squalid sidewalks lined with sofas and crates, where out-of-work men 
and women drank away their afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 A year before the riots, Bass, Castillo and a group of residents began 
appealing to the Planning Commission and the Zoning Administration to rein in 
the problem liquor stores. Some 760 shops sold beer and wine in the 
neighborhood -- which Bass defines as the area bounded by Alameda Street, 
Imperial Highway, the Santa Monica Freeway and La Cienega Boulevard. More 
liquor stores than in the state of Rhode Island. With the coalition's help, 
residents identified 15 stores they wanted closed because the businesses and 
the sidewalks in front of them had long histories of attracting trouble. 
Castillo warned Bass that, because most of the owners were Asian, they'd be 
accused of race-baiting. "Don't let them do that to us," Bass replied. "That's 
not the issue." She then enlisted Kim's help. Less than 24 hours after Bass met 
with Mayor Tom Bradley's office, she watched on television as half the stores 
on her list, and more than 200 others, burned to the ground. "We stayed closed 
for four days," she recalls. "Then we opened up and went to work." 
</P>
<P>
 In her current campaign against the liquor stores, Bass has enlisted everyone 
from former Central American rebels to African-American retirees. Her special 
genius has been to appeal to the solid, hard-working blacks and Latinos who 
live in the neat blocks between the commercial strips, most of whom bought 
their houses before crack obliterated the neighborhood. They include people 
like Elizabeth McClellan, who moved to South-Central from Compton after a 
divorce in 1974 because it was the only place she could afford to buy a home. 
There, McClellan earned a teaching certificate and raised her last child. "This 
may not look like much," she says of her immaculate one-story home, "but it was 
my independence." 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, a crack house -- "so busy it was like living next to 
McDonald's" -- had operated across the street. With the help of the police, the 
landowner and her neighbors, McClellan finally got the dealers to move on. Now 
she is one of Karen Bass' foot soldiers, keeping journals on the troublesome 
liquor stores. Day after day, she and others monitor the storefronts, jotting 
down the presence of the illegal sofas and chairs that turn the pavement in 
front of the stores into sidewalk lounges. In the past two years, thanks to 
their efforts, 17 stores have been put on notice that their permits to operate 
are in question; another 20 stores destroyed in the fires have reopened, but 
with new restrictions, including security guards and restricted hours for some. 
Only one store of the original 15 has lost its license, a fact that disappoints 
but does not demoralize Bass.  
</P>
<P>
 For Bass, the liquor stores aren't a black issue or a Korean issue; least of 
all are they a black versus Korean issue. The neighborhood simply has too many 
places selling alcohol and too many merchants selling it to drunks and underage 
customers. Those that are there, she says, should operate so that men, women 
and children can walk by or go in to buy milk without being harassed by 
drinkers. Entrepreneurs who come into the neighborhood, she adds, should be 
encouraged to try to sell something other than liquor. Maybe a decent 
hamburger, McClellan suggests. Never once does Bass refer to the "Korean 
liquor-store owners," as a problem; she talks about the "owners," those who 
maintain their stores and those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent hearing in front of the city zoning administrator, coalition 
members and residents go to great pains to reassure the owner of a liquor store 
that they do not want to see him shut down. "I'm not here to see their liquor 
license pulled," says Alice Henderson, who lives at 90th and Flower streets. 
"The biggest problem that we have is respect." George Hinton, active with the 
Fellowship Christian Community Church across the street from the liquor store, 
tells the hearing officer that he's noticed an improvement in recent months but 
that the rules governing the liquor stores' operations need to be written down. 
No one talks race, just specific problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's done an incredible job," says Hicks. His Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference of Los Angeles recently honored Bass with the Rosa Parks Award for 
outstanding community activist. "The whole liquor-store issue is ethnically 
polarizing, but she doesn't polarize it. She's never engaged in Korean 
bashing." Bass, for her part, fumes that some television reporters are 
disappointed when they're directed to Castillo for interviews. "They want to 
have my black face next to a Korean," she says. "That's not the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why it was so important when Kim stepped forward to take her side on 
the liquor-store issue. His help has been "absolutely essential in blurring 
racial lines," says Bass. "There are some Korean leaders who understand what we 
are trying to do, but they won't go on record saying that we have a case. When 
Kim told the press how he felt, it helped immeasurably." 
</P>
<P>
 That first breakfast at Roscoe's did not end with Kim and Bass deciding they 
were multicultural soul mates. Kim was open to listening to Bass, but he also 
wanted to recruit her to become part of the Black-Korean Alliance, created by 
the county Human Relations Commission in 1986 after four Korean-American 
merchants were killed. Bass objected. "It was set up as merchant to resident -- 
that's an unequal relationship," Bass says. "I also questioned why it was black 
and Korean when the neighborhood was heavily Latino. The black-Korean 
stereotype was already overdone." Nevertheless, Bass agreed to attend some 
meetings. And Kim persisted. He learned about a grant from the city to work 
with teen-agers and suggested that they apply together. She agreed and 
increasingly found Kim responsive and helpful when she would call with a 
problem or an idea regarding the liquor store issue. 
</P>
<P>
 AT FIRST GLANCE, KIM WOULD SEEM AN UNLIKELY CANDIDATE FOR THE role of 
"translator" for about 200,000 Korean Americans in the Los Angeles area. In the 
1970s, while Bass was finding her place in the civil-rights movement, Kim was 
at home mainly on the basketball court of his Bergen County, N.J., high school. 
His father, a chemist who sent for his wife and children when Kim was 3 years 
old, fretted that Kim would never amount to more than a jock. But when Kim 
attended Boston College, he began to confront the holes in his assimilation. 
Without the safety of close friends, he found it more difficult to ignore 
social slights or ethnic slurs. He turned to philosophy tracts to find some 
answers. "I was trying to get a better sense of where I was in relation to 
society, and a lot of it had to do with cultural identity," he says. "I went 
through a whitewash period, thinking I was white, then realizing that wasn't 
what I was," he says. "I sort of broke down." The crisis led him to take a year 
off from school to visit relatives in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Kim says, "I found a lot of richness, a nation of people who looked and 
talked like my parents. But I thought my identity would be out there, and it 
wasn't." After graduating, Kim headed West, trying to get closer to the 
Korean-American community and himself. For five years, he ran the Korean 
Community Center in the East Bay. In 1988, he arrived in Los Angeles to take 
charge of the Korean Youth and Community Center, which runs everything from 
after-school programs to conflict-resolution counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 In six years, Kim has built the agency, which had an operating budget of 
$300,000 a year in 1988, into a powerhouse with an annual budget of $2.2 
million, 70% of it from government funding. Today he manages a staff of 65. 
They are the children of privilege -- young, college-educated, from comfortable 
families, with political views ranging from Christian right to liberal left. 
Like Kim, most speak at least some Korean and maintain close ties with the 
culture and their families. Kim, 36 and unmarried, explains that, as an only 
son, he has a duty to his parents to marry a Korean woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradition also meant that Kim, a member of the so-called 1.5 generation that 
came to the United States as children, could not easily challenge the authority 
of the first-generation Koreans. Kim waited from the sidelines, trying to 
encourage participation in multicultural initiatives like the Black-Korean 
Alliance, but he never got very far. Then, in 1991, Soon Ja Du, who helped run 
a liquor store on South Figueroa Street, shot and killed 15-year-old Latasha 
Harlins because, Du said, the girl was stealing orange juice. Du received a 
$500 fine and five years' probation. "There were a lot of hard feelings on both 
sides, and there wasn't any leadership from politicians," says Kim. "After 
Latasha, it got progressively worse." After the first verdicts in the Rodney 
King beating, it exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 The riots thrust younger Korean Americans like Kim into the spotlight. In May, 
1992, few first-generation Koreans knew how to get their side of the story to 
the media. Kim and others, like Marcia Choo, program director of the Asian 
Pacific American Dispute Resolution Center, filled the vacuum. 
"First-generation Koreans had to acknowledge that we played a role," Kim says. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Kim is still struggling to hold onto that role -- as 
evidenced at a recent meeting of the Korean American Inter-Agency Council, an 
umbrella organization of eight groups planning a national networking conference 
on Korean-American community issues. The participants, a mix of 1.5 and 
first-generation Korean Americans, start in English to discuss the choice of a 
keynote speaker for the conference. The elders name several prominent Koreans; 
Kim nominates Joe Hicks of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. 
Everyone smiles. Then the first-generation representative launches into a long 
argument in Korean. In the end, Hicks is named as an alternate and Laura Jeon, 
director of the Korean Health Education Information & Referral Center, is the 
representative.  
</P>
<P>
 The second dispute is triggered over the use of a $30,000 grant. Speaking 
English, a program director from Kim's agency says they need to hire someone to 
help with earthquake relief. In Korean, the first-generation representative 
replies that the Korean Youth and Community Center is getting too large, and 
the smaller, older organizations should get the money. The matter is tabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the classic split between the first and 1.5 generation," Kim says later, 
explaining that the first generation wants the money to stay completely within 
the Korean community rather than move to more mainstream organizations. "The 
first generation is in survival mode. What they've done is admirable, but 
they've got to learn how to leverage with the mainstream." Kim, who talks about 
someday running for office, partly on the strength of the alliances he's formed 
with Bass and other black and Latino leaders, adds: "The African-American 
community has learned that well." 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion that there's something to learn from African Americans isn't 
likely to go down well in Koreatown. Many Korean Americans don't define 
themselves as part of a rainbow coalition. "Coalition building is not embraced 
in the Korean community, as in others that have a long history of struggle," 
says Marcia Choo. "Koreans think that if they work hard and stay out of 
trouble, they'll be fine. They don't put themselves in the context of Los 
Angeles. That's why some of them say Bong Hwan isn't being Korean enough." 
</P>
<P>
 INITIALLY, KIM AND BASS WERE CONVINCED THAT, ONCE THEY STARTED talking, the 
hard part would be over. They believed it wouldn't be difficult to find other 
profitable -- and legal -- business opportunities for the merchants whose 
liquor stores had burned to the ground. They were mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two liquor-store owners who have surrendered their licenses, one has 
opened a coin laundry at Figueroa and 52nd streets; the other, David Whang, 
plans to open a laundry soon at 89th and San Pedro streets. Because Whang 
repeatedly assured local residents that his laundry would have an attendant to 
prevent the store from becoming a gathering place for troublemakers, they 
supported his request for a waiver of sewage-hookup fees. But when Whang 
submitted his plans, there was no mention of an attendant. The residents hauled 
Whang back into hearings and kept him there until the attendant was written 
into the plans. "The back and forth didn't help relations much," says Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hasn't helped much, either, according to Patrice Wong, general 
manager for the Alliance for Neighborhood Economic Development. "We can't 
replace 200 liquor stores with 200 laundromats," she notes, but the city hasn't 
any better ideas. The mayor's office has stonewalled them, says Wong: "We take 
out our appointment books when we meet and say that we should talk about it, 
and they say, 'We'll give you a call.' " Kwoh of the Asian Pacific Legal Center 
agrees there's been little city leadership to help ease racial tensions. "There 
are a lot of comments about support," he says, "but it never goes anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 When Kim decided to back the conversion program, it was one of the few 
solutions he could see. "The only other position was for compensation, and I 
just didn't see it happening because the victims didn't have any political 
capital," he says. As time goes on, however, he's increasingly pessimistic. 
"Progress is still slow, and I have an uneasy feeling that if we aren't able to 
convert enough businesses, criticism will be justified. This is the only time 
that Asians and African Americans have come together on addressing the problem. 
If we fail, it won't be for lack of us trying. We didn't get the necessary 
support from the political institutions that we were hoping to have."  
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the city cries poor. "I don't know that the mayor's office can 
wave a magic wand to make a really terrible situation turn out right for 
everyone," says Steven MacDonald, the mayor's director of business assistance. 
"We have extremely limited resources." His office, he says, is focused on 
persuading existing businesses to remain in the city. Creating new businesses 
or helping a community come up with a business plan, he adds, is beyond his 
office's abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the damage mounts in Bass' neighborhood. The vacant lots left 
by the riots are now overgrown with weeds and scrub grass, but, as Bass drives 
through, she points out the hamburger stands that deal in drugs, the hotels 
where only prostitutes take rooms, the burnt-out men slouched against burnt-out 
buildings. "Nothing will really change until the economy changes," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the liquor stores now have concrete blocks in place of the glass 
storefronts that shattered in the riots. The glass allowed patrol officers or 
neighbors to make quick security checks, but the owners argue that the blocks 
protect them from gunshots. Inside, they've raised thick plexiglass walls as 
further protection, adding another barrier to the cultural and linguistic walls 
that already existed. When a Latino customer shouts through the plexiglass to 
the uncomprehending Korean owner, asking the price of a bottle of Coke, the 
tension is almost palpable -- and with reason; two Korean-American merchants 
were killed in South-Central in one four-month period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the merchants seem determined to stay. Witness the recent sale of 
Century Liquor Store on South Figueroa, allegedly the scene of drug deals and 
frequent assaults, according to Bass. Last fall, Bass thought she'd put Century 
out of business when she hauled its African-American license owner before the 
zoning administration for a revocation hearing. "We were just at the point of 
getting the license revoked when we hear it's being purchased by a Korean 
family," she laments. "If an African American can't control the situation, how 
can a Korean?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bass called Kim. But even if he could have stopped the license sale, it's not 
clear that he would push the issue very hard. "You have to understand that a 
store in South Los Angeles is all some people can do to get ahead," he says. 
"They can't go to the Valley because they can't compete with the other liquor 
stores where the owners are white and speak English." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the options are limited, Kim's loyalties are divided. "Translators," 
after all, interpret for their constituencies -- they don't tell them what to 
say. In the end, the Korean family was kept from Century Liquor store by 
another of South-Central's recurring dramas: The store has since burned to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 DESPITE A TRACK RECORD that, for every step or two forward, seems to take one 
or two steps back, Bass vows her campaign will continue, spearheaded by a 
subsidiary group, Neighborhoods Fighting Back, which will also focus on the 
area's motels, where prostitution and drug dealing are rampant. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, her hopes were lifted when the 2nd District Court of Appeal upheld 
the city's right to impose restrictions on liquor stores built after the riots. 
That helped soothe an earlier disappointment she faced when she and Castillo 
met with the new Riordan-appointed Planning Commission, a successor to the 
board that the community had painstakingly educated about the neighborhood's 
objections to the liquor stores. The women say the new members -- two Asians, 
one Latino and two whites -- treated them to a condescending lecture on race 
baiting. (The commission now has one Asian, three whites and one Latino.) 
Instead of exploding, Castillo reports, Bass said they needed to talk. "She 
wanted to start again," says Castillo. "That's patience." 
</P>
<P>
 It appears to have paid off. Marna Schnabel, president of the commission, says 
the commissioners educated themselves during the last several months. "Once 
done, the coalition and the commission understand one another," she says. "I 
believe what the coalition is doing is very positive. They do a lot of very 
effective work in the community. Some of us weren't aware of their history." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting again, and again, and again, may be the only way to address the 
racial and ethnic divisiveness that shapes South-Central. Perhaps recognizing 
that their best hope lies with the next generation, Bass and Kim recently 
started a graffiti-removal business for Latino, Korean-American and 
African-American teen-agers. They're sufficiently encouraged by the results to 
consider more multicultural partnerships -- as long, Bass stipulates, as the 
participants are also learning a skill, like entrepreneurship or leadership.  
</P>
<P>
 They are learning less tangible skills, too. When the graffiti-removal team -- 
now composed of 15 Koreans, 10 Latinos and 10 African Americans -- was first 
organized, their training included some consciousness-raising: "We got into 
different groups and discussed stereotypes, like how Koreans are supposed to 
always eat garlic, and all black people are on welfare or do drugs, all Latinos 
sell oranges by the freeways, stuff like that," says Elmer Roldan, 15. "People 
don't really know what they are talking about. They make it up because of 
ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
 Training teen-agers like Roldan and his teammates is just another way of 
translating suspicion and ignorance into empathy. "Slowly," Bass says, "they 
have become friends."

TRICKLE-DOWN CULTURE; SHARING, SAMPLING, SCANNING, RECYCLING -- IS IT ART OR IS 
IT MEMOREX?

<BYLINE>

 PCRV, the Pop Culture Recycling Virus, particularly plagued Broadway last 
season, leading some critics to carp that Stephen Sondheim's "Passion" won the 
Tony for best "new" musical by default. Nearly everything else was a revival. 
L.A. has already been served the musical transmogrification of Billy Wilder's 
"Sunset Boulevard," and this fall Broadway will get a super-hyped revival of 
"Show Boat," first seen in 1927 and now charging the highest ticket price in 
Broadway history ($75) as it vies to supplant the current Tony award-winning 
revival of "Carousel," first seen in 1945, as the finest restaging of a classic 
Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than musical theater is in the clutches of the virus. Hollywood, 
which suffers acute infections, seems to be in a chronic stage of PCRV with an 
endless run of movies based on TV shows: "The Addams Family," "The 
Flintstones," "Dennis the Menace," "The Fugitive," "Maverick" and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the digital world, where you can directly appropriate an 
image or riff. Sampling has become a medium in itself, used by hip-hop 
musicians as the basis of their art. Rappers sampled so many jazz riffs from 
Blue Note recording artists that the company threw up its hands and told one 
group, Us3, to go ahead and raid the entire Blue Note library of music. This 
year's gold-selling album "Hand on the Torch" is the result, with its 
irresistible hit single "Cantaloop," a pastiche of samples of Art Blakey and 
Herbie Hancock riffs with fresh hip-hop touches. As a result of Us3's success, 
Blue Note profits have doubled on its back catalogue, thanks to the attention 
the group has brought to some of the best jazz of the mid-20th Century -- 
certainly a salutary consequence of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Gilligan's Island: The Musical"? Has the recycling phenomenon devolved to 
mean we are literally just reusing what was junk to begin with? Are we so 
devoid of new ideas at the end of the 20th Century that the era has truly 
become a cultural wasteland? 
</P>
<P>
 THE NOTION HIT ME HARDEST ONE BRIGHT SUNDAY MORNING AS I CAREENED north on the 
Sepulveda Pass. With the top down on the silver Mustang convertible, hair 
jetting backward in a braid-packed ponytail, I howled as tears streamed down my 
face. I was too old for Pampers and too young for Depends, but there was going 
to be a major accident if I didn't pull over soon. I did. As they sped past, 
bewildered motorists glimpsed my bent, rocking form. I gripped my sides, trying 
to contain the roaring, incredulous laughter that the music in the tape deck 
had ignited: "Don't you know, Blue Eyes, you never can win," Bono squealed to 
Frank Sinatra. "Use your mentality, wake up to reality." When U2's great leader 
whimpered, "I've got you under my skin," I moaned: Et tu Bono? Accessory to yet 
another recycling of pop culture? I speak, of course, of the widely hyped 
platinum hit "Frank Sinatra Duets" -- mostly schlock commercial pairings of the 
Chairman of the Board with younger artists singing classic American pop tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's current nostalgia for old songs, old movies, old Broadway shows, 
old TV shows -- as well as postmodern critiques of certain of these cultural 
expressions (isn't that partly what "Beavis and Butt-head" is about?) adds fuel 
to a debate I've engaged in for years -- first as a musician, now as a writer. 
What is the distinction between artistic reinvention and recycling? What's the 
difference between mere appropriation and syncretism? 
</P>
<P>
 I've been particularly preoccupied with these themes of late because of a 
novel I am writing: "The Secret Life of Fred Astaire." (Relax, Mrs. Astaire, 
the title's metaphorical.) As a dancer and singer, Astaire reflects a uniquely 
American synthesis of European and African forms. He was white and a jazzman 
and, to some, automatically a cultural appropriator -- an early Elvis. To 
others, he is a dazzling totem to an inspiring syncretism that could not exist 
-- as, indeed, contemporary U.S. culture could not exist -- without an African 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 At the road's edge, I recalled the pale, pimple-faced young salesman in the 
music store who'd convinced me to buy "Duets" against my better judgment, 
though I am generally a Sinatra fan. I probably relented because the "Duets" 
cut playing softly in the store at the time was the supreme one: Natalie Cole 
issuing a perfectly read and unerringly swinging version with Sinatra of "They 
Can't Take That Away From Me."  
</P>
<P>
 Popping his fingers and wobbling his head, the young salesman stood behind the 
counter, now singing along with Anita Baker and Sinatra: "that sly come-hither 
stare, leaves my conscience bare, it's witchcraft." And the harder he wobbled 
that head, the more he reminded me of the jazz drummer whom jazz critic Stanley 
Crouch once tagged the "secret enemy of swing." But I appreciated his 
appreciation of these great songs and told him so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, I get no kick from champagne ," he suddenly crooned. "Wasn't Cole 
Porter great? And all those other guys, too. I hope we hear a lot more of these 
old songs." Mmmmm, that all depends. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As if I were flashing back on a bad drug trip, Linda Ronstadt's 1980s 
recordings of classic American tunes echoed in my head. I cringed. Despite 
Nelson Riddle's superb arrangements, her pedestrian phrasing and inability to 
swing affirmed that she, too, was a card-carrying member of the cult against 
swing. It takes a particular sensibility, as well as talent, to interpret these 
songs in the jazz and big-band style that was America's popular music. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, I told the salesman as I mounted my portable soapbox, these songs 
haven't been languishing in obscurity. Long the staple of jazz musicians, the 
American popular song has been kept alive and constantly reinvigorated by jazz 
artists who mine the lyrical, melodic and harmonic possibilities of the tunes 
in ways usually far superior to the original. That jazz has appropriately, but 
grudgingly, become "art" music (which means it doesn't make big money) and that 
its originators and primary innovators are African Americans (the most 
ambivalently loved people in the nation) continues to marginalize it. This is 
partly the reason it's possible for rock superstar Bono's squealing of Cole 
Porter to be hyped as a serious artistic statement, while Shirley Horn, the 
jazz singer and pianist who seems to atomize and freeze space and time with her 
peerless phrasing of similar material, dwells at the margins of popular 
consciousness, if not art. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 BUT THE QUESTIONS FOR THIS GRAND INQUISITION ARE THESE: WHETHER IT'S music, 
movies, literature, television or dance, when does the recycling of these 
aspects of culture elevate and illuminate the art -- either through subversive 
reinvention or a profound talent that has absorbed and mastered tradition? And 
when does recycling merely appropriate the material or trash it, exposing the 
artistic poverty of a particular cultural era, form or artist? Between my 
guffaws on the Sepulveda Pass, that's what I was thinking -- more or less. And 
as Grand Inquisitor, I threatened a bunch of folks with the rack it they didn't 
ponder it too.  
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, what you are thinking about is: Who are the Andy Warhols?" 
suggests Laurie Horne, dance critic for the Miami Herald. "Who are the people 
who are going to select these pop images and really make a new statement with 
them? Who is going to incorporate them into a creative statement about the 
world and how the pop iconography of the world is, in fact, changing our 
perceptions of the world? And who's just out for a ride? I am not sure anymore 
that we can really make these kinds of moral judgments," she asserted, "because 
so many of our (cultural) references are to the iconography of the pop world." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in her career, Barbra Streisand fit this iconoclastic image, and her 
rendition of "Happy Days Are Here Again" leaps to mind. "She was a subversive 
artist," claims Armand White, the New York-based arts writer and contributor to 
the Village Voice. "She certainly wasn't doing Broadway show tunes in the same 
old way, and she showed it was possible to reinvent, to re-energize, and not 
just recycle that material." 
</P>
<P>
 Her inspired reading of "Children Will Listen" on the recent "Back to 
Broadway" album is a social statement about the consequences of abandoning -- 
pyschologically and morally -- children. And in a climate of increasing 
hostility between blacks and Jews, only the "stupid and bigoted," says White, 
could fail to see how "daring and noble" is her duet with Johnny Mathis on that 
album of "I Have a Love/One Hand One Heart," from "West Side Story." 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time, "you had a standard repertoire of great songs that singers 
would prove themselves by. Streisand was a key exemplar of that," White says. 
"Doing covers was a legitimate artistic strategy (whose merit) we lose sight of 
in an era of some horrible person like Michael Bolton, who has no new ideas to 
bring to the songs he covers." 
</P>
<P>
 But "popular culture is rarely fresh or inventive," argues Lawrence Mintz, 
professor of American Studies at the University of Maryland and editor of 
"Humor in America," a compilation of essays on humor genres. "If it were fresh 
and inventive, it wouldn't be popular culture, it would be serious culture, or 
avant-garde culture -- there are exceptions to that -- but for the most part, 
popular culture is about repeating formulas and changing them slightly or 
bringing them back in new forms. Some of the things that make popular culture 
appealing are familiarity, predictability, some sense of a history. People 
watch 'The Cosby Show' and want to be reminded of 'Father Knows Best.' They 
watch 'Roseanne' and want to be reminded of 'The Honeymooners.' Very rarely is 
there anything in popular culture that is surprisingly new." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I argue, there is little surprising in classical culture -- that's why 
it's considered classic. A great opera singer gets no points for reinventing a 
Mozart aria. Classical music is about the mastery of technique and 
interpretations that honor the intentions of the composer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true," Mintz acknowledges, "that the classical culture, particularly the 
classical culture we have inherited from Europe, is not applauded for its 
innovation but for its faithful representation of classical standards. But the 
idea that popular culture is supposed to be unsettling is more easy to 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Culture, with a "capital C, I have problems with that. I don't buy into these 
hierarchies," counters Jimmy Reeves, a professor of communications at the 
University of Michigan, who laughs with unsneering delight at Beavis and 
Butt-head, the animated miscreants of MTV. "Yes, I have to say I do love them. 
They allow me to flash back to an earlier identity and a lot of people I knew, 
guys in high school, who were wasteoids and became aficionados of the low," 
says the 42-year-old native of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 But about this distinction between high and low culture, he continues: "In 
high culture, this recycling is called allusion. They will look at 'Finnegan's 
Wake' or something by T.S. Eliot, who makes references to ancient mythology, 
and say that's a literary allusion. But when it comes to the realm of popular 
culture it becomes, somehow, depraved, an example of a lack of creativity. I 
don't buy that somehow high culture is supposed to be immune to this question 
of recycling, of drawing on what happened in the past. This is how culture 
works, it's an ongoing conversation. It's a recognition that a particular 
artistic expression is connected to a tradition and comments on the tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Recycling and reflection, one might argue, are hallmarks of the postmodern 
world. I learned I was in the postmodern world because critics kept calling 
David Letterman a postmodern comic, and I live contemporaneously with Dave. I 
like Letterman. I know that his humor is ironic and self-aware. He sends up 
conventions -- especially those of the pretentiously unconventional. 
</P>
<P>
 THE POSTMODERN WORLD IS A transitional epoch. What does it bridge? It links 
the modern world that was born, many would say, in the verification of 
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity in 1919, the European suicide of World 
War I and the sexual Gnosticism of Freud, which grabbed the popular imagination 
after the war, with a world still forming. A new world already experienced in a 
multitude of ways seen and unseen, yet unnamed; one that, only in retrospect, 
will look upon modernism and the postmodern as did the romantics upon the 
classical era that preceded it and claim to know the lines of demarcation. The 
postmodern spirit offers nothing essentially novel; it rethinks modern culture, 
so it must recycle and reflect -- from the sublime to the ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, at one end of the cultural continuum, the postmodern artist 
rereads texts, as did Toni Morrison in her collection of essays, "playing in 
the dark (whiteness and the literary imagination)," on the unacknowledged 
African presence in American literature. In America's wholly racialized 
society, she writes, a calculated blindness by the literary critics makes it 
possible to "read Henry James scholarship exhaustively and never arrive at a 
nodding mention . . . of the black woman who lubricates the turn of the plot 
and becomes the agency of moral choice and meaning in 'What Maisie Knew.' " Or, 
she continues, they ignore, in Gertrude Stein's "Three Lives," the "exploratory 
and explanatory" uses to which Stein puts the black woman who holds center 
stage in the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "These critics see no excitement or meaning in the tropes of darkness, 
sexuality and desire in Ernest Hemingway or his cast of black men," Morrison 
writes. "They see no connection between God's grace and Africanist 'othering' 
in Flannery O'Connor." And with few exceptions, they treat William Faulkner's 
later works, "whose focus is race and class," as "minor, superficial and marked 
by decline." 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the cultural continuum, we have those aficionados of the 
low, "Beavis and Butt-head," and those who critique them. Farting and 
scratching their way to fame, B and B comment on slightly obsolete music videos 
that divide, as their world does, into "things that suck" and "things that are 
cool." They carry postmodern sensibility to the extreme: Everything is a joke. 
Nothing can be taken seriously because the world is a nihilistic mess, a notion 
reinforced by cataclysmic 20th-Century wars, the atomic bomb, which Einstein's 
theories made possible, and the popular misapprehension over his theory of 
relativity. At the start of the 1920s, it became the popular belief, for the 
first time (at least in the Western world) that there were no longer any 
absolutes, particularly between good and evil. Relativity became confused with 
relativism. 
</P>
<P>
 Both "Beavis and Butt-head" and "Mystery Science Theater 3000" -- a kind of B 
and B for the intelligentsia -- are really inventive ways of recycling the low 
end of popular culture, claims the University of Michigan's Reeves. A cult 
cable hit on the Comedy Central channel, "Mystery Science Theater" is based on 
a nightmare anyone without cable on a Saturday night knows: A human lab 
technician is trapped in space with his two robot sidekicks and is forced by 
evil scientists to watch an endless stream of bad flicks and, a la Beavis and 
Butt-head, keep up a running commentary. And these are really bad flicks: 
"Attack of the Giant Leeches," "Viking Women and the Sea Serpent," "The 
Crawling Eye."  
</P>
<P>
 But once, says the show's head writer, Mike Nelson, they accidentally aired, 
as a "bad" movie, Orson Welles' "The Magnificent Ambersons." Even if we are a 
society that reads less and depends on the mass media for a shared cultural 
identity, how can anyone who lays claim to pop cultural literacy not know the 
significance of any Orson Welles film? If that error was not just a technical 
mishap, it may suggest the poverty of intellect and artistry that can come from 
milking the low end of popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems there is a general dumbing-down that may affect even the supposedly 
hip. The creators of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" may just be wisecracking on 
culture and lack the true wit to critique. It's not a conviction, just a 
thought. Then again, this dumbing-down may be a carefully conceived plot. If 
the masses are kept as stupid as Beavis and Butt-head, whom we know neither 
think nor read, then the Ivy League types who reportedly write the show can be 
assured that many of their class will have job security in an economy where one 
in five college graduates take jobs that require no college. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps one of the consequences of PCRV is that we are literally just reusing 
what was waste to begin with. This can be said fearlessly about "Attack of the 
Giant Leeches" and with minor trepidation about "The Donna Reed Show," which is 
replayed on Nick at Nite and whose commercials for it are sendups done with 
subliminal messages flashing "Drink Milk" and "Marry a Doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves counters, however, that when the Nickelodeon channel runs a Donna Reed 
marathon and reframes it with commercials like that, it's not just recycling. 
"They're teaching the next generation subversive ways of viewing the material. 
You would never see that in the original." 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately, he notes, "there's a profound difference between the American 
Movie Classics' recycling of old movies versus Nickelodeon, which does this 
playful recycling of '50s television that invites subversive pleasures. AMC 
does this reverent recycling of old Hollywood movies that invites nostalgia," 
to which viewers lament, "they don't make movies like that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 In some regards, Stanley Crouch is one of those doing the lamenting. A 
self-proclaimed genius before he got the MacArthur Foundation award last year 
and an always entertaining spiritual Tory, the jazz and social critic asserts 
that there is a kind of artistic poverty pervading the popular culture that 
accounts for the nation's nostalgic turn. The country is hungry for true 
romance, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the central things we are in the middle of, in the pop arena, is the 
great difficulty in achieving a certain kind of adult vision of romantic 
involvement. By that I mean the whole male-female story, which is about 
optimism on one hand, and it's about love, loss and disillusionment on the 
other. In most pop music -- if you look at MTV or something like that -- it has 
been reduced to a kind of pornography with a backbeat." 
</P>
<P>
 He notes that Harry Connick Jr., a jazzman and retro-romantic song stylist, 
and performers mining similar territory "are successful because there is an 
appetite in the society for an expression of male-female relationships that are 
neither brutally barbaric . . . or the kind of amelodic, nursery-rhyme-level 
songs that these pop people write (today)." 
</P>
<P>
 The romantic song "dignifies, in a radiant, sensual kind of way, the 
relationship between men and women," he says. That relationship has been 
discussed ad infinitum in terms of politics and biology, Crouch notes, "but 
that doesn't supply what is spiritually needed for men and women to deal with 
each other. In terms of the romantic ideal -- and I don't care how corny the 
plot is -- you can't beat a Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire dance as the 
idealization of the male-female story. You can't beat it, nobody can smoke 
that. Do do dah, do do do, dedo ah, boo, be da. . . " he scats and I recognize 
the tune to "Cheek to Cheek." And their "whole dance symbolizes the ups and 
downs of male and female relationships. People can say it's stupid, it's the 
same movie over and over again -- he meets her, they don't like each other, he 
chases her, she kinda likes him, he makes a mistake, she thinks he tricked her, 
she quits him, and then he has to prove to her that it was actually blah, blah, 
blah . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But that's the way it always is, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly," he answers. "I think the first person in this decade who figures 
out how to tell that story in our time, who recodes the story in our terms with 
the same feeling -- because that's what people want -- is going to make as much 
money as Steven Spielberg, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone put 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 And of the man who helped generate Crouch's romantic ideal -- Fred -- what can 
be said? 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you deal with widely popular figures like Astaire, they are nothing 
but a bundle of appropriations from one point of view," says Sally Sommer, 
professor of dance history at Duke University and a dance critic. "To someone 
like me, who is a historian -- and my specialty is black dance forms of the 
20th Century -- it is amalgamation. He also mixes it through his own 
sensibility." Actually, she amends, she prefers to think of it as imitation. 
"It's not venal, as with the record industry," where there's a long history of 
appropriation, she says. Elvis Presley was a blatant example of that: a white 
man who was promoted because he could copy the black style the nation's youth 
hungered for without the social inconvenience of black skin. But "imitation" 
suggests that the artist appreciates another artist and wants to emulate what 
is "really cool," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In Astaire's case, it was much more "soft edge, blurred," Sommer offers. "He 
is such a stylist in his own right. I think that all jazz is black. I think 
that only political and economic power are held by white males in this country. 
Everything else, all the popular entertainment, all major American culture is, 
to me, black. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred Astaire was a jazzman, and because of that he is, de facto, an 
appropriator or imitator. But he kept so many Europeanisms in his dance forms: 
that close couple positioning, the very upright back, the way the arms frame 
the body, the lightness and bounding quality of the movement, the verticality 
of the movement -- all completely opposite of Africanisms. In the great African 
tradition, we get close to the earth, there is a much looser kind of spine, the 
pelvic area is much more free." 
</P>
<P>
 Tap is what people think of when they consider the African-American influence 
on Astaire. They forget that the ballroom tradition that informed his work was 
influenced by black popular dance as well. Ballroom dancing became a fad in the 
United States around World War I. And all those trots: fox, turkey, etc., were 
African-American dance forms introduced to Vernon and Irene Castle by black 
bandleader James Reese Europe. The Castles "refined" these dances and used them 
to launch an African-based dance craze early in the century that hasn't let up 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense, like the nation, Astaire could culturally be called African 
American. He certainly was not the greatest, or even a great, tap dancer. The 
late and revered hoofer, Honi Coles, used to say that Astaire "was a great 
describer of things," recalls Brenda Bufalino, director of the New York-based 
American Tap Dance Orchestra. "He described furniture and chairs and a broom 
really well." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that a put-down?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, Honi liked Fred Astaire. He considered him a great ballroom dancer. I 
think he was very inventive." 
</P>
<P>
 He is a classic example of syncretism, says the Miami Herald's Horne, in that 
he is clearly more "reinvention than appropriation." 
</P>
<P>
 If there are no new ideas, only new ways to express them, then Astaire 
succeeded in elevating popular dance through this Euro-Afro-American 
syncretism, also giving form to our deepest romantic yearnings. Whomever he 
imitated, when filtered though his unique sensibility, no one could duplicate 
him. Others had to learn, move on or stay stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel like we're stuck, lost in Nick at Nite. To my mind, as a cultural icon, 
Astaire is an inspiration for that new world yet unnamed, one surely being 
lived or conceptualized somewhere that's trying to break through the expanding 
channels of recycled cultural debris and the sometimes deadly aesthetic virus 
it breeds.

 Grunge. Deconstructivism. The monastic look. The waif look. For the past four 
years, designers have been ripping apart fashion from sleeves to hem, 
experimenting with new looks and ideas.And now they've put it all back 
together. This season, fashion is outrageous, sexy and glamorous, full of slick 
fabrics, tight miniskirts and dangerous stiletto heels. Spring's baby doll has 
become fall's vixen, intent on showing off legs, hips and breasts. Hair is 
coifed, lips are dark, nails are lacquered midnight red. Fashion hasn't been 
this blatant since the '70s. The message: Dress up. Provoke. Have fun while you 
can.

SERIOUS FUN; ANNA SUI'S QUIRKY DESIGNS COME OF AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Debra Gendel and Times Fashion Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anna Sui's gleeful eye sees poetry where fashion conformists see only the 
absurd. She trims her glittery disco dresses with garters and drapes fake fox 
stoles -- heads attached -- around the shoulders of serious supermodels. Smile 
, her clothes say, it's only fashion.  
</P>
<P>
 After a decade of anonymity, Sui grabbed the fashion world's attention a few 
years ago with her resurrection of hippie chic, a potent marriage of bohemia 
and psychedelia that appealed to the theatrical sensibilities of both New 
York's downtown crowd and Hollywood's young and hip .  
</P>
<P>
 Her quirky designs have evolved since then but remain part of fashion's 
vanguard. Today, Sui sells to more than 200 stores in the United States, Japan, 
Europe and Canada. And in what is surely the sincerest form of flattery, her 
work is copied by rivals. A souffle- sized faux fur hat that prompted giggles 
when Sui friend and longtime client Linda Evangelista wore it during the 
designer's collection debut in 1991 has turned up on competitors' runways. And 
earlier this year, an Italian designer was accused of duplicating Sui designs, 
stitch for stitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Sui's taste for eccentricity or romance or whatever you call her free-form 
aesthetic places the thirtysomething designer squarely opposite someone like 
Giorgio Armani, for whom less is more. For Anna Sui, more is more better. She 
tops a Norwegian sweater with a Norwegian cardigan, teams them with a fake fur 
skirt, patterned hose, a neon-green marabou scarf and a big hat to match. Oh, 
did we mention the teetering, five-buckle pumps? Woven through her work are 
references to favorite design motifs of the past -- Chanel suits, '50s-style 
jackets, Eva Gabor's peignoir in "Green Acres." 
</P>
<P>
 The designer attributes her tendency toward postmodernist sampling to a 
childhood spent poring over fashion magazines. As a Chinese-American teen in 
Detroit, she would meticulously match her shoes and purse to her dress, an 
effort that earned her the title Best Dressed Eighth-Grader. But her creative 
mettle wasn't truly tested until, while studying at Parsons School of Design in 
New York, she helped classmate Steven Meisel style photo shoots for an Italian 
fashion magazine. "They would send us skiwear, and we would turn it into 
hippies on motorcycles, adding fur vests and tapestry boots in much the same 
way as I do now when putting together a collection," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sui's fall collection is a generational leap from her signature look from 
spring, the baby-doll dress. The innocent girl in the patent-leather Mary Janes 
has grown up and would rather wear flouncy cheerleaders skirts, rubber rompers 
over neon-bright spandex T's and black vinyl pants. Sui credits the 
groundbreaking '70s fashion photography by Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton for 
inspiring the edgy glamour in her latest designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love all that glamour," she says. And so, she suspects, do the young women 
who came of age in the time of grunge. Push-up bras, corsets, garter belts, 
stiletto heels -- "for this younger generation, it's like playing dress-up," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her own personal style is defined by a few rituals from which she never 
varies: "I always wear Chanel Midnight Red lipstick and nail polish" -- and a 
discontinued but treasured blush called Orange Flame. Her penchant for color 
extends to her New York apartment, where floors and ceiling are vivid red and 
where, up until a few years ago, Sui did her designing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to do everything -- shoes, jewelry, lingerie," Sui confesss. 
"I've been talking to people about a perfume. I wish I had more money so I 
could do more." Until then, she's busy in her Garment Center studio, plotting 
the direction of her next collection. Possible influences include her recent 
travels through Europe ("I love the eccentric way people in London dress") and 
the shopping habits of her West Coast clientele ("A halter dress we did for 
spring just flew out of the store -- it showed a lot of skin"). 
</P>
<P>
 "Having a store in L.A.," says Sui of her year-old La Brea Avenue boutique, 
"has really opened my eyes. It got me thinking about non-seasonal design and 
more casual clothes." What also struck Sui was how close to the bone women here 
keep themselves. "Everyone is a size 2 or 4. I remember seeing women and 
wondering how old are they?"

 Billy Wilder's gratifying film noir classic from Raymond Chandler's adaptation 
of the James M. Cain novel leaves an impression that's indelible, no matter how 
long it's been since you've seen it. How could you ever forget Barbara 
Stanwyck's hard-as-nails bottle blonde who teams up with insurance salesman 
Fred MacMuray (pictured) to get rid of Stanwyck's much older husband (Edward G. 
Robinson)? Wilder also made wonderful use of L.A. locations. (AMC Tuesday at 2 
p.m., again at 8 p.m.)

 Director Agnieszka Holland and adaptor Caroline Thompson have created a lush 
but faithful 1993 film of Frances Hodgson Burnett's beloved children's 
classic.Imperious 10-year-old Mary Lennox (Kate Maberly, right), orphaned in 
India, is sent to live at her uncle's Yorkshire estate, so vast and forbidding 
that Count Dracula would feel right at home. Although spoiled rotten, Mary has 
a doughty spirit, which allows her and her grief-engulfed relatives to affect 
each other in a magical, transforming fashion. With Heydon Prowse (center) as 
the sickly Colin, Andrew Knott (left) as the sturdy Dickon and Maggie Smith as 
the killjoy housekeeper Mrs. Medlock (HBO Sunday at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 2:45 
p.m.). Kevin Thomas

CRITIC'S PICK: 'BAD BEHAVIOUR'

<TEXT>
<P>
 Les Blair's 1993 film offers a comic look at a love relationship that is 
wearing thin around the edges and makes few demands other than asking that we 
settle in for the duration. While it lacks the bite of fellow Brit Mike Leigh's 
films, it shares with them an ability to put strongly drawn folks on the 
screen. Beautifully acted by Sinead Cusack and Stephen Rea (pictured, with 
Saira Todd), Gerry and Ellie McAllister are an amusingly realistic 
married-with-two-children couple, frustrated by the patterns of their lives 
(Cinemax Monday at 4:35 a.m.). Kenneth Turan

<TEXT>
<P>
 This flawless 1991 Swedish film of strength and calm marks the solo 
directorial debut of cinematographer Sven Nykvist and centers on the dire 
consequences facing a young tenant farmer (Stellan Skarsgard) after he slays an 
ox belonging to his employer in order to feed his starving family. An Oscar 
nominee for best foreign film, it is a spiritual odyssey, a study of the 
psychology of guilt and a period piece depicting hardship amid the most 
beautiful of settings.It is also a love story, an affirmation of the power of 
faith in the face of cruel injustice. Based on an actual incident, the film is 
set in 1867. Starring Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow. (Bravo Monday at 5 p.m., 
again at 11 p.m.) Kevin Thomas

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; PHYLLIS GEORGE ENDS HER NINE-YEAR 'HIATUS' TO PLAY TO 
HER STRENGTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER GLIMPSE, Jennifer Glimpse is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 She's older. She's wiser. And this time around she could care less if the 
critics vote her Miss Congeniality. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis George is back. The onetime Miss America, onetime sportscaster, 
onetime morning news show host has returned to television after nine years. 
Although her first round with broadcasting was often plagued by controversy and 
criticism, this time she feels she's found her niche. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Phyllis George Special" -- the first aired in June and a second airs 
Wednesday -- is a one-hour program featuring interviews with high-profile 
personalities, a format for which George feels well-suited. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of show is a show I've wanted to do for many, many years," says 
George. "I love people. It sounds so corny: 'I love people.' But I genuinely 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 The show resembles the highly rated Barbara Walters specials. George, who 
views Walters as a role model, is flattered by any comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well Barbara, of course, is the master. No one will ever compare to her. I 
mean that," George says. "She has this incredible ability. I mean, people just 
want to pour their hearts out to her. If I could achieve one-tenth of that I'd 
be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 During her stint on CBS as co-host of "The NFL Today" from 1975 until 1984 and 
as co-host of "CBS Morning News" for eight months in 1985, George was regularly 
taken to task by critics. She was a former Miss America, beautiful and 
energetic, but she didn't know sports and she didn't know news. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Being Miss America) has been a help and a hindrance," says George. "It's 
been a help in that it's opened doors. It's been a hindrance in that people 
immediately said 'BQ,' you know, beauty queen. And you had to prove yourself 
more than the next person." 
</P>
<P>
 George cites Emmys garnered by "The NFL Today" as evidence that she mastered 
the sports interview. But success in the hard news arena proved more elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told I was hired to compete with 'Good Morning America,' " says George. 
"But then I got in there and was thrust into hard news. (CBS) didn't play to my 
strengths." 
</P>
<P>
 George's strengths, she contends, lie in her softer, less aggressive 
interviewing style. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Southern," she says. "I don't look at someone and say, 'I don't trust 
you. I'm suspicious of you.' That's not my nature or my personality. My style 
is easygoing and relaxed. Therefore, in an interview, I don't think someone's 
sitting there with their hackles up waiting for me to throw the next bomb. 
(People) feel comfortable talking to me. I think they can tell that I'm 
genuinely interested in them. And I am. I figure if I'm conversational, if I 
make someone feel comfortable, then they're going to tell me a lot of things 
they're not going to tell Mike Wallace and Sam Donaldson." 
</P>
<P>
 That style, George says, has already served her well on the new show, most 
notedly in her interview with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known the Clintons for years," says George. "My husband (John Y. Brown) 
was governor (of Kentucky) when Bill was governor (of Arkansas). They were 
freshmen governors together, so we've had a friendship for a long time. I think 
he felt comfortable talking with me about Chelsea -- (my son) Lincoln and 
Chelsea are the same age. But he also knew I wasn't going to take that 
information and twist it and turn it. It was going to be straight as he told it 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 In this month's installment, George interviews Kenny Rogers, Dallas Cowboy 
quarterback Troy Aikman and former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback-turned Fox 
NFL play-by-play commentator Terry Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 George, who still lights up a room with her Miss America good looks, doesn't 
characterize her return to television as a comeback, but rather, the end of a 
long hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never said I retired," says George, who while away from television started 
a Chicken by George product line in 1987 and later sold it to Hormel. "I just 
said my priorities changed and I wanted to refocus and reorganize and regroup 
and recharge my battery." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you call George's re-emergence, she feels the response has been 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This show does suit my personality. I'm not pretending to be something I'm 
not. I mean, I can just be Phyllis. And it's interesting to find out who you 
are after 45 years." 
</P>
<P>
 "A Phyliss George Special" airs Wednesday at 5 and 9 p.m. on TNN.

FOCUS; SPELLING CHECK; MEGA-PRODUCER'S LATEST VENTURE IS HIS OWN 'NETWORK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 What, he worries? 
</P>
<P>
 He's launched some of television's highest profile series -- "Beverly Hills, 
90210," "Melrose Place," "Dynasty," "Family," "Love Boat," "Fantasy Island," 
"Charlie's Angels," "Mod Squad." And, OK, a clunker or two -- "Nightingales," 
"Winnetka Road," "HeartBeat"; the jury is still out on "Models Inc." 
</P>
<P>
 But, heaven help him, Aaron Spelling says he's nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must be honest, I feel much more pressure than ever," says the 66-year-old 
TV producer of his latest venture. The butterflies this time around come from 
launching what's being touted as a new "network." His network. The Spelling 
Premiere Network. He hopes it will draw women in the syndication market a la 
the successful testosterone targeting by Warner Bros.' Prime Time Network 
("Kung Fu," "Babylon 5") and Paramount ("Star Trek: The Next Generation," "Deep 
Space Nine," "The Untouchables"). 
</P>
<P>
 "There really is nothing for (women) to watch in syndication," Spelling says, 
pointing to such male-oriented shows as "The Untouchables," "Cobra" and 
"Renegade." 
</P>
<P>
 From that counterprogramming premise, the Spelling Premiere Network was born 
and, he says, a good case of insomnia. "We're totally responsible for the cost 
of the shows," he explains. And with a 22-episode order for each series at 
about $1 million per show in production costs, "It's a $44-million gamble." 
</P>
<P>
 "Heaven Help Us," one of the two new Spelling network series that premiered 
last week, features an angelic newlywed couple who really become angelic when 
their plane crashes during their honeymoon. And helping these two 
angels-in-training earn their wings is a Super Angel, played by Ricardo 
Montalban. 
</P>
<P>
 The second show, "Robin's Hoods," is "more down to Earth," Spelling jokes. It 
revolves around a group of parolees who work in a hip nightclub and solve 
cases. While they're not angels, these young Spelling-esque lovelies look out 
of this world. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of the series to 107 stations by Worldvision, Spelling's distribution 
arm, doesn't allay Spelling's anxiety. "The sale was based on previous shows we 
had done," he acknowledges, shows that have done well attracting women in the 
coveted 18-34 age range. 
</P>
<P>
 But has Spelling lost his spell? His latest Fox show, "Models Inc.," has 
received lackluster ratings and the nickname "Models Sink." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, "Heaven Help Us" is going all-out for the estrogen crowd with 
its fantasy feel, its nod to Cary Grant and its high romance quotient. The 
ethereal couple, the ex-baseball star played by John Schneider and the 
debutante played by Melinda Clarke, are gloriously in love. And in Spelling 
heaven, angels, at least married angels, can have some pretty steamy scenes. 
"But Mr. Shepherd (Montalban) keeps popping up whenever they start having a 
little fun in the bedroom," says Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
 Spelling calls Montalban the perfect guardian angel. "He has that marvelous 
sternness . . . and that distinctive voice. I think it's great to have an 
Hispanic angel -- people think angels are so white." 
</P>
<P>
 But Montalban's proteges on the show are not perfect angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, grown up since his days on "The Dukes of Hazzard," enjoys the 
couple's newlywed squabbles. "My wife Elly and I get along like that. We're a 
little sarcastic here and there." 
</P>
<P>
 Playfulness aside, Clarke finds her character's strength appealing. "She'll 
take risks. It takes a lot for her to be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, her appearance counts -- a lot. Her hair and designer clothes are "big 
issues," says Clarke, who admits to being fussed over on the set in San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robin's Hoods" also features a strong female lead in Linda Purl, who plays a 
former assistant D.A. who runs her husband's nightclub after his death. Purl's 
character reluctantly becomes den mother to the parolees who work in the club. 
They're a lovable bunch of gorgeous women: the bad check writer; the petty 
thief; the accomplice to robbery; the one arrested for drug possession. The man 
among them -- played by David Gail -- is surrogate big brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be that female viewers may not share Spelling's fascination with 
beautiful women in short denim shorts and cowboy boots? 
</P>
<P>
 Purl says women will relate to the show and her character, Brett, in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at my own life in my 30s, it seems that everybody goes through 
something. Brett's something is that her husband was killed. She's a single 
woman, a novice small-business owner. I think those are challenges that any 
woman who is (at any of those places) in their lives can relate to." 
</P>
<P>
 Spelling says he's a huge fan of programs that present strong women. In fact, 
he's been criticized for portraying weak men who serve as sex objects on his 
series -- the himbos. "I think it's great for women to have shows with women as 
leads. . . I think we're giving women two shows they'll like," he says. "I hope 
I'm not wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Nielsens will tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heaven Help Us" airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on KCOP ; "Robin's Hoods" airs 
Thursdays at 9 p.m. on KCOP.

IT'S A LIVING; TALK THIS WAY; DELIVERING DIALECTS AND DIALOGUES IS A COACH'S 
JOB: HOW THEY DO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE, Libby Slate is a frequent contributor to TV Times and Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Santa Monica native Linda Gray won the role of Sue Ellen Ewing on 
"Dallas," she turned to dialect coach Robert Easton to learn a Texas accent -- 
and was so good that she was asked to tone it down on the set because she was 
showing up other cast members. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kenny Rogers did a guest stint on "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" he got into 
the lingo of the new Old West under the guidance of dialogue coach Steve 
Posner, who also helped out guest stars Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. And 
when it comes to speaking Cheyenne on that CBS series, cast members learn the 
language from dialect coach Eva Allrunner, a Cheyenne whose grandfather and 
brother were chiefs of the Oklahoma-based tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Dialogue coaches and dialect coaches may not fulfill the same function -- the 
former primarily assist performers with their lines, while the latter teach 
various accents and languages. They do, however, share a common goal: to ensure 
that actors and actresses deliver those lines correctly and credibly. 
</P>
<P>
 A dialogue coach's job description usually broadens when the cast includes 
children. Now working on the CBS sitcom "The Nanny," Posner is available at 
guest stars' request and often "runs lines" -- rehearses dialogue for accuracy 
rather than interpretation -- with the entire cast before the weekly taping. 
But most of his time is spent with the show's three youthful stars, Madeline 
Zima, Benjamin Salisbury and Nicholle Tom. 
</P>
<P>
 "With young, inexperienced actors, you'll run blocking (the performers' 
movement before the cameras), give them business to do, give line 
interpretations, discuss what the beats of a scene are, all in concert with the 
director," Posner says. "Because school is a priority and the kids aren't 
always on the set, I'll write down the blocking and let them know what cues 
have been changed." He also relays directorial instructions to his young 
charges and on tape day remains on the set, going over lines, reminding of any 
changes and being cheerleader as well as coach. Posner has a Ph.D. in 
psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor of a different sort is Robert Easton, who bills himself as "the 
dialect doctor -- accents cured, dialects strengthened." Perhaps the field's 
best-known practitioner, Easton, who began almost five decades ago as a 
performer and still acts occasionally, has participated in productions the 
world over. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, he's been working with "NYPD Blue's" Dennis Franz and "Melrose 
Place's" Heather Locklear for the upcoming ABC miniseries "Texas Justice." 
</P>
<P>
 He coached Jane Fonda for the Appalachian-set TV movie "The Dollmaker," for 
which she won an Emmy, and taught British-born Jane Seymour Americanese for 
various projects pre-"Medicine Woman." When Easton worked with Gregory Peck on 
the miniseries "The Blue and the Gray," he urged the actor to deliver the 
Gettysburg Address in the resonant tones viewers would expect rather than in 
the high-pitched nasal voice the 16th President actually possessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually urge actors to tape the coaching session and then listen, listen, 
listen," Easton says. "I keep guiding them. They imitate themselves easier than 
they would a (non-personal) tape." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all performers have aural acuity, he notes. "Many are extremely visually 
minded, so I'll write it out for them, respell things. I talk to them about the 
differences in the tongue position, or the mouth or jaw, and also how the vocal 
cords should resonate." 
</P>
<P>
 And not all jobs actually call for teaching dialects, according to Jessica 
Drake, a Juilliard School of Drama graduate who turned Marion Ross into 
Russian-Polish-Jewish grandmother Sophie Berger in "Brooklyn Bridge," now 
running on Bravo. In the months ahead, we'll see the results of her work with 
Sally Field and Ron Silver for NBC's upcoming miniseries "A Woman of 
Independent Means." Drake also worked with Tom Hanks to help perfect his 
Forrest Gump-ese and recently worked on the miniseries "Return to Lonesome 
Dove" and the TNT film "Broken Chain." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," she says, "I have Americans who need to clean up their speech. It 
can be bad, and you can't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to ensuring authenticity, Easton has a two-story library and 
file cabinets galore; Drake does painstaking research to track down appropriate 
audio and videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The dialect coaches' work is most often done before or during filming. But 
that was not the case in what may have been Easton's greatest challenge: 
improving Japanese actress Yoko Shimada's phonetically learned English for the 
miniseries "Shogun" in post-production looping, with close-ups that were 
already edited. Shimada went on to win an Emmy -- for acting in a language she 
did not even speak.

RETRO; THE BRIDGE TO BROOKLYN; BRAVO SELECTS CANCELED SERIES FOR ITS 'TV TOO 
GOOD FOR TV' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary David Goldberg is thrilled that Bravo has chosen his acclaimed 1991-93 
CBS series "Brooklyn Bridge" as the latest offering on its "TV Too Good for TV" 
showcase. 
</P>
<P>
 (During the past year, "Twin Peaks" and "Max Headroom" have found a new home 
on the cable channel.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Brooklyn Bridge," which premiered to great acclaim in September, 1991, is a 
semi-autobiographical comedy-drama based on creator-executive producer 
Goldberg's childhood in Brooklyn, N.Y., circa 1956. Danny Gerard plays 
14-year-old Alan Silver, a middle-class Jewish youngster who loves his Brooklyn 
Dodgers. Alan lives in an apartment house with his father George (Peter 
Friedman), a postal worker; his mom Phyllis (Amy Aquino), and 9-year-old 
brother Nathaniel (Matthew Louis Siegel). The glue holding the family together 
are Alan's maternal grandparents, the strong-willed Sophie (Marion Ross) and 
the firm but charming Jules (Louis Zorich), who live in the same apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite positive reviews and numerous Emmy and Golden Globe nominations, the 
series never became a ratings hit. Within its first four months on the air, 
"Brooklyn Bridge" had four different time slots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know everyone whose show was canceled, no matter what, believes (the 
reason) was the time slot," says Goldberg, who was also the creator and 
producer of the long-running NBC sitcom "Family Ties." 
</P>
<P>
 "But actually we never had a time slot. I think that really hurt us, 
especially with our viewers, who, I don't think were necessarily watching tons 
of other shows. It was hard for them to keep up with the information. 
Television viewing is such a habit and that habit never got developed. In my 
own mind, I believe they never gave it a chance by leaving it in one place. I 
knew we were in trouble when my brother called and said, 'When is it on?' He 
couldn't find us." 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem was that "Brooklyn Bridge" was a half-hour series without a 
laugh track. Episodes were both funny and dramatic. "We used to say in our 
meetings all the time what goes on 'Brooklyn Bridge' shouldn't be on any other 
show. You shouldn't be able to tune in on another show and get that kind of 
experience that you can here. I think the coin of comedy has been diminished 
and, basically, what comedy is at the moment is just a lot of screaming and 
yelling and insults. We felt that sometimes we were comedic and sometimes we 
were dramatic. We had respect for the audience. We just wanted to present the 
information and let people decide if they wanted to laugh or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg says he's thrilled that every week approximately 9 million people 
tuned into the series. "They sought it out no matter where it was. That's very 
satisfying for me. If it wasn't for the ratings numbers that would come on the 
sheet each week, I would have thought we were a huge hit just because of the 
people stopping me on the street, and the same thing with Marion. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she was stopped more on this than 'Happy Days.' But whatever, it 
didn't translate into what is the only coin of recognition that really matters 
right now, which are these ratings. The measurements that exist now only 
measure gross numbers. They don't measure involvement, attachment or depth of 
viewing." 
</P>
<P>
 There was never any talk of doing the series for cable or syndication after 
CBS canceled it, Goldberg said. The series was too expensive to produce. "It 
was very hard with the kids. If you have 20 kids (on a show) you need welfare 
workers, you need teachers. Then what happens is that if you have a period 
piece, you have extras and extras need hair, makeup and clothes. We always felt 
we needed a lot of extras, and just to do it right it became very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg is currently producing and co-writing the new Fox feature comedy "Bye 
Bye Love" with Matthew Modine, Paul Reiser and Randy Quaid. "It's going to be 
nice. It is basically about three guys who are divorced and it's about the 48 
hours when they each have custody of their kids."

 Goldberg doesn't rule out doing another TV series, but says that after 
"Brooklyn Bridge" he was "deeply wounded. You want to say, 'I am out of here,' 
but I think that's a bad response to what happened. Over the last year or so, 
I've had time to think about it. I think I was given an extraordinary 
opportunity to do that show. I should just really focus on that. As a writer, I 
think it is very hard to say, 'I am going to turn my back on that audience.' 
It's just too wonderful an opportunity to get into a large-scale interaction 
and relationship with a really large group of people. It's hard to give that 
up.

 "Brooklyn Bridge" airs weeknights at 7 and repeats at 2 a.m. on Bravo.

CANDY HEIRESS'S MURDER PROBE EXPOSES BRUTALITY IN HORSE WORLD; CHICAGO: HELEN 
BRACH'S DISAPPEARANCE TRIGGERED INVESTIGATION THAT LED TO TRIPLE MURDER, ANIMAL 
CRUELTY AND INSURANCE FRAUD CHARGES.

<P>
 It is portrayed as a conspiracy of the rich and infamous -- a network of 
riders, trainers, owners and veterinarians who concocted a vicious plot to kill 
horses to collect insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The same people who pampered horses, picking up silver cups and blue ribbons 
along the exclusive riding circuit here and abroad, now stand accused of 
playing a role in the cruelest crimes: electrocuting, starving, even allowing 
animals to be burned alive. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal investigators say there was something even worse under the genteel 
veneer of crisp, velvet riding hats and sleek steeds galloping over fences. 
</P>
<P>
 There was murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say they exposed the seamy underside in this most unlikely of 
worlds on their way to something else: cracking the 17-year-old murder mystery 
of one wealthy animal lover. 
</P>
<P>
 They've arrested and charged one man with arranging the 1977 murder of Helen 
Vorhees Brach, lonely widow of the Brach candy fortune who vanished after an 
appointment at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Their investigation into Brach's disappearance also has led to the arrest of a 
61-year-old horseman in another of Chicago's most baffling mysteries: the 1955 
murders of three young boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Two whodunits 22 years apart. One unlikely connection: horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more tantalizing is the hint that more crimes may be solved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only is this unusual, but it's not over yet," says Jerry Singer, a 
spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The break in the Brach case was made public in July when federal authorities 
indicted 23 people prosecutors call a "virtual who's who of the nation's 
equestrian industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest in the 39-year-old murders followed soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual to investigate one crime and uncover evidence of another," 
Singer said. "It's interesting the way it all comes out." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very fortunate because these cases are rather old," he added. "But we 
never give up and we never forget." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police in north suburban Glenview never forgot about the mystery of the 
missing candy heiress. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, there were lurid Hitchcock-like hints about Brach's 
disappearance: her houseman's purchase of a meat grinder, a convict's drawing 
of maps and his claim that he buried the widow's body in Minnesota under cover 
of night, an exhumation of a mutilated corpse from a pauper's grave in 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 One man who came under suspicion early was Richard Bailey, a perpetually tan 
horse trader from Kentucky with an eighth-grade education and a knack for 
sweet-talking women. He had wined, dined and become an eager escort of Brach, 
who had her own modest origins: She met candy company founder Frank Brach when 
she was a coat-check girl at a Florida country club. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, two years after her disappearance, a spray-painted message was 
scrawled on the road near Brach's seven-acre estate reading, "Richard Bailey 
Knows Where Brach's Body Is," according to Glenview Police Commander John 
O'Connell. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell said that when Bailey was questioned, he said the same words had 
been painted on a sign at his stables in a nearby suburb. O'Connell declined to 
elaborate on what else Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Menk, a court-appointed attorney for Brach's estate, worth about $30 
million when she disappeared, also tried to question Bailey about his 
relationship with the candy heiress. "He took the Fifth Amendment, except for 
his name and address," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, after a five-year investigation of the equestrian industry, Bailey 
was charged with fleecing Brach and 12 other women of large sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors claim that since 1989, Bailey placed at least 26 lonely hearts ads 
-- "family oriented, loves dancing, exercising, long walks" -- conning affluent 
widows or divorcees into shoddy horse investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, 65, is accused of wooing an alcoholic divorcee, getting her drunk and 
persuading her to shell out about $90,000 on horses -- her virtual life savings 
-- in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment charges that after Brach threatened to report Bailey for 
talking her into spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on virtually 
worthless horses, he and a second unidentified person conspired with others to 
arrange her murder. No one is charged with actually committing the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey has pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Patrick Tuite, suggests his 
client is a "very charming man" who was merely involved in relationships that 
soured. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Brach, Tuite said his client "emphatically denies" any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 But others say the charges confirmed their worst suspicions about a woman who 
loved animals but was painfully naive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so blatant the way he flaunted Helen," Donna Ewing, president of the 
National Hooved Animal Humane Society, said of Bailey. "Anybody in the know who 
saw a neophyte get involved with someone of that caliber said, 'Oh, my God. 
There's one born every minute. Here's one who's going to be taken advantage 
of.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very lonely, a shy, quiet person," Ewing added. "She probably thought 
this would fill her loneliness and her hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brach probe, in turn, led authorities to a ring of riders, trainers and 
others in the equestrian industry who now are charged in an insurance-fraud 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 23 people charged, 19 were accused of crimes relating to the killing of 
horses to collect insurance; four, including Bailey, are charged with enticing 
people into bogus or inflated horse deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of those charged have pleaded guilty, including one former trainer who 
recounted in court last week how he killed two horses with a sledgehammer and 
crowbar, electrocuted a third and killed three more by tossing a lit cigarette 
in a trailer, igniting hay that had been soaked with accelerant. 
</P>
<P>
 A second trainer has admitted he paid a man $5,000 to electrocute his horse so 
he could collect $75,000 in insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of the accused, nicknamed "The Sandman," allegedly had a regular 
income as a horse hit man -- authorities say they witnessed him breaking a show 
horse's leg with a crowbar. 
</P>
<P>
 Six people have pleaded not guilty, including George Lindemann Jr., a one-time 
member of the U.S. Equestrian Team and son of cellular phone tycoon George 
Lindemann, whose wealth Forbes magazine estimated at $575 million. He was 
accused of paying $25,000 to electrocute his horse when it didn't perform up to 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these charges surprises Bill Graham, a folksy, Columbo-like insurance 
investigator from South Carolina who probes suspicious horse deaths nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because they've got money doesn't mean they're gentlemen or 
gentlewomen," Graham said. 'It's an incestuous, money-grubbing industry. . . . 
They don't look at horses as far as their intrinsic value. There's no altruism. 
If they don't perform, they're going to the glue factory. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the periphery of this world was the vulnerable widow, Helen Brach. Though 
an arrest has been made in her case, the puzzle isn't entirely solved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've still got a lot of unanswered questions," said O'Connell, of the 
Glenview police. "As of now, we don't have enough to indict anybody for 
murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Brach, who was 65 when she disappeared, was declared dead in 1984. Her husband 
and a cherished dog, Candy, are buried in Ohio. The elaborate grave next to 
them remains empty; her body has not been found. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one final irony: Mrs. Brach willed a large chunk of her estate to 
animal rights causes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the time an arrest was made in the Brach case, a brutal millionaire 
horseman named Silas Jayne had been dead for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1930s, he teamed up with his brothers -- they were known as the "Jayne 
gang" -- to ship horses from the West to the northern Illinois area, where some 
were sold, others slaughtered. 
</P>
<P>
 Silas Jayne's world was filled with violence, beginning with a rape conviction 
as a teen. His most notorious crime was his 1973 conviction for plotting to 
murder a rival -- his brother, George. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities say Richard Bailey, the man accused in the Brach case, was 
a Jayne associate; published reports also claim that a Jayne nephew introduced 
Bailey to Brach and other women. 
</P>
<P>
 Silas Jayne's name also has been connected to another sordid crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the fall of that year that the naked bodies of Robert Peterson, 14, 
John Schuessler, 13, and his 11-year-old brother, Anton, were found in a forest 
preserve ditch. They had been strangled. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe was exhaustive: Police said 43,740 people were questioned, and 3,270 
suspects interrogated. A $100,000 reward was offered. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those questioned was Silas Jayne, who had stables nearby. Another was 
Kenneth Hansen, then a 22-year-old horseman who worked for him and who later 
became a stable owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 40 years passed. Then, finally, Hansen, a balding, grandfather who 
reportedly had long been a suspect, was charged this month with the three 
murders. Once again, accusations of another awful crime in the horse world. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this case, there were no squabbles over money, no claims of deception, 
no country club atmosphere. This, authorities say, was just a tragic example of 
boys in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities contend Hansen picked up the boys while they were hitchhiking and 
took them to Silas Jayne's stables, where he sexually abused at least one of 
them, then strangled all three after one threatened to report him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen denies the charges. His son, Mark, born after the murders occurred, 
recently told reporters: "Whoever would have done a crime like this would have 
to have been a monster, and that's not my father." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months after the murders, Silas Jayne's stables were destroyed in a fire 
that investigators suspect may have been set to destroy remaining clues. When 
the boys' bodies were exhumed shortly afterward, police reportedly found 
evidence of hay in their lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer, the ATF spokesman, said the information leading to Hansen's arrest was 
developed in 1991 during the Brach probe. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent news conference, Cook County State's Atty Jack O'Malley would say 
only: "After 40 years, you don't solve a case by physical evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege Hansen admitted to the killings as recently as 1980, and 
had a habit of picking up young hitchhikers and inviting them to the stables to 
see horses. Two other people also were involved, though that doesn't 
necessarily mean they participated in the murders, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley said there are no allegations now that Silas Jayne was involved in 
the deaths. But Hansen had another link to him. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, Hansen was charged with conspiracy to commit murder in the death of 
George Jayne, but the case was dismissed, according to Arthur O'Donnell, 
Hansen's attorney. Hansen also was accused this month of arson in a 1970 fire 
that killed 36 horses at a competitor's stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen was an atrocious horseman, contends Ewing, the activist who dispatched 
investigators from her agency to check out his stables after receiving 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "His animals were ridden to death and dumped in the forest," she said, 
contending horses would be returned to him in weakened condition after a 
veterinarian took plasma from them to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would stumble, fall and die. . . . They would be ridden with huge open 
sores," she said. "He didn't care at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing is hopeful that the investigation will result in some housecleaning in 
the horse industry.

FAMOUS HAITI HOSPITAL CLINGS TO LIFE; CARIBBEAN: THE CHARITY ALBERT SCHWEITZER 
MEDICAL CENTER IS STAFFED MOSTLY BY FOREIGN WORKERS. THEY TREAT EVERYTHING FROM 
AIDS TO MALARIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Reverence for life," the philosophy of renowned humanitarian Albert 
Schweitzer, is carved in stone at the entrance to a hospital in central Haiti 
that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members still have their reverence for life, but preserving it has 
rarely been more difficult in the hospital's 38-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three years of military rule and economic sanctions have drastically 
worsened suffering in what was already the poorest nation of the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every day, we see somebody walking by here carrying a casket," said 
Sharon Arbaugh, a Mennonite missionary who volunteers at Albert Schweitzer 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic hardship has torn many families apart and made survival a challenge 
for those who stay together. The contrast between two babies at the hospital, 
one Haitian and one American, provided a stunning illustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting on a bench for treatment was Obene Normil, age 1, weight 11 pounds. 
Malnutrition had turned his dark hair red. Doctors said it might be 18 months 
before his spindly legs could support his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbaugh, working in the ward, carried along her own 8-month-old son, Jonathan, 
a robust 22 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walk through this ward, I feel like crying," she said. "If I hear the 
children crying, I want to just go and pick them up." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest international sanction, a ban on air service, poses even more 
problems for the hospital, preventing the arrival of volunteers and disrupting 
shipments of medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Marlene Goodfriend, a child psychiatrist from Rockford, Ill., was on one 
of the last commercial flights. The next day, she saved the life of a 
6-year-old boy who was brought in unconscious with a 104-degree fever. 
</P>
<P>
 That patient was reason enough for Dr. Goodfriend to put her practice on hold 
for at least six weeks and stay at Albert Schweitzer, which serves 185,000 
people in more than 600 square miles of the Artibonite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, I am needed," she said. "There, they can always go down the hall to 
another doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Full-timers at Albert Schweitzer don't even make five-figure salaries, much 
less the six figures they are accustomed to in the United States, said Tim 
Dutton, the administrator. Dutton, 42, gave up running a hospital in Shelby, 
Ohio, to bring his family, including daughters aged 6 and 8, to Haiti two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think that the normal life in the United States of career changes 
and stepping up the ladder was satisfying," he said. "There was an element of 
us needing . . . to make a difference. For our daughters, we wanted them to see 
that the world was a bigger place, and there were problems and pains." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital workers acquire Haitian resilience and seem confident that they will 
not only endure, but prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn patience, tolerance, that your way of running the world is not 
always right and that there are other ways too," said nursing director Debbie 
Berquist, who arrived 5 1/2 years ago from Hamilton, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haiti's gone through many cycles of instability, president after president, 
coup after coup. But the hospital goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses deliver babies. Doctors deal with AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, 
diarrhea, typhoid and hepatitis, handling more pathology in two weeks than they 
do in years in the States. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the hospital came to William Larimer Mellon Jr., an oil and 
banking heir, in 1947 when he read about the hospital started by Schweitzer in 
the poor African nation of Gabon. 
</P>
<P>
 "From that moment on, our life changed," recalled his widow, Gwen Grant 
Mellon, 83. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellon, who was in his 40s, quit ranching in Arizona, enrolled at Tulane 
Medical School in New Orleans and started corresponding with Schweitzer about 
starting his own Third World clinic. Schweitzer's facility, begun in a chicken 
coop, had evolved into a large hospital treating thousands of people a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellon chose Haiti, and when asked why, would respond: "Because Haiti is our 
neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
 Mellon managed the hospital until his death five years ago. Gwen Mellon runs 
it now from a wooden table in the courtyard. The money comes from family trusts 
and donations. Hundreds of foreign doctors who have served at the hospital are 
among the contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians pay the equivalent of about $1 for a visit, lab work and medicines, 
and about twice that for an overnight stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing people who walk all day or come by donkey to get treatment for 
themselves or their children, it doesn't take long to want to help, said Dr. 
Gretchen Berggren, 61, a lecturer at Harvard who has worked at the hospital off 
and on since 1967. She was one of six health care workers honored by the White 
House in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all inspired by the strength of the Haitian people," Berggren said.

SLAPP LAWSUITS STIFLE DISCOURSE, ACTIVISTS SAY; JUSTICE: PEOPLE WHO SPEAK OUT 
ON PUBLIC ISSUES ARE BEING ACCUSED OF DEFAMATION. SEVERAL STATES HAVE TRIED TO 
RESTRICT SUCH LEGAL MOVES, BUT NO LAW CAN GUARANTEE IMMUNITY.

<P>
 Retired wildlife biologist Art Hawkins has nurtured his sanctuary on the 
shores of Lake Amelia for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 So when a developer wanted to build townhouses across the lake, Hawkins 
worried about the environment. He did what he thought a good citizen should do: 
spoke at public meetings, wrote letters, circulated a petition. 
</P>
<P>
 And he got sued. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins believes he is among a growing number of people around the country 
slapped with lawsuits intended to shut them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans by the thousands are being sued simply for exercising one of our 
most cherished constitutional rights -- speaking out on political issues," 
wrote George Pring and Penelope Canan, professors at the University of Denver 
who have studied the issue for the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 A Texas woman was sued for writing a letter to a newspaper calling a local 
landfill a "dump." A group of about 60 Pennsylvania parents were sued for 
defamation for telling a school board that their community's school buses were 
unsafe. Citizens fighting a proposed incinerator in New York were sued by their 
county governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Short of a gun to the head, a greater threat to First Amendment expression 
can scarcely be imagined," New York state Supreme Court Justice Nicholas 
Colabella wrote in a 1992 decision. (The New York Supreme Court is that state's 
trial court.) 
</P>
<P>
 Pring and Canan dubbed them SLAPP suits, or Strategic Lawsuits Against Public 
Participation. That name has caught on. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of Hawkins' testimony, Minnesota has joined seven other states 
in trying to deflect such suits. The state's new law, which passed almost 
unanimously, makes it easier to get frivolous suits dismissed and collect 
reimbursement for attorneys' fees as well as punitive damages. Similar laws are 
in effect in California, Delaware, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and 
Washington, according to Pring. 
</P>
<P>
 The multimillion-dollar lawsuits often are camouflaged as suits about 
defamation, interference with business or conspiracy, the researchers say. But 
they say the goal is the same: stifling political expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most frightening effect of all is what they're doing to public 
participation," Pring said. "We pride ourselves on being a participatory 
democracy; we even like to think we invented it. But we're destroying our own 
invention by allowing these cases to basically chill citizens into silence." 
</P>
<P>
 Most suits ultimately are dismissed, and victims can file "SLAPP-back" 
countersuits, Pring said. But in the meantime, victims lose money and time, and 
the suits still have their intended effect by muzzling defendants' speech and 
intimidating others who fear being sued. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Fritz Knaak, representing the developer suing Hawkins for defamation, 
said true SLAPP suits are a problem. But he said the suit against Hawkins was 
not one. It's not always an "evil, wicked developer" against an innocent 
citizen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to be responsible for what they say," Knaak said. "You don't want 
to create an environment where just because I stand up in a council meeting . . 
. that I can say anything I please about you and your spouse and your dogs and 
have there be no consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins, a former wildlife biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
says he was responsible. Inside the old farmhouse he shares with his wife of 54 
years, he brings maps and books to a heavy wooden table -- including textbooks 
he helped write and edit -- to explain his concerns about ospreys and other 
threatened species that nest near the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two-year case, he racked up more than $20,000 in legal bills to 
defend himself. His wife, Betty, described it as years of "lying awake at 
night, worrying, and getting up early and looking at maps." 
</P>
<P>
 "I might actually have been doing something constructive with all of that 
time," said Hawkins, 81, who once studied under famous ecologist and Wilderness 
Society founder Aldo Leopold. Hawkins put his writing on hold and the couple 
quit going to Arizona for part of the winter, worried about legal developments 
in their absence. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit recently was settled out of court; Hawkins says he still feels 
silenced because details are confidential. He says he settled because the case 
could have dragged on for years and he did not want to spend his remaining 
years that way. The couple also worried about entrusting their fate -- and 
their beloved farm -- to a jury. But they remain disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always thought the First Amendment meant what it said, that you are 
entitled to speak as long as what you say is in good faith and isn't meant to 
slander anyone," Hawkins said. "We thought that was the way this country 
worked."

DMZ NOT ALL THAT PEACEFUL FOR S. KOREA VILLAGE; ASIA: NORTH KOREAN JEEPS AND

 Ku Chun Woo's eyes harden as the North Korean Army patrol jeep, bristling with 
radio gear, rattles off into the late afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my hometown," said Ku, standing near his flooded rice field 100 yards 
inside South Korea. "My ancestors lived here. I was born here. I have no 
interest in leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 The jeep and other military gear are an unwelcome and unnerving presence for 
Ku and about 240 other South Korean farmers and their families who dwell here, 
within hectoring distance of the most heavily armed border in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Ku will soon head toward his house, where his wife and two daughters, ages 6 
and 4, are waiting to begin dinner. Any last-minute family errands in the 
village will have to be finished quickly. All residents are required to be in 
their homes by sundown. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11 p.m. they will bolt their doors and windows to keep out intruders from 
North Korea who might try to sneak across the border and kidnap them -- and 
later claim they defected. 
</P>
<P>
 It's another day inside the post-Korean War curiosity that Americans call 
Freedom Village. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, Taesong-dong is a typical Korean hamlet. It has a school, shops, 
a pharmacy, rows of neat brick-and-frame homes and some picket fences. 
</P>
<P>
 But even more than their countrymen elsewhere on the Korean Peninsula, 
residents of Taesong-dong live, literally, under the shadows of guns. South 
Korean soldiers stand guard as they work in their fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes North Korean soldiers come to the line and try to talk to the 
villagers, try to get them to defect," said one of the military guards, Cpl. 
Ahn Byung-hoon, through a translator. "It gets especially spooky at night or in 
fog or rain. You're not sure what's out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Taesong-dong is a metaphor, in part calculatedly so, of life in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1953 armistice that ended the shooting in the Korean War resulted in the 
existence of three villages inside the demilitarized zone (DMZ), the 
2.5-mile-wide buffer that cuts a 150-mile swath across the peninsula and 
divides North and South roughly at the 38th Parallel. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the three is Panmunjom, a village destroyed by tank fire during the 
war. It was designated as the site of the truce talks, which continue 
sporadically to this day. The village straddles the military demarcation line 
that runs down the middle of the DMZ, marking the border. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, both nations reserved the right to set up one "working" village 
inside their sector of the DMZ. They chose sites directly opposite each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The village on the north side, a few yards from Taesong-dong, is called 
Kijong-dong, or Peace Village. Southerners call it Propaganda Village: Every 
day, Taesong-dong residents are subjected to long propaganda harangues boomed 
over the border through three-story loudspeakers, urging them to cross 
voluntarily into the workers' paradise of North Korea. No one has yet accepted 
the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the competition for the hearts and minds of Koreans on opposite 
sides of the line sinks to seemingly childish proportions, though probably not 
inconsistently in an area where for years negotiators have sat across a green 
baize table and hurled insults at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, South Korean authorities built a 330-foot tower in 
Taesong-dong from which to fly their national flag. A few weeks later, the 
North Koreans put up a 525-foot tower in Kijong-dong. The flag that flies from 
it is 98 feet long. It requires a 25-knot breeze to unfurl and a large truck to 
haul it off for cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 As the South Koreans like to point out, Taesong-dong is inhabited around the 
clock by working farmers. Kijong-dong, in contrast, appears to be vacant most 
of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the games played inside the DMZ are peaceful. The current mayor of 
Taesong-dong carries a nasty bayonet scar on his chest from an attempted 
kidnaping about 15 years ago. When he resisted, he said, North Korean troops 
stabbed him and left him for dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Like virtually all Koreans, farmer Ku longs for eventual reunification of his 
country -- a vision common on both sides of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his death in July, North Korean leader Kim Il Sung had targeted 1995 
for reunification -- albeit under his own terms. How Kim's successor will deal 
with this commitment remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 In the South, ardor for quick reunification has cooled, as the realization has 
settled in that reunification would be costly. 
</P>
<P>
 South Koreans have closely scrutinized the reunification of East Germany and 
West Germany -- the resulting economic drain on the prosperous West. Most are 
now convinced that a similar effort in Korea would be even harder on their 
pocketbooks, because the disparity between the two regions is greater than in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The South's economy is more than 10 times bigger than the North's, where even 
basics such as food are in short supply, defectors say. Per-capita income in 
the South is more than five times higher than in the North. 
</P>
<P>
 Most southerners now speak of reunification in five to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Public opinion polls indicate that most South Koreans doubt that North Korea 
would launch an attack. Even in Seoul, the booming metropolis of 10.5 million 
just 35 miles south of the DMZ, within range of North Korean artillery, 
residents find it hard to believe those guns would ever be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all brothers," said E. B. Lee, a Seoul businessman who was born in the 
North but whose family fled south at the end of World War II. "And, besides, 
they could never win." 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to the demarcation line, where residents have witnessed North Korean 
attempts to infiltrate the South by various means, including rubber boats and 
tunnels, people aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen their willingness to violate the terms of the truce," said Ku Chun 
Woo, watching an egret swoop in from the north and splash down in his rice 
field. "Especially if they had nuclear weapons, I think North Korea would 
attack."

KINDNESS LESSONS COST SONS THEIR LIVES, MOTHER SAYS; NEW YORK: ONE BOY WAS 
STABBED TO DEATH TRYING TO STOP A ROBBERY 11 YEARS AGO. THIS MONTH, ANOTHER ONE 
WAS SHOT TO DEATH, ALSO WHILE TRYING TO STOP A ROBBERY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Christina Vaccarino always taught her children to be kind and to help people 
in need. They learned the lesson, perhaps too well. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to help others have cost two of her sons their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaccarino buried one son, Edward, 11 years ago after he was knifed to death 
trying to stop a street robbery. She relived the tragedy this month, when 
another son, Glenn Iscoe, was shot to death trying to break up a bagel store 
holdup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I blame myself for my son's death," Vaccarino said at her home in Queens. "In 
our family, whether you know a person or not, you help them out when they're in 
need. That's a lesson I've taught my children." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he was listening to my words when he went to help those people," she 
said, her voice choked with sorrow. "Maybe he'd be alive today if I hadn't 
taught him that." 
</P>
<P>
 Iscoe, 35, was taking a break from driving his livery cab early one morning 
and stopped for coffee at the bagel shop. As he waited in line, a skinny, 
nervous man in front of him pulled out a gun and announced a robbery, pointing 
the gun at the two employees behind the counter, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hurry up! Hurry up or somebody's going to get killed!" the robber shouted as 
the employees began putting cash in a paper bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Videotape from a store surveillance camera, released by police, graphically 
captured Iscoe lunging at the robber and trying to knock the gun from his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed, and when he lunged a second time, the suspect fired once into 
Iscoe's left temple. The robber then coolly collected his booty -- $178 in cash 
and Iscoe's wallet -- and left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't help but think he'd be alive today if he didn't try to help," said 
John DePalo, manager of the bagel shop. "He made the ultimate sacrifice to save 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
 The employees were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have long warned citizens about the dangers of trying to stop a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get robbed every day," said Lt. Louis Pagnotta, who is heading the 
investigation. "Ninety-nine percent of them give it (property) over. Here's a 
guy who took it upon himself to try and stop a crime. He tried to do the right 
thing, but it didn't turn out right." 
</P>
<P>
 Iscoe's younger brother also died trying to be a good Samaritan. The off-duty, 
23-year-old correction officer interceded in a street robbery outside a Queens 
movie theater in 1983 and was stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have no choice but to keep going," Vaccarino said of losing two sons so 
violently. She has two other children, Gary, 32, an attorney from West Palm 
Beach, Fla., and Kelly, 24, also of Queens. 
</P>
<P>
 She tells a story that epitomizes Glenn: He was driving a young woman in his 
cab to meet her boyfriend at a street corner. Instead of dropping her off in 
the dark of night, he waited with her. When the boyfriend failed to show up and 
the girl had nowhere to go, Iscoe brought her to his mother's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Vaccarino chided the young woman for coming home with a 
stranger, saying, "He could have beaten you up or brought you someplace bad." 
But the girl told her: " 'I could tell from his face and the look in his eyes 
that he was a wonderful person . . . and I knew everything was going to be OK.' 
"

ABORIGINE JUSTICE IS HAILED AS TRIBAL ELDERS ORDER FLOGGINGS, EVEN EXILE; 
AUSTRALIA: JUDGES MAY TAKE EXTENT OF TRADITIONAL PUNISHMENTS INTO ACCOUNT WHEN 
DECIDING WHETHER TO IMPOSE MORE JAIL TIME OR FINES. WHIPPING AND SPEARING IN 
THE THIGH ARE AMONG THE OPTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Flogging, spearing in the thigh and forced exile may seem like barbaric 
punishments, but they work for Australia's aborigines and even have the 
blessing of white judges. 
</P>
<P>
 White authorities frustrated by rising crime are allowing aboriginal leaders 
to administer their own justice, sometimes without trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, tribal elders in a small town near Darwin in the Northern 
Territory decided car theft had gone far enough. They persuaded police to turn 
over six aborigines, ages 15 to 25, for a dose of traditional justice. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, on Main Street, the elders flogged the young men with rubber 
hoses. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the young fellows couldn't walk for three days," said Kevin Kitchener, 
a lawyer, who reported the incident but would not name the town. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one car has been stolen in the town since, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know that if they get into trouble again, the same thing will happen, 
but with women wielding the rubber hoses, which will give them an even greater 
sense of shame," said Kitchener, who works for the North Australian Aboriginal 
Legal Aid Service. "Maybe we should go back to the old traditional ways. They 
seem to work." 
</P>
<P>
 The beatings occurred shortly before the flogging May 5 in Singapore of 
American teen-ager Michael Fay, who was convicted of vandalism. The Fay case 
provoked protests from abroad and pleas for clemency by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 No trial was involved in the decision by the aboriginal elders, and the 
flogging incident in the northern Australian town got little attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Mick Dodson, the government's commissioner of social justice for aborigines, 
believes traditional punishments are a strong deterrent and questions whether 
they are any harsher than modern ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have people confined to solitary confinement, white and black," he 
said "You could argue that that's cruel and unusual. What's the difference 
between spearing and hanging or electrocution? What makes one cruel and the 
other not? 
</P>
<P>
 "Locking people up doesn't work; it just hones their criminal skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Australia's legal system formally recognizes traditional methods of justice. 
Judges may take traditional punishments into account when deciding whether to 
order jail time or fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Northern Territory say floggings and spearings are seldom 
reported, but are more common than many outsiders think. 
</P>
<P>
 David Moore, deputy police commissioner of the Northern Territory, said he 
knows of several flogging cases. Frustration with the regular system has led to 
a resurgence of traditional justice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have encouraged nonviolent forms of traditional justice, such as 
forcing offenders to do community service, with some success, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another nonviolent alternative is exile -- up to 10 years in a distant city 
for a killing. Connections with family and tribe are so strong that this is 
considered a severe punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Barry Lehmann of the Kalgoorlie police in Western Australia said spearing 
is common practice in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who killed his brother and was convicted of manslaughter "had been 
speared a number of times in the thighs," he said. "I asked him, 'Is that the 
end of the matter?' And he said, 'No. I get speared again when I get out of 
jail.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him when this stops," Lehmann said, "and he said, 'When my father 
says to stop it.' His father is an elder, and they make the decision." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, an aborigine was convicted of manslaughter in the Northern Territory 
for inadvertently killing a man when administering the spearing punishment. 
Judge James Muirhead let him go free, noting that he had been obligated to 
administer the punishment and the killing was accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. P. T. Burke, who served in the outback with the Royal Flying Doctors 
service in the late 1980s, estimates that one in 20 spearings will cause fatal 
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Chief Justice Brian Martin of the Northern Territory Supreme Court 
ruled that a man convicted of manslaughter could be speared in the thigh by 
relatives of the victim, a form of justice called "payback." 
</P>
<P>
 He imposed no other punishment, letting Wilson Jagamara Walker, an aborigine 
from Alice Springs, off with a three-year suspended sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin also took the unprecedented step of ordering police officers to witness 
the spearing so they could verify that the sentence had been carried out. They 
protested on grounds that, if Walker died, they could be charged as accessories 
to a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the Northern Territory police announced that the dead man's family had 
declined to carry out the "payback." Martin has not said whether he will review 
the suspended sentence in light of the family's decision.

AMERICAN EXECUTIVES COME TO GRIPS WITH THE DOWN SIDE OF DOWNSIZING; BUSINESS: 
THE ATTEMPT TO BOOST INCOME AND PRODUCTIVITY BY CUTTING WORKERS MAY HAVE COST 
FIRMS BILLIONS, EXPERTS SAY, AS MORALE WORSENS, LOYALTY VANISHES, AND OVERWORK 
BECOMES THE NORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Millions of employee layoffs have helped corporate America cut expenses. But 
evidence is growing that the strategy known as downsizing produces destructive 
side effects that range from demoralized workers to job burnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, researchers and strategists say the attempt to strengthen profits 
and productivity through cutting layers of workers may actually have cost many 
companies billions of dollars. Nor is it clear that downsizing has made 
businesses as productive as initially hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the downsizing of the last 10 years has been an enormous waste of 
time and energy, and in many cases has been spectacularly unsuccessful," said 
Michael Hammer, a consultant specializing in re-engineering efforts. "I'm 
seeing many companies go that route and then regret it." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there is a powerful argument for cutting unnecessary workers in an 
age when technology can do the work of several people. If American industry is 
to remain competitive on costs, work force cutbacks are still seen as an 
obvious way to achieve the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, a main barometer of corporate performance, investors usually 
act favorably to word of cost-cutting. Stock prices often jump when companies 
terminate workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, charge re-engineering has become a fad, with companies 
embracing the strategy without considering the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer estimates 70% of the corporate cost-cutting he has observed has not 
achieved hoped-for results. And a survey of top executives by the consulting 
firm Arthur D. Little shows about two-thirds are not satisfied. In hindsight, 
many said they should have planned more carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, the study found, was a conflict between the executives' 
objectives, motivations and expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Peter Scott-Morgan, associate director at Little and author of the book 
"The Unwritten Rules of the Game," said that, not surprisingly, chief 
executives have been reluctant to address their failures. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a conspiracy of silence," Scott-Morgan said. "But many feel 
the changes have been too slow or too patchy." 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragedy is that so many people are suffering and the reasons for which 
they have had to suffer are not being achieved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the obvious emotional and financial cost to employees is the 
less-publicized and not insignificant cost to companies themselves. American 
corporations are spending between $7 billion and $10 billion a year on 
re-engineering, Scott-Morgan estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of America's largest companies have been shrinking since the mid-1980s, 
and the economic recovery has not slowed the pace. For example, after 
eliminating about 100,000 jobs since 1984, AT&T is still dropping 1,000 a 
month, spokesman Burke Stinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1983 and 1993, Fortune 500 companies eliminated 4.7 million people 
from their payrolls, or one-quarter of their work force, said David Birch, 
president of Cognetics, a Cambridge, Mass., business research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a study for the Census Bureau's Center for Economic Study questions 
whether job cuts and improved productivity -- a key rationale for many 
restructurings -- necessarily go hand-in-hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways, the message is that we need to be careful when we look at 
trends in the economy and then apply them to all industries," said University 
of Maryland economics professor John Haltiwanger, one of the study's authors. 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis of productivity at 140,000 factories during the 1980s found that 
while 55% of gains came where the work force fell, the other 45% came at plants 
with growing employment. 
</P>
<P>
 David Noer, author of "Healing the Wounds: Overcoming the Trauma of Layoffs 
and Revitalizing Downsized Operations," said the anger and fear among employees 
who survive layoffs limit their risk-taking -- and hurt productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, Hammer and other strategists say, is that in their quest 
for efficiency, many companies have ignored the human side of the drama, that 
restructuring efforts are changing how employees view their work lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, loyalty was a given: If you worked hard, you attained. An employee 
gave the company loyalty and received a steady job, service pins and a secure 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new reality is that people come to the office understanding . . . that to 
rely on the paternalism of the company is a mistake," Stinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although companies have found loyalty is hard to engender amid massive 
layoffs, they also are beginning to recognize that without significant 
commitment from workers, the changes won't be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cost reduction by itself is not a winning strategy," said Don Sacco, head of 
human resources at Nynex Corp. "We have to grow and we can't grow without our 
employees on board. They implement our strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 At Nynex, more than 20,000 jobs have been eliminated since 1988. Another 
15,000 will be lost over the next few years. Just a few years ago, Nynex was 
considered a safe place to work, a guarantee of lifetime employment, Sacco 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies realize now they have not spent enough time preparing workers 
for restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is important to people doesn't change just because executives try to ram 
(restructuring) down their throats," Scott-Morgan said. "The resistance gets 
pushed undercover, where it turns to sabotage and treachery." 
</P>
<P>
 Citibank went through radical cost-cutting beginning in 1991 to guarantee its 
survival. Now it's in the midst of a more comprehensive effort to realign 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like other companies, we had problems at implementation in the earlier phase 
of re-engineering efforts," said Susan Evans, head of business evaluation at 
Citibank. "We would jump into designing a new process without spending enough 
time assessing the full problem. People didn't always understand the changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, the bank spends more time training employees and evaluating 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives also have not considered how restructuring affects the workload of 
remaining employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "All many companies are doing is eliminating people, throwing them over the 
side of the boat, and they aren't eliminating work," Hammer said. "Companies 
then have to work the remaining people harder and they become stressed and 
unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
 You get the benefit of having people off the payroll but not much else, said 
David A. Hofrichter, managing director with The Hay Group, management 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, executives often haven't considered the conflicting messages between 
the existing corporate culture and the new vision adopted under a 
restructuring. Many restructurings, for example, emphasize teamwork, but the 
company's rewards -- more interesting projects, compensation, respect -- often 
require an employee to stand out as an individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies, Noer said, also need to let employees grieve. "They are like 
survivors of other forms of human trauma," he said. "The issue has been 
seriously overlooked."

AIDS PATIENTS VULNERABLE TO WATER BACTERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The source of one of the most common infections in people with advanced AIDS 
may be tap water, a Dartmouth College researcher says. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40% of AIDS patients develop a serious infection called mycobacterium 
avium complex, or MAC, according to Dr. C. Fordham von Reyn, associate 
professor of medicine and director of the infectious disease section at 
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.The infection causes severe illness and 
weight loss, shortening the lives of AIDS patients by about seven months, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Von Reyn and other researchers found that some institutional water systems, 
including the hospitals in which infected patients were treated, contained the 
same bacterial strains as AIDS patients in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Using data from 36 AIDS patients living in New Hampshire and Boston, 
researchers were able to isolate the source using a DNA fingerprinting 
technique called pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The technique was adapted 
for use on MAC by Dr. Robert Arbeit of Boston University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers took water samples from each person's home and from hospitals 
where patients were treated, and tested the samples to determine the source of 
the bacterium. Results of the study pointed to hot water systems in the 
hospitals as the common denominator among 14% of the AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The means of transmission is unknown, but researchers believe that 
hospitalized AIDS patients could have come into contact with the waterborne 
bacterium through exposure to hot shower water, through the use of 
bronchoscopes (devices used to view airways and lungs) that may have been 
rinsed in warm water, or by drinking tap water.

FBI TESTING NAPOLEON'S HAIR FOR POISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A forelock snipped by a maid from Napoleon Bonaparte's head hours after his 
death is at the center of a debate over whether the former French conqueror was 
murdered, and if so, by whom. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hairs from the locket, to go on sale in Chicago next month, are being 
studied for signs of poison by the FBI laboratory in Washington. The lab is 
also trying to determine the DNA makeup in the follicles, said Robert Bresson, 
a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The results will be among evidence presented at a meeting of the Napoleonic 
Society of America in September, said group member Bob Snibbe. 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon's official cause of death in 1821 was originally listed by English 
doctors as stomach cancer. But people who attended the former emperor on the 
remote island of St. Helena, in the south Atlantic Ocean, where he was exiled 
after losing the battle of Waterloo, have come under suspicion over the years, 
Snibbe said. 
</P>
<P>
 French royalist Count de Montholon is among the possible culprits and, Snibbe 
said, had several possible motives. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1982 book, "The Murder of Napoleon," charged that Napoleon was poisoned, a 
result based on hair tests at the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Laboratory in 
England. The lab found abnormally high traces of arsenic. 
</P>
<P>
 Snibbe said French scholars found the book's allegations absurd. It postulated 
that French royalists, afraid that Napoleon's possible return would strip them 
of their power and wealth, had Count Montholon poison him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the author of a soon-to-be-published book on the question, Rene Maury, 
argues that Montholon's motives were personal: Napoleon had cuckolded him, and 
the count was impatient to obtain a promised inheritance of 2 million francs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maury will join the debate at the meeting, Snibbe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Snibbe said the 1,800-member group is considering whether to ask 
that the body of Napoleon's nephew, Achille Murat, be exhumed from his grave in 
Tallahassee, Fla., where he fled after his Italian father was beheaded and his 
body tossed in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 Achille's body would be exhumed to determine its genetic makeup and try to 
match it to that of the locket. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI's Bresson said the agency partly agreed to test the hair because 
scientists are not sure if DNA can be recovered from hair "that had been 
sitting around for 200 years." 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly Frenchman, Jean Fichou of Rennes, brought the locket to the FBI in 
Washington, Bresson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The locket, along with other Napoleonic items, will be on sale in Chicago 
during the society's meeting.

R / X FOR DEPRESSION AS CLOSE AS DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION PAD; MEDICINE: 
PHYSICIANS SAY THE NEW DRUGS ENABLE THEM TO TREAT THE MENTAL PROBLEM, OFTEN 
WITHOUT SENDING THE PATIENT TO A COUNSELOR. BUT THERAPISTS WARN AGAINST RELYING 
ON PILLS AS THE MAIN REMEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The closest thing to a couch in Dr. Mike Doyle's barn-red clinic is his padded 
waiting room bench. There's no psychiatric text in sight, just the usual 
doctor's gear: examining table, stethoscope, scale. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many patients who are "down in the dumps" -- the 62-year-old healer's 
term for depression -- this is their first and last stop for relief. 
</P>
<P>
 They turn to Dr. Doyle and his handy prescription pad. This family doctor is 
not reluctant to prescribe easy-to-take antidepressants like Paxil, Zoloft and, 
the pioneer, Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
 No fuss, no therapy -- just pills. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors like Doyle say the new drugs enable them to treat depression -- the 
most common mental illness -- many times without sending the patient for extra 
counseling or psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is becoming the norm for family physicians to make the decision, 'Do you 
need intensive therapy? Or therapy that can be given by the family physician: 
encouragement and support?' " said Dr. William H. Coleman, president of the 
American Academy of Family Physicians, who practices in largely rural 
Scottsboro, Ala., where therapists are thin on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when a patient's chronic despair has no apparent reason, Coleman 
sees no need for therapy that examines the past. "I don't see this backtracking 
through all that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Could this trend augur a dusty end for the therapist's couch? A detour from 
the talking cure, that arduous, expensive and time-consuming journey toward 
self-understanding and change? Mental health in a bottle? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an American solution," Ellen McGrath, a psychologist in Laguna Beach, 
said of doctors who dispense mind medicines and give therapy a back seat. "It's 
temporary. A quick fix." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that it helps and it works better, but it's only part of 
the solution," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While many therapists welcome the doctors' increased interest in recognizing 
and alleviating depression, they warn against relying on pills as the main 
remedy. While that may be the right treatment sometimes, ideally, they say, the 
depressed patients should be evaluated to find out if they need talk plus 
medication, or no pills at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Depression often recurs. Taking an antidepressant for four to six months or 
more, they say, will not deal with underlying problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very glad that primary care physicians are interested and are looking 
to identify signs and symptoms of depression and mood disorders," said Vivian 
Jackson, who handles clinical social work issues at the National Assn. of 
Social Workers. "That is a plus." 
</P>
<P>
 But, said Jackson, mood disorders are a mix of biological, psychological and 
social factors. Doctors should think of referring afflicted patients to a 
psychotherapist as readily as they will consult a specialist for surgery, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family doctors and internists interviewed around the country said they do keep 
therapy in mind when treating patients. But they're also mindful of the need to 
keep costs down, and of many patients' aversion to the label "mental illness" 
implicit in sending them to psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, many times the improvement they see in patients on the new 
antidepressants seems to make counseling unnecessary, if not irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you tell them, 'You're depressed,' they'll tell you, 'But I'm not crazy,' 
" said Dr. Marjorie Bowman, who practices in Winston-Salem, N.C., and chairs 
the department of family and community medicine in Wake Forest's medical 
school. "There is just a major stigma to labeling somebody depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 The stigma is felt not only by the patient, she said. "It can have major 
problems with insurance, so there has been a fair amount of reluctance on the 
part of physicians to put down depression on their billing form." 
</P>
<P>
 How much Bowman prods a depressed patient to seek therapy varies. If the 
patient's family has a history of depression, she won't push as hard as she 
does someone struggling, say, with a child-custody fight or big-time work 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get them feeling better . . . that's what it's about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors in general practice have always been on the depression front lines. 
Generally, it's the family doctor or internist or gynecologist who first 
encounters the patient who comes with physical complaints that the astute 
physician recognizes as signs of depression. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the not-distant past, a doctor may have overlooked or even shied away 
from a diagnosis of depression. That would leave the patient to struggle along 
on their own, maybe find their way to a psychiatrist, or sink until they wound 
up hospitalized in a psychiatric ward or, in extreme cases, committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Antidepressant medicines have dramatically changed this, as has increased 
understanding of depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Like knowledge of the brain's exquisite machinery, drugs to treat mental 
illness are relatively recent in medicine, dating back only to the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Prozac's debut six years ago, the favored drugs for treating depression 
were known as tricyclics, which go by brand names such as Elavil, Sinequan, 
Tofranil. They work fine, except that some patients find their side effects 
unbearable: dry mouth, dry skin, blurred vision, constipation, weight gain, 
dizziness, a drugged feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Depressed patients don't need to be masochists too; people won't take a drug 
that makes them feel worse. The tricyclics also need close monitoring and 
sometimes day-by-day adjustment. Overdoses can kill. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of Prozac in 1988, and drugs like it that followed, mark a 
fine-tuning of these mind medicines. Known as SSRIs, for selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors, they don't need such close attention. 
</P>
<P>
 They too may produce side effects, but milder ones. The chief complaints -- 
typically disappearing after the first weeks -- are nausea, jitters, insomnia, 
sexual difficulties -- though any long-term effects are unknown. And it's 
virtually impossible to take a fatal overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, patients take their medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of these drugs' popularity is clear in figures compiled by IMS 
America, a market-research firm. Taking a kind of Nielsen rating for drugs, the 
company regularly surveys doctors on what they're prescribing. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrists issued 1.9 million prescriptions for SSRIs in 1989 and 5.6 
million last year. According to IMS, prescriptions for SSRIs written by 
internists, family practitioners, general practitioners and osteopaths nearly 
kept pace, multiplying from 2 million in 1989 to 5 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, except for psychiatrists, doctors lost enthusiasm for tricyclics, 
writing 4.5 million prescriptions in 1989, down to 3.4 million in 1993. 
Psychiatrists stuck with the tricyclics, writing 4.2 million prescriptions in 
1989 and 4.7 million five years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Doyle is one of those doctors who have embraced SSRIs. "Mainly because 
people take them and they work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A jowly man with a deep crease of concern in his brow, hair in silvery waves, 
and sympathetic gray-blue eyes, Doyle doesn't go in for Freudian jargon. 
</P>
<P>
 The patient who comes to see Doyle with depression usually doesn't know that's 
what really ails them. They say they've got a bad stomach, or a backache or a 
weariness no sleep can quench. With gentle, practiced prying, Doyle extracts 
more information. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did you have for lunch?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel like eating," they'll reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there lead in your pencil?" he asks husbands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you still having the same fun in the bedroom?" he asks wives. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon they're confiding, say, that they join social clubs and then they don't 
show up. And, frankly, some days they can't get out of bed and go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 After eliminating any physical cause, Doyle will say something like: "Look, 
you're down in the dumps. Some people call it depression. But let's just call 
it 'down in the dumps.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then he'll prescribe an antidepressant, expecting to put them on it for at 
least two to four months. 
</P>
<P>
 With only 10 to 15 minutes to spare each patient, Doyle doesn't provide 
psychotherapy. Should the patient wish to talk about problems, maybe a 
childhood trauma, or a work or marriage crisis, he'll suggest they consult 
their priest (or minister or rabbi). Only if the antidepressant doesn't lift 
them after a few months will Doyle prod them to seek psychiatric help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mental illness still carries a stigma," Doyle said. "I don't care what status 
of society you're in. Seeing a psychiatrist implies that there's something 
wrong with them . . . that can't be fixed. The mind is a funny thing. Many 
people don't understand, including many doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the future of psychotherapy? Yes . . . and no. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the new mind medicines and the new skills of the family doctor pressed 
to keep costs down, the treatment of depression may be entering a new era. But 
some say family doctors will have to be better prepared for the challenge, and 
will never replace trained mental health professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the future, I think we will be more aggressive about training primary care 
doctors in recognizing anxiety depression," said Dr. Robert Nesse, vice 
chairman of the Department of Family Medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor's office will be the place of diagnosis and, for a group of 
patients, the place of treatment. But I strongly feel the role of the 
psychiatrist and psychologist will still be there."

'T' OF BLT FAME BRINGS HOME BACON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT GREENE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Late summer, and a person's fancy turns to tomatoes, the fresh, home-grown, 
farm stand kind. And that's good news for hog farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 No, tomatoes still grow on vines, not in a pen. But a national desire to bury 
those tomatoes in a sandwich with bacon, lettuce and mayonnaise moves lots of 
pork this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a multibillion-dollar market rides piggy back -- or rather piggy 
belly -- on the seasonal gap between hog slaughter and the demand for bacon in 
late summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the reason that a storage market exists in pork bellies," said Chuck 
Levitt, senior meat analyst for Alaron Trading Corp., a Chicago-based futures 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The market in frozen pork bellies helps determine what farmers get for hogs, 
and what shoppers pay for bacon, which is pork bellies that have been cured, 
smoked, sliced, and cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, it's hard to tell where prices are heading on either end. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers are producing hogs in record numbers, adding tons of pork to the 
mountain of beef and chicken already out there. 
</P>
<P>
 And consumers are indulging themselves at fast food outlets with bacon-laden 
chicken sandwiches and cheeseburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra push from BLT season might help the year be even less lean in more 
ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 Information Resources Inc., a Chicago-based marketing research and software 
firm, says shoppers buy $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion worth of bacon each year. 
</P>
<P>
 For Oscar Mayer Food Corp., the largest-selling brand, sales typically rise 
20% in August and September, said company spokeswoman Jean Cowden. 
</P>
<P>
 Supermarkets sold an average of $24 million worth of bacon a week in the five 
weeks ended last Sept. 11, the highest-volume period of the year, said Nielsen 
North America research of Northbrook, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer sales spurt typically mean that bacon slicers, as the processors 
are known, start pulling frozen bellies out of warehouses because there aren't 
enough fresh ones. With so much pork around, however, the frozen ones aren't 
moving as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bacon producers would rather have fresh bellies. The frozen ones pick up 
freezer burn, they shrink, and they need to be thawed. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, frozen belly prices have tumbled. They peaked in February at 
about 59 cents a pound, but dipped below 30 cents in July, for a two-year low. 
It's unclear where they are currently headed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bacon was at $2 a pound in July, according to Labor Department surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 For $2 a pound, shoppers get a heavy dose of salt and fat, a smidge of 
protein, and no fiber, vitamins or minerals to speak of. 
</P>
<P>
 But no food label can quantify the feeling when you bite into three layers of 
crispness for a soft, creamy tomato inside, the salve of mayonnaise on a palate 
zinged by the caustic saltiness of the bacon and the cool, mild acid of the 
tomato.

HERE'S WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE ABOUT HEALTH BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "What's So Terrible About Employers Helping With Health Care?" (Aug. 7), 
Robert Eisner makes broad statements about small business to support his 
conclusion that health care insurance should be financed by employers. His 
cursory treatment of difficult financial and business issues is disturbing. 
Readers impressed with his credentials as an economist might believe his 
conclusions reflect established principles of economics or business rather than 
optimistic ideas contrary to business experience. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he implies that since businesses have managed to survive the burdens of 
Social Security and unemployment insurance, they should be able to survive one 
more burden of health care. That is like saying that since the camel carried a 
few extra pounds last week, the camel should be able to handle yet a few more 
pounds this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many government burdens -- including Social Security contributions, 
workers' compensation premiums and unemployment compensation -- are significant 
burdens to business and substantial disincentives to employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, there is no way to calculate or demonstrate the level of 
employment this country could be enjoying if those and the many other burdens 
to employment were removed or reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, he expresses doubts that the imposition of the costs of health insurance 
on businesses would raise labor costs "at all." He believes workers would take 
jobs with lower wages to obtain health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 His conclusion would be less disturbing if he completed his hypothesis by 
discussing how the particular workers he has in mind will match up with the 
particular employment opportunities available, and by discussing the effect on 
the economy of forcing workers to take lower wages in order to cover mandated 
levels and types of health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he takes a handy "this is how the economy works" approach, stating that 
even if labor costs were raised, it wouldn't be a problem because all 
competitors would face the same increases. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes a static and local view of business and competition. In fact, 
business and competition are global and dynamic, and increases in payroll costs 
can affect a huge range of compensation, competition, automation and investment 
issues. The effect of government-imposed burdens on business cannot be easily 
identified, let alone dismissed as insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest failure of his optimistic article may be the lack of discussion 
of the impact on new businesses, which, in particular, do not fit his cartoon 
image of competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical new small business hiring its first employees is most concerned 
with total cost and administrative burdens. While competitors' labor costs may 
be relevant competitive information, the key issue is whether the new business 
can bear the imposed burdens and still survive to become a stable competitor in 
the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists and legislators can take comfort in warm and fuzzy economic 
theories, projections of costs, assumptions about competition and hypotheses of 
how well things are going to work "in the private sector" with the latest 
government program. Business owners know that they have to produce cold, hard 
goods and services, and cover payroll, to survive in an unpredictable, 
ever-changing real world. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 After reading (Robert) Eisner's column, I have a better understanding of why 
our politicians can feel good about writing laws that cripple business and 
destroy jobs. Our intellectuals have given the politicians false ideas that 
ease the lawmakers' consciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Private insurance companies are heavily regulated by the government. Excessive 
insurance paperwork and bureaucracy are a result of nonessential requirements 
demanded by myriad federal, state and local agencies and are not a natural 
state of affairs, as implied by Mr. Eisner. Government programs traditionally 
have become bogged down in paralyzing bureaucracy. I am not aware of any 
government program that is efficient in comparison to private industry. How 
would a single-payer health care system escape what every other government-run 
program has fallen victim to? 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Social Security and unemployment insurance are 
government-mandated programs in no way makes them efficient or morally 
justifies their existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asking" employers to "contribute" to a health plan, as Mr. Eisner suggests, 
really means forcing employers and employees to do what the government says is 
best for them. Participation by force is a common feature of both the 
single-payer plan and the universal plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern health care started out in reasonable shape. Then the government 
discerned a few minor problems. After a small fix here and another there, and 
more fixes to fix the fixes, the whole system went out of control until we 
found ourselves in this so-called health care crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the first step to solving this crisis is to identify the underlying 
factors that have caused the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * We have a highly regulated medical insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health insurance benefits are not taxed as normal income, which somehow has 
created the illusion that employees are entitled to health care as a benevolent 
gift from their employers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Current laws allow doctors to be sued for frivolous reasons, so doctors and 
hospitals are forced to perform needless procedures in an attempt to avoid 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medicare and the government's other mandated health care programs have 
inadvertently punished private patients and their insurers in the form of 
higher medical costs for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution to our national health care crisis could be to attack these 
underlying factors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deregulate the insurance and medical industries, perhaps over the next 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Begin to tax paid health insurance premiums as normal income. 
</P>
<P>
 * Change the laws that currently allow doctors and hospitals to be sued for 
doing their jobs properly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gradually phase out all government health-related programs, departments and 
agencies. Then reduce taxes accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 In brief, eliminate the government as our super-parents.

U.S. NEEDS A FRESH ECONOMIC POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Good Jobs News Put Wall Street in Gloomy Mood" said the headline on Aug. 6. 
Why the investors' gloom? They know that the Federal Reserve uses such 
indicators to increase interest rates to put dampers on the economy.With a 
current 6% unemployment record, doesn't that sound a bit Draconian? 
</P>
<P>
 It is reminiscent of the time-honored medical practice of bloodletting to 
relieve patients of "bad humors" believed to cause illness -- a practice long 
since discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 Are we tolerating an outmoded practice of economic management? Should we even 
try simplistic interest rate juggling to fine-tune our economy now struggling 
with a very complex global situation? 
</P>
<P>
 A highly placed monetary authority doesn't agree. Edward M. Bernstein, one of 
America's true currency experts and a veteran of the 1944 conference at Bretton 
Woods, N.H., that set up the post-World War II international monetary system, 
says that rising interest rates hurt the U.S. economy and could be disastrous. 
His words echo often among currency and economic authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) complained recently that such practices place 
the "narrow interests" of the bond market ahead of the standard of living of 
American workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades of unfavorable foreign trade balances, nagging unemployment and rising 
prices suggest we need another high-level Bretton Woods approach to the new 
problems of our post-Cold War period. 
</P>
<P>
 Isolationism is gone. World trade treaties are becoming profitable while 
putting more of our people back to work. Can't we do better than manipulate 
interest rates at workers' expense?

ROBIN ABCARIAN: GOT THE URGE TO CHEAT? DON'T WORRY, IT'S ONLY NATURAL

<P>
 We were a couple of married ladies, passing the time with idle conversation 
about old boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever thought lustfully about other men?" I asked my friend. "I mean, 
have you ever thought about having sex with other guys?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh sure," she said. "Who hasn't?" 
</P>
<P>
 "But would you ever do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, of course not," she said. "I love my husband." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," I said, "me too, but that doesn't mean you don't get the urge." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's true," she replied. "I think most people would love to have sex with 
someone besides their spouse. As long as there were no repercussions." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, yes, repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Those little details: devastation, disease and divorce. Ah, well. We agreed 
that repercussionless extramarital sex was a universal fantasy -- for both 
sexes -- then segued into our next favorite topic: what our husbands had done 
lately to make us want to rip out their nose hairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But afterward I found myself brooding: Could that really be true? How can we 
be programmed for infidelity when society places such a premium on monogamy? 
Are our "urges" rooted in biology and therefore impossible to ignore? 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, when I saw the cover of Time -- with a golden wedding band snapped 
in half and the provocative headline, "Infidelity: It may be in our genes" -- I 
remembered our chat. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out that with her own simple logic, my friend had demonstrated an 
unschooled appreciation for the burgeoning field of evolutionary psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The article in Time is a much-condensed version of a book called "The Moral 
Animal: Evolutionary Psychology and Everyday Life" by New Republic Senior 
Editor Robert Wright. It is one of a number of recent books that attempt to 
view human reproductive behavior through the lens of evolution, to explain our 
messed up sex lives in the context of Darwinian survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright pulls together research that ranges over the bumpy terrain of love, 
looking for biological cues to our behavior, attempting to answer timeless 
questions such as why wealthy men take trophy wives, why most societies 
throughout history have been polygamous and why we cheat. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to all these questions, evolution-wise, is propagation of the 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is that human beings are designed to fall in love," Wright 
says. "The bad news is they aren't designed to stay there. According to 
evolutionary biology, it is 'natural' for both men and women . . . to commit 
adultery or to sour on a mate, to suddenly find a spouse unattractive, 
irritating, wholly unreasonable. . . . It is similarly natural to find some 
attractive colleague superior on all counts to the sorry wreck of a spouse 
you're saddled with." 
</P>
<P>
 (Act on your impulses, though, and that attractive colleague could one day be 
that sorry wreck of a spouse.) 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom -- as it's often expressed on talk shows and in magazines 
-- holds that men are programmed to stray while women are programmed to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, Wright says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are not by nature paragons of fidelity," he says. "Wanderlust is an 
innate part of their nature, ready to surface under propitious circumstances." 
But, he adds, "If you think women are bad, you should see men." 
</P>
<P>
 (On behalf of my gender, I thank him for that.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So why are we inclined to stray? 
</P>
<P>
 Evolutionarily speaking, women's innate wanderlust is geared toward confusing 
the paternity of a child -- on the theory that a man who thinks he may be the 
father will be disposed to offer care and protection. The more men who think 
they could be the father, the more protectors a child will have. 
</P>
<P>
 Men want to jump into bed with everything that moves for an entirely different 
reason: The more sex they have with young, healthy females, the more likely 
they are to produce healthy offspring, thus ensuring the bloodline. (Added 
evolutionary bonus: each time a male impregnates a female, she is less likely 
to pass on the genes of another male.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now. The next time you see a luscious prospect and reach instinctively to 
remove your wedding band, remember: You are normal and you do not have to act 
on your lust. 
</P>
<P>
 Your positive sexual response to another person does not mean you married the 
wrong guy or gal, Wright says. 
</P>
<P>
 It simply means you are human. 
</P>
<P>
 And so -- don't forget -- is the person you married.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; COMING HOME; DON'T LET THAT BABY FACE FOOL YOU -- MAYOR 
FIDEL VARGAS, 26, HAS A GRAND VISION FOR BALDWIN PARK. BUT SOME WORRY THAT HE 
IS CHANGING THE CITY FOR THE WORSE. 
</P>

<P>
 The kid knows how to pack a room. 
</P>
<P>
 For two hours now, one of the youngest mayors in the country has been hearing 
from his constituents, many of them old enough to be his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 First up is Teresa Filner, mother of two boys. Her hair is pulled under her 
uniform cap, her right hand raised to take an oath, as she stands in front of 
26-year-old Fidel A. Vargas. The mayor, in corporate wear and refreshed from a 
workout in the police gym, leans his boyish face into a microphone to welcome 
Baldwin Park's newest cop. 
</P>
<P>
 Next is Kenneth Moore. Nervously, he admits that this is his first time to 
address His Honor. Then he unabashedly lays into the city council, griping 
about the deafening music blared weekend after weekend by the kids on his 
block. The police, he says, have done nothing. Vargas glances toward Police 
Chief Carmine Lanza, sitting three down on the tiered dais. Later, the chief is 
at Moore's side, on bended knee, jotting down details. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivian Ross takes her turn. Softly, respectfully, she tells the mayor of being 
caught in a nightmare as one of the trailer park residents who must buy a new 
mobile home and move because the Vargas Administration is apparently the first 
to enforce a 15-year-old zoning ordinance. The law is the law, Vargas says. And 
then, with reciprocated respect, he tells her not to worry, that the city will 
help her. "We should work with the folks down there," he instructs his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, others approach the lectern. 
</P>
<P>
 A 33-cent-per-month sanitation rate increase is debated. Brighter lights along 
Ramona Boulevard are suggested. A town hall meeting to discuss street repairs 
is scheduled. And Bette Lowes, defeated in her 1992 mayoral reelection bid by 
Vargas, suggests to her successor that something ought to be done about the 
beer guzzlers who gather after work at an entrance to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor orders it stopped. The police chief makes a note of it. 
</P>
<P>
 That persistent monster Vargas calls "perception" is again challenging the 
"reality" of Baldwin Park, a city of 72,000 in the center of the San Gabriel 
Valley. Truth be told, it is not a town full of drunks, or a place on the down 
and out, or one without vision, he says. But many outsiders see it that way, 
which is why Vargas brought his Harvard social studies degree and youthful 
vigor to City Hall three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He was drawn to the mayor's race while driving to work in the fall of '91. A 
graffiti-covered wall stopped him cold that day -- and later fired his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had seen that wall before," he says, "but for some reason the graffiti 
really aggravated me. I said, 'Why aren't we doing something about this? Why 
are we accepting this?' " The vandalism, he says, sent a dangerous message, not 
only to kids but also to the community, "that we don't really care enough" to 
give people a decent and dignified environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking office -- a part-time job that pays $3,000 annually -- Vargas has 
fulfilled his promise of a strong anti-gang stance, a graffiti-removal program 
and hot line, and a Morgan Park Community Center expansion. Presidential 
candidate Bill Clinton, who would later tap Vargas for his Social Security 
advisory council, made a campaign stop there on Mexican Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti is indeed scarce now, and the crime rate has steadily dropped with 
the introduction of police bike patrols. Weekend helicopter flybys have been 
started to further curb gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fidel has raised the city's self-esteem," says Robert Ochoa-Schutz, a city 
planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor is also credited with maintaining a balanced budget, pushing for a 
city-assisted first-time home buyer program and for looking ahead with Baldwin 
Park 2000, a long-range plan being developed by business and community leaders 
and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But his earliest and perhaps most noteworthy changes involved replacing 
several commissioners, committee and board members to create a city work force 
that better reflects the local demographics: 70% Latino, 12% Asian American, 
12% Anglo, 5% African American and 1% other. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is thrilled with those changes. Vargas knows that many residents 
are averse to diversity. He has been criticized to his face for paying too much 
attention to all-things Latino. Some longtime residents also accuse him of 
using Baldwin Park as a steppingstone to a higher public office and would be 
happy to see him move on. And Vargas knows that many equate his youthfulness 
with inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mayor, who gets a periodic postcard from a local addressed to "The 
Boy-Mayor of the Wetback Capital of the World," presses on. 
</P>
<P>
 Up by 5 a.m. on weekdays, he reads the newspapers over a bowl of bran flakes 
-- unless he's taking a 7 a.m. meeting over hot cakes at a local cafe or at the 
Pantry in Los Angeles -- then reports to his full-time job. As a senior policy 
analyst for another mayor, Richard Riordan, Vargas monitors public safety 
initiatives such as community-based policing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fidel is one of the most focused, confident young leaders I've ever come 
across, and he's been a great asset to the city," Riordan says. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas is usually home by 7 p.m. and devotes his evenings to his wife and 
kids. They love to swim in the back-yard pool, play baseball and eat out at 
McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular Wednesday, a council-meeting night, Vargas doesn't pack it 
in until 10, after yet another confab with city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the wheel of his red, phone-equipped Saturn, he heads for home, less 
than 10 minutes away. His wife, Melissa, is up. Their two sons -- Max, 4, and 
Julian, 18 months -- are asleep. The dog, a friendly German shepherd mix that 
chewed up Vargas' baseball glove days earlier, is comfortably slumped, like a 
rug hung out to dry, over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas cracks up. "It's good to be home," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Use your brain before you make up your mind.  
</P>
<P>
 Vargas -- this time in sneakers, shorts and a T-shirt designed by his wife for 
a local AIDS benefit -- is standing outside the Baldwin Park Commuter Rail 
Station and plaza that he dedicated in May. It's a Saturday morning and instead 
of taking his usual golf lesson, Vargas is pointing to walls carved with 
unattributed quotes -- part of a public arts project designed by artist and 
community activist Judy Baca. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something I always say," Vargas says about the using-your-noggin 
quote, one of three he contributed. "What I mean by that is, don't just react 
to what you initially hear or what you initially read. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't always take as gospel somebody's argument. I mean, really analyze it 
before making up your mind," he adds, recalling his father's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Melissa Vargas: "Fidel is very focused and analytical. Everything with 
him has a plan and a goal at the end. That's how he's always led his life. He's 
always trying to get me to get more structured, like get a schedule. But we're 
opposites." 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Melissa is extremely private. Fidel is definitely not shy. She 
hates to have her picture taken. He autographs his. She is African American. He 
is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple met at Shout, a Baldwin Park restaurant-nightclub, during Christmas 
break of his senior year at Harvard University. After he graduated, he 
proposed. They trekked across Europe for seven months before marrying in 
Florence, Italy, in 1990, then returned to Southern California to begin a 
family. She is expecting their third child in February, and they hope to have 
three more. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa started a business last year called Cards of Color, featuring 
whimsical hand-painted drawings of children in "shades of black and brown." But 
the greeting cards and classes at Mt. San Antonio College come after "being the 
mom, not the mayor's wife." 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest part about the latter role is "learning to keep my mouth shut and 
not being defensive about some of the things that people say about Fidel when I 
know those things are not true." 
</P>
<P>
 She recalls one encounter in the community center indoor pool when she and son 
Julian met up with a woman -- a Vargas adversary -- who was caring for her 
grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked me if I lived in Baldwin Park and I said, 'My husband is the 
mayor.' She almost drowned. Since that day she has not been the same with me. 
She stayed on the other side of the pool and that's really silly because this 
is a child's swim class that has nothing to do with politics." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of community that people dream of, rich and poor, brown, yellow, red, 
white, all living together.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of place we all dream about living in," Vargas says as he 
waves to a police officer driving by the rail station. "Where you have people 
who are just different -- financially, culturally, ethnically -- all living 
together, striving for the same thing, which is to raise a family, to make a 
better life for themselves and their children. It's the American dream." 
</P>
<P>
 But cultural diversity is not always easily accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still people in this community who resent the fact that (it) has 
changed. There are some people who really do believe diversity doesn't matter. 
They aren't ignorant of it, but they really believe that it doesn't matter. 
I've met people like that here," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime resident Dan Steffane, whom Vargas dismissed as a city planning 
commissioner, believes that Baldwin Park has changed for the worse in the past 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not mad because I got ousted. I'm upset over what is going on in the 
city," he says, referring to such changes as the replacement of the city 
manager with Vargas' E-team, or executive staffers, who run various 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Steffane and his wife "don't feel welcomed in the community anymore," he says. 
They may retire elsewhere because of what he sees as "more attention on 
Hispanics" under Vargas. Others share that impression, he says, "including 
elderly Hispanics who just want to be known as Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor "has separated all of us," he believes, by hiring younger, 
ethnically diverse commissioners and by spotlighting individual cultures -- 
particularly that of Mexico -- with public celebrations of Cinco de Mayo and 
Mexican Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a bigot. I want to be a part of the community. But this is the United 
States of America, and the Hispanics here, if they want to be in Mexico, they 
should be in Mexico," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk like that displeases Vargas. His parents and thousands of other local 
residents are from Mexico. But he understands that "politics and government 
isn't about pleasing everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Doing a guest spot recently on a radio talk show, Vargas gets another dose of 
bad-mouthing from a Baldwin Park resident who identifies himself as Ed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys hype up Fidel," the caller admonishes the two hosts. "The place is a 
dump. Just because he's 26 doesn't mean he's good." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas jumps in, defending his city's reputation and reciting enough positives 
for Ed to start agreeing. Clearly, in Vargas' mind, it is a knockdown for 
perception and a win for reality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If this place was good enough for me to grow up in then, it is good enough for 
my children.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want my kids to dream," says Vargas, strolling along the railroad tracks. 
"I want my kids to know that there isn't anything that they can't accomplish if 
they work hard enough." 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife also want their children to be proud of their dual cultures 
and to give back to their community. 
</P>
<P>
 Max, his mother says, is hometown proud, always policing his neighborhood from 
the front lawn, dog at his side, or picking up litter in the park. Whenever he 
gets the chance, he tells people his dad is the mayor. "He thinks the city 
belongs to us," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband's love for Baldwin Park also "has rubbed off on me, majorly," says 
Melissa, who was born in Los Angeles but moved around a lot as a child. "I 
didn't understand community love, but after we married, I found myself getting 
mad about people saying negative things about the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas says his civic loyalty stems from strong family values that stressed an 
allegiance to community. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents -- Fidel Sr., a carpenter, and Margarita, a homemaker and 
community activist -- lived in South-Central Los Angeles after their eldest 
son's birth, then moved to Tijuana to save money for a house. They later 
settled in Baldwin Park, where seven siblings -- two bilingual teachers, three 
in college and two younger students -- were also raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a kid in Baldwin Park, you shouldn't have to worry about whether 
you can go outside and play. I didn't have that fear growing up. In fact, I 
don't think it's an issue for very many kids," Vargas says. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove his point, he explains that while the city has 20,000 school-age 
youths, police have identified only 150 hard-core gang members and 450 
wanna-bes. He hopes to continue to whittle that number down "by raising the 
expectations of kids" through recreational programs, jobs and a strong message 
that gangbanging is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas' own leadership skills were honed, unknowingly, through osmosis, he 
says. His mother, a grass-roots organizer for more than two decades, would take 
her children to meetings, marches and voter registration rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes, (Fidel) saw me very involved in this community," Margarita Vargas 
says. "When Michael Dukakis was running for President, we registered a lot of 
people to vote and we made sure that a lot of people went to vote. Fidel walked 
the precincts with me." 
</P>
<P>
 A cheerful woman who's always on the go, Margarita remembers Fidel's early 
attempts at leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "He organized a work schedule board for his brothers and sisters on the chores 
they should do around the house. He put the board on the refrigerator door. It 
lasted two days before the other kids tore it down," she says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 First-grade teacher Roberta Serafin saw similar signs of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody took the initiative like Fidel. I could see then he was a leader, 
always organizing the other children. He had charisma." 
</P>
<P>
 He also was an overachiever. When Serafin assigned a few pages of math 
homework, Vargas, who was struggling to learn English, misunderstood and 
completed the entire workbook in one night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next day my teacher was stunned," Vargas says. "But I remember liking the 
challenge. I was so eager to do my best. But I also learned early on to pay 
attention and to listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in high school, he founded the school's Lettermen Club. To join, the 
athletes had to have a C or better average and perform community service. In 
his senior year, classmates voted him "most likely to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Little League team mother Kika Rubalcava says Vargas was the consummate 
competitive athlete. She's glad that the man she still calls "Fidelito" became 
mayor. "We needed a young kid to guide us, to give us fresh ideas," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would agree more than Ochoa-Schutz, Baldwin Park's openly gay "citizen 
of the year" and chairman of its planning commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was approached to be on the planning commission, I said, 'Fidel, you 
need to know that my being gay might be an issue.' He said that wasn't an issue 
with him. He was looking for the best qualified people to serve and he was 
committed to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of any town is the return of its youth," says Ochoa-Schutz, who, 
with his lover, will open a combination bookstore, art gallery and espresso bar 
in Baldwin Park next month. 
</P>
<P>
 But former mayor Lowes, a 41-year resident who now serves as a councilwoman at 
large, says she deserves some of the credit heaped on Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things were in the pipeline or just being completed before Fidel was 
elected," she says, referring to the Metro Rail Station and the Morgan Park 
expansion. "He was there to sign his name or hire the contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says he wants what's best for the community and I believe that's true. But 
sometimes I think he wants to decide what's best. I think he tends to be 
dictatorial. He can be very charming. He's ambitious. He's smart. And I've got 
two more words for him: cunning and arrogant ." 
</P>
<P>
 Aileen Pinheiro, the 72-year-old director of the Baldwin Park Historical 
Society Museum, says she didn't vote for Vargas in 1992 because she believed 
his age meant inexperience. She told him so. Last April, during his reelection 
campaign, she had a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so impressed with him that I actually had tears in my eyes," she says. 
"When Fidel makes a mistake, like he did a few weeks ago, he admits it. And 
believe me, there is not a single one of us who hasn't made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 The "mistake" involved a possible conflict of interest over a chat Vargas had 
with the head of the Los Angeles Animal Regulation Department concerning a 
contract to collect delinquent license fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract, held for eight years by the Mid-San Gabriel Valley Consortium, 
on which Vargas served as a paid director, had not been recommended for 
renewal. One day in the elevator, Vargas says he mentioned to the department 
head that a letter would be forthcoming from the consortium urging refusal of 
the opposing contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't write the letter. I should have recused myself totally," Vargas says 
now. "I had no bad intentions in mentioning (the letter) to him and I wasn't 
trying to influence his decision . . , " he says, adding that he has since 
resigned from the consortium "to avoid any appearance of any future conflict." 
He also belatedly filed a disclosure statement with the city Ethics Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Potential is man's greatest burden.  
</P>
<P>
 Vargas says often he repeats that quote -- one that has yet to find its way 
onto the rail station plaza walls -- to himself as a reminder of what he has 
accomplished in his young life and how much more lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends didn't have the guts to tell me that I was crazy to run for 
mayor," he says. "A lot of people told me after I was elected, 'I didn't think 
you had a chance.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And some people said, 'Oh, yeah, I knew you could do it all along.' And I 
knew they weren't telling me the truth," he says. He remembers having the same 
experience in high school. "For a while I just stopped telling people that I 
wanted to go to Harvard because everybody would look at me like I was crazy, or 
tell me, 'You can't do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But, Vargas says, it's a mistake to underestimate him or to box him in. "I'm 
an original thinker. I believe in myself. You'd be amazed at what wonderful 
things can happen when you believe in yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 He shares that message -- one learned from his parents -- with others, 
especially children. He raises their expectations, asking not if they're going 
to college, but rather which college they will attend.

 Developing leaders for the next century is critical, Vargas says, because he 
won't always be the mayor. He's uncertain about taking on a third term because, 
maybe -- or so rumor has it -- a higher office beckons. 
</P>
<P>
 But "The Kid," as some of the locals call him, is certain of this: "I want to 
be here as long as there's something for me to contribute." Fidel A. Vargas 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: Yes; born in Lynwood, lives in Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Wife Melissa is expecting their third child in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Community organizing and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 On attending Harvard: "I loved the experience so much that I applied to 
Harvard's Business School. I might go back one day. I definitely didn't feel 
isolated being one of about 300 Latinos at Harvard. There were a lot of 
Californians there. And I actually enjoyed the snow." 
</P>
<P>
 On his interracial marriage: "To be honest, I don't even think about it -- me 
being Latino, Melissa being African American. I'm sure some people might be, 
you know, surprised, initially, but it's not an issue with us. We're human 
beings and that's all that matters to me." 
</P>
<P>
 On his recipe for success: "You need to be passionate. You need to be 
enthusiastic about what you're doing and about what you want to achieve. You 
gotta have that fire. And that comes from paying attention to other people who 
are successful. They have self-confidence. They dream. They're not afraid to 
ask questions and knock on someone's door and say, "I've seen you accomplish 
some of the things I want to accomplish. How did you do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 On his lifelong dream: "My ultimate dream is to have my own business and to 
travel the world. . . . I remember when I was a little kid people would ask me, 
'What do you want to be?' and I'd say, 'I want to be a millionaire.' People 
would tease me, some would laugh because in the Latino community it's not a 
good thing to say you want to be wealthy. Where did that come from? Who said 
that being Hispanic meant being poor?"

GALLERY: THROUGH A CHILD'S EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIENNE M. JOHNSON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was like magic. Jim Hubbard gave a group of Native American youths cameras, 
and suddenly everything seemed possible. With the push of a button, they could 
capture the things they found beautiful or funny or truthful.Those simple 
point-and-shoot cameras put a whole world in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographs they took make up "Shooting Back From the Reservation: Another 
Dimension" (New Press). The work is the second collection from Shooting Back, 
an organization Hubbard founded in 1989 that's dedicated to increasing the 
self-esteem of children with limited opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pulitzer-Prize nominee says he's seen even the shyest kids respond to 
photography. "At first they're astonished at what they've done," Hubbard says. 
"Then they realize they have control so they hunt for pictures. And then they 
get ideas, they want to do books of their work. So it's a catalyst for thinking 
of grander things." 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting Back began when Hubbard rounded up volunteers to work with homeless 
kids. That project produced a book, a documentary and national recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, donations have helped set up two educational centers -- in 
Minneapolis and Washington, D.C. Hubbard also helps other groups set up 
programs around the world. And he is preparing for a third project with Hmong 
children in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some of the Native American photographs are being exhibited in 
galleries across the country. And the book awaits a chance to transport readers 
into a world of children's hopeful visions. As R.J., a 10-year-old Hualapai 
says, "When I pick up a camera, it feels like I'm going to a different 
dimension. The future." ADRIENNE M. JOHNSON

SOCIAL CLIMES / THE BUZZ: WHAT TO DO IN A TRICKY SPOT? LAUGH 
</P>

 The City of Hope has opted for comedian Garry Shandling rather than a musical 
performer at its $500-a-head Music and Entertainment Industry Chapter gala 
Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an annual dinner with major record-industry support (it's expected to 
net more than $3 million) that traditionally has a band or singer headlining. 
With all the industry heavies in the crowd, it's perceived as an ideal showcase 
for musical talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason may have to do with the honoree: Ticketmaster CEO Fred 
Rosen and his L.A.-based company were in a widely publicized battle this summer 
with the band Pearl Jam over ticket service fees. There had been speculation 
that getting a band to play would have been a tricky situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce Resnikoff, chapter president, says: "Believe it or not, there are 
plenty of musical acts we could have had." 
</P>
<P>
 A comic was chosen because "this is a crowd that tends to be jaded by music 
acts. I've seen them walk out. It's a lot tougher to walk out on comedian than 
it is to walk out on a band. 
</P>
<P>
 "And another thing," Resnikoff jokes. "If we had Pearl Jam, we were afraid 
they night ask us to reduce the ticket price." 
</P>

 The Prince's Prints: He's not exactly a starving artist, but Prince Charles is 
searching for an L.A. gallery to handle and display his art. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Hunter, the prince's art publisher, is in town looking for the 
appropriate space to display the royal watercolorist's signed lithographs. 
Hunter is searching for a gallery that's "suitable for the Prince's visit . . . 
very smart and quite dedicated to selling prints." 
</P>
<P>
 The lithographs come packed in a navy blue portfolio with the prince's badge 
on the cover. They sell for $4,000 each with the proceeds going to charity. 
"It's a lovely way to make a donation to a charity and get something special in 
return," Hunter says. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the prince will do any painting on his visit to L.A. this fall has not 
been determined.

 Hail to the Chief: Even though an acting career poses no clear and present 
danger to his position as artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum, Gordon 
Davidson was considered for the chief executive role in the current Tom Clancy 
novel adapted for the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he's glad his friend, Donald Moffat, got the part ("He's closer to 
the Reagan type than I am"), Davidson does voice one regret: "I could have been 
the first Jewish President." 
</P>

 No Pit for This Olive: The Olive, that cozy, unmarked Fairfax restaurant so 
dear to denizens of the night, will be closing temporarily in early October. It 
will reopen this spring at "a super double-top-secret location," co-owner Sean 
MacPherson says. 
</P>
<P>
 MacPherson says the Olive's new digs are "surprisingly nearby . . . 
spectacular and beautiful," and "is a place people have seen hundreds of times 
and never realized is a potential restaurant space." 
</P>
<P>
 The new site will be roughly the same size, although it will have a patio and 
a larger kitchen. Both the menu and the staff will stay virtually the same.

SOCIAL CLIMES; THE CIGAR RENAISSANCE: MALES BOND AROUND A NEW FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the narrow aisle of the Century City Tobacco Shoppe they gather in pairs, 
in groups -- men, mostly. 
</P>
<P>
 They gather to talk and smoke, smoke and talk, both the conversation and the 
smoke becoming dense, thickening in midair, then evaporating. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk floats from news to sports to politics to women. 
</P>
<P>
 But what they're smoking is usually the same thing -- cigars. Cigars are big 
here. They are big in size (as in a nice, fat Macanudo) and increasingly big in 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 And as more smokers discover cigars, they're also becoming initiated into the 
rituals that come along with them: the choosing, cutting and lighting; the time 
they demand; the conversations they inspire. 
</P>
<P>
 While some men may be loath to call this a flat-out male-bonding ritual, cigar 
smoking is definitely a catalyst that's bringing men together. Those who don't 
fit into the loincloth-wearing, drum-beating brigades are finding this a 
pleasant alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, as Sigmund Freud said. And sometimes it's 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 As actor Jim Belushi put it: "It's a wonderful ceremony among men. There's a 
formal atmosphere to it, yet it's casual. And we talk about what men talk 
about, which is sex and politics and work." 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence of this cigar renaissance, witness the proliferation of cigar 
dinners at first-class restaurants, as well as "smokers," and the unexpected 
popularity of 2-year-old glossy Cigar Aficionado magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Male bonding and networking is one of the real dynamics in place here," said 
Marvin Shanken, the magazine's publisher and editor. 
</P>
<P>
 "About two years ago I went to a black-tie dinner that Dunhill (a top cigar 
maker) put on. I walked in and I didn't know anybody. And by the time the 
evening was over, I felt like I had 50 new friends. There was such incredible 
energy in the room. We weren't into the social layers of life, just the 
fundamentals of mutual appreciation of an object. 
</P>
<P>
 "A cigar can be enjoyed enormously when you're alone," he added, "but there is 
also the great joy of sharing a great cigar with a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 There's sharing a cigar -- and there's sharing a Cuban cigar, arguably the 
ultimate gift from one tobaccophile to another. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Cubans are illegal in this country, although true cigar lovers 
seem to find a way to bring them in. Even the offering of a Cuban comes with 
its own ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shanken: "There's usually a tale that goes with the gift." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Washington, D.C.-based Cigar Assn. of America, more people 
are smoking cigars. After a decline in sales since the mid-1970s, in 1993 there 
was a 1.2% increase -- modest, to be sure, but a definite ray of hope for the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 And sales of premium cigars, which make up 5% of total cigars sold, increased 
24% from 1989 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 This renewed interest has been bringing more customers into Hugh Getzenberg's 
Century City Tobacco Shoppe, where smokers, some armed with the latest ratings 
from Cigar Aficionado magazine, come looking for specific brands. Individual 
cigars range from about $1 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulars crowd the counter, talking, smoking, laughing. There are lawyers 
escaping from their offices, actors, stockbrokers, producers, art dealers. A 
privileged few hold court in the shop's cramped back room, where cigar after 
cigar crumbles to silvery ashes as such topics as the O.J. Simpson trial are 
discussed, dissected and debated. 
</P>
<P>
 Getzenberg wasn't sure his store would turn into a '90s version of the 
neighborhood barber shop -- but he hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sort of liked the idea when I got the business," he said, "of an 
environment (where people could) talk and relax. . . . I couldn't spend three 
hours in a store, but I'll have two or three guys in here standing and talking 
and smoking a cigar. A work environment is not a friendly place to do this. 
Here you meet somebody and get into a conversation, or I'll introduce people if 
I think they share an interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Cigar smokers are happily lighting up at the same time various campaigns are 
working furiously to make anti-smoking laws more stringent. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigar fanciers argue that their sophisticated smokes can hardly be compared to 
cigarettes, with their paper wrappers and additives, and that cigarette smokers 
are different creatures, the way they nervously inhale. They also realize that 
some people react with horror to the mere sight of a cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 So they have been forced to seek havens in cigar dinners and smokers. The 
dinners started popping up a few years ago at upscale restaurants, which offer 
multi-course gourmet meals, fine wines and, of course, top-notch cigars. 
</P>
<P>
 At Remi restaurant in Santa Monica, members of Les Amis du Cigare meet on a 
regular basis for dinner, wines and smokes. Owner Jivan Tabibian started the 
group a few years ago; it has spawned the George Sand Society, whose membership 
is largely women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jivan and I realized that there were women who would come for the Les Amis 
dinners, and they were so happy to have found a place where it was OK for women 
to smoke cigars," said Julie Ross, the group's founder. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and sometimes a woman will smoke one. "So 
often it's seen as a male thing," Ross added. "And in the beginning, I didn't 
want to intrude on a man's activity. I thought, 'Are they going to resent me 
and think I'm charging into their territory?' But it worked out really, really 
well. It's a great balance having women there." 
</P>
<P>
 Cigar smokers are less formal and involve cigar "tastings" and sometimes 
feature experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Carleton Hacker is in demand as a speaker at private smokers all over 
the country. The Sherman Oaks-based author of "The Ultimate Cigar Book" 
(Autumngold Publishing, 1993) has found an enthusiastic brotherhood of cigar 
lovers who are sponges waiting to soak up information. 
</P>
<P>
 Why this surge in interest now? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a throwback to Victorian times," he said. "In the 1890s, Queen Victoria 
hated tobacco and it was unsocial to smoke in public, so they had private 
smoking clubs. Now, 100 years later, we're doing the same thing. There's a 
feeling of being hemmed in by bureaucracy, government, our own demons in 
getting through this day-to-day world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also have a whole generation of baby boomers who are dealing with 
mortgages, families, even a few gray hairs, and they're looking for an escape. 
For this you're not required to wear special clothes or take a 20-mile journey. 
It's just a means to combat the hectic world we find ourselves in."

 I loved your article on Homer, Alaska ("They Left the Light On," Aug. 7). I 
liked what you did with your time -- just what I would have done -- and I liked 
your character sketches.It reminded me of "Midnight in the Garden of Good and 
Evil," the best-selling, town-describing book about Savannah, Ga.

 As a college student studying geology in 1948, I got a summer job with the 
U.S. Geological Survey evaluating the coal deposits in the Homer area. We 
camped out and mapped the coal beds during the week, but on the weekends we 
caught king salmon, trout and halibut, hiked across glaciers, took pictures of 
hillsides covered with blue lupine and later with red fireweed, picked 
strawberries, dug clams, raced the 30-foot tides in our Jeeps, drank beer in 
the Salty Dawg Saloon and the Yah Sure Club, searched for the first Russian 
settlement built in Alaska at the head of Kachemak Bay and read about Capt. 
James Cook sailing northward through Cook Inlet to his "Anchorage" and 
"Turnagain Arm" as he searched for the Northwest Passage. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a summer I will never forget. Your article motivates me to head north 
again to Homer.

 Your article about Mendocino (Weekend Escape, June 5) was intriguing, so when 
the two-week 1994 Mendocino Music Festival was listed in "California Corner" 
(July 3), we decided to couple exploration with culture. The festival was 
magnificient with varied musical fare, professionally presented and very well 
organized.The area is beautiful and has ample housing to suit all tastes and 
finances, and excellent dining is available at Little River Inn, Albion River 
Inn and in Mendocino.

 John Smith responded to my letter (deploring "kid-hostile" establishments) 
without appearing to have read it (Letters, July 31). But his peevish anti-kid 
comments illustrate the point I made in praising Shawn Hubler's original 
article, which advised families away from B&Bs in Mendocino (where children are 
somewhat less than welcome). More warnings on family-unfriendly destinations 
would assist families in determining which places to avoid and spare Mr. Smith 
the trauma of seeing children at his next B&B.

SUCCESS OF ANTI-CRIME PROGRAMS IS ELUSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David D. Dotson, David D. Dotson is former assistant chief of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How, and to what degree, can crime be prevented, and how may success, or 
failure, be reliably measured? Congressional debate on the crime bill refocused 
attention on these questions, which are as old as police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the legislation's proposed spend ing is directed toward 
restricting criminal opportunity. More police officers, more prisons, longer 
periods of incarceration, broader application of capital punishment -- all are 
believed to be effective deterrents. Logic, too, seems on our side. But 
objective data in support of our belief -- and logic -- is scarce, at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rancor surrounding the crime bill, however, is reserved for "crime 
prevention programs," which aim to diminish crime by changing individual 
attitudes, thus behavior. Drug courts, the Violence Against Women Act, the 
Local Partnership Act, among other provisions in the bill, all promise to do 
this. These proposals have drawn fire, but nowhere near the firestorm of 
ridicule and contempt as have inner-city youth activities. Opponents mouth 
"midnight basketball," "arts and crafts," "self-esteem counseling" and 
"after-school programs" as if they were expletives. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of these programs claim they have evidence to buttress their case. 
Most of it, however, is anecdotal. 
</P>
<P>
 One bright spot in attempts to assess the effectiveness of such purely 
preventive approaches is the Los Angeles Police Department's DARE (Drug Abuse 
Resistance Education) program. Because a substantial commitment of police 
resources is required to teach the DARE curriculum, city and police 
administrators demand an elaborate and aggressive evaluation effort. 
Professionals in the design and administration of scientific surveys were 
retained. That DARE has survived more than a decade of tightening budgets 
speaks not only to its effectiveness, but also to the value of a reliable 
evaluation system. Still, the DARE record yields no clue as to its 
effectiveness as a crime-prevention tool. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that opponents -- or advocates, for that matter -- want to 
know, "How much crime did not occur because of this or that program?" Measuring 
the absence of anything is always risky business. Generally, police compare 
recent statistics on reported crime with prior numbers, then, through 
deduction, judge whether the incidence of crime has increased, decreased or 
remained static. This seems straightforward, no? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, several assumptions are made in such moves from A to B, chief of which 
is that reports of crime consistently relate to the actual incidence of crime. 
That assumption, it turns out, is questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Community surveys conducted in Los Angeles and in other large U.S. cities 
indicate that much crime is never reported to the police. When police are 
notified that a crime has occurred, variations in police documentation policies 
and practices frequently undercut any attempt to draw definitive conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the situation that developed several years ago in the West San 
Fernando Valley. The local police-station commander detected a significant 
increase in burglaries. He also noted that many of these burglaries involved 
garages with open doors. He quietly directed that such incidents -- no 
ostensible breaking and entering -- be reported as thefts rather than 
burglaries. Burglary statistics plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Most variations in reporting are much more subtle. They result from 
fluctuations in workload levels, police response times, citizen confidence in 
their police department and other factors. The presumed effects of any 
anti-crime program, whether it be police suppression or social work, can be 
negated, masked or even enhanced by these reporting factors without any real 
effect on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean we should not engage in any of the programs included in the 
crime bill? Of course not. What it does mean is that regardless of who pays for 
them, all anti-crime programs must have an evaluation component, even though 
that will add to administrative costs. The longevity -- and success -- of the 
DARE program urges us to do no less, even though we may doubt the "objectivity" 
of our crime-measuring methods.

forgiven for thinking -- to paraphrase Shakespeare -- that this is the summer 
of our discontent. The publicly displayed disarray in the NAACP -- the oldest 
and most respected of the nation's civil-rights organizations -- is the latest 
in a steady parade of falls from grace by blacks who had become icons of 
success. Each of these developments receive maximum media exposure, as the 
depictions of our distress become grist for society's diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of personal shortcomings by individual blacks are lumped with 
assaults by whites on voting rights and affirmative-action programs. Both 
become blacks' fault, as well as blacks' loss. At a time when, despite laws 
intended to discourage discrimination, racial bias is on the rise in 
employment, schools, housing and in the criminal-justice system, it would seem 
to make no sense for blacks to worry about whether or not a black actually 
committed the latest high-profile crime, or is rightly accused of serious 
malfeasance in public office. But long experience has taught us that 
allegations of individual impropriety do "harm the race" by giving renewed 
vigor to racial stereotypes that just won't die. 
</P>
<P>
 We will likely never know what happened after Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., a 
civil-rights leader with a long and honorable record, became the executive 
director of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. What we 
do know, though, is that after only 16 months in office, the organization is 
deep in debt, corporate and foundation contributions have been severely cut or 
entirely withdrawn and membership is down. Rather than the many worthwhile 
legal initiatives and social programs carried out by the organization's 
national office and local branches, attention is focused on the unsavory 
aspects of a sexual-harassment claim that Chavis sought to settle with NAACP 
funds and without notice to either its national board or its general counsel. 
It does not look good. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Chavis seeks to prolong a painful episode in NAACP history with a 
court challenge to the fairness of his ouster, I wonder. Suppose Chavis had 
been a model of personal propriety and fiscal responsibility. Suppose, as well, 
that Chavis had moved beyond rhetoric and achieved programs of outreach to 
black gangs and troubled youth, established meaningful coalitions with other 
black groups across the ideological spectrum -- including the Nation of Islam 
-- and mounted a determined search for new directions that more closely connect 
with the contemporary racial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 How would the NAACP board, funding agencies, the general public and the media 
respond to him? In other words, how many of us are using Chavis' failures of 
judgment and of financial responsibility to hasten from the stage another black 
man who, for all his failings, was trying to move the NAACP in directions that 
would distress a substantial portion of the public and more than a few within 
the organization? We tend to forget that unorthodox thinking and 
confrontational tactics have been the hallmarks of our best leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 My point is not to compare Chavis to Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X or Martin Luther 
King Jr. Rather, we should not forget that each of these now revered black 
leaders was castigated during his lifetime, often for perceived personal 
failings that led many to conclude they were unfit for leadership roles in the 
black community. Will we welcome and support the next NAACP leader if, despite 
clear competence, unquestionable commitment and a spotless character, he or she 
adopts programs aimed at the myriad marks of oppression that afflict so many 
blacks, particularly poor blacks? 
</P>
<P>
 While there is general agreement about the need for more strategies that build 
self-esteem, teach self-sufficiency and advocate self-help, achieving these 
goals will almost certainly involve techniques and processes that will be 
threatening to some whites, particularly those who control funds, grants and 
the media. In the wake of the Chavis experience, many may urge the selection of 
a person noted for prudence rather than militancy, charm rather than charisma, 
skills in conciliation rather than adeptness in confrontation. Indeed, funding 
sources may insist on such a person as a condition of renewed grants and other 
financial support. But what may seem a safe pick may be the wrong choice at a 
time when a growing percentage of the nation's blacks are in prison and 
society's principal response is to build more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all too easy for me and other critics to highlight the inadequacies of 
current civil-rights approaches to black poverty, family disorganization and 
crime. It is more difficult to even imagine, much less implement, programs that 
effectively address these problems. The nation is deeply in debt. Corporate 
downsizing made possible by technology and fueled by greed has cost millions of 
Americans their jobs and placed millions more at risk. In today's tight job 
market, many employers are unwilling to hire blacks -- regardless of their 
training and experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The major response of politicians to this crisis is to ignore it. It is far 
easier to pander to racial fears and prejudices by defining as "crime" the 
futile efforts of the dispossessed who are determined to defer their doom by 
any means possible. Now, as earlier, civil-rights groups and their leaders must 
understand that from slavery to segregation, this society has never moved to 
remedy racial injustice until forced by circumstances and persistent black 
activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsumed beneath the condemnations of Chavis is the question he too clumsily 
posed: Who will speak for and define the issues that are relevant to African 
Americans generally, and, more specifically, into which group of hands will 
that corporate capital, however meager in the great scheme of things, flow? The 
black middle classes want to be that conduit, but they have yet to address the 
issue of whether they are willing to welcome to the policy-making table those 
to whom the black lower classes listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope as we might, King will not come back to lead us now. And were he to 
return with views calling for major economic reform like those he expressed 
toward the end of his life, he would not long be welcomed. We need to keep a 
sharp eye and an open mind to ensure that those with King's potential are not 
shunted aside because they urge disturbing remedies for conditions that 
approach the genocidal for some blacks and threaten disaster for us all.

MEXICO'S ON THE MOVE, WHY DOES IT STAND STILL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Rodriguez, Richard Rodriguez, an editor at Pacific News Service, is 
the author of Days of Obligation (Viking). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time of great change and national confusion, after a season of violence 
and rumor, Mexicans voted for the political party that promised them least. 
Ernesto Zedillo, of Mexico's antiquated Institutional Revolution ary Party, was 
elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 The PRI, as the ruling party is popularly called, is as truly a Mexican 
invention as the taco or machismo. It has ruled Mexico for most of this 
century; it owes its endurance to a Mexican fear of chaos and a yearning for 
orden . 
</P>
<P>
 Polls last week indicated that the older the voter, the more likely he or she 
was to vote for the PRI. The old in Mexico remember the early decades of this 
century -- the blood and the bodies -- as Mexican killed Mexican, and the 
victors romantically proclaimed the civil war to be "la Revolucion." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Revolution, the PRI gave Mexico the stability of compromise. The 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, as its name implies, sought to reconcile 
institutional pragmatism with revolutionary rhetoric. Its genius was as 
go-between, mediating among competing Mexicos -- business and labor, land 
owners and peasants. Mexicans tolerated the PRI's corruption and mischief in 
exchange for orden . Though after extraordinary corruption in the presidential 
palace and the near-collapse of the economy in the early '80s, Mexicans 
wondered if the PRI was an invention appropriate to the age of steam. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, flush with victory, Zedillo offered to "dialogue" with the 
opposition parties. The PRI was thus again trying to play its role as mediator. 
In recent years, however, the ruling party has been torn by internal conflicts, 
pitting party bosses ("dinosaurs") against Ivy League "technocrats." Rumors 
persist that PRI bosses were behind the assassination earlier this year of 
their own party's candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, the PRI represents an odd marriage of Tammany Hall politicos 
and Ivy League graduates. Yale-educated Zedillo replaces Harvard-educated 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Americans say they will miss Salinas. People sigh: "At last, Mexico had a 
president who spoke our language." But Salinas was preceded to the United 
States by peasants who journeyed north looking for work after the Revolution. 
Decades before Salinas introduced microeconomics to Mexico, Mexican peasants 
returned from the United States with rumors of dollars and Frank Sinatra 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City today, there are fancy new hotels and international boutiques 
to cater to business executives from all over the world. But all over Mexico, 
the poor are on the move. And the poor in Mexico are getting younger and 
younger -- the average age is 15. Half of Mexico has yet to reach puberty. Half 
of Mexico wasn't of age to vote this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo is not the face of future Mexico. Mexico is a teen-age girl. She has 
acne, but is just beginning to date. She wears a T-shirt that reads "HARD ROCK 
CAFE." Mexico is looking for a job. Mexico is on the move, leaving the village 
for the city, leaving custom for possibility, leaving home for Monterrey, 
Mexico, or for Monterey, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 We Americans, of course, are terrified of teen-aged Mexico. We much prefer 
Mexicans with Harvard degrees. During the debate over the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, not a few in the United States wondered: How are we ever going 
to compete with a teen-ager who is willing to earn in a day what we pay 
ourselves for an hour? 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, cynics in Mexico noted the way the PRI "points to the left and 
then moves to the right." The rhetoric of the party was fiery and leftist; the 
interest of the party was power, held tightly from on top -- an oligarchy of 
media billionaires, police chiefs with mansions and presidential relatives with 
millions invested in tourist hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, what distinguished the presidential elections was the presence of 
two true opposition parties -- one on each flank of the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 On the left stood Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate of the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party. The last time around, six years ago, Cardenas came close 
enough to winning the presidential race to require massive fraud by the PRI. 
This year, the rhetoric and the revolutionary agenda -- the old nationalism and 
state-development model -- were soundly defeated. After an Indian rebellion in 
Chiapas and the kidnaping of millionaires in Mexico City, Mexicans were wary of 
the rhetoric that had romanced their grandfathers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the right, coming in second, was the National Action Party's candidate, 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos. The PAN is pro-business, friendly to the Catholic 
Church, friendly as well to U.S. business interests. It emerged from the 
elections as the party of Mexico's middle class -- something new in Mexico's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine a parade: In the Election Day parade, the campesinos and the 
university Marxists rode the PRD float. The blond beauty queens and the 
Northern Mexican business executives were on the PAN float. On the PRI float, 
there was Zedillo, surrounded by overweight labor chiefs and pale MIT 
graduates. The PRI float had the least glamour. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the PRI won. It was as though Mexicans were voting for nothing. It was as 
though the PRI victory was hollow. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to Mexicans last week, I had the sense that the vote for the PRI was 
not one of affection or ideological solidarity. People, rather, wanted the 
status quo. Mexicans chose the PRI because it promised least. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor Mexico," goes the old saw. "So far from God, so close to the United 
States." If Americans in recent years have feared proximity to Mexican 
teen-agers in the international labor market, Mexicans have their own reason to 
worry. 
</P>
<P>
 For generations, Mexicans have called people in the United States 
"norteamericanos." (It was the polite way of saying "gringos.") Now, of course, 
after NAFTA, Mexico is waking up to the idea that she, too, is a 
norteamericana. Her future is tied to her old antagonist, the gringo, and to 
Canada, a country she barely knows. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southwestern United States, Americans fret about illegal aliens. Throughout 
Mexico, there are Wal-Marts and satellite dishes that pull in the Playboy 
Channel and the Dallas Cowboys. Mexico broods: As her future turns north, how 
shall she remain distinctly separate? Mexican? 
</P>
<P>
 The persons who have fewest answers are those at the top. The writers, the 
academics, the politicians of Mexico are offering Mexico no idea of what she is 
becoming. The dreams, the ambitions, the schemes are coming from the bottom of 
society. Mexico is stirring, moving, growing. Mexico is starting to shave. 
Mexico is converting to evangelical Protestantism or listening to Madonna. 
Mexico wants a job washing dishes at the new Italian restaurant on Sunset 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Had there been fraud in the elections? The international cast of observers 
assembled in Mexico thought the fraud was less than usual. The PRI didn't, 
after all, need to steal ballots or stuff the ballot boxes with the names of 
the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the PRI had an easy victory. Yale would replace Harvard at the 
Mexican White House, Los Pinos. But at a time of Indian rebellions and rock 
concerts; at a time of kidnapings and NFL football games in Mexico City; at a 
time when everything was changing everywhere in Mexico, it only seemed last 
week that nothing had changed.

CRIME FIGHTERS; CONGRESS' STRUGGLE AGAINST CHANGE THE PRESIDENT -- AND THE 
PUBLI -- WANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN ESTRICH, Susan Estrich, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a law 
professor at USC. She served as campaign manager for Michael S. Dukakis in 
1988. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our democracy isn't working well these days. Things that should be easy -- 
like the crime bill -- are nearly impossible. Even moderate reform of the 
health-care system may be more than Congress can accomplish. A President 
committed to change is confronted by political institutions -- the House of 
Representatives and the U.S. Senate -- wed by ties of money and politics to the 
status quo. What is striking is not that the President is having trouble on 
Capitol Hill, but that he manages to get anything through. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill, on its merits, should have been an easy vote: Election Day is 
11 weeks away; crime is a top priority for voters, and the major elements of 
the bill -- with money for prisons and police, expanded punishment, a ban on 
assault weapons and some funds for prevention -- reflect a consensus approach 
to crime that has broad public support. If that were not enough, both houses of 
Congress had already passed the bill once; in the Senate, it had been 
overwhelmingly supported by Republicans. What remained was approval of a 
conference report that provided even less money for prevention -- what the GOP 
now calls "pork" -- than the original House bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the process was so painful, that it required major concessions 
to House Republicans and what Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas saw as 
desertions by six GOP senators before passage on Thursday, is a stark case 
study in what is wrong with Washington these days. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Republican leadership, the only goal seems to be embarrassing the 
President. This was the game from the beginning. Much-maligned midnight 
basketball -- the first Republican symbol of supposed excess in the bill -- was 
one of George Bush's "1,000 points of light." New York Mayor Rudolph W. 
Giuliani and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, two of the crime bill's 
strongest supporters, aren't your typical pork-barrel politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Pork was just the excuse. This is, as always, about politics. The Republicans 
smell blood in November. The worse shape President Bill Clinton is in, the 
better they hope to do. The less he gets through Congress, the better it is for 
them as challengers. Dole's only regret was that he couldn't play it all the 
way. But he'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't just Republicans playing politics as a contact sport. The 
Congressional Black Caucus deserted in significant numbers -- either because 
they care more about stopping the death penalty than providing police and 
prevention, or because they just wanted to prove how much clout they have. And 
then there is the National Rifle Assn., which is credited with intimidating 
conservative House Democrats into voting "no." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans support the crime bill's ban on assault weapons, but most 
Americans aren't well-organized and well-financed -- the way the NRA is. In the 
House two weeks ago, the NRA managed to deny a Democratic President a 
Democratic majority on a popular piece of legislation. In the Senate last week, 
many saw the NRA behind Dole's procedural games. 
</P>
<P>
 And crime is easy, compared with health care. What the NRA did to the crime 
bill, doctors and hospitals and insurance companies are doing to health care. 
With Dole determined to deny any victory to the President, and the organized 
interests on the march, average Americans -- people who don't give money to 
politicians or hire lobbyists -- don't have a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $100 million has already been spent to influence legislators on 
health care. Political-action committees representing interested parties are 
making campaign contributions at the rate of $2 million a month. Who is 
representing you? 
</P>
<P>
 Even though a majority of Americans support the basic elements of the 
Democratic approach, there seems little chance of comprehensive reform. And 
even though virtually everyone, including Dole, supports at least some reform 
-- so that insurance is not just for the healthy, and people can leave jobs 
without losing their coverage -- the prospect of even moderate reform fades 
every day. The status quo is winning. Chances of Congress doing nothing are 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting legislation passed would be easier, of course, if Clinton were more 
popular. But one important reason the President is not more popular is because 
he is trying to change America. Whitewater and Paula Corbin Jones may provide 
the text for the attack on the Administration -- but the subtext is change. His 
allies complain he compromises too much, but his opponents appreciate the 
threat that Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton pose to the status quo. That is why 
Rush Limbaugh attacks the President every day. 
</P>
<P>
 The caricature of Clinton is that he believes in big government and 
bureaucracy. That is a caricature because no one -- certainly, no one elected 
to any office in the 1990s, much less the only Democrat to win the presidency 
in 12 years -- does so on a platform of big government and bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton Administration does stand for change. This is a President who 
actually believes government can play a constructive role in solving problems 
-- in protecting people from crime and ensuring access to quality medical care. 
But he needs Congress to make change happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has always been at his best in a fight. He was the comeback kid in New 
Hampshire, and he has played that role repeatedly with the Congress. The 
deficit-reduction plan passed on a tie vote in the Senate; the North American 
Free Trade Agreement was uncertain until the last minute, and the Brady bill 
was a cliffhanger -- to name just a few. 
</P>
<P>
 This Administration spends a great deal of time on the limbs of trees, without 
falling off. Maybe that's inevitable, when you're trying to accomplish real 
change in our system. But health care may be the most difficult balancing act 
of all. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many decent, principled people in the Congress, for whom being there 
is not the only end. The question is whether there are enough of them. After 
the last two weeks of trial and tribulation, it is an open question.

WHO DO YOU TRUST: THE EPHEMERAL NATURE OF REPUTATION IN PUBLIC LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Suzanne Garment, Suzanne Garment, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. She is the author of 
Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American Politics (Times Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's newest independent counsel, former Solicitor General Kenneth W. 
Starr, is finally starting his investigation of Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a brief hitch: Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) asked the federal judges 
who named Starr to un-name him, on the grounds that the appointment process and 
Starr himself were too partisan. But the judges speedily answered they had no 
authority to do such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 If he doesn't agree, the senator can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, where 
it takes the votes of four justices to put a case on the court calendar. 
Getting four votes in this matter would require disinterring William O. 
Douglas, Hugo L. Black and probably two more of those old-time judicial 
activists. So Starr can now start. But his reputation and work are already 
under a cloud. 
</P>
<P>
 How come we don't seem to have in our national life what used to be called 
public men, whose honesty was beyond question and whose judgment was trusted by 
political partisans on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, such individuals did exist. They were the permanent 
panjandrums of national affairs, people like Henry L. Stimson, Dean G. Acheson 
and -- well, Clark M. Clifford. They could be found in the federal government, 
where after World War II they constituted a foreign-policy Establishment and 
where as late as the 1960s they populated significantly bipartisan Cabinets. 
They also existed in law enforcement, where they were called on by federal and 
state governments to serve as special prosecutors for big cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually none of them, measured by modern standards, could pass investigative 
muster. Recent historians have exposed their personal vices and their 
activities as agents of international capitalism. But in their day, their word 
was enough to settle even the most rancorous political arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after the turmoil of the 1960s, came Watergate -- in which President 
Richard M. Nixon fired Archibald Cox, a special prosecutor very much in the 
mold of the traditional public man. There was national uproar. Nixon had to 
name another special prosecutor to continue the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 You might see this as heartwarming proof of the power of the trustworthy 
individual in public life. But people enraged by Watergate found it intolerable 
that Nixon held the power to fire Cox in the first place, even if this 
theoretical power proved an empty one. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, they did not make their argument in this highly personal, anti-Nixon 
tone. Instead, they said that all investigations of high-government officials 
were tainted if conducted by special prosecutors who had been appointed by 
Presidents and could be removed by Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus arose the post-Watergate special-prosecutor legislation, a real piece of 
work, designed to produce special prosecutors untouched by human hands. This 
law detailed the circumstances under which an attorney general had to seek the 
naming of such an official; actual appointment and removal were in the hands of 
the federal courts. Moreover, a special prosecutor could be fired only for 
"good cause" -- an administrative-law phrase meaning, roughly, "not unless you 
actually catch him on a boat to China with the family jewels." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, "special prosecutor" was changed to the more polite 
"independent counsel." People fought over just how much power an attorney 
general should have in the process, and they grumbled at the length and expense 
of independent-counsel investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the institution stuck. Opponents succeeded in scrapping the law only to be 
forced to reinstitute it. The idea had become engrained, not just for 
investigations but for government in general -- only individuals thoroughly 
insulated from politics can be trusted with power. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Clinton Administration started trying to extricate itself from 
Whitewater. It laid in a supply of traditional public men whose reputations 
could help restore public trust. The President named Lloyd N. Cutler as White 
House counsel. With the independent-counsel law expired, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno 
appointed another such man, Robert B. Fiske Jr., as Whitewater special 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite their illustrious careers, neither bought the Administration much 
in the way of increased respectability, and both saw their own reputations 
dimmed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cutler insisted, during congressional testimony, that he was giving his 
independent legal judgment on Whitewater, that he was not talking as a partisan 
and that because of his past career he should be believed, reactions ranged 
from cynical to more cynical. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske followed the experts' advice, developed out of the Iran-Contra fiasco, 
by demanding that Congress delay public hearings on Whitewater so as not to 
compromise any criminal proceedings that might arise from his investigations. 
In his first two investigative verdicts, he concluded that White House aide 
Vincent W. Foster Jr. had indeed committed suicide, contrary to sinister rumor, 
and that no one had done anything criminal during the Resolution Trust Corp.'s 
inquiry into a Clinton-connected bank. 
</P>
<P>
 For these findings, Fiske was accused of covering up on behalf of the 
Clintonites. What could you expect, critics asked, of a man who owed his job to 
Reno? 
</P>
<P>
 When the independent-counsel law was revived, the Administration tried to 
regularize Fiske's status by having the courts name him an official, authentic 
independent counsel. But the judges, rigorously following post-Watergate logic, 
gave the job to someone never appointed by the Clinton Administration -- 
someone, in other words, who was more formally independent than Fiske. 
</P>
<P>
 They chose Starr -- the soul of prudence and a man who even ideological 
opponents consider fair. But none of these qualities was enough to still 
suspicion; not even a court appointment, we discover, can bestow purity today. 
Starr is a conservative, his pro-Clinton critics say. In the Paula Corbin Jones 
case, he talked about filing a friend-of-court brief to make the constitutional 
argument that a President is not immune from being sued. Starr, still 
relatively young, has even considered running for the Senate -- as a 
Republican! 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, one of the judges who named Starr has Political Connections: He was 
seen lunching with a conservative senator. So how can Starr be fair-minded? 
</P>
<P>
 We had better watch it. Too many scandals, producing results that many 
consider ludicrous, are making us cynical and embroiling us in the paradoxes 
that cynicism brings. Thus, bad people in politics can no longer be truly 
ruined by scandal, while good people can no longer preserve their reputation 
for virtue. 
</P>
<P>
 When the political community so loses the ability to discriminate, we will 
find out what it really means to be governed by people whom we can not trust.

AS THE CRISIS GROWS, WHERE IS THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN CUBA AND CLINTON WHITE 
HOUSE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Wayne S. Smith, Wayne S. Smith is a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins 
University and a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy. He was 
chief of the U.S. interests section in Havana. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Administrations trying to deal with Cuba are reminiscent of nothing as 
much as a man long accustomed to driving nails when sud denly presented with 
something so subtle as the principle of the screw: He just keeps banging away 
with his hammer. The Clinton Administration is as bad as its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the Administration talked quietly with Cuban authorities weeks ago, it 
might have defused the increasing immigration problem by agreeing to such 
measures as the expansion of legal means of immigration and halting the 
practice of accepting without question any undocumented Cuban who arrived in 
the United States. But the problem has now reached such proportions that these 
measures cannot solve it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than trying calm discussions, the Administration flailed away with its 
hammer, ratcheting up the pressure on Cuban President Fidel Castro, by saying 
the United States wouldn't accept any more Cuban refugees. With the emigration 
safety valve thus turned off, pressures on the island would build, to be vented 
by Castro's ouster. Or so it was reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
 But as anyone who knows Cubans well could have told the Administration, the 
tactic did not work. President Bill Clinton's announcement did not stem the 
flood of refugees. On the contrary, aware that Coast Guard vessels were now out 
in the Florida Straits to pick them up, the number of refugees increased. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not inconceivable that several hundred thousand Cubans will leave the 
island, undeterred by the fact that they will be taken to detention camps -- in 
Guantanamo or elsewhere. As a group of rafters said to me when I was on the 
beach in Cuba last week, "At least we know we'll be well-fed." 
</P>
<P>
 I saw no evidence of Cubans being "pushed out," as the Administration has 
alleged, or even encouraged to go. On the contrary, I saw Cuban policemen 
trying to dissuade rafters from setting out on their dangerous voyage. Other 
Americans in Havana witnessed similar scenes. But the police clearly have 
instructions not to interfere if the rafters insist on going. In other words, 
this is a voluntary outflow. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the Clinton Administration had condemned efforts to prevent rafters 
from leaving as a violation of human rights. But it now says failure to prevent 
departure shows, in the words of Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, "a cynical disregard 
for the safety of Cuban citizens." Which way does the Administration want it? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the new measures taken by Washington to squeeze Castro -- cutting 
off family remittances and halting the charter flights -- may pinch a bit. 
Without question, they will cause increased suffering for divided Cuban 
families. But they will not have any significant impact on the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, they will bring about neither Castro's downfall nor a decision to 
prevent the rafters from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does the Administration do now, with more and more refugees on the way 
and little likelihood of Castro's quick ouster -- or change of heart? 
Essentially, there are three options: 
</P>
<P>
 * It can take the route of further escalation, eventually reaching the point 
of imposing a blockade or even invading the island. Anything to get rid of 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 * It can accept Cuban offers now on the table to begin a dialogue aimed at 
resolving this problem and, ultimately, all other disagreements between the 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 * Or it can bite the bullet; make no efforts to resolve the problem, and 
reconcile itself to having thousands of refugees on its hands indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Which option is the Administration most likely to take? Nothing short of 
blockade or invasion will satisfy the right-wing exiles who now seem to be 
advising the Clinton White House. On the other hand, perhaps cooler heads will 
recognize that the cost would be disproportionate. An invasion could result in 
hundreds of U.S. casualties -- and condemnation by the United Nations. We have 
no chance of getting international support for a blockade. On the contrary, if 
we want a real international crisis, we can have it by unilaterally halting 
French, British, Canadian and Russian vessels bound for Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Administration is unlikely to escalate pressures to the point of 
military action, it is even less likely to fathom the principle of the screw 
and begin a dialogue. That would offend the right-wing exiles to whom it is so 
mysteriously committed, and would represent too abrupt a reversal of the course 
it has followed over the past two years. The White House has already ruled out 
discussion of anything except narrow immigration issues. That is unlikely to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, we are likely to be stuck with housing and feeding a large number of 
refugees for years to come, and facing a glowering standoff between the United 
States and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that the Clinton Administration appears incapable of acting to end that 
destabilizing impasse, perhaps it is time for a group of hemispheric countries 
-- including, for example, Mexico, Canada, Jamaica and Colombia -- to play the 
same role in this situation that the Contadora countries played in the Central 
American conflict of the '80s. Cuban spokesmen have said intermediaries are not 
needed, but have not rejected the concept of "good offices." Under this, the 
other countries could urge conciliatory steps on both sides and provide a forum 
where the two might begin to talk sensibly. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of all, they could make it clear to the United States that its 
crusade against Cuba is a relic of the Cold War, no longer acceptable to the 
international community. Everyone wants to see Cuba move toward a more open 
political and economic system, but this is no way to bring that about.

THE FOLLY OF COZYING UP TO THE SON OF A DICTATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Shapiro, Michael Shapiro, who teaches at the Columbia Journalism 
School, is the author of The Shadow in the Sun: A Korean Year of Love and 
Sorrow (Atlantic Monthly Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one thing for departed North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung to consider 
negotiating away the one asset his country is believed to possess -- its 
nuclear bomb -- and not risk losing his head. It is quite another for his son 
and heir, Kim Jong Il, to so much as try. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative agreement recently reached in Geneva between U.S. and North 
Korean negotiators, which would freeze Pyongyang's nuclear program, may well 
prove illusory. North Korea may balk at inspections that could determine 
whether it has diverted enough plutonium to build a bomb. There are also rumors 
of a power struggle in the North Korean capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis has nothing to do with the younger Kim's presumed madness. Rather, 
what the United States confronts is a son who, his excesses aside, cannot be 
what his father was. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of North Korea after Kim Il Sung not as a Stalinist state in the midst 
of a transfer of power but as a condensed Yugoslavia after the death of Josip 
Tito. That is the degree to which factional bitterness and hatreds have 
dominated life on the Korean peninsula for virtually all its 5,000-year 
history. In Korea, power has always been a zero-sum game: If you have it, you 
have it all; if you lack it, you have nothing. Winners gloat and punish the 
losers, who brood and wait for their chance to turn the tables. 
</P>
<P>
 In his North Korea, Kim Il Sung was the state -- the omniscient authority to 
whom legions of bureaucrats, military officers, and men and women of ambition 
were indebted. He was the mythologized founder, whose Orwellian cult of 
personality demanded -- and in many ways achieved -- a devotion his son cannot 
duplicate. And the debts Kim Il Sung accumulated do not necessarily pass from 
father to son, especially in the rush to fill the vacuum, now that the old man 
is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The deceptive thing about tyrants, especially those who display the particular 
evil of a Kim Il Sung, is that the fear they engender masks their political 
skills. Kim stayed on his throne for almost 50 years not only because he was 
adept as playing the powerful off each other -- Josef Stalin against Mao 
Tse-Tung was no mean accomplishment -- but also because he could play the angry 
factions in his own country to his advantage. Kim knew when to purge, when to 
kill and when killing risked making blood feuds that he did not need. He knew 
when to call friends-turned-sudden-enemies back from internal exile and replace 
them in the cold with others he perceived as challengers. By doing this, he 
managed to survive at least three coup attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim learned the lessons of manipulation and terror because there was no other 
way to rise and then to endure. Not so his son, who, at 53, has eased into 
middle age celebrated by his father's propagandists as the son of god. For 
years, Kim Jong Il has been sold to his nation as the apotheosis of filial 
piety, first, the propaganda goes, in trying 
</P>
<P>
 to ease the burden of leadership for his aging father and now, after his 
death, as the distraught and haggard heir, lost without his master. And while 
that is a powerful image in a society that so values the good works a son 
performs for his father, it is also an indication of just where Kim Jong Il 
finds himself -- alone, no longer able to move beneath his father's 
considerable shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 His father gave Kim Jong Il his crown and put him in charge of the army and 
commissioned a mountain of hagiography celebrating the manifold accomplishments 
of the boss' boy, "the Dear Leader." But despite talk of Kim Jong Il's running 
the "day-to-day" business of government for some time, there is nothing to 
suggest that this is a man who knows -- or, for that matter, has ever had to 
know -- how to play the game the way his father could. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he will have to play the army off the technocrats, the putative economic 
reformers against those who insist that any erosion of state control is 
tantamount to treason. Kim Jong Il will have to mediate between these 
antagonists as well as between his own relatives, distant and close, many of 
whom hold high government positions. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kim Jong Il to be seen as conciliatory toward his nation's most hated 
enemy -- the United States -- may damn him in the eyes of those in the military 
who see compromise as surrender and who might well move to topple him. On the 
other hand, if he resumes the pose of obstructionism, he risks losing the 
economic incentives that could come in a deal with the Americans. This, in 
turn, means alienating those who insist upon the need for reform; his 
countrymen who, by many accounts, are getting poorer and hungrier, and his last 
patron, the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 All this leaves the United States, for the foreseeable future, negotiating the 
end of the nuclear crisis with the representatives of a leader who has almost 
no room to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 If we embrace Kim Jong Il, if we help smooth his ascent, we risk alienating 
those who might follow him. If we push him, we risk incurring the ire of a man 
trying to prove his worth. The Koreans have been adept at playing for time. 
Without a better solution -- the use of force is not a sane option -- we are 
left to play the same game, talking and waiting for the moment when Kim Jong 
Il, or his successor, senses that the moment is safe for making a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 We should continue offering real incentives to the North Koreans -- economic 
assistance and the prospect of diplomatic recognition -- while at the same time 
reminding Pyongyang that their delay in halting their nuclear program could 
well bring consequences. The economy of Kim Jong Il's North Korea's can ill 
afford even modest sanctions that might, conceivably, reduce oil from China and 
cash from Koreans living in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 We should not be surprised if Pyongyang returns to obfuscation, bluster and 
deceit. And we should not respond with accusations and threats of force. 
Rather, we should take the calculated risk of talking and waiting, 
understanding that the end of this crisis is, with the death of Kim Il Sung and 
ascent of his son, ever more elusive.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; MICHAEL HESELTINE; BRITAIN'S PRIME TORY ASSESSES 
PARTY'S CHANCES -- THEY'RE GOOD (OF COURSE) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Tuohy and Thomas Plate, William Tuohy is London bureau chief and 
Thomas Plate is the editorial page editor for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Conservative Party supporters and the British tabloids, he is known as 
"Tarzan." Indeed, Michael Ray Dibdin Heseltine looks the part and is one of the 
most popular political figures with the Tory rank-and-file -- at the 
grass-roots level. Tall, rangy, with Kirk Douglas looks and flowing blond locks 
that are beginning to whiten, Heseltine always stirs up the faithful with 
rousing speeches at Conservative Party conferences. In person, he seems almost 
too big for his top-floor office as secretary of state for trade and industry 
in Prime Minister John Major's Cabinet. The job also carries the title 
president of the board of trade, and, perhaps significantly, he prefers the 
title "president" to "secretary of state." 
</P>
<P>
 Now 61, he was a successful publisher before winning a seat in the House of 
Commons and served in the government of Prime Minister Edward Heath in the 
early 1970s. Heseltine supported Heath in his losing battle for the Tory Party 
leadership against Margaret Thatcher in 1975. But Thatcher appointed him to her 
first Cabinet as environment secretary in 1979. He shifted to defense in 1983 
but, after in an internal argument over policy, he resigned in a huff in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, from the backbenches, Heseltine led the move to depose Thatcher. He 
was successful -- but partly because of his spoiling role, lost the vote for 
the prime minister's post to Major. Nonetheless, Heseltine is often mentioned 
as a leading successor to Major if the prime minister should step down or be 
deposed. Heseltine maintains that he is a loyal supporter of Major. 
</P>
<P>
 Heseltine lives at his 800-acre country estate with his wife, Anne. They have 
three children. He suffered a serious heart attack last year, which may have 
reduced his chances of ever becoming prime minister. But he was looking tanned 
and fit during a recent conversation in his Spartan office in the department's 
high-rise overlooking London's Westminister district. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: As Britain gets closer to Europe, it gets farther from the United 
States. Should America be worried?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No. American governments since that of President Eisenhower have been 
consistent in urging Britain to become more closely involved in the European 
postwar movement. And so, they shouldn't be surprised if we do. But it serves 
both British self-interest and American interest. It serves British 
self-interest for all the obvious reasons that the configuration of power is 
increasingly focused on the shrinking world market and three regional markets 
of the Pacific, America and Europe. And for Britain to be a leading voice in 
that process means that we tend to influence the climate, the environment in 
which decisions are taken that affect us profoundly. 
</P>
<P>
 From America's point of view, the attitudes of the Anglo-Saxon, capitalist 
culture, the attitudes toward the defense of the free world, the common 
language, gives America the opportunity to know that there is a very 
sympathetic and historically close ally at the decision-making process which -- 
as our interests tend to coincide in many ways -- is to American interests as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Isn't there a lot of tension in Britain right now, as regards the role of 
Britain in the world?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, there's always tension in democratic politics, that's the great 
strength of democracy, that it resolves tensions in an amicable, peaceful way. 
</P>
<P>
 But it would be unthinkable for a shift of British policy of such historic 
proportions to be conducted without tension across the political spectrum, both 
within and between parties. But the broad thrust of the process is acknowledged 
by all parties today. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Another American fear is the fear of a Labor Party government -- we've been 
dealing with a Conservative Party government for 15 years, and it's worked 
rather well, on the whole. Are the American fears of a Labor government 
legitimate?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, they're not going to be in power. Socialism is bankrupt. If you look 
at the late 19th Century -- where the excesses of capitalism were thought to be 
susceptible to cure by statist solutions, whether they were socialist or 
communist -- it was quite widely believed that there had to be a more orderly, 
a more planned, a more centralist, a more egalitarian way of managing complex 
societies. The movement in that direction lasted until the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that there is no serious contribution today being made by 
socialism across the world. To the extent there is a huge debate about the 
future of societies, it's all based upon the philosophies of the 
free-enterprise capitalist culture. Cuba may be the exception -- but there's 
hardly any exceptions to this rule. So any party which has its roots and its 
emotions, its instincts and its power base in yesterday's structures cannot 
win. They are simply out of date. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the event, however likely or unlikely, of a Labor government, what would 
be the implications of British foreign policy vis-a-vis the United States?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The difficulty about the Labor foreign policy at the moment is that it's 
very difficult to know what it would actually amount to in practice. It has 
always tended to be anti-American in its basis. There are (Labor Party) trigger 
words -- there are bosses , there's profits, there's capitalism and there's 
America. And those are the sort of words that bring rapturous applause from the 
audiences of the left. If you want to get them off their butts, cheering in the 
aisles, you play that variety of music. Now, of course, trying to win power 
they've learnt to suppress this instinct and this phraseology but, deep down, 
it's all there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As a leading light of the Tory Party, with polls in the last six months to 
a year showing the party quite low, what's your solution for bringing the 
Tories back out on top for the next general election -- which might not be 
until 1997?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, you're right to set the question in the right time scale -- the next 
general election is a long way from today. And the answer to your question, in 
a single word, is recession. If you look at similar societies to ours, you will 
find that there is no exception to the rule, that recession has cost the 
governments of those countries their existence. President Bush failed to secure 
reelection in America, the incumbent government was beaten in Canada, the 
Liberal Democrats lost power for the first time in 40 years in Japan, the 
socialists were beaten in France and, until recently, Chancellor Kohl has been 
into similar difficulties in Germany. We, too, are no exception to this rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Democracies take a toll of their political leaders when the economic 
circumstances take a toll of democracies. As we're just coming through the 
longest and deepest recession of the postwar world, there's no way that elected 
governments could escape from its ravages. And the answer follows from this 
analysis, that if we, as a government, are going to keep our nerve, we are in 
an extremely competitive position, economically and industrially, today, and by 
the time we get to the election, the growing confidence in the management of 
our companies will have been translated into an understanding in the public 
mind of why we had to achieve the low-inflation and low-interest background for 
the restoration of our fortunes, and how the people have benefited from that. 
But you can't get people to understand that in advance of the delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There is speculation about the next prime minister. Who will that be?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, well, my analysis goes on to answer the question quite easily. I think 
that the current prime minster, John Major, will lead the Conservatives in the 
next election, and we will be elected with an increased majority. The prime 
minister will be seen as a man of steel who's kept his nerve and led us through 
the most difficult, stretching circumstances, and I can hear the speeches that 
everyone will be making then. I say all this because I've been through these 
experiences so many times in the mid-term of governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Now that Tony Blair has succeeded to the Labor leadership, is this bright, 
fresh face a danger to the Conservative Party?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The only thing that would be a danger to the Conservative Party is if the 
economy isn't as good as I think it will be. The personalities will fade into 
insignificance against economic delivery. You can't fool the people -- they 
know whether the economy is suiting them or not, because they know what their 
relative living standards are doing, and a sense of confidence in jobs, and all 
of that is very much a personal judgment for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It seems as if there is a trend toward a more measured role for the state.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, it's a very important point, and I think it's manifest in many ways. 
The whole privatization across the world is an indication of governments 
recognizing the restraints in what they can do. The need to cut public 
borrowing across the world is the recognition that governments just can't go on 
borrowing; it has malign consequences on the management of the economy. So 
there's a new consensus and essentially a right-wing consensus -- this is, in 
fact, the analysis I was giving you a few minutes ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A left-wing government could no more escape from that than any other 
government, but they would hate not being able to escape, whereas on the right, 
we tend to welcome the disciplines that it imposes once we recognize the 
beneficial effects. That presents left-wing governments with enormous 
difficulties -- because their heart isn't in it. They actually want to supply 
the left-wing solutions, the statist solutions, but they can't. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You often emphasize the need for government to help and be involved in 
sectors of the economy that are hurting. One phrase in America for this is 
"industrial policy." Do you favor a kind of industrial policy?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, yes. Every government has an industrial policy, even if the essence of 
the policy is not to have a policy . . . . The concepts of industrial policy, 
industrial strategy, whatever you call it, are the subject of deep and burning 
controversy. Now you have gone to one aspect of the dangers of one sort of 
industrial strategy, which is overregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many other dangers. One is oversubsidization, because you preserve 
inefficiencies. The other is over-state ownership, because then you create 
monoplies and then you protect them. 
</P>
<P>
 You can go to the other end of the political spectrum and have an industrial 
policy which says we'll do nothing to help anybody in any circumstances, 
whereupon you find yourself getting wiped out by other countries that have 
heavily supported this, that or the other thing . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Helping (British) companies to win (in the world marketplace) means you have 
to be very hard-nosed about your analysis about what will help them win. You do 
not work on the assumption that what they tell you is what will help them to 
win. Because if you do that, you go down the road that you were talking about 
-- which is subsidy protection. It doesn't help them to win; it may only help 
the weak to survive, but not for long. 
</P>
<P>
 The first and biggest goal of all is getting the macroeconomic policies right. 
You get low inflation, low interest rates, good industrial relations, high 
productivity, low taxes at a competitive exchange rate and a heck of a lot will 
go right for you. Not everything, if you don't educate your people and train 
them properly. So you've gotta get that right and even if you get that right, 
there are all sorts of other things that then come into play. 
</P>
<P>
 America today, for example, is being very aggressive in its use of export 
credits. And I get companies saying we can beat them on price but we can't beat 
them on the credits -- well, that's a state intervention. I mean, America has 
always been a very formidable competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've got an awfully small desk; one expected to see something like that 
Chaplin movie, with the biggest desk in the world.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Not much happens in this office. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why such a small desk?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There's nothing much to put on it.

POLICE UNION COMPLAINTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Assistant Chief Bernard Parks ordered an audit of the LAPD's West Los Angeles 
station to determine whether alleged sexual harassment had made working 
conditions difficult for female officers (Aug. 17)? How dare he! And now he's 
trying to promote minority and female officers because of a longstanding dearth 
in upper- and middle-management ranks?

 Re "City Council Members Back LAPD Official," Aug. 20: 
</P>
<P>
 I know what I'm about to say isn't politically correct, and that it will 
probably offend those who are, but what is wrong is wrong. What's wrong in Los 
Angeles is how City Council members would stand up so vehemently with Assistant 
Chief Parks for a policy that is so obviously unfair and unjust. Is it just for 
officers who work harder and perform at a higher level than their co-workers to 
be passed over because they are white and male? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it just to tell minority and female officers that they receive promotions 
not because they excel over their peers but because standards must be made 
lower for them (because in the minds of the politically correct they could not 
make it on their own merits)? Is it just to these people to make them feel 
inferior by constantly telling them that the only way they can compete or 
succeed in the world is by expecting less from them, and lowering standards for 
them? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it just to the people of Los Angeles for them to have to accept officers of 
lesser capability simply because of race or gender? No, I can't accept such 
injustice.

 What a grim and pathetic situation our society has become since the racist, 
sexist institution of affirmative action set us all against each other. Now 
black LAPD officers talk of seceding from the Police Protective League since 
the league has the audacity to challenge the new Jim Crow laws of our society, 
which have already made it impossible for new white male applicants to enter 
the LAPD, even with perfect scores. 
</P>
<P>
 White males were not even allowed to fill out an application to take the exam 
for the Los Angeles Fire Department recently, and now this. There is only one 
way out of this mess, people, and that is a race-blind, sex-blind meritocracy. 
The black officers should be the first to understand that people should be 
judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. must be turning over in his grave.

NEITHER IGNORE NOR ISOLATE; IS CLINTON'S CHINA POLICY ABOUT TO TAKE SHAPE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years after the government of China turned its guns and tanks on 
pro-democracy demonstrators in Tian An Men Square, that nation faces an 
uncertain future as its communist leaders maneuver behind the scenes to succeed 
the ailing Deng Xiaoping, 90. The transition that his inevitable passing will 
bring about requires a review of Washington's policy toward Beijing.  
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Jim Mann reported that the Clinton Administration is 
thinking about lifting most of the remaining sanctions imposed against China 
after the Tian An Men massacre, although just three months ago the President 
said he was extending them. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the Administration has been torn between anguish over China's grim 
human rights policies and the dire need to improve trade relations. The 
confusion culminated in the embarrassingly hostile reception that Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher received in Beijing last spring. Now Clinton is moving 
toward restoring the U.S. relationship with Beijing. However, the 
Administration must be careful in doing so to not inadvertently validate 
China's hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MANEUVERING: No one can forget the Chinese government's harsh treatment of 
dissidents and its other human rights failures, but, as a major succession 
looms in Beijing, it is more important than ever for the United States to 
engage the emerging players. China obviously is too big a nation to ignore or 
to attempt to isolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton renewed most-favored-nation trading status for China last May. At the 
time U.S. officials said he was trying to decouple trade and human rights, 
which had been souring relations between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 As a follow-up to that controversial decision, Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. 
Brown is leading a White House-sponsored delegation of American business 
leaders currently visiting Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown could have a key role in the Administration's policy changes. The 
commerce secretary is hoping the United States will open the way for a "new 
commercial relationship" with Beijing. Among other steps, the Administration is 
considering lifting the prohibitions on U.S. trade assistance to China and on 
the Overseas Private Investment Corp. program, which provides insurance and 
financing for American companies. These possible changes are of mainly symbolic 
value to Beijing, but some reciprocal move would certainly be in order and 
should be part of improving U.S-China relations. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MARKET: Although China is an important market for the United States, care 
must be taken not to simplify U.S.-China relations into a mere commercial 
connection. Rapid change has engulfed China in the five years since Tian An 
Men, and it is likely to continue and even accelerate dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 To date Beijing has been far more astute than Washington at handling the 
problems that have arisen in U.S.-China relations as a result of all that 
change. The United States requires a consistent, broad-based and sophisticated 
China policy to prepare now for the coming change of leadership in Beijing.

TREATMENT FOR MENTALLY ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My 10 years as an advocate for persons with mental illness taught me that it 
is not accurate to describe the problem of providing treatment to persons in 
need as a conflict between civil liberties and tough but necessary medicine 
("Treatment Against Their Will," Aug. 18). Treatment can be provided and civil 
liberties respected if the treatment is available in the community and 
affordable housing provided to persons whose mental illness prevents them from 
working at certain times. 
</P>
<P>
 Public psychiatric hospitals, where almost all long-term patients are 
confined, are rightly feared by almost everyone, mentally ill or not. At their 
worst, the hospitals are snake pits, and some of these still exist. At their 
best, they are clean and patients are not abused, but treatment consists almost 
exclusively of psychotropic drugs, many of which cause powerful distortions of 
the mind, interfere with thinking and have serious (and sometimes irreversible) 
physical effects. 
</P>
<P>
 The deinstitutionalization of persons with mental illness was never intended 
by its advocates to result in dumping patients onto the streets; that result 
was imposed by politicians who saw opportunities for balancing budgets and 
saving taxes by closing hospitals without providing the needed housing and 
community-based treatment facilities. The legions of homeless persons who are 
mentally ill are the product of this shortsighted policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution is not to lock up those in need of assistance, but to provide the 
housing and needed care in the community, so that most will voluntarily accept 
the benefits along with the treatment. Surprisingly, it is also cheaper than 
the $50,000 or more it costs the taxpayers to lock someone into a hospital.

 Your excellent piece on treating individuals with neurobiological disorders 
(formerly known as "mental illness") against their will missed one important 
change that has to be made in the law if we are to guarantee these people the 
human care they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 In many states individuals receive one court hearing on whether or not they 
are "dangerous" and should be involuntarily hospitalized and a second hearing 
on whether or not they should be involuntarily treated. These hearings often 
occur weeks apart, resulting in the ludicrous and cruel proposition of having 
someone hospitalized but not allowed to receive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The law must be changed so the two hearings can be held at the same (earliest) 
time. This would prevent individuals with NBD from being warehoused 
unnecessarily, sometimes for months, while they wait for a second hearing on 
whether they should be treated. It will allow people to get on the road to 
recovery faster. Utah provides a good model for such a combined hearing at the 
time of commitment.

REP. WALTER TUCKER

<P>
 Re "Rep. Tucker Pleads Not Guilty to U.S. Charges," Aug. 23: I wish public 
officials would cease with their constant accusations of federal prosectors 
being overzealous in their pursuit of high-profile black men. Rep. Walter R. 
Tucker III (D-Compton) cites Marion Barry, O.J. Simpson, Mike Tyson and Michael 
Jackson as examples. Well, Rep. Tucker, what you have here are a convicted 
cocaine user, an indicted double murder suspect, a convicted rapist and a 
suspected child molester, who may have bought himself his innocence.Not one of 
these men has cleared himself in a court of law. (Simpson's case is pending.) 
</P>
<P>
 And look at the high-profile "non-blacks" such as Michael Milken, Robert 
Altman, Willie Nelson and Jim Bakker, all who have been suspected or convicted 
of criminal offenses. I think prosecutors target suspected criminals, not 
people of race.

 Tucker's claim of racism is the height of cynicism. African Americans must 
realize that when their leaders cry wolf they are reducing the claim of racism 
to a meaningless cliche. Claims of racism by public figures now are a mark of 
desperate individuals.

SAFE STREETS ACT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Assemblyman Richard Katz's (D-Sylmar) bill AB 3148, which would take 
away the cars of unlicensed drivers (Aug. 14), I hope everyone is watching this 
to see how good intentions get watered down. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to get a suspended license, you have to get several tickets or a 
drunk driving conviction, and anyone that still drives without a license should 
have his or her car taken away.But for our lawmakers to vote for the bill, it's 
been changed so that the car could only be taken after the scofflaw has been 
stopped twice, and if the person is married it would take three times before a 
vehicle was taken. That's too many chances. 
</P>
<P>
 My son has been hit twice in three years and neither driver had a license or 
insurance. When I was 16 and went to the DMV, my booklet said driving was a 
privilege, not a right. The bill still has to go through two more committees to 
get approved.

 I was furious to read about the air-conditioning breakdowns in a local prison 
and Police Department during this recent heat wave (Aug. 15). I would love to 
have air conditioning so it could break down! I work at a public high school in 
the San Fernando Valley where almost none of the classrooms or offices even 
have air conditioning.From June to September, the students and teachers are 
subjected to temperatures that exceed 100 degrees inside the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The prisoners you wrote about were subjected to 85-degree temperatures for a 
short period of time. This was seen to be a big enough catastrophe to make 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article is a painful reminder of how lowly regarded children are to our 
society and to lawmakers, who allocate the funds for police, jails and schools. 
Schools, children and teachers are clearly on the bottom.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your perceptive editorial of Aug. 1, "Always Let a Thousand Scientific Flowers 
Bloom," brings attention to an immediate crisis.  
</P>
<P>
 The support of science contributes to our welfare through discoveries we 
cannot easily anticipate.As you note, this is best achieved by a multiplicity 
of funding mechanisms. Rep. John Murtha's (D-Pa.) retaliation toward Rep. 
George Brown (D-Colton) wholly overlooks the fact that the Defense Department 
has generally been quite imaginative in the types of long-range basic research 
supported. Loss of this funding not only would result in the drastic reduction 
of overall support, but elimination of some of our finest long-range research. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more devastating is the potential loss of future scientists who will make 
discoveries to save lives and improve our existence. Young people are motivated 
to become scientists because of the contribution that they can make to society, 
but they can only do this if stable support is given to scientists by society. 
When science is reduced to a mostly unsuccessful hunt for research funds, we 
will see a further reduction in interest in science. Our goals to become "best 
in science education by the year 2000" will surely fail if science support 
further withers.

CRACKING DOWN ON ART THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The thought of smuggled plutonium falling into the wrong hands makes the blood 
run cold. Smuggled artworks in the wrong hands -- well, that seems by 
comparison a minor matter.But the unchecked despoiling of an artistic heritage 
can leave wounds that take centuries to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Eastern Europe -- having dismantled the old, totalitarian 
controls and not yet having developed effective new controls -- is suffering a 
wave of art theft as bad as a sack by a barbarian horde. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are the customers for stolen national treasures? Unscrupulous 
international art dealers are ultimately just middlemen. The ultimate consumer 
is typically a museum that buys a fine work "of unknown provenance" in good 
faith or a wealthy private collector who, in good faith or not, does the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectors and other buyers who deliberately ask no questions deserve to be 
regarded as criminals. But what of those who ask questions and are given 
plausible but unverifiable answers? They are now an innocent part of the 
problem. To make them an effective part of the solution calls for the sharing 
of data among not just art museums but also insurance companies, police 
departments and customs offices. 
</P>
<P>
 International standards for art history documentation exist, but they need to 
be both simplified and refined if they are to function as an effective tool in 
so many different hands. Unless and until this step has been taken, the 
assembly of existing databases into a single computerized international shield 
against art theft is impossible.  
</P>
<P>
 By taking this unexciting but indispensable first step, the Art History 
Information Program at the J. Paul Getty Trust is performing a service that may 
yet liberate a few stolen artworks and put a few art thieves behind bars.

WILSON WATCH; DOMESTIC TRANQUILLITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson got well-deserved attention last week when he signed a bill 
permitting school districts to require students to wear uniforms. Wilson hopes 
that uniforms will reduce school violence by preventing students from wearing 
provocative gang colors.In signing the bill, Wilson expressed his faith that 
this relatively minor legal change will make a big difference in the lives of 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 For the same reason we urge Wilson to sign AB 2810, sponsored by Assemblyman 
Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). The bill, now before the governor, would make another 
relatively small change in state law that stands to do much good. Katz's bill 
would create a Domestic Partners Registry, extending certain rights in times of 
crisis, now often denied, to unmarried individuals who share a residence and 
are responsible for each other's living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, hospitals would be required to let partners visit when one is 
gravely ill and surviving partners would be allowed to inherit joint property 
more easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Several cities already permit domestic partners to register; Katz's bill would 
make California the first state to extend such benefits to unmarried couples. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the thousands of couples in California who would be affected are 
heterosexual senior citizens who live together but do not marry in order to 
preserve their Social Security benefits. But because homosexual couples also 
would be allowed to register under this bill, Wilson, in the midst of a nasty 
gubernatorial campaign, may well hesitate. He shouldn't.

BY MOST STANDARDS, AN EPIDEMIC; GUN DEATH TOLL IS THE FOREMOST CHALLENGER TO 
AIDS FOR A GRIM DISTINCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal Centers for Disease Control report that U.S. firearm deaths grew 
more rapidly between 1980 and 1991 than any other category except AIDS. By most 
standards, that would qualify gun violence as an epidemic, generating an 
aggressive, focused and sustained government response. For years few 
legislative remedies were forthcoming. But now, at long last, there are signs 
that the nation's lawmakers are recognizing the scope of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate late Thursday President Clinton won final passage of the crime 
bill and its crucial ban on assault weapons. Progress toward ridding the nation 
of these instruments of quick and easy death has been slow, but every small 
step forward has been worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the explosion in gun violence, which began about 1980, Congress had been 
justifiably criticized for failing to turn back efforts by some legislators to 
kill or delay every major bill that addressed gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
 For a decade, a ban on Teflon-coated bullets signed by President Ronald Reagan 
and a limited ban on imported assault weapons approved by President George Bush 
were the most significant measures to become federal law. Now President Clinton 
successfully has tapped the burgeoning national revulsion against gun violence 
and has had the courage to press the issue on Capitol Hill.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, under Clinton's leadership, Congress passed the Brady bill after a 
seven-year push by its supporters. This welcome measure mandated a five-day 
period between purchase and delivery of handguns so buyers' backgrounds could 
be checked. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics insist the debate over assault weapons is much ado about nothing. They 
argue that semiautomatic firearms make up only a fraction of all gun crimes and 
that targeting them is a waste of time. Tell that to the families of the 
victims in last year's San Francisco law firm massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no conceivable reason or justification for a civilian to possess a 
weapon with the capacity to fire off 30, 60 or even 100 rounds as fast as one 
can pull the trigger. It is that feature, above all others, that makes these 
weapons pernicious and a menace to society -- whether used in 20 murders or in 
one.

IS THIS ANY WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS?; BASEBALL STRIKE: THE OWNERS ARE WILLING TO 
PLAY CHICKEN WITH THE PLAYERS, AT THE EXPENSE OF THE GAME AND FANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD KOPPETT, Leonard Koppett is a columnist for the Alameda Newspaper 
Group in Oakland and surrounding towns. He has covered major league baseball in 
New York and California for 46 years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Man owns fanciest restaurant in town. It's packed at dinner time, the line of 
people waiting to get in stretches around the block. The more he has raised 
prices, the more customers he has attracted. 
</P>
<P>
 He goes into the kitchen and tells the chef and staff: "Start cooking, we've 
got another full house. By the way, as of tomorrow I'm going to cut your pay." 
</P>
<P>
 "In that case," says the chef, his assistants nodding assent, "we ain't gonna 
cook nothin' tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, don't," says the owner. "But I'll get even and teach you a lesson. I'll 
burn down the restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 Silly? 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't that what the baseball club owners will be doing if they let the 
post-season determination of a champion get wiped out for the first time in the 
history of the National League (119 years) and the American League (94 years)? 
</P>
<P>
 But then, we've already seen how they approach their business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come into my restaurant," urges the owner outside his front door. "My cooks 
and waiters are overpaid, greedy, disloyal and selfish bums, but come in and 
enjoy being served by them." 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't that the message ball clubs have been sending the public about their 
players for the last 20 years? 
</P>
<P>
 Our restaurateur, having raised menu prices dramatically in recent years while 
attracting a larger and wealthier clientele, has not neglected to plead 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really must come in and try my delicious meals," he says. "Of course, I 
can't afford to buy fresh vegetables or higher-grade meats because my chef 
won't accept lower pay -- even after I replaced my experienced cooks with 
inexperienced ones -- but come in anyhow." 
</P>
<P>
 His problem, you see, is that the other restaurant down the street has a 
better location, and won't share its profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any business is entitled to a reasonable return on investment," he explains 
to the local restaurant critic who wants to know how come the doors are closed. 
"I paid $100 million for this place, the lease is expensive, food prices have 
gone up, good help is hard to find and a lot of patrons are settling for TV 
dinners at home or pizzas that are delivered. Only by cutting payroll can I 
stay in the black. I'm not trying to get rich, but I'm entitled to stay out of 
the red, no?" 
</P>
<P>
 "But why," asks the critic, "did you decide to pay $100 million for it when 
the man who sold it to you told you and everyone else in the world that he had 
acquired it for $20 million and then lost money every year on his investment? 
Wouldn't you expect to lose money too?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously," says the owner, "you understand nothing about business 
realities." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, with his cooks on strike and no customers, the owner has no 
revenue, so he stops paying the electricity and garbage-collection bills. The 
freezer shuts off and all the food in it rots. The uncollected garbage smells 
up the neighborhood. Since he has laid off his maintenance workers, no one is 
around to mop up when a leaky pipe causes flooding.  
</P>
<P>
 "Since my employees won't work for less," he announces, "and the guy down the 
street won't give me some of his profits, I have only one alternative. I'll 
take down my big sign, move to another city where the authorities will be glad 
to have me, and open my restaurant there." 
</P>
<P>
 He's right. The other city will give him tax breaks and a sweetheart lease to 
occupy an otherwise empty building.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hate the idea," he laments, "of leaving the people in this town without a 
place to eat so that they'll starve to death, but blame it on my stubborn 
cooks." 
</P>
<P>
 Why do I think the abandoned citizens will find some other source of 
nourishment? As they have in Brooklyn, in Washington, in half of Boston, St. 
Louis and Philadelphia and, for a while when necessary, in Milwaukee, Kansas 
City and Seattle? 
</P>
<P>
 Why do I think this restaurant owner is acting irrationally? Because I know 
nothing about business realities.

COLUMN LEFT / BENJAMIN SCHWARZ: THE WORLD ISN'T OURS TO AMERICANIZE; THE 
CLINTON DOCTRINE OF EXPORTING OUR VALUES IS THE WRONG USE OF FOREIGN POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN SCHWARZ, Benjamin Schwarz is a foreign-policy analyst based in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The conviction that America should, in President Clinton's words, help "create 
a just, peaceful and ever-more democratic world" is often embraced as a moral 
imperative; it may in fact lead us to moral disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the political spectrum, many believe that, with the end of the Cold 
War, the United States has the opportunity and the responsibility to create a 
world order shaped by American power and values. In the words of national 
security adviser Anthony Lake, America's foreign-policy imperative is nothing 
less than "the enlargement of the world's community of market democracies." 
This policy requires, in effect, that the United States regard as hostile those 
states that do not subscribe to American economic and political beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats hardly have a monopoly on this Wilsonian enthusiasm. Sen. Richard 
Lugar, the Republican Party's most distinguished foreign-policy spokesman, also 
betrays the dangerous belief that America can be safe and prosperous only when 
it has made the world very much like America. The United States, Lugar asserts, 
must remain the world's dominant power so that it can "project market economies 
and democratic institutions abroad." Embracing the logic that brought us the 
domino theory, Lugar argues that such an effort must be truly global in scope 
since "there can be no lasting security at the center without security at the 
periphery." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who oppose this grandiose vision of America's role in the world often 
argue that exporting American values is not a practical goal of foreign policy, 
which should instead concentrate on the defense of concrete national interests. 
This opposition must go further. There are, in fact, moral hazards in 
attempting to effect a new world order. 
</P>
<P>
 First, to argue, as Lugar does, that only American power and leadership can 
provide a stable and secure international marketplace smacks of economic 
imperialism. And to assert that this capitalist enlargement is, in Lake's 
words, America's "security mission" because "the expansion of market-based 
economics abroad helps expand our exports and create American jobs," is to 
arrogantly conflate what is in America's economic interest with a moral 
imperative to interfere with economies and politics throughout the world. This 
policy of capitalist enlargement can easily appear to its recipients as nothing 
more than a new world order version of old-style interventionism, a crude 
intrusion in their domestic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, America's missionary impulse -- the conviction that it is our 
obligation to inflict our conscience upon the world because there are no 
enlightened alternatives to American ways -- breeds within us an intolerance 
and a narrowness. To believe that Russia or Haiti or Cuba is ours to rescue, or 
to demonize those who do not hold our values is to indulge in a paternalism 
that reduces other peoples to wayward children to be cajoled until they conform 
to our image. This cannot help but engender within us a reckless and cruel 
pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue fantasies are intrinsically insidious. Once we make others the objects 
of our generous wishes, we inevitably make them the objects of our pity, and 
ultimately of our coercion. A sense of righteous omniscience is not the mark of 
a balanced and enlightened state, but of the crusader from whose civilizing 
zeal brutality seems inevitably to flow.  
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has said that America has an obligation "to give back to a 
contentious world some of the lessons we learned during our own democratic 
voyage." But if we seek to teach the world by imposing our achievements on it, 
we have learned the wrong lesson from that journey. In viewing what promises to 
be a tumultuous post-Cold War world, it is important to remember that our 
nation, too, was forged in blood and iron, that our own struggle to build a 
more perfect union and effect democracy has been marked by tragedy, aggression 
and brutality. For better or worse, without these trials we would not be the 
nation we are today. And, despite much of which we may be proud, we have not 
reached our destination. 
</P>
<P>
 If we understood our transgressions as well as our achievements, we would 
perhaps be able to reach a more generous understanding of others. Then, rather 
than seeking to convert other peoples, we could accept them for what their 
history has made them. If this fatalism replaced idealism in our expectations 
of and conduct toward the world, a more respectful and measured outlook could 
supplant our present arrogant and feverish one. 
</P>
<P>
 By pursuing grand visions pleasing to our self-image, we may, like Kurtz in 
Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," set out to civilize the world as "an emissary of 
pity and progress," only to awaken the savage within ourselves.

A NEW CONSTITUENCY THAT COULD ROIL STATE POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Although virtually all political candidates declare the "middle class" to be 
their target constituency, few seem to recognize its changing na ture. Most 
ignored are those seg ments of the middle class who are younger, who work in 
the fastest-growing sectors of the economy -- information, entertainment, 
high-end business services, international trade and design -- or who are 
self-employed. Taken together, these workers and business owners make up a new 
constituency whose interests could significantly alter the political calculus. 
And nowhere is the new constituency more evident than in California, where the 
economy is undergoing fundamental changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the new constituency earn their money from "knowledge work," to use 
Peter F. Drucker's phrase. They work for, or own, smaller and mid-sized 
non-unionized companies that are rapidly growing. Many of these firms rely 
heavily on international connections -- both in terms of trade and suppliers -- 
for their current and future growth. Most important, these companies offer the 
same kind of high-wage job opportunity that once was the hallmark of aerospace 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The new constituency includes the twenty- and thirtysomethings who predominate 
at companies like Kingston Technologies in Orange County or Hollywood's Pacific 
Data Images; the graphic artists, software writers and musicians who work at 
firms like Torrance-based Davidson and Co.; the former Marine who works in the 
highly computerized shipping department at Pairgain in Cerritos; the woman who 
heads research and development at a biomedical firm; the Latina who works on 
the assembly line of a medical-instrument company; the African American who 
runs a management-consulting business, and the Asian American who keeps the 
books at a PC manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Many members of the new constituency are self-employed as consultants or 
specialists. Nearly one in six households in California reports some 
self-employment income, a rate 25% above the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most striking characteristics of the new constituency is its 
racial, ethnic and gender diversity. One recent survey of small, independent 
companies in Los Angeles County revealed that non-whites held one-third of all 
management positions and 40% of the jobs in research and development, 
traditional middle-class occupations. Women were particularly well-represented, 
holding one-third of all management positions and a majority of marketing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The diversity of this new middle class also extends to business ownership. 
Woman-owned companies now account for as many as half of all the region's new 
businesses. Perhaps even more dramatic has been the growth of minority-owned 
firms. Southern California, for example, leads the nation in Latino-, Asian- 
and African American-owned enterprises. Over the past decade alone, the number 
of Latino- and Asian-owned businesses has more than doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 One key and often overlooked fact about the new constituency is that it 
includes a middle class far broader than ever before. Over the past decade, for 
example, the number of Californians with at least one year of college grew by 
71%, but for Latinos, it rose by 138%, and for Asians, by 258%. In 1980, there 
were just 400,000 Asians and Latinos with college experience; today, the number 
approaches 2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Different economic interests make for a different political agenda. Since the 
new constituency is more globally oriented in its economic outlook, it would 
probably not favor government protection from foreign competition. Rather, it 
would demand of politicians that they strive to pry open overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
 As young or prospective parents, members of the new constituency would have a 
keen interest in reversing the decades-long decline in public education. And as 
entrepreneurs of information-based industries dependent on highly skilled 
workers for success, they would have strong reasons to push for reform of the 
state's higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the politics of the new constituency is evolving. It tends to favor the 
kind of deregulatory and lower-tax regime backed by private-sector-oriented 
people, yet it looks to government -- although not necessarily Washington -- to 
correct such problems as crime. The steady exodus of younger families to such 
areas as Irvine, Calabasas and Thousand Oaks, as well as to towns in the 
intermountain hinterland, suggests their appeal as places where governmental 
institutions, notably schools and police, still work reasonably well. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever its politics, the realities of the new constituency are not included 
in the political messages of the two major parties. Consider the gubernatorial 
race in California. When Kathleen Brown talks about the middle class, she has 
in mind the middle class of older, unionized workers at defense plants. Yet, 
across the nation and especially in California, unionization outside of public 
employment has been dropping precipitously, most notably among the young. 
Today, less than 6% of workers aged 18 to 24 are union members, compared with 
nearly twice that percentage 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's quest to restore the "Ozzie and Harriet" California of the 
1950s offers the new constituency no bargain, either. His nativist assaults 
risk alienating Asians and Latinos, whose rates of home ownership, years of 
college education and levels of income are among the fastest growing in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1840s and 1850s, the Whigs continued to cater to their mercantile 
base even as the economy was producing new political players -- the industrial 
classes and small farmers -- who eventually gravitated to the newly formed 
Republican Party. The Whigs were soon out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, California's two major political parties may face a similar fate if 
they continue to ignore the state's new and growing constituency.

THEATER NOTES; THE SHOW WILL GO ON AT PASADENA PLAYHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Don Shirley 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pasadena Playhouse is at least temporarily off the hook, reports its 
owner-manager, Theatre Corp. of America President David Houk. Money is in hand 
to do the next scheduled show at the Playhouse, "The Crimson Thread," and there 
is "no doubt" the current season will go on, with "The Lion in Winter" 
following "Crimson Thread." 
</P>
<P>
 Cash flow problems within Theatre Corp. had forced the company to pull out of 
the Alex Theatre in Glendale and cancel tours of Pasadena and Glendale shows to 
four satellite theaters. Even in Pasadena, the company had to borrow $200,000 
from the city in order to stage "Heartbeats," which closed last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Houk said that single-ticket sales to "Heartbeats" were several times 
higher than single-ticket sales to any of the last three shows, and receipts of 
incoming subscription sales have been comparable to the take in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE OTHER HAND: One of Houk's fellow producers wants him to get out of the 
business. Irv Kimber, executive producer/artistic director of Civic Light Opera 
of South Bay Cities, wrote to Houk that "with theater in general being in the 
rather precarious state that it is in right now, we certainly do not need 
someone 'spooking the herd' by bailing out on subscribers who gave up their 
hard-earned cash on the promise that you would deliver a product. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sooner you finally decide to fold up your tent and steal away into the 
night, the better off we will all be and can begin to repair the phenomenal 
damage you have done to the Southern California theater community." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we've done the damage this guy says we did," Houk responded to 
The Times. "We got the Alex open spectacularly well and delivered three great 
shows." As for his withdrawal from the second season at the Alex after only one 
show had been presented, he noted that "efforts are ongoing" to find substitute 
shows. The first substitute show, "Dreamgirls," was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimber acknowledged to The Times he had no "concrete evidence" that would-be 
subscribers are spooked. His company's next telemarketing campaign hasn't 
begun. But he said it would be "an incredible uphill battle" for a company to 
start a subscription series in Glendale or the other cities abandoned by 
Theatre Corp. Any attempt would have to rely on single-ticket sales until a 
track record was established, he said, adding, "If I were John Q. Public, I'd 
be leery too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SPELVIN UNMASKED: Who is that actor playing the small role of Second Merchant 
in Shakespeare Festival/LA's touring "Comedy of Errors," which closes at 
Descanso Gardens today? He's credited in a program insert "George Spelvin" -- 
the traditional pseudonym for actors who don't use their real names. 
</P>
<P>
 It's none other than Ben Donenberg, the company's artistic director. Donenberg 
couldn't afford to use members of Actors' Equity this summer in "Errors," the 
group's second-string production. But when an actor was in a car accident 
halfway through the run, Donenberg took over the role, though he belongs to 
Equity. "What are they going to do," he remarked, "kick me out of the union for 
keeping my show going?"

MUSIC NOTES; CROWDS ON THE RISE AT THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cariaga, Daniel Cariaga is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unscientific sampling by one longtime observer of audiences at Hollywood 
Bowl recently netted the undocumented opinion that fewer people are attending 
Bowl events this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Au contraire, fires back Stephen Belth, senior director of marketing and 
communications for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the permanent resident 
symphonic ensemble at the Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Belth, the numbers are up in 1994 from those of 1993. In fact, he 
says, when the summer season ends, mid-September, attendance will probably be 
up 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a forecast ," he says, cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the numbers bear him out. Out of 31 public, ticketed events at the 
Bowl -- pre-season, classical, jazz, pop and country concerts -- between June 
28 and Aug. 16, eight were sell-outs at which at least 17,979 people attended. 
And 16 of those 31 events hosted more than 10,000 listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our peak season was 1987," Belth says, "when the total number of 
concert-goers in one summer exceeded all previous single years. There was a 
small decline in the three summers following, then a bounce-back in 1991. After 
the riots of 1992, attendance was down somewhat, but not dramatically." He 
points out that end-of-season total attendance is not computed at the Cahuenga 
Pass amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 More important than these level numbers, according to Belth, is the "greater 
diversity of activities at the Bowl -- we have a wider range of music and 
attractions now than ever before." He cites "Arsenio Hall's One-Thousandth 
Show" at the amphitheater in May, 1993, the now-annual mariachi concerts and, 
for five nights in 1994, a weeklong series of World Cup Soccer-related 
concerts.

 Negotiations between the American Guild of Musical Artists -- the union that 
represents dancers, singers and other performing artists -- and Los Angeles 
Music Center Opera concluded Aug. 1, and struck another blow for parity. 
According to Annalouise Paul, the dancer who represented her colleagues in the 
talks, the new contract represents "significant" advances for dancers, most 
importantly, financial parity with the singers of the LAMCO chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, acknowledges Patricia Mitchell, deputy general director of 
LAMCO, dancers have received less than choristers at American opera companies. 
"Three years ago we addressed this issue in regard to rehearsal pay. Now we 
have done so with per-performance pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Without revealing details, Mitchell and Paul agreed that the new provisions 
equalize payments to LAMCO's dancing and singing ensembles. A few bones of 
contention remain, however: For instance, whether minimally paid 
supernumeraries should continue to carry out staging that might more 
appropriately be entrusted to dancers.

 NOTED: Pianist Andre-Michel Schub was the performer chosen to pick the new 
Steinway piano to be housed at the new California Center for the Arts in 
Escondido, which opens in late September. Schub was assisted in making his 
selection at Steinway Hall in New York City by Robert Freedman, vice president 
of performing arts of the new Center, and by a leading Steinway technician, 
Peter Crosby of the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts. Reports Freedman: 
"Our first consideration, given the size of the hall (1,524 seats), was a rich 
and even sound. We tested seven of the best instruments the Steinway Co. 
offered, and chose one which seemed to promise the most, as it matures in the 
hall." . . . A Ned Rorem tribute concert saluting the veteran American composer 
will be given Sept. 24 at 3 p.m. in Old First Church in San Francisco. Rorem 
himself will introduce the program of some of his chamber music and songs, to 
be performed by members of San Francisco Opera, San Francisco Symphony and the 
San Francisco Saxophone Quartet. . . . American tenor Gary Bachlund will take 
the role of Rudolph Valentino (replacing the originally announced Marcello 
Giordani) in the Dallas Opera premiere of Dominick Argento's "The Dream of 
Valentino," in January, 1995. . . . The archive of American composer and 
pianist David Tudor (b. 1926) has been acquired by the Santa Monica-based Getty 
Center for the History of Art and the Humanities. As a pioneer performer and 
advocate of American experimental music -- he was a longtime associate of John 
Cage, among many others -- Tudor has been for more than half a century in the 
vortex of contemporary musical activity. His archive, most of which has not 
been published, will now be available to scholars and researchers by 
appointment. . . . The annual festival of the American Liszt Society takes 
place this year at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. This year marks 
the 30th anniversary of the Society. Among the participants will be pianists 
Vladimir Leyetchkiss, Philip Thomson, Valerie Tryon and speakers Gerhard 
Winkler, Dezso Legany and Harold C. Schonberg . . . The jury of the 1994 
Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards for best new American orchestral compositions 
has chosen four new works to receive awards at the Center, Oct. 1. The 
composers represented are Leon Kirchner, John Anthony Lennon, Tison Street and 
Jay Alan Yim. The four will receive cash prizes totaling $9,000.*

ON THE RECORD: BRUCKNER REVIVED, GRANDLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert Glass, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the not-so-distant past, echt Bruckner interpretation seemed to be 
predicated on dawdling and on reveling in the composer's gaucheries, above all 
in his thick instrumental textures, his penchant for piling climax on climax 
and his grinding gear-changes -- ending thematic ideas abruptly and beginning 
new ones just as precipitately. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the early 1960s, largely through the recorded interpretations of 
conductor Bernard Haitink and his splendid Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra, 
it became apparent that the composer's textures needn't be uniformly dense or 
his rhythms rigid. The notion began to circulate that Bruckner's grandiose 
visions needn't be tied to trying the listener's patience. 
</P>
<P>
 These thoughts are prompted by a recent outpouring of recorded Bruckner that 
exhibits a variety of interpretive approaches unthinkable in pre-Haitink days, 
the days of Bruckner the presumed monolith. 
</P>
<P>
 A strikingly anti-traditional view comes via a budget-priced Sony "Essential 
Classics" reissue (53519, two CDs) of the 1969 recording by George Szell and 
his Cleveland Orchestra of the Eighth Symphony, the composer's longest and 
perhaps most self-indulgent in terms of stops, starts and brassy, roof-rattling 
climaxes. Szell showed that it could be played faster, with leaner sonority and 
more sharply inflected rhythms than were usually employed, without denying the 
specific Brucknerian grandeur and mysticism. 
</P>
<P>
 A lso included in this package is the Third Symphony, de livered by the same 
artists in similarly low-calorie fashion, in its 1889 edition. (The issue of 
Bruckner editions will otherwise be ignored here, to spare both writer and 
reader the attendant tedium.)  
</P>
<P>
 Some commentators regard it as far removed from the composer's final 
intentions, although Georg Solti hardly enters an eloquent plea for the 1877 
original with his hectic, incessantly loud traversal, roughly played by the 
Chicago Symphony (London 440 316). 
</P>
<P>
 The Third is heard in another reissue from the 1960s, which purports to be of 
the same edition as Szell's but sounds more ungainly in the hands of Kurt 
Sanderling and the Leipzig Gewand-haus Orchestra (Berlin Classics 2151, 
mid-price). 
</P>
<P>
 Octogenarian Gunter Wand, directing the Hamburg NDR Symphony, offers a slowly 
unfolding, massive and sonorous performance of the Ninth Symphony (RCA Victor 
62650) -- not markedly different in approach from the two previous Wand-led 
performances of the Ninth in the RCA catalogue: an extreme example of the 
label's curious repertory multiplications. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it would be unfair to regard Wand as stodgy, there is infinitely more 
color in the Ninth Symphony as presented by Carlo Maria Giulini and the Chicago 
Symphony in a reissue of their 1977 recording (EMI 65177, mid-price), a 
magnificently sensual account of this sublime score, rich in dynamic nuance and 
melodic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 O n the other (Italian) hand, Giulini's Italian compatriot Claudio Abbado has 
shown a decidedly Germanic ponderousness in his recent work. In the Seventh 
Symphony, however -- not with his own Berlin Philharmonic but with the Vienna 
Philharmonic (Deutsche Grammophon 437 518) -- Abbado projects a welcome 
relaxation and lyric expansiveness, particularly suited to one of the 
composer's smoother-textured symphonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The old-time chunky approach is favored by Wolfgang Sawallisch, who leads the 
Philadelphia Orchestra in the Fourth Symphony, a reasonably popular work even 
before the general acceptance of the once-esoteric composer (EMI 55119). 
</P>
<P>
 Sawallisch does nothing here to dispel the damnable portrait of Bruckner as an 
inspired clod, incapable of separating his climactic peaks with contrasting 
lyric valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently arrived too is the mid-priced reissue of the aforementioned 
Haitink-Concertgebouw set of the nine canonic Bruckner symphonies and the early 
work known as "No. 0" (Philips 442 040, nine CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 Much of it remains remarkably fresh, perhaps unsurpassed in its dashing 
energy. The most durable are Nos. 3 (1877 version), 4 and 7, and a Ninth as 
effective in its slender, tightly organized way as Giulini's is in its 
quasi-operatic richness. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two major failures in the set: the Sixth Symphony, hobbled by 
insensitive engineering that obliterates the timpani figurations that define 
the first movement's ferocious rhythmic drive, and an Eighth that barely 
survives the conductor's uncharacteristic lack of organization.*

$50 GUIDE: GLIMPSING DAYS OF FUTURE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Hilburn, Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new Al Green? A new George Jones? A new Neil Young? There are lots of traces 
of old pop greatness in this edition of the guide -- a way to keep up with 
what's exciting in pop on a budget of $50 a month. Shara Nelson reminds you of 
Green at his peak. David Ball reminds you of Jones at his peak. And who reminds 
you of Young at his peak? Why Young himself, of course. July 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds, "Let Love In," Mute/Elektra. If success were 
measured by acclaim alone, the veteran Cave would be a superstar by now. But 
the blank stares from the crowd during his set at the opening Lollapalooza 
concert showed how strictly a cult favorite he remains. Too bad. His music 
combines the naked emotionalism of Leonard Cohen, the theatrical punctuation of 
Tom Waits and the smoldering tension of a Sergio Leone Western. 
</P>
<P>
 Shara Nelson, "What Silence Knows, Chrysalis. We may at last have the answer 
to all the prayers for a singer with the soulful purity and captivating 
character that has largely been missing from the R&B world since Al Green was 
at his creative peak in the '70s. A fine solo debut from the London-born singer 
and writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Penn's "Do Right Man" (Sire/Warner Bros.). If Penn did nothing more than 
co-write such classic, soul-accented tales of romantic obsessions as "The Dark 
End of the Street" and "Do Right Woman, Do Right Man" in the '60s, he'd deserve 
an honored place in pop history. But Penn's singing is also worth attention. He 
can't match Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding, who have recorded his songs, but 
the strain of trying to reach the notes adds to the struggle in the lyrics. 
August 
</P>
<P>
 David Ball, "Thinkin' Problem," Warner Bros. It's a good bet in a blindfold 
test that 99 out of 100 country fans would identify George Jones as the 
vocalist on the hit title track of Ball's first album for Warner Bros. He 
writes most of his own material, exhibiting a keen feel for playful lyric 
twists. Sample line: "I've got a thinkin' problem / She's always on my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Reverend Horton Heat, "Liquor in the Front," Sub Pop/Interscope. If you want 
your country with a bit more of a manic rockabilly aura, try this collection, 
which was produced by Ministry's Al Jourgensen. Think of the music Jerry Lee 
Lewis might have made in the '50s if he had just seen Ministry and the Cramps 
in concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Young, "Sleeps With Angels, Reprise. In a work with the soul-baring 
intimacy of his 1975 classic "Tonight's the Night," Young writes about 
disillusionment and despair with uncanny grace. At times he takes the role of 
the protective parent, offering comfort and support. At other times, he assumes 
the role of someone whose youthful idealism has been shattered. An album of the 
year contender.

RECORD RACK: HURTLING DOWN 'KILLERS' ROAD WITH TRENT REZNOR AT THE WHEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Hilburn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *** 1/2; VARIOUS ARTISTS, "Natural Born Killers," soundtrack ( 
Nothing/Interscope ) 
</P>
<P>
 This has been a career year for Trent Reznor, who exhibits as an artist and 
producer the daring instincts and rich musicality of Prince back in the days 
when his records mattered. Leading Nine Inch Nails, Reznor has already given us 
the best album so far of 1994 ("The Downward Spiral") and a mud-caked Woodstock 
'94 performance as captivating as the legendary Who and Hendrix sets from the 
original Woodstock festival. 
</P>
<P>
 When someone's on this hot a creative streak, you want to monitor his every 
move -- and this soundtrack, from Oliver Stone's movie about murderers becoming 
the ultimate superstars, rewards you with images as anxious and disturbing as 
Reznor's own albums with Nine Inch Nails. 
</P>
<P>
 In this hauntingly seductive work, which includes old tracks by such varied 
acts as Patti Smith, the Cowboy Junkies and Dr. Dre, Reznor -- the producer -- 
weaves music, dialogue and sound bites from the film into a conceptualized 
expression about these restless, explosive times. 
</P>
<P>
 The album's mood moves from the sweet optimism of Patsy Cline's "Back in 
Baby's Arms" to the dark obsession of Leonard Cohen's "Waiting for the Miracle" 
to splices of dialogue as violent as the gunshots that follow them, all 
hurtling at you with the speed of a car racing down the lost highway on a 
final, fatal ride. 
</P>
<P>
 It's harrowing and frightening, mirroring at times the hopelessness of the 
doomed characters in Bruce Springsteen's stark "Nebraska" album, only more 
disturbing because Springsteen's characters seemed the innocent victims of an 
indifferent society. Here, the characters wonder if their destructive ways 
weren't programmed by their genes. "I guess I was born . . . born bad," 
Juliette Lewis, the actress, sings with bittersweet resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reznor's own "Burn" -- which was written for the movie -- defines the 
desperation best: This world rejects me / This world threw me away / This world 
never gave me a chance / This world gonna have to pay . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A soundtrack like no other. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 ***; DINOSAUR JR., "Without a Sound" ( Sire/Reprise ) 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a Look" might be more like it, given the way the Amherst, Mass., 
group's visually lackluster performances on last year's Lollapalooza failed to 
capitalize on the terrific album "Where You Been." J Mascis (who basically is 
Dinosaur Jr.) has a sound -- distorted, Neil Young-ish guitars, uncertain 
vocals and an impressive command of rock dynamics, conveying a sense of 
isolation and psychic implosion, even when his lyrics speak of contentment. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas other contemporary rockers work with anger and Angst , Mascis makes 
art out of passivity. Whether on the typically driving opener, "Feel the Pain," 
or the contrasting, hypnotic meditation of "Seemed Like the Thing to Do," he 
sounds as if he would barely lift a finger to find salvation from his inertia. 
</P>
<P>
 But speaking of fingers, boy, can Mascis' work a guitar. Though not as 
sonically playful as the last album, "Sound" is marked by deceptively 
straightforward layers of overdubs that unfold to reveal a rough, fluid 
facility that is noteworthy in its own right. They also underscore a subtle 
complexity in the songs' emotions, reminiscent of the compatible -- but more 
expansive -- Smashing Pumpkins. The rewards are here, but with Mascis, you have 
to do the work to find them. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 **; AMY GRANT, "House of Love" ( A&M ) 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Grant has all the makings of a legitimate '90s Top 40 queen: With a silky 
voice equally adept in sassily sexy or sweetly spiritual mode and in sensitive 
ballads or unabashed bubblegum, she always conveys a genuineness as 
considerable as her charisma. 
</P>
<P>
 But baby, baby, has she blown it."House," which comes after a string of 
increasingly accomplished albums, is her weakest recording since the late '70s 
-- largely because of computer-programming-happy producers Keith Thomas and 
Michael Omartian, who leave few pop studio cliches unturned. 
</P>
<P>
 For a couple of numbers, it seems deliberate: "Lucky One" and "Say You'll Be 
Mine" fare best, if only because they take the singsongy simplicity of her 1991 
hit "Baby, Baby" to a near-kids'-record extreme. Soon the buoyancy is gone, but 
the banality remains in love songs or generic brotherhood anthems both 
elementary and listless. Lyrically, Grant has strayed beyond contemporary 
Christian music (just one nouveau -age gospel number here), but musically, the 
producers' synth-sap fits too snugly within the subgenre's dull aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
 The standout is an incongruous version of Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow Taxi," 
whose famous refrain -- about not appreciating what you've got till the asphalt 
truck arrives -- could describe how a fan feels hearing Grant's considerable 
gifts being paved over. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 Offspring's "Smash" has been a Southern California smash for some time, 
residing at the upper levels of The Times pop album chart--No. 3 this week. But 
the Orange County band's album is also doing well nationally, climbing into the 
Top 10, at No. 10. This could be the one that cracks the soundtrack barrier at 
the top of the Southern California chart, where "The Lion King" and "Forrest 
Gump" have been 1-2 for weeks. Neil Young's album "Sleeps With Angels," which 
is getting rave reviews, is off to a fast start with fans too, debuting at No. 
5 on the Southern California pop chart. TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,38,11 Title, Artist

 Hot Long Beach rapper Warren G is lined up to produce a track for 
rap-basketball giant Shaquille O'Neal's next album, which is due in early 
November -- right as the NBA season starts. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Soul Asylum is recording a new song, "Live to Tell," for the soundtrack to the 
independent film "Clerks," which also features songs by Jesus Lizard, Ned's 
Atomic Dustbin and Corrosion of Conformity. Then in October, Dave Pirner and 
crew will start work on their next full album with producer Butch Vig. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Red-hot R. Kelly is featured on the soundtrack for the December movie "Lowdown 
Dirty Shame," starring Keenen Ivory Wayans. Also on the album are songs by 
Silk, Tevin Campbell and Kelly's protege Aaliyah. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Eazy-E is pushing back the release of his "Str.8 Off the Streetz of . . . 
Compton, Vol. 1 and 2" CDs so that he can concentrate on his role as executive 
producer for the first full album by Bone Thugs 'N Harmony, the rap group whose 
debut EP, "Creepin' On ah Come Up," is one of the fastest-rising new pop 
releases. The album is expected in early '95. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When James was recording its "Laid" album last year, producer Brian Eno 
suggested that the band relieve tension by recording some casual, off-kilter 
extra material for a possible second album. They did, and the album, "Wah Wah," 
is due Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The Go-Go's have reunited again, to record new songs to include on a 
greatest-hits album. The tracks, produced by former Smiths producer John 
Porter, will be part of the two-CD, 40-song "Beyond the Valley of the Go-Go's" 
collection, which will also include some of the group's rare early singles. 
There's also talk of some live dates. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 L.A.'s punk-oriented Epitaph Records has signed Wayne Kramer, guitarist of the 
proto-punk Detroit band MC5. Guests on his upcoming album include Bad Religion 
guitarist (and Epitaph owner) Brett Gurewitz and Circle Jerks singer Keith 
Morris. Henry Rollins wrote the liner notes. . . .

POP EYE: ROBBIE ROBERTSON GOES NATIVE . . . AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 African Burundi drummers . . . Irish harpists . . . Spanish monks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds from just about every nook of the globe have been brought to us as the 
world music boom continues. 
</P>
<P>
 So what exotic locale will yield the next discovery? 
</P>
<P>
 Try our own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Four major labels currently have projects built around music of Native 
Americans, the most visible being Robbie Robertson's upcoming soundtrack for a 
TBS television documentary series. The six-hour series, "The Native Americans," 
premieres on Oct. 10, with a single disc album due Oct. 4 from Capitol Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson, the former songwriter and guitarist of the Band, is half Mohawk, 
and had long hoped for a project in which he could explore the music of 
indigenous Americans, both traditional and modern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told (Capitol president) Gary Gersh that I was going to do an album of 
Native American music, and Gary said, 'I think it's time,' " Robertson says. 
"This is one of those records with something that everybody needs to have. It 
addresses that kind of thing emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson enlisted a number of musicians from all over North America, hoping 
to show the wide variety of styles and approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those he called is Kashtin, a duo from North Quebec that is now on 
Sony's TriStar label after selling 350,000 albums in Canada as an independent 
act. It has a new album due in November.  
</P>
<P>
 Other acts tabbed by major labels include A&M's Songcatchers, a multicultural 
outfit based in Washington that combines native drumming and jazz-fusion pop 
(with the Neville Brothers' Charles Neville on saxophone) and Warner Bros. 
Nashville singer-songwriter Bill Miller.  
</P>
<P>
 Howie Gabriel, vice president and general manager of TriStar Music, notes that 
Kashtin became popular in Canada even though the group sings in its native Innu 
language, which is spoken by only 10,000 people in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some thoughts about them singing in English, but we want to keep 
it as authentic as possible," Gabriel says of the duo's style, which 
incorporates traditional music into a mix of country, folk and rock. 
</P>
<P>
 But will this be subject to New Age fad-dom, like chanting monks? 
</P>
<P>
 "The crystal-New Age generation finds it mystical and romantic to identify 
with indigenous people and music, and there's a danger there," says Vernon 
Bellecourt, president of the National Coalition of Racism in Sports and the 
Media, which initiated protests against the Atlanta Braves fans' "tomahawk 
chop" and other misuses of Native American symbology. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we hope that this will give a chance for people to hear our traditional 
music and our contemporary music," he says. "It's fresh and exciting and 
hopefully we'll get the American people's attention so they'll want to look 
more closely at our culture." Steve Hochman

 *** David Ball, "Thinkin' Problem," Warner Bros. Ball's debut album recalls 
the golden age of honky-tonk, focusing almost exclusively on the ghosts of 
busted relationships and the accompanying feelings of all-consuming failure.His 
wondrous voice at times echoes past greats more than it creates its own stamp, 
but Ball's willingness to forge his own path is unmistakable.

 *** Jeffrey Gaines, "Somewhat Slightly Dazed," Chrysalis/EMI. The delicious 
power-pop bounce that reverberates through this album is not what you'd expect 
from a musician whose debut was a serene, largely acoustic affair.But the 
Philadelphia singer-songwriter defies expectations by drawing from Elvis 
Costello and the Bangles as deftly as he once evoked the guitar-strumming, 
protest-singing troubadours of the previous generation, with equally pleasing 
results.

 ** Crosby, Stills & Nash, "After the Storm," Atlantic. After a storm, 
everything's either fresh and lush or just plain soggy.Though this is just the 
trio's sixth studio album in 25 years, CSN might well have spent a bit more 
time toweling off before stepping back into the studio. The love songs are 
generally less drippy than the weighty social commentary.

 *** Edie Brickell, "Picture Perfect Morning," Geffen. Never mind Michael and 
Lisa Marie -- here's Brickell with hubby Paul Simon, whose versatile production 
puts several new spins on Brickell's airy voice and bohemian songs.Most 
surprising are a few pleasant forays into classic soul ballad territory, with 
perhaps the ultimate odd coupling on "Good Times," a silky number with a guest 
appearance by basso romantico Barry White.

 ** 1/2 BLACKstreet, "BLACKstreet," Interscope. Group founder Teddy Riley is 
still regarded as one of hip-hop's innovative young honchos.However, no tracks 
here really equal past hits he produced for Guy, Bobby Brown and Keith Sweat. 
Songs such as "Baby Be Mine" and "Booti Calls" are irrepressibly funky, but 
their casually cynical attitudes toward sex are questionable.

 COURTNEY CONTINUED: Speaking of Love on-line, the singer, whose messages have 
frequently been deleted by America Online monitors due to profane or 
inflammatory language, was understandably outraged when a note from a service 
user making lewd remarks about Love's daughter was allowed to remain on the 
service for more than a week before being deleted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's clearly a violation of our terms-of-service agreement," says AOL 
spokeswoman Pam McGraw of the lewd note. "But we have thousands of message 
areas and each is monitored by its own staff." Steve Hochman

 WIN SOME, LOSE SOME: The L.A. House of Blues has apparently scored a big coup 
with word that the club will host Eric Clapton in a rare, intimate appearance 
for three or four nights in mid-November. Clapton's spokeswoman was unable to 
confirm the booking, but sources at the club and in the concert promotion 
industry say that the shows will be part of a brief U.S. club tour Clapton will 
do before mounting a full series of arena shows (including a Nov. 3 stop at the 
Forum). 
</P>
<P>
 On the down side, the House of Blues seems to have lost a chance at a special 
show by Steely Dan when it botched the dinner reservation of the band's 
management at the recent Boz Scaggs show. Sources at the club say that HK 
Management, which also handles Scaggs, withdrew an offer for a Steely Dan 
appearance after the incident. An HK spokeswoman says that the idea of a Steely 
Dan booking had never gone beyond mere conversation, and that the company is 
planning future bookings at the House of Blues for other clients, including 
Michael McDonald in December. Steve Hochman

 ICE HOT: Ice Cube didn't get a summer vacation -- and he might not get a break 
until next summer. Not only did he just finish work as writer and star of the 
film comedy "Friday," but he also put together the soundtrack album, with an 
impressive roster of contributors including himself, his former N.W.A. partner 
Dr. Dre and Prince.And as a bonus, old school funksters George Clinton and 
Bootsy Collins reunited for one track. 
</P>
<P>
 With the movie out of the way, Cube will focus on his own next album, 
"Bootlegs and B Sides," due in late November. As the title indicates, it's a 
collection of rarities and remixes. When that's out, Cube plans to start work 
on his eagerly awaited collaboration with Dre, tentatively billed as Helter 
Skelter. Look for that one in late spring at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in addition to executive producing the new album by Da Lench Mob, 
"The Planet of the Apes" -- which is coming at the end of October -- he's a 
guest rapper on the record too. That trio, which just moved from Atlantic's 
EastWest to independent Priority, now features a new member, Maulkie replacing 
J.D., who's in jail on charges related to a shooting death in June of last 
year. charge. Dennis Hunt

 AND ONE MORE THING: 4AD Records has signed Kendra Smith -- she's the one who 
was replaced by Hope Sandoval in Opal, which became Mazzy Star.But the original 
Dream Syndicate bassist comes with a few interesting qualities. For one thing, 
she lives in an isolated Northern California area with no electricity or 
running water, so she's very hard to reach. And she's said that she'll only 
tour if she's allowed to take her goat with her so she can have fresh goat's 
milk every day on the road. Well, performers have toured with their dogs before

 THE ENVELOPE, PLEASE: Can MTV possibly top its recent Video Music Awards shows 
with this year's event? Some highlights from last year: Neil Young's rousing 
appearance with Pearl Jam, sexy stagings by Madonna and Janet Jackson, Eddie 
Vedder's mumbling questioning of the value of the awards and (offstage) L.A. 
police unsuccessfully trying to arrest Snoop Doggy Dogg on a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 What about this year? Will top performers the Rolling Stones go head to head 
with Aerosmith in a battle of the archetypal rock 'n' roll bands of their 
generations? "We've got a couple of surprises up our sleeve," MTV senior vice 
president of programming Doug Herzog says of the Sept. 8 telecast from New 
York's Radio City Music Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone, he says, will be set by host Roseanne, who promises to be a lot more 
on the edge than last year's genial but wooden Christian Slater. Other musical 
guests include veteran Tom Petty and youngsters Green Day, Smashing Pumpkins 
and Snoop Doggy Dogg.  
</P>
<P>
 One rumor is that Courtney Love will provide some never-before-aired home 
videos of her late husband Kurt Cobain with their daughter Frances Bean. Love 
herself brought up the possibility in a recent note she posted on the America 
Online computer service.  
</P>
<P>
 "I could not confirm anything like that," Herzog says. "Nirvana's been 
nominated for several awards . . . and hopefully Nirvana will have a presence 
at the show." Steve Hochman

PRIVATE LIVES; VIDEO GAMES; VESTING NEW INTEREST IN INTERACTIVITY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tired of only being able to see and hear home video games? 
</P>
<P>
 The Interactor, a new prod uct from Aura Systems that game players can wear as 
a vest, will help them feel some of the action as well.Using technology that 
the El Segundo-based company originally developed for military uses, the 
lightweight plastic vest converts bass sounds into vibrations that enable 
players to feel such bass-heavy vid-game staples as punches, kicks and laser 
blasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interactor is the first feeling-simulation vest to work in this way, and 
the effect is a bit like having a thumping car stereo speaker inside your rib 
cage. It doesn't create a very convincing virtual reality, but it adds an 
urgency and energy to such Nintendo games as NBA Jam.  
</P>
<P>
 Dribbles and rebounds pound as they would on a real gym floor, and the crowd's 
roar almost seems to come from inside the player. Explosions that seem to come 
from within make Total Carnage much more engaging, though the vest did little 
for a Nintendo billiards game. 
</P>
<P>
 The vest lets users feel the amount of sound they want at the "volume" they 
want, and it can be plugged into the audio output of any video game system. To 
add that extra kick to a Dr. Dre or Nine Inch Nails album, it can also hook up 
to a stereo with audio output. 
</P>
<P>
 The vest, which is scheduled to be in the stores by Sept. 5, will retail for 
about $80.* Robert Levine

PRIVATE LIVES; PREPARE FOR TAKEOFF . . . ; SANTA MONICA'S MUSEUM OF FLYING 
CATERS TO CHILDREN WITH NEW INTERACTIVE AREA AND THEIR PARENTS WITH DINING 
DEAL.

 It's the plane truth. Kids are fascinated by aircraft. From paper planes and 
balsa wood gliders to radio-controlled models and jets that thunder overhead, 
if it has wings, it'll fly with children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Museum of Flying in Santa Monica knows that. It displays actual aircraft, 
such as the Bell P-39 and the Douglas DC-3, and more than 120 wood and metal 
production models of concept planes. Video stations show footage of historic 
planes in action. Aviation films are screened in the museum's theater. Hangar 
doors yawn to reveal planes taking off and landing on a runway of Santa Monica 
Airport, where the museum is located. 
</P>
<P>
 But no kid wants to just stand around and look at a plane, even if it is an 
actual YAK 3. The museum knows that too. In May, it opened Airventure, an 
8,000-square-foot children's interactive area, to introduce kids to the 
fundamentals of designing, building and flying aircraft. It's also a good way 
to teach them some math and science too.  
</P>
<P>
 But parents don't have to tell them that. 
</P>
<P>
 The interactive area has videos, model-building stations and actual cockpits 
that children can climb into. There are sophisticated flight simulators, in the 
form of a Fokker DR-1 and a Sopwith Camel. 
</P>
<P>
 W hen kids get in the cock pits, they see computer- generated images before 
them, which respond as they work the plane's controls. They can just take the 
plane up for a simulated spin -- or engage in a dogfight with another flyer. 
(That should be a snap for video-game-playing children. For their parents? More 
of a challenge, perhaps.) 
</P>
<P>
 On the weekends, the museum has hands-on workshops, which are held in the 
museum's specially built miniature hangar. The workshops range from 15 to 45 
minutes, are generally geared for children as young as 5, and are free with 
museum admission. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, for example, "Learning to Preflight" explains how a pilot prepares an 
aircraft for takeoff. The workshop is at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Also today, at noon, is "Beginner Glider Building." Children learn the 
difference between a glider and an airplane, compare the parts and construct a 
paper and a balsa glider. It's one of the museum's most popular workshops, said 
Pamela Hall, director of children's education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children learn the basics of construction, make a plane and become the 
pilot," she said. "And they're good pilots. They're willing to experiment with 
a design or take a risk to make it fly better or faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents -- and other adults -- are welcome in the workshops, Hall said. 
"Beginner Glider Building" will also be held Saturday and next Sunday, both at 
1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the museum is putting on special programs about aviation pioneer 
and helicopter designer Igor Sikorsky, and that includes children's workshops 
on helicopter design and operation.  
</P>
<P>
 N ext weekend, "How Do Heli copters Take Off?" explores aerodynamics, the 
airfoil, Newton's Third Law of Motion and cyclic pitch -- all in language 
children can grasp. (Actually, parents could probably benefit from a simplified 
explanation of this stuff too.)  
</P>
<P>
 Kids also create mini-rotor paper aircraft to test fly. That workshop, for 
children 6 and older, meets at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in September, the museum presents weekend workshops where kids can make 
and test-fly paper helicopters and experiment with packing and dropping 
mini-parachutes. Contact the museum for details. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights, DC3, a restaurant adjacent to the 
museum, has a special deal for families. Parents with dinner reservations for 
6, 6:30 or 7 p.m. can have a quiet meal alone while their children, in the care 
of a certified child-care service, dine on pizza, salad and dessert at DC3 and 
then adjourn to the museum to play on the simulators, make paper airplanes and 
watch videos. There is no additional charge for the child care.  
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant asks that parents make their reservations no later than 2 p.m. 
on the day they want to dine, so it can tell the service how many children to 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9 p.m., parents reclaim their kids, and it's happy landings for everyone.*

'TOMMY' OUT OF TUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having lived most of my life in New York and Boston, and as a 10-year resident 
of Los Angeles, I have felt starved for good theater during my time here. This 
rang ever so true this past week when, after seeing the ad in last Sunday's 
Times for all remaining seats to "Tommy" at the Universal Amphitheatre for half 
price, I decided to take my wife Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 A major Broadway musical at the Universal Amphitheatre? Well, for half price, 
what can be so bad? Everything! Parking one mile from the theater for $6. The 
box office? What a joke! A rude clerk telling us there are half-price tickets 
for certain shows only. The advertised prices all carried surcharges because 
all sales were done through Ticketmaster. We purchased balcony seats advertised 
at $14 for $17.50; the Friday-night performance was empty, between 500 and 800 
in a 6,000-plus arena, hence we sat in the best seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Any seating, other than direct center, was distorted because this is a concert 
amphitheater, not a stage theater. The sound was also bad; the special effects 
sometimes distorted the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, and the performers seemed good, but lackluster in this awful excuse 
for a theater, and how strong can performances be playing to empty seats?

FORD'S FEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like millions of other moviegoers, I have long admired and enjoyed the 
performances of Harrison Ford in films that run the gamut from the silly to the 
challenging to the thrilling. I've always felt that he was giving his audience 
full value for their money, at least until I read Bruce Newman's eye-opening 
interview ("Danger Is His Business," Aug. 14) and learned that Ford has been 
holding out on us.Ford in person manages feats I would gladly pay $6 to see in 
a film. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, Newman tells us that in person "when (Ford) is provoked -- or afraid 
-- his brow descends like the cornice of a great mountain, and his eyes form 
blue lakes at the foot of this undulant granite mass." Wow! Sounds rather like 
a description of Yosemite Valley in mid-spring! In movies he just looks like a 
guy. Then there's his "unscripted" speech: "When the words come, they seem to 
erupt from him like magma that has been churning just below the surface." Boy, 
I wish he'd talk like that in the movies. It sounds like it's a lot more 
exciting than his usual naturalism that merely sounds like his character is 
expressing his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the greatest achievement of all comes near the end of the article, when, 
during a silence, Newman witnesses this astonishing stunt: "Ford's eyebrows 
slowly begin to knit themselves together." I would love to see them do that on 
a big screen! Jim Carrey needs ILM to pull off that sort of thing!

ART AND POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The Art of Politics and Just Plain Art" (Aug. 7), art critic Christopher 
Knight subscribes to the absurd notion that in order to make art, artists 
"must" dispense with the convention of middle-class morality. It is true some 
artists defy convention, but where is it written in stone that to qualify as an 
artist, the artist "must" dispense with conventions? Nowhere .This is only one 
interpretation of art which poseur radicals and pseudo-intellectuals like 
Knight subscribe to, preferring art to be used as a political battering ram. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet with one swoop, Knight delegitimizes many of the finest artists in 
history. Towering works of many great masters had no ax to grind -- moral, 
political or otherwise -- contrary to Knight's contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Portraits, still-lifes, the idealized beauty of face, form, landscape and 
imaginative impressions captured by the talent and technique of the artist 
exist sui generis . They put the lie to Knight's rhetoric, which pretends to 
have superior knowledge of what art "must" be.

GUMP GRUMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Forrest Gump's Proud Dad" (Aug. 7), "Gump Happens," the current ad 
line for "Forrest Gump," pretty much sums up my own opinion of the film, and I 
have no desire to step in it again -- especially not the sequel referred to in 
Robert Epstein's Film Clips Q&A with Gump author Winston Groom. 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, I have no desire to read the book upon which the film is 
based, nor do I wish to hear Mr. Groom reading it.Furthermore, if there are any 
Gump T-shirts and baseball caps anticipated, count me out on those as well. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 I read "Forrest Gump's Proud Dad" with some concern. I'm sure the movie is as 
good as everyone is saying, but the nagging parallels to the book/movie "Being 
There" unsettle me. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I read about Paramount's brainstorm: Put out a quickie book of aphorisms 
called "Gumpisms: The Wit and Wisdom of Forrest Gump." This is too much! 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't anyone remember a pamphlet that author/screenwriter Jerzy Kosinski 
issued to commemorate "Being There"? Probably not. It was called the 
"Quotations of Chauncey Gardiner,"illustrating the witty aphorisms of Chance, 
who (as the pamphlet states) has actually gone on to become President of the 
U.S.!

SAWYER'S SALARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Does Diane Sawyer Deserve It?" (Aug. 7), the point is not whether 
Sawyer is worth $7 million.The point is that her salary will be taken out of 
ABC's operating budget and they'll make up for it by cutting jobs and 
underreporting the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, it is all of us who pay the salaries of media personalities. We'll 
pay dearly for this one.

NORTHRIDGE FALLS TO VENEZUELA, 4-3; BASEBALL: THREE-HOUR RAIN DELAY DOESN'T 
DETER SOUTH AMERICAN TEAM IN FINAL GAME OF LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Venezuela ended the United States' two-year run as Little League champion, 
beating the California team whose city was ravaged by an earthquake seven 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezuela came back after a three-hour rain delay Saturday and defeated 
Northridge, 4-3, to become the first Latin American team to win the title since 
1958. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was scoreless in the third inning when rain, hail and lightning 
stopped play. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm left 18 inches of water in the outfield and when the game resumed 3 
hours 5 minutes later, it was 7:20 p.m. EDT and ABC had cut away from its 
telecast in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge pitcher Justin Gentile, whose palm ball worked well before the 
break, and Venezuela pitcher Cesar Hidalgo each were in control when the severe 
weather hit. But after the game resumed, Gentile threw five wild pitches and 
gave up seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile had a 3-2 count on Effinson Mora with two out in the top of the third 
when the storm came. After the delay and after a foul tip, Mora doubled to 
right field, where more than a foot of water had stood only two hours earlier. 
Mora took third when the next pitch sailed over catcher Matthew Cunningham's 
head and scored two pitches later on Esteban Avila's single to right. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venezuelans picked up another run in the fourth when Guillermo Quiroz 
reached on an error, moved to second on Hidalgo's single and scored two wild 
pitches later. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge tied the game at 2-2 in the bottom of the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathew Fisher walked, then Matthew Cassel and Peter Tuber singled to load the 
bases. Michael Frost's grounder to second forced Tuber at second, but Mora's 
throw to first for the double play was off the mark and let Cassel score behind 
Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Venezuela fifth, Elio Perez singled to right, moved to second on a wild 
pitch and scored the go-ahead run on Avila's second run-scoring single. Avila 
himself scored -- on a wild pitch -- after Erik Villalobos walked and Hildago 
singled. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Gordon hit his second home run of the Series in the bottom of the 
fifth, dropping the ball just over Avila's glove in center field. Gordon's 
three-run homer in Thursday's semifinal put Northridge in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassel, Tuber and Frost went in order in the sixth to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge was attempting to become the third California team in a row to win 
a World Series title. Long Beach won the last two. 
</P>
<P>
 Little League's Latin American region hadn't won a World Series championship 
since Monterrey, Mexico, won consecutive titles in 1957 and 1958. U.S. teams 
hadn't won three consecutive titles since they won eight in a row after 
Monterrey's last title. 
</P>
<P>
 The game marked Venezuela's first appearance in a championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Three California teams -- El Cajon, San Jose and Granada Hills -- won 
consecutive championships from 1961-63. Pennsylvania, with titles in the first 
two World Series, 1947 and 1948, is the only other state with titles in 
consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrents of rain, then hail, inundated Lamade Stadium for 30 minutes. Fire 
station pumpers had water off the field in another hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service at Williamsport recorded three-quarters of an 
inch of rain within 25 minutes -- a rate of nearly two inches per hour -- and 
hail up to half an inch in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightning became so vivid that the public address announcer warned fans not to 
take shelter beneath the outfield scoreboard or stand too close to the 60-foot 
flagpole past the right field fence.

RACING WITH DEATH; FOR THE DRIVERS, PERIL LIES JUST AROUND A CORNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Speed is their drug, racing provides the rush. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential peril that lies around every corner is pushed to the far reaches 
of the mind, eclipsed by the desire to push the pedal to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Race car drivers muster all their daring and verve to seek out The Edge -- 
that narrow line of propelling a car as fast as it can go without flying off 
the track. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only thing we know. It's what we do for a living. It's a must," said 
NASCAR star Rusty Wallace, his voice unwavering, his conviction firm. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, that resolve is tested when a member of their fraternity 
goes over the edge. Speed is uncaring, unforgiving, indiscriminate. It can kill 
the best, like Formula One star Ayrton Senna. It can kill those far from the 
pinnacle of the sport, like stock car rookie Rodney Orr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I wake up, and I do a lot times in the middle of the night with bad 
dreams happening, I'm always totally out of control," said Mario Andretti, who 
has seen friends die but survived to the point where he's only four races away 
from retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something happens and there's nothing I can do about it. That's the part that 
frightens me more than anything. Ayrton Senna was the best in the world, but 
there was nothing he could do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Andretti has no thoughts of cutting short the final year of his racing 
career, even with all the tragedy that has rocked the sport in the last 16 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the nature of the beast," he said. "We're trying to tame a demon, if 
you will. The race car can be a very lethal weapon. But that's all part of the 
excitement, part of the lure that gets us going. If this thing was a piece of 
cake where anybody could do it, we wouldn't be interested. We'd be in 
accounting or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Formula One lost two drivers -- including Senna, its brightest star -- during 
one terrible weekend in May. Four Winston Cup drivers have died since April 
1993 -- including two who perished in aviation accidents while flying to race 
tracks. And another top star, Ernie Irvan, was seriously injured last weekend 
in Michigan, his brain damaged, his best hope being a slow, painful recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my people, my wife, my team," NASCAR's Geoff Bodine said, "if 
something happens to me like it did to Ernie, go on, find somebody else and go 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody has a factory and a guy dies of a heart attack, they don't close 
the factory. If you have a football team and your quarterback is Joe Montana, 
and Joe Montana breaks his leg, you go on and play the game. It's not barbaric. 
It's just the way it needs to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love the sport most of the time. Sometimes we hate it. I hated it (the day 
Irvan was hurt). It's a love-hate thing most of the time. But you have to go 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Andretti clan understands that. Mario's oldest son, Michael, had a close 
call Wednesday when his Indy-car slammed into the wall during testing at 
Nazareth Speedway, sending him to the hospital with a concussion. It was one of 
those hate days that Bodine spoke about. But soon, they'll be back to loving 
it, just as Mario and another son, Jeff, couldn't resist the lure of speed 
after suffering serious injuries in the 1993 Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy," said Wallace, who went on to finish fourth in the Winston Cup 
race that Bodine won -- just a day after Irvan was critically injured in 
practice when he cut a tire and veered into a concrete wall at more than 170 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was on my mind the whole time," Wallace said. "I drove three or four laps 
thinking about it. I would come to turn two and see that mark on the wall where 
he hit and I would think about it. I wish on Saturday night they had painted 
that wall so we didn't have to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wallace never considered not racing. And if history is any indication, 
Irvan eventually will point his recovery toward one goal: getting back behind 
the wheel of the race car that nearly took his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Neil Bonnett, whose career appeared to be over after a 1990 crash left 
him with amnesia. He didn't race for more than three years, but never lost hope 
of returning. He was plotting a comeback this year when he lost control of his 
car during a practice session at Daytona and plowed into the wall. In a matter 
of seconds, he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even think about it," said Wallace, discussing the specter of danger 
over the roar of the engines in Team Penske's North Carolina garage. "I work as 
hard as I possibly can to take it out of my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti doesn't regard racing as being any more dangerous than other sports 
where speed or contact play an integral role. Athletes die on the football 
field, in the boxing ring, on the ski slope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be watching a football game and a guy will land on his head and it's 
like, 'Oh my God, how close did he come to breaking his neck?"' Andretti said. 
"There's no worse injury than that. I think death would be better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Six deaths notwithstanding, Wallace insists the perils of racing have been 
exaggerated. He has walked away from two horrible crashes, further emboldening 
his belief that his car -- and himself -- are nearly indestructible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger is nothing like people think it is," he said. "We're talking about 
a couple of accidents happening. I don't know how other teams have their 
cockpits fixed . . . but I know how I do my stuff. I feel confident in the way 
we do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Irvan crash prompted everyone -- Wallace included -- to take 
a second look at how they were doing things. The Penske car builders already 
have asked "if there's anything they can do to make it safer," Wallace said. 
"They talked about padding the car more and more so you can take a wild wreck 
and still walk away." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan's crash hasn't brought the kind of protests in Winston Cup that followed 
Senna's death in Formula One, where spooked drivers suddenly realized if the 
best in the world could die, they certainly could, too. Tracks were redesigned 
to slow speeds. Cars were altered to provide more protection around the 
driver's head. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerhard Berger, the Austrian who drives for Ferrari on the Formula One 
circuit, lost one of his closest friends when Senna died. A day earlier, fellow 
Austrian Roland Ratzenberger was killed while practicing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the pit, watching the TV monitor, when Roland went off," Berger told 
Nigel Roebuck of Autosport. "I could see them working on his heart and I knew 
the guy was dead. I was completely shocked and when I got to the motor home I 
was shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the moment when I said, "Think about this. You've had some success, 
and you've made good money out of it. For the rest of your life, you can have a 
smaller risk of hurting yourself. Maybe now is the time to stop.' 
</P>
<P>
 "For 10 minutes, I sat there and then I concluded, no, I still love to drive 
racing cars, even if there is a risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Max Mosley, president of the International Automobile Federation that 
sanctions F-1, would have expected nothing less. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you said to a racing driver, 'There in front of you are two cars. One of 
them is very dangerous, one of them is very safe, but the dangerous one is 5 
seconds lap quicker than the safe one, they would all without exception get 
into the dangerous one," Mosley said. "You cannot expect racing drivers to be 
primarily interested in safety. That is the job of the people who run the 
races." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately," Andretti said, "we don't react fast enough. We usually react 
after the fact. That's always been one of my complaints as far as doing certain 
things in racing. Why do you do it now? Why didn't you do it before?" 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti continues to push oval tracks to install "energy-absorbing walls" -- 
the kind of walls that may have lessened Irvan's injuries, or kept Bonnett and 
Orr alive when they crashed three days apart while practicing for the Daytona 
500. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to come," Andretti said, "but it's not going to come soon 
enough. We'll just have to suffer through it." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Senna crash is still under investigation, the book already has been 
closed on Irvan's wreck. NASCAR took one day to rule that Irvan's car 
apparently ran over something on the track that punctured the right front tire. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the other drivers know what happened to Irvan. The cause of both the 
Bonnett and Orr wrecks is still listed as "inconclusive," said NASCAR spokesman 
Kevin Triplett, who defended the organization's investigative procedures in the 
wake of a newspaper report that found only one fatal crash out of eight in the 
past two decades had been thoroughly probed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a thousand elements involved in any crash," Triplett said. "Every 
human reacts differently, so you've got another thousand elements involved. 
It's just impossible to reconstruct what occurred first and in what order." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace seems fully satisfied with NASCAR's process for investigating wrecks. 
He believes the major problem in Winston Cup is the re-emergence of Hoosier 
Tires on a circuit that once was the exclusive domain of Goodyear. Competition 
between the two companies, he fears, can only lead to faster -- and less 
reliable -- tires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the tire war sucks," he said. "The drivers would not have to worry 
about being outrun by faster tires if we all had equal tires. . . . The 
competition should come down to having a little stronger engines, building your 
body a little better than the next guy. Instead, we've got to compete with the 
compounds on the other tires. The cars have gotten so quick it's unbelievable, 
but to be in the sport you have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace is still bitter about the death of Bonnett, who took his final ride on 
two pairs of Hoosiers. "That will never leave my mind," he said. "Deep in my 
heart, I think the tire thing had a lot to do with that. If there hadn't been a 
tire war, that wouldn't have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoosier insists its tire is safe. Besides, Irvan was on Goodyears when he 
crashed, although there was no evidence that the tire failed. There also was no 
evidence that Bonnett died because he was using Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the drivers continue to test the limits of speed. And some will 
die -- no matter how many steps are taken to make the sport safer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may sound cold, but I always say it's like going to work and seeing a 
neighbor in a car accident," Andretti said. "It doesn't mean you're going to 
walk to work the next day. You keep going and hope it doesn't happen to you."

TENNIS / JERRY CROWE; CHANG HAS NOT ABANDONED HIS QUEST FOR ANOTHER MAJOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than five years have passed since Michael Chang won the French Open in 
1989, becoming the youngest male winner of a Grand Slam tournament at 17 years 
3 months. 
</P>
<P>
 And although he has won 16 tournaments since, Chang has not seriously 
challenged for a second Grand Slam title, advancing as far as the semifinals 
only once. 
</P>
<P>
 His career has continued to flourish -- this year alone he has won five 
tournaments and earned more than $800,000 in prize money -- but Chang said that 
he will not consider it a complete success if he never again wins one of the 
sport's four major events. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason being is that, I feel that at this particular time, I'm a much 
better player than I was when I was 17 years old," said Chang, who is seeded 
sixth at the U.S. Open, which starts Monday in New York. "Although the game has 
gotten better, I think that I'm still able to go out and compete against the 
big boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's been difficult as far as Grand Slam events, I'm able to get through 
the early rounds and win a couple of big matches, but I haven't been able to 
put together a string of them. And that's what it takes to win a Grand Slam 
event.

 "You've got to be able to beat the best, and you've got to be able to beat 
three of them in a row, in many cases. And that's what's been sort of 
frustrating. I haven't been able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chang hasn't abandoned his quest. Still six months shy of his 23rd 
birthday, he is the youngest of the five U.S. players ranked among the top 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give myself a little more time than say, Pete (Sampras) and Jim (Courier), 
partly because of my size and partly because I'm younger," Chang said. "I think 
people forget that I'm the youngest one of that little bunch (that also 
includes Todd Martin and Andre Agassi). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating getting to a certain point in an event and losing to Pete in 
the quarterfinals of the (U.S.) Open last year, then running into him again at 
Wimbledon (this year). But, then again, to win those events, you've got to beat 
the best players in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 He knows. He did it once.

 Music Men: In an effort to "improve the presentation and add more fun and 
entertainment to men's professional tennis," the ATP Tour introduced several 
innovations this month at a tournament in New Haven, Conn., among them playing 
music selected by the players during their introductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Lendl, the tour's all-time money leader, chose "Penny Lane," by the 
Beatles. Agassi, in a wink at his former No. 1 fan, picked "The Way We Were," 
by Barbra Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
 A partial list of songs that probably won't ever be heard: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I'm a Loser," by the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Poor Poor Pitiful Me," Warren Zevon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Born to Lose," Ray Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sour Note: Agassi strongly objected to playing music during changeovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To add to the sport, you need to add to it, not take people out of the game," 
said the originator of "rock 'n' roll" tennis. "Playing music on the 
changeovers is taking people out of what they're going there for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rock 'n' roll tennis is not playing rock 'n' roll music during the match. 
Rock 'n' roll tennis is an attitude. Rock 'n' roll tennis is a way of playing 
and a way of being out there. It's saying, 'Come on, get alive, get into this.' 
Bringing the fans into it is what I try to do on any level. Tennis as a sport 
deserves to maintain its entertainment value -- as a sport." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Still more music news: John McEnroe recently took his band to Italy, kicking 
off a two-week tour with a concert in Santa Margherita that was described by a 
local newspaper as "the musical equivalent of a double fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Before what was described as an unenthusiastic crowd of 400, McEnroe led his 
group, McBand, in covers of Rolling Stones and Nirvana tunes and songs about 
New York life. 
</P>
<P>
 McEnroe was not discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "In sports, you can win or lose," he told an Italian newspaper. "On stage, 
it's different because you can get results somewhere in the middle. I'm not 
afraid. This time, I know I'm not the best." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Opposing view: Contrary to conventional wisdom, Anne Person Worcester of the 
Women's Tennis Council said that Steffi Graf's dominance of the WTA Tour and 
negative publicity surrounding the sport in the year after Monica Seles' 
departure was actually good for women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steffi set a new standard and other players have strived to reach that level 
and have really succeeded in stepping up the level of their own tennis," 
Worcester told Elliott Almond of The Times. "Losing Monica and Jennifer 
(Capriati) for a while, some of the negative stories that have been coming out 
of women's tennis have almost been a blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a tremendous stepping up of the players just in the first six 
months of this year. Because they said, 'OK, we're minus two marquee names, 
we've got negative news stories, the economy is tough, we're looking for a 
sponsor. We've got to convey how terrific women's tennis is.' And they have 
done that. 
</P>

COMMENTARY; GEORGIA'S ZEIER COULD BE BEST COLLEGE FOOTBALL QUARTERBACK

 Five seconds to play in a big game and you are trailing, 33-26. You are 12 
yards from a touchdown that can beat a team much better than yours. A victory 
turns your season around. A coach signals in the play. He wants the Smash game. 
The call is 272. 
</P>
<P>
 You have thrown the ball 64 times. Even Fran Tarkenton never did that at your 
school. You have completed 36 for 386 yards. You need 12 more yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Four receivers go wide, two on each side. The outside men run a hitch, 
straight downfield and turning to face you. The men inside run a flag, breaking 
toward the end-zone corners. 
</P>
<P>
 You like the play. But you have used the formation before. It can be no 
surprise. In the huddle, you say: 272. And you say: Let's run it a new way. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 We are talking quarterbacks with Eric Zeier, the Heisman Trophy candidate from 
the University of Georgia. He already belongs in Southeastern Conference lore 
with Archie Manning and Kenny Stabler, Joe Namath and Heath Shuler. Zeier, 21, 
is a career military man's son. He is a portrait of bubbling energy, eager to 
get at life's next play. 
</P>
<P>
 We are talking quarterbacks with a good one who is answering questions with 
bursts of words that leave the visitor's notebook a scribbly mess when all the 
visitor did was ask about putting together the perfect quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aikman's drop," Zeier says. "Marino's release. Montana's knowledge and feel. 
Elway's arm. Johnny Unitas' leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Rat-a-tat-tat. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier says he will name quarterbacks he has seen. But he went back 35 years 
for Unitas because he knew the stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unitas broke his nose in a game and kept on playing," Zeier says. "He just 
stopped it up with a bunch of mud. That's toughness and leadership. Getting up 
in pain, you're hurting, and you say, 'Let's do it.' You're hurt but you don't 
stay down. You get up and lead your team to victory." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before his 65th pass against Florida, Zeier read the coach's signal for Smash, 
272, and then told the inside receiver on the left side: Let's change routes. 
No flag. Make it a post. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier hoped Florida's defender would be late to cover, even a heartbeat late. 
Zeier would turn his eyes to the outside. A "hard look," he called it, hoping 
to persuade the defender the ball might be thrown out there, a heartbeat's 
indecision. "Then we've got him beat," Zeier says. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball left Zeier's hands ... and he says he thought he heard a whistle. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Some folks in Georgia get buried wearing red and black, the university's 
colors. College football means a lot to a lot of people. Older than basketball, 
in more places than big league baseball, it fills stadiums with more people 
than live in any but some state's largest two or three cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanford Stadium holds 86,117 Georgia worshipers, many of whom fall to all 
fours and woof in the manner of Uga, the bulldog mascot. Such behavior was 
perfected during Vince Dooley's 25 seasons, particularly in 1980 when the team 
won a national championship on Herschel Walker's running. 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley's successor, Ray Goff, recruited Zeier out of suburban Atlanta's 
Marietta High School (chosen by the Zeiers for the quarterback's last two high 
school seasons; the first two were in Heidelberg, Germany). 
</P>
<P>
 In his sixth season, Goff needs to be good after last season's 5-6 record. And 
for Georgia to be good, it needs Zeier to be great. 
</P>
<P>
 We know he can throw. We know he is Joe Montana's size, 6 feet 2, 205 pounds. 
But we also know Montana works with instincts and quickness that make possible 
the unlikely. Whether Zeier has such gifts, we will soon find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, wondering about the pros, Zeier canvassed 14 NFL teams and 
decided he was a third-round draft choice at best. So he returned to Georgia 
for his senior season. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that NFL scouts 
now rate Zeier the country's No. 1 quarterback prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "His throwing motion is pure beauty," says Dexter Wood, his high school coach. 
Florida Coach Steve Spurrier, himself once a quarterback who won the Heisman, 
says Zeier throws "a nice, catchable ball." Bill Curry of Kentucky, on how 
seldom Zeier is intercepted: "That's the kind of stuff Bart Starr and Johnny 
Unitas used to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A whistle? When? No one stopped playing. The defender held his ground for an 
instant, just as Zeier hoped. He had him beat. The quarterback didn't even look 
at receiver Jerry Jerman. He knew where he would be. A perfect pass. Touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Only there had been a whistle. Georgia's outside receiver on the left side, 
Anthone Lott, had called timeout an instant before the snap. No play. Some 
teams find ways to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the whistle right before I threw," Zeier says. "I didn't do any 
celebrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Still five seconds to play. Another pass. Interference. One more play, no time 
on the clock. Zeier's 65th pass. Incomplete. "Their linebacker made a good 
play," Zeier says. "I had nowhere to throw it where it could be caught." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We are talking quarterbacks with the only passer in SEC history to throw for 
500 yards in a game. He is also the only SEC player to throw for more than 400 
yards more than once, doing it three times last season. What he does better 
than most is see theory on film and take it to the field where he makes it real 
for his team. Only quarterbacks get to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 So a visitor asks Zeier one more question. Would he like any other position as 
much? Zeier tries to say yes; he is a football player, and he would play 
anywhere. "But," he says, eager to make a play on this day of Montana and 
Unitas and Aikman, "I love being a quarterback."

AUTO RACING; BRISTOL TRACK RATED NASCAR'S TOUGHEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HARRIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are faster tracks and longer tracks, but none tougher than the 
half-mile, bowl-shaped oval at Bristol International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where NASCAR's top guns headed for this weekend's Saturday night race. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Waltrip, a three-time Winston Cup champion and winner of 12 races in 
39 previous starts on the .533-mile, high-banked track, says the place in just 
plain mean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any secrets," said Waltrip, who in the early 1980s won seven 
straight starts at Bristol. "Everybody knows what I know about Bristol. They 
just don't go there and practice it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all the races I've run at Bristol, there's been two times I felt like I 
didn't do a good job, and both of those times it was because I was running real 
good and I got to racing people early in the race when I shouldn't have been. I 
should have been minding my own business." 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old racer added, "The big thing at Bristol is just don't race 
anybody. It's like Darlington, but it's a lot more intense. You race the race 
track and look at the situations. The thing that hurst you so much here is cars 
that are in front run so much fater than cars that are in back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time, if you're driving a smart race, you're going to be in 
jeopardy of going a lap down for the first 200 laps of the race. The only thing 
you can do is bide your time and don't do anything foolish until you get in a 
position where you've got to go to keep from going a lap down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then," Waltrip added, "you drive the wheels off of it to stay in front of the 
leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 HILLIN'S THRILL: Bobby Hillin Jr., a 12-year veteran of Winston Cup racing at 
the age of 30, is feeling pretty lucky these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Texas high school football star walked away without injury from 
what was probably the most vicious hit of his life a week ago at Michigan 
International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first lap of the GM Goodwrench Dealers 400, Hillin was toward the back 
of the 41-car field when chaos erupted in front of him between turns one and 
two on the two-mile, high-banked oval: Cars were crashing and spinning up and 
down the track, and Hillin, who also had cars behind him, had to pick a 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 His choice was nearly disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the melee, rookies Jeff Burton and Bill Standridge slid up to the wall. 
That's exactly where Hillin chose to go. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit Standridge's car and sailed over it, scraping the roof of his car on 
the concrete wall for more than 100 feet. Luckily, he came down on his wheels 
before sliding to a stop at the bottom of the banking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything else I could have done," Hillin said. "I let them check 
me out a whole bunch (at the infield medical center) because I got hit a bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was up on my side," Hillin said. "My window net came down and that 
scared me a little. Then I got hit again. I just held onto the wheel as hard as 
I could. I think that's what kept me from getting hurt. Whatever it was, I feel 
lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 THE FAST LANE: Laura Lane says she'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane came up short last week at Michigan in her effort to become the first 
woman to qualify for a Winston Cup event since Patty Moise made the July 1989 
race at Talladega. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a fabulous opportunity, but I still have to put my time in," said 
Lane, who missed making the field by just over 3 mph. "What I really want to do 
is get a sponsor and be successful at this level of competition." 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old Lane, who finished sixth at Michigan in a June ARCA race, has 
driven late model stocks in North Carolina, has done road racing in IMSA and 
Pro SCCA, and has worked as an instructor at driving schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Women have been a part of NASCAR racing on and off since the sanctioning body 
was formed, with Sara Christian racing in the first event, on June 19, 1949, at 
Charlotte, N.C. In all, 15 women have raced in NASCAR's top series. 
</P>
<P>
 PETTY'S ROOKIE: John Andretti's ride in the No. 43 car last week at Michigan 
and again this weekend in Bristol is believed to be the first time a NASCAR 
rookie has driven the Petty Enterprises entry since Maurice Petty -- Richard's 
brother and longtime crew chief -- drove two races in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice, known as "Chief" throughout his racing career, finished 15th a 
Hillsboro, N.C., and seventh at Greenville, S.C., but decided that working on 
the car was how he wanted to make his living.

surgery.Turner, 55, was to give the keynote address at Georgia State 
University's commencement, but he spoke for less than five minutes. "I'm going 
straight from here to a skin cancer operation," Turner told the students and 
their families. "The one piece of advice I can give you is put on sunscreen and 
wear a hat." A small cancerous growth on his lip was removed in an Atlanta 
doctor's office. A spokesman said his prognosis was good.

 The FBI is investigating several Atlanta doctors tied to a home health care 
company that has been accused of inflating the medical bills of critically ill 
patients, including AIDS patients. An article in the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution quoted FBI officials as confirming the existence of the 
probe amid publicity over a civil lawsuit that charges Caremark International 
Inc., two Atlanta doctors and a local pharmacy with charging "unconscionable" 
sums for their services. The suit was filed last April by Michael Alan Booth, 
who entered the care of two Atlanta AIDS specialists after being diagnosed with 
the disease.

 The woman whose harassment allegations prompted Swarthmore College to pay for

being readmitted to the school just outside Philadelphia.Alexis Clinansmith, 
19, alleged last fall that Ewart Yearwood stalked her after she repeatedly 
refused to date him during their first semester at the school. Yearwood denied 
the allegations, insisting Clinansmith misunderstood his romantic overtures and 
developed unfounded fears. A disciplinary committee couldn't decide whether 
Yearwood had harassed and intimidated Clinansmith, but said he had violated a 
school order to stay away from her.

 Residents of a rural canyon near Sams Valley in southwestern Oregon were 
barred from returning to inspect the damage to burned-out homes as a stubborn 
forest fire swelled to 7,250 acres.Across the West, 24 major fires still 
burning had covered 391,200 acres in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho and 
Montana, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Ida. The 
Hull Mountain fire in southwestern Oregon detroyed four houses and eight other 
buildings, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Chris Friend. Firefighters 
estimated that the blaze, about 15 miles northwest of Medford, would be 
contained late Monday.

MEDIATOR BACKS KEY TEACHERS' DEMANDS; EDUCATION: BUT OFFICIAL GIVES L.A. 
DISTRICT A VICTORY BY URGING THAT WORKERS GET ONLY HALF AS MUCH SALARY 
RESTORATION NEXT YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A state mediator has recommended that Los Angeles teachers receive an 8%, 
one-year salary restoration -- 1% more than the school board originally offered 
-- as part of a package that union leaders say could avert a chaotic strike 
soon after school opens in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education must first approve the package before it can officially 
be considered a bargaining offer to teachers. School board President Mark 
Slavkin was in a closed-door meeting with the board late into the afternoon 
Saturday and could not be reached for comment on the board's stance on the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 After three days of intense meetings with both sides, state mediator Draza 
Mrvichin supported most of the union's demands for improving the offer, but 
also gave the district a key win -- a guarantee that the teachers next year 
will receive only half as much as the mediator is recommending for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mrvichin did not agree that the district could afford a full 10% 
salary restoration this year, union leaders say they believe he has offered 
enough incentives to appease the demoralized teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 United Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein fell short of 
whole-hearted endorsement of the package because a full restoration was not 
suggested. But she called it "a significantly better change from the previous 
district offer. . . . This, together with the improved health and welfare 
package that has already been agreed to, gives our unit members a clear 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
 If the board approves the mediator's report, Bernstein said, she will 
encourage her members to "seriously consider it. . . . I think they will be 
disappointed that they didn't get a full restoration, but they will weigh the 
option of going on strike or turning down 8% in their pockets this year." 
</P>
<P>
 If the board approves the recommendations, the offer would be put to a vote of 
the 32,000-member teachers union days after most schools open Sept. 12, 
Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the district had proposed a 7% salary restoration plan that 
included a 4% permanent restoration and a 3% one-time payment. The school board 
had also stipulated that all seven of the district's unions had to first agree 
to use a $42-million health benefit surplus for salaries -- a contingency that 
teachers called unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Mrvichin's recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
 * A 4% permanent and a 4% one-year contract restoration, with a promise from 
the district to continue the restoration in the 1995-96 school year if the 
money is available. 
</P>
<P>
 This provision is a significant win for the district. Strict state education 
finance laws prohibit the district from paying for ongoing salaries with funds 
that are available during one fiscal year. The district's original offer of a 
permanent 4% pay restoration was supported by the mediator. However, Mrvichin 
sided with the union, saying that the district could squeeze more money out of 
this year's $4.2-billion budget for salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 50-50 split between the district and union if any new money becomes 
available this year. The district would earmark half of any additional funds 
for employee salaries and the other half for educational programs. Potential 
sources of additional income include increased lottery revenues and state and 
federal reimbursement claims filed by the district. 
</P>
<P>
 * The teachers union would be able to take its share of the health benefit 
fund, about $33 million, and use it for salaries without the permission of any 
other unions -- an important win for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has long been opposed to bargaining that links its contract talks in 
any way to the district's six other unions. For the district, this 
recommendation could complicate negotiations with other unions. Already, two of 
them -- the school police and clerical workers -- have rejected use of health 
benefit funds for salaries. Instead, they want to use the health surplus as a 
hedge against future increases in health benefit costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mrvichin eliminated a provision in the district's original offer that called 
for teachers to report to work on two unpaid furlough days. Instruction is not 
affected by this provision. Instead, teachers will now get paid for time spent 
preparing for classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Mrvichin, a member of the State Mediation and Conciliation 
Services, suggested that the district set up a budget review committee, with 
representatives from all unions, to monitor fiscal developments throughout the 
year.

DO-IT-YOURSELF HOBBY COMES TO A HEAD; BEER: IT'S A TAILOR-MADE KEG OF BREW 
THAT'S READY IN TWO WEEKS. ENTHUSIASTS PREFER CONCOCTING THEIR OWN RECIPE 
RATHER THAN SWILLING STORE-BOUGHT BRANDS.

<P>
 More than two years have passed since Tor Mohling brewed his first batch of 
beer. Since then, he has made cases and cases of the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes an event of it, enlisting friends to stir the bubbling wort (that 
infusion of malt and simple sugars that will ferment into beer) and 
experimenting with every batch, always trying some new spice or flavor or 
grain. The brews have ranged from raspberry wheat to cinnamon and clove to his 
own favorite, imperial stout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I started doing it, it was a landslide," said Mohling, a graduate 
student and former brewer for a local brewery. "It fills the kitchen with great 
smells; it's satisfying, and you end up with your own beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Mohling may not fit the profile of the average home-brewer, whom the American 
Homebrewers Assn. in Boulder describes as about 35, with an annual income of 
$57,000 and 4.75 years of brewing experience. But he is in on a hobby that is 
rapidly gaining popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past five years, Americans have become obsessed with expensive, 
personality beers. As a result of people wanting to try their hands at the art 
or wanting to save money, the home-brew industry has experienced 20% to 35% 
growth each year, according to the 20,000-member AHA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home-brewing definitely picked up about five years ago," said Walt Dudley, an 
employee at Denver's Wine & Hop Shop. "It's become really trendy and a lot of 
people have gotten into it. Home-brew stores are popping up all over." 
</P>
<P>
 The smell -- not the taste -- is the first thing one notices upon entering a 
home-brew supply store. Home-brew supply sales have grown to a 
$7-million-a-year industry, but that has not diminished the friendliness, the 
sawdust-on-the-floor layout or the trademark malt-and-grain aroma of most 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like any hobby, there are a million toys to make it more fun," said Anne 
Trowbridge, another Wine and Hop Shop employee, during a tour of the small 
store with the creaky floor. She is winner of this year's Queen of Beer 
Homebrew Competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelves are packed with yeast, malt, spices, scales and Irish Moss flakes. A 
loft of sorts is laden with huge plastic buckets and other paraphernalia. An 
odor of something musky and fermenting wafts in from somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic starter kit, which includes makings for the first two cases of beer, 
runs about $50 to $60. Subsequent batches cost about $20 for two cases -- much 
cheaper than premium beer at the liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
 Trowbridge says she is a "beer snob." Her favorite beer costs $11 a six-pack 
at the liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do it (home-brewing) to kind of support your habits," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The store sponsors a club, one of about 400 nationwide, providing an arena for 
competitive tasting. The get-togethers range from a once-a-month meeting of 
groups with names like "The Unfermentables" to a full-scale, seven-day, 
national home-brewing conference called "BrewStorm '94." This year's event, 
which was held June 19-25 in Denver, attracted more than 3,000 entries. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked where an aspiring home-brewer should begin, Trowbridge headed 
straight for the cookbook rack and held up what she called "the bible of 
home-brewing," Charlie Papazian's "The New Complete Joy of Home Brewing." 
</P>
<P>
 The book helps, but most home-brewers shyly compare horror stories of batches 
gone bad. Timing, temperature, bacteria and the gods of fermentation are all 
variables that can combine to produce ill-tasting brews. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend a lot of time on the phone (answering questions)," Dudley said. 
"You've got to make it fun; it's someone's hobby. If they hit a brick wall 
every time, they'll quit." 
</P>
<P>
 There is another option for people who need more hand-holding, who cannot 
dedicate entire refrigerators and bathtubs to brewing, or whose spouses or pets 
cannot tolerate two weeks of the beer belching during fermentation. In both 
Colorado and California, microbreweries cater to the do-it-yourselfer. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hamilton Gregg Brewworks in Hermosa Beach, customers can choose among 45 
different beer styles, from light lagers to porters and stouts. They spend from 
1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours mixing the brew, then return two weeks later to bottle and 
label it.  
</P>
<P>
 "We provide the recipe, guidance, ingredients and equipment," said coowner 
Patricia Spiritus. "But they actually grind their own grains and measure out 
their own hops." They can even design the labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers get four cases of beer for their trouble -- 48 22-ounce bottles. The 
price ranges from $80 to $130, depending on the beer style, she said, plus $30 
for the bottles -- which are reusable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beer Shop in Boulder offers a similar service. People can brew their beer 
on the premises, with supervision and without dealing with the variables that 
can foul up a batch of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 A customer can come in -- even a complete novice -- and choose from 87 
recipes, said owner Doug O'Claussen. It takes about two hours to mix the 
ingredients into wort. The staff then "baby-sits" the beer, controlling the 
temperature and environment, while it ferments and ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The customer comes back exactly two weeks later, and we wheel out a beer 
keg," O'Claussen says. The cost of the keg, which may also be bottled into 
about six cases, runs between $60 and $90, roughly the same as the cost of 
brewing a batch at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiritus noted that brewpubs -- taverns that brew their own beer -- have 
failed to catch on in Los Angeles, as they have in some other areas. "That's 
why I think we're popular, because you can't find fresh-brewed beer," she said.

SCIENTISTS IN HEAVEN AT DANTE'S RETURN FROM VOLCANO 'HELL'; RESEARCH: THE 
ROBOTIC TEST IN ALASKA PROVED INVALUABLE. TECHNOLOGY COULD BE USED ON SPACE 
MISSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSANNE PAGANO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wearing a red flannel shirt, faded jeans and work boots, robot scientist John 
Bares was riding a helicopter bound for Spurr volcano when the bad news was 
yelled into his left ear. 
</P>
<P>
 An umbilical cord that carried power to the Dante II robot -- a $1.7-million 
project that consumed a year of Bares' life -- had snapped while a military 
helicopter tried lifting Dante from a bed of rocks 400 feet inside the crater. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall Aug. 5 sent the robot tumbling deeper into Spurr's steamy pit. Worse, 
one of Bares' colleagues needed a medical airlift after breaking a leg in a 
fall on the volcano's rim. 
</P>
<P>
 An Army National Guardsman called out a message from the cockpit: "Do you want 
to turn back?" 
</P>
<P>
 Overhead, the chopper blades whirred. The green, forested hills passed 4,000 
feet below. For a long moment, Bares, 31, sat silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn back? After television viewers nationwide watched his eight-legged 
machine spider-walk its way into robotics history, traveling nearly 700 feet 
and operating longer than imagined from the innards of an active volcano? 
</P>
<P>
 Turn back? After the machine's computer, communications, power and video 
systems had all worked without a hitch, after Dante's rotating laser had sent 
back the first map of Spurr's interior? 
</P>
<P>
 No. 
</P>
<P>
 Bares signaled for the pilots to press on. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to fetch Dante began when the 1,700-pound machine, picking its way back 
up from the crater floor, stumbled after hitting a 30-degree slope of sloppy 
mud. The treacherous terrain was unexpected, scientists said. Only a week 
earlier, it had been covered in snow that made walking easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand how a lay person might say it wasn't a complete success 
because the robot didn't come back," said David Pahnous, director of a National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration consortium at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon 
University. Dante II was developed for NASA by Carnegie Mellon to explore how 
robots could explore planetary surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "True, they didn't see C-3PO and R2D2, but this isn't the movies," Pahnous 
said, referring to the "Star Wars" robots. "What they did see was the most 
advanced robotics technology today." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Dante's feats: 
</P>
<P>
 * Remaining inside Spurr, a rockfall-prone volcano 80 miles west of Anchorage, 
for seven days, more than twice what was planned. The robot was under remote 
control for part of the time and took other steps on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maneuvering across ash-strewn terrain that gave way under foot. Pahnous said 
the robot had been tested on gravel heaps, but hadn't walked before on a 
pliable landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 * Demonstrating new computer software and laser applications that relayed 
three-dimensional images and topographic maps, both the first of their kind 
from inside a volcano. 
</P>
<P>
 Pahnous says that, for comparison, he likes to think back 20 years to probes 
that were dropped over Venus. The devices operated just seconds before being 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dante proved you could send a machine into very, very harsh conditions and 
get a week's worth of excellent data," Pahnous said. "That's what we wanted to 
find out. That's what planetary exploration is about." 
</P>
<P>
 The space agency said technology that proved itself in Spurr probably would be 
installed on future space missions. A robot explorer to Mars is planned as soon 
as 1996, NASA says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante was damaged, but scientists are undaunted: A robot's tumble -- like a 
toddler's first faltering step -- is just one step on progress's path, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Dante arrives back at Carnegie Mellon this month, scientists may try 
fixing it in preparation for another volcano climb that has yet to be funded. 
They could salvage parts for another machine. Or they could do nothing, and 
install Dante in the laboratory rafters to inspire the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
 With a spotter on the rim to call out warnings of falling boulders, Bares, the 
Carnegie Mellon scientist in charge in Anchorage, descended into the crater 
Aug. 13 with a rigger who affixed helicopter slings on Dante. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine was hoisted out that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Bares, who wore a helmet for the mission, said he was unafraid while working 
an hour or so in the volcano. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one rockfall, a minor one, that morning and the team emerged 
without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Slides that pop like gunshots and upend rocks three feet wide are a constant 
hazard at Spurr. Avalanches of ash and boulders have kept researchers out of 
the volcano since it erupted in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Dante was dinged a few times after it walked into the crater July 29. 
Once, it narrowly missed being crushed. 
</P>
<P>
 There was always a chance that Dante wouldn't come back, said David Lavery, 
manager of NASA's telerobotics program. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavery, who says he got out his dancing shoes when the Erector-set-like robot 
reached Spurr's crater floor Aug. 1, says mission success was never defined as 
a round-trip walk. 
</P>
<P>
 An attempt Aug. 9 to lift the robot by its tether was a delicate move -- bold, 
too, since tension could have sent a snapped cable straight up into the 
helicopter's blades.  
</P>
<P>
 The retrieval mission was called off that sunny afternoon. The day before, an 
airlift was aborted because of clouds. Bares acknowledged that delay was 
starting to make his team weary. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Bares, a natural optimist, just glimpsing the stalled robot while 
flying low over the steamy crater was a lift. "The first thing I felt was, I'm 
still pretty impressed with what the machine did." 
</P>
<P>
 After Dante's Kevlar-reinforced tether broke, Bares took a day to complete 
thoughts begun on the helicopter ride to Spurr. 
</P>
<P>
 He got some rest, talked to NASA and called Pittsburgh to trade ideas with 
university colleague William (Red) Whittaker. Renowned among robot-builders, 
Whittaker designed the machine that cleaned up the Three Mile Island reactor 
after a near-meltdown 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They decided against abandoning Dante. 
</P>
<P>
 "People and things get knocked down in life," said Whittaker, a former amateur 
boxer. "I've had a great education out of getting floored. 
</P>
<P>
 "So often, even in a research community, there is a lot of risk-aversion. But 
if you have a situation where success begets success, where nothing ever goes 
wrong -- I'm not sure that's what the world is about."

SURF'S UP AT HUNTINGTON'S WALK OF FAME; NEW ATTRACTION'S INAUGURATION MARKS 
LATEST GIFT FROM SPORT TO CITY IT MADE FAMOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They skipped the Pellegrino and Perrier, omitted the air-kisses and dazzling 
smiles, and were the better for it. After all, it was Huntington Beach, not 
Hollywood, and this was the inauguration of the Surfing Walk of Fame, not a 
mere addition of yet another star to that other walk, the one on Hollywood 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach, which likes to call itself Surf City, inaugurated its newest 
attraction this month with honorees appropriately attired in khakis or shorts 
and Hawaiian shirts, not business suits. Bruce Brown, the filmmaker whose 1964 
movie "Endless Summer" detailed the international search for the perfect wave, 
was one of the six inaugural inductees. Brown was nicely low-key, saying he was 
flattered and embarrassed and did not really deserve the honor. But when he was 
asked what he planned to do after the ceremony, he struck just the right note 
with the ringing declaration: "I'm going home to surf." 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, it was the co-owners of a surfboard shop in Huntington Beach who 
instigated the project four years ago and donated $30,000 for the walk. 
Organizers wisely decided to set aside one of the six slots for a "local hero," 
with the initial honor in that annual category going to Robert August, one of 
the stars of "Endless Summer" (Brown this year made a sequel, "Endless Summer 
II"). 
</P>
<P>
 Also deserving enshrinement was Joyce Hoffman of San Juan Capistrano, a 
five-time champion whom some consider the best female surfing competitor ever. 
Hoffman's gracious comment: "It's nice to know that after 30 years, people 
remember you as giving something to surfing." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing gave a good amount to the city as well, with city officials reporting 
that residents of other states usually tell them they've heard of the city 
because of the beaches. Now the sport's latest gift to the city is the Surfing 
Walk of Fame, which fits nicely with the city's redevelopment of its downtown 
area.

STATE MAY STILL RAID COUNTIES' REVENUE; SUPERVISOR IS RIGHT ABOUT DELAY IN 
FILLING POSITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In recent years, August has been the cruelest month for Orange County 
supervisors. For August has meant budget hearings in which advocates of social 
programs, the sheriff, proponents of libraries and a host of others have 
pleaded for money the county did not have.  
</P>
<P>
 This time it was different, but the less contentious budget hearings may have 
been deceptive, as one supervisor rightly noted. Much of the county's 
$3.5-billion spending blueprint for the next fiscal year is dependent on how 
much money state government takes from the county and how much it gives back. 
And in drawing up the state budget Sacramento made several assumptions that 
appeared foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the state budget relies on $3.6 billion in federal funds that 
have not been appropriated. For another, a federal court last month invalidated 
the state's 1992 welfare cuts, so the state may have to look for more money for 
welfare.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year state legislators balanced their budget on the back of the counties. 
The danger is that a similar raid of county revenue could happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why Supervisor William G. Steiner was right to recommend that Orange 
County delay filling about 200 of the 930 new employee positions proposed in 
this year's budget until it is clear that the state's budget woes have been 
straightened out. If all the positions were filled, some people might have to 
be laid off soon after they were hired, which would make no sense and would 
cause understandable bitterness among those laid off and more skepticism among 
taxpayers over government's ability to manage. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has done a good job in the past several years in not pushing 
workers out the door. Of nearly 2,000 positions trimmed from county 
departments, most were vacant, and only about 100 job cuts resulted in actual 
layoffs. County officials said all the new positions would be paid for from 
state or federal funds or money from cities that contract with the county to 
provide services such as fire protection or sheriff's department patrols. Thus 
no county money would be spent on the new hires. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the credit for the county's coping with tough budgets goes to County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider, who saw problems down the road and made 
sure county staffers took steps to ease the pain. Part of the credit goes to 
Robert L. Citron, the county treasurer-tax collector who has managed to pry 
higher rates of return on the county's funds than have his colleagues in other 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county still faces expensive problems, including two dealing with 
public safety. As many people warned, the "three strikes" law has started 
clogging the courts. A defendant convicted of two serious or violent felonies 
and facing trial on a third felony, with a mandatory 25 years to life sentence 
upon conviction, has little incentive to plead guilty.  
</P>
<P>
 So more trials are being requested, meaning more public defenders and support 
staff must be hired to defend those unable to afford their own lawyer. 
Supervisors have been asked for $576,000 for four more lawyers and six 
supporting employees for the next year to help the public defender cope with 
the "three strikes" law. Sheriff Brad Gates asked for 55 new employees to work 
at the Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange, if it survives a court challenge and is 
expanded by 358 beds, as proposed. The new employees will cost well over $1 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are all reasons why county officials must keep a close eye on the purse 
strings. The days of booming growth, increased revenues and greatly expanding 
budgets are over. It remains time for extra fiscal prudence.

TOO HIGH A PRICE TO KEEP (L.A.) RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, Leigh Steinberg ("Letting Team Go Would Be Irreversible Financial, 
Cultural Loss," Aug. 21) and some of his business friends want the citizens of 
Anaheim to spend millions of dollars to keep the L.A. Rams football team in 
their city. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasn't anyone informed him that the L.A. Rams never left Los Angeles? All he 
needs do is check out their name and address in any telephone directory. He'll 
find them listed as the "Los Angeles Rams Football Club, Main Ofc 10271 W Pico 
Bl LA" and "Ticket Ofc 10271 W Pico Bl LA" 
</P>
<P>
 In all the years the Rams have played in Anaheim, the management has never 
moved its main office to the city nor made the appropriate name change. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakland Raiders became the Los Angeles Raiders when they moved to L.A. 
Even the old semipro Rhinos called themselves the Orange County Rhinos. Not 
until the Ram owner demonstrates good faith by moving her main office to 
Anaheim and changing the team name to the Anaheim Rams should the City Council 
of Anaheim give any consideration to spending millions of its residents' 
hard-earned money. 
</P>

<P>
 Steinberg is correct in suggesting that we should not allow "businessmen, 
columnists and politicians to fulfill their own prophecies" and create a 
vicious circle that ultimately drives the Rams away.  
</P>
<P>
 How ironic it is, however, that it is the new breed of agents, lawyers and 
lawyer-agents, of which Steinberg is the dean, that in no small way are the 
etiology of the current woes, chaos, confusion and anger that characterize pro 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonstop negotiating, absurdly high salaries, lack of player, team and 
owner loyalty created by Steinberg-like agents has made Orange County fans 
appropriately apathetic. Now do you got bonded to a team to which you know that 
next year many or most of your favorite players, assistant coaches or head 
coach will leave for greener pastures? Who cares who wins given this scenario? 
</P>
<P>
 The priest of agents now asks the fans to save the Rams. It is as if he wants 
the fans to pay to protect the agents from themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps we could make a legal deal with the legal men. We will go to the games 
it they stay out of the negotiations.

TRIAL COURT CONSOLIDATION NOT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC -- OR JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial "Order in the Courts" (Aug. 18) in support of SCA 3, the trial 
court consolidation initiative, was one-sided. It failed to mention the 
compelling arguments against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the reasons why SCA 3 would be contrary to the public 
interest: It would eliminate the Municipal Courts, which provide justice at the 
community level, close to the people. If SCA 3 is enacted, there will be only 
one class of judges elected countywide, with no community ties. 
</P>
<P>
 This will benefit the big law firms and the business litigants who have large 
cases, but it will dilute the resources available for traffic, small-claims and 
smaller civil cases. It will also destroy the liaison between the police 
departments and the Municipal Courts that enables law enforcement to focus on 
unique local problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate effects will be in cost increases resulting from the adjustment 
of the Municipal Court judges' salaries to the same amount as Superior Court 
judges receive. The so-called "long-term" cost savings that are projected are 
purely speculative. 
</P>
<P>
 It is more likely that consolidation will emulate the school systems to 
produce new bureaucratic positions to administer the courts. Just the opposite 
of cost savings may result, since modern management theory now favors 
decentralization, not consolidation. The SCA 3 model is the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 You failed to mention that Gov. Wilson is strongly opposed to SCA 3, believing 
that it is unnecessary and that it would make it more difficult to appoint 
highly qualified lawyers to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, you failed to mention that similar consolidation measures have twice 
before been voted down by the people.

 Your recent editorial must have been based on a legislative press release. 
Contrary to your editorial, the California Judges Assn. has not been 
indifferent to the legislation and has supported the concept of open hearings 
and a balanced membership on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 It has opposed bills that would have allowed a majority of politically 
appointed members to discipline and remove judges without any review by the 
Supreme Court. Aside from their doubtful constitutionality, those bills were 
just bad policy. 
</P>
<P>
 As to trial court unification, there has never been any debate as to whether 
this proposed amendment will benefit the public. The referral to the California 
Law Revision Commission by the Legislature contained express directions to the 
commission that it was not to consider the question of whether the proposal was 
in the public interest. In requesting comments, the commission stated that it 
would consider only suggestions that might aid in the passage of the 
legislation and would not consider opposing viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 If this proposal is of such a benefit to the people of California, why can't 
it be submitted to the rigors of a vigorous debate on its value in answering 
public access to the courts, on whether it preserves a reasonable degree of 
local autonomy and on the question of whether, in fact, it will save money? 
</P>
<P>
 During a period when business and industry have rediscovered the value of 
decentralization, it is tragic that the Legislature sees fit to push the court 
system in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Efficiency, of course, should be required of the courts, but justice, fairness 
and guaranteed access for people, regardless of class, culture, gender, race or 
creed, can't always be accomplished on the cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, we could save tons of money by dispensing with such 
outmoded, inefficient and wasteful concepts as jury trials and other quaint 
vestiges of our past. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that if the unification amendment does make it to the ballot, your 
paper will give it greater attention than you have to date. It is worthy of an 
honest inquiry.

AIRING DIRTY LINEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let me see if I have this right. La Habra plans to ban clotheslines because 
the City Council considers clean, sweet-smelling clothes to be a "blight."Yet 
La Habra is doing nothing to address the blight of traffic and air pollution. 
Maybe people are supposed to wear dirty clothes so that everything matches -- 
the clothes, the cars, the air. Perhaps there is even a City Council term for 
this, such as coordinated-aesthetics-of-the-external-environment. I must admit 
it makes a California kind of sense.

WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE IF STUDENTS FAIL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to the article on grade changes at Brea Olinda High School 
("Discipline Possible for Officials Linked to Grade Changing," Aug. 17), I 
believe the issue of grade changing has a much deeper significance that is 
symbolic of our times. It reflects a general belief of parents, administrators 
and school boards that no student shall fail. This means that students are not 
held responsible or accountable for their own success or failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Education thrives on new ideas and innovative teaching but as with all new 
ideas, we tend to go overboard. Project Self-Esteem is an example. We all want 
to feel good about ourselves, and we certainly want our children to be positive 
about themselves, but we carry this concept too far if we don't allow our 
children to fail because it might damage their self-image. Sometimes, we learn 
more from our failures than our successes. We have to stop acting on the idea 
that no student shall be allowed to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 We also need to add more courses to our curriculum for students not college 
bound. Not every student is qualified or wants an academic program. There 
should be no stigma or loss of self-esteem if a student chooses other options.  
</P>
<P>
 We tend to forget in talking about the debacle at BOHS that what made us a 
Blue Ribbon school has not changed. We have a fine staff dedicated to the 
well-being of its students. We have students who graduate from BOHS and find 
that their high school experience has prepared them to compete successfully in 
college. We have parents who support their children and the public school 
system. I believe that in the long run we will have a stronger school if we 
learn from this painful experience, and isn't that what education is about?

NRA'S WISHES COME BEFORE THE VOTERS'

<P>
 The Orange County congressional delegation unanimously voted against President 
Bill Clinton's crime bill, which outlaws assault rifles. No intelligent person 
could sanction the use of these weapons of war by anyone not in the military 
services of the United States. You may just as well advocate murder! 
</P>
<P>
 As a Marine Corps night fighter pilot in combat in three wars, I have fired 
more ordnance than most people have seen. As a federal prosecutor for five 
years, I am responsible for sending felons to prison for sentences totaling 
1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The cops, our front-line soldiers, who lay their lives on the line on every 
tour of duty, certainly deserve more than our delegation gave them. It does no 
good to talk against crime and then vote for unrestricted instruments of 
slaughter on our streets. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no lawful civilian use for an AK-47 or any of its progeny. Have they 
forgotten Stockton and the dead children? 
</P>
<P>
 The large contributions from the National Rifle Assn. and other right-wing 
military kook organizations should not direct legislation that encourages 
killing.

 Do Orange County voters really need any further evidence that their 
representatives in Washington cater far more to the wishes of (demands of) the 
National Rifle Assn. than of the people they are supposed to represent? In 
spite of the fact that the overwhelming majority of the public, including those 
in Orange County, wanted the crime bill passed, they voted against it based on 
their lame excuse that it was loaded with pork. 
</P>
<P>
 The only pork that will come out of this crime bill will be the dollars that 
will be given to those who voted against it for their reelection campaigns. 
Wake up Orange County voters! Kick those rascals out of Congress once and for 
all!

KEEPING WATCH OVER NURSING HOMES; STATE INSPECTORS ARE DOING A BETTER JOB OF 
CHECKING UP ON FACILITIES IN THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By one measurement, the state is finally facing its responsibility in ensuring 
that residents of Orange County nursing homes are getting the care they deserve 
and the law requires. The attention is overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, inspectors issued county nursing homes only three citations for 
fines totaling $8,250. Last year's totals were 56 citations calling for $96,800 
in fines; for the first seven months of this year, the total citations were 
more than 80, with the amount of fines not yet determined. It is true that 
inspectors can take other punitive actions against nursing homes besides fines, 
but hitting the pocketbook remains one valid measurement of how well inspectors 
are keeping tabs on the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 citation record prompted complaints from a private group that 
monitors nursing homes, and a hearing by a legislative fact-finding panel 
chaired by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 State statistics painted a disturbing picture of deficiencies in the more than 
70 nursing homes in the county. Those homes made up a relatively small district 
on state organization charts, yet they registered many more serious 
deficiencies than larger districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Private individuals investigating a nursing home before placing a parent or 
other relative there can read the state inspection reports, which are kept at 
each facility. The reports explain the circumstances and context in which 
deficiencies were found, as well as detailing how serious each was. But many 
nursing home residents have no relatives and no visitors. They are dependent on 
volunteer ombudsmen, conscientious employees and, ultimately, state and federal 
inspectors to see they receive adequate care. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale of Harbor Health Care in Fullerton is instructive. The facility since 
has been sold and has not had problems lately, state officials said, but under 
the old owners, inspectors found numerous deficiencies. The state recommended 
at one point that the home be ruled ineligible for Medicare or Medi-Cal 
payments, without which most nursing homes cannot exist. But the federal 
government wrongly overruled the state, and the facility under previous 
ownership continued to pile up deficiencies. The lack of proper treatment of 
patients and maintenance of facilities detailed in state records represents a 
shocking failure of the system. State officials said the situation that once 
existed at Harbor Health Care was by no means typical, but they must use their 
powers to see it does not recur at any nursing home.

CONROY HARASSMENT SUIT PUTS FOCUS ON OFFICE BEHAVIOR AND TOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was told by several attorneys that I should refrain from commenting about 
the harassment suit that was filed against me by my former employee, Robyn Boyd 
("Ex-Aide Sues Conroy for Harassment," Aug. 23). I was told it best to let the 
truth come out in the courtroom. Unfortunately, Robyn has chosen to hold press 
conferences throwing out accusations about my character and accusing me of 
inappropriate behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 In my 50 years in the work force, prior to this incident, I have never been 
accused of sexual harassment. Nor has anyone to my knowledge ever suggested 
that I have acted in a way that would make them feel uncomfortable in the 
workplace. Therefore, Robyn's public statements have been particularly hurtful 
and surprising. Because so many have requested that I do so, let me clearly 
emphasize that Robyn's claims that I deliberately harassed her -- or that 
someone on my staff did -- are not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout my career I have always tried to foster a friendly and open 
environment with my employees and colleagues. I remember employees, birthdays 
and anniversaries and names of their children. I have always made a point of 
interfacing with people on a personal level and have always felt that the most 
productive office is one in which there is trust and friendly camaraderie. On 
occasion, it is true that I have placed my arm around an employee's shoulder, 
male or female -- but never with any sexual intention. I also have on occasion 
paid compliments to an employee who is looking particularly sharp or 
well-dressed -- but never in a suggestive or demeaning manner. I do not live my 
life in a plastic bubble, afraid to interact or touch people, but I do respect 
my employees, male and female. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that any of my employees can attest to my genuine feelings in this 
regard. The tragedy of this lawsuit, and similar claims brought against public 
figures, is that such cases tend to make a mockery out of real instances of 
sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither I nor my staff did anything shameful or malicious, Robyn's 
complaint was taken very seriously by my office. Contrary to her public 
statements, she was not terminated by the Assembly, but decided to quit her job 
to seek damages in court. Unfortunately, this is an all too common tactic in 
our media-driven society. 
</P>
<P>
 I am confident that the truth will emerge through the normal court procedures. 
This incident has absolutely no effect on the discharge of my official duties 
in Sacramento or in my home district.

</P>
<P>
 Regarding the sexual harassment case by Robyn Boyd against Assemblyman Mickey 
Conroy, it seems to me that Mrs. Boyd is out of order. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women object to the attention by such a man as Conroy, notice it quickly 
and resign from the job. Other women approve of his attention and stay on the 
job. If he loses too many employees because of his amorous attention, he either 
changes, or in private industry is fired. 
</P>
<P>
 People can object to bosses for many other reasons or for the nature of the 
work. No one is guaranteed a job that he must like. Everyone fits into a 
particular employment role, and probably an emotional role within that 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible to create an atmosphere satisfactory to all comers. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure Mrs. Boyd is not so talented that this is the only job she deserves, 
wants and needs. Frequently a change in jobs can prove beneficial. The human 
condition being what it is, Mrs. Boyd and the sexual harassment clique are 
trying to reorder that condition. How will women find husbands or men find 
wives in the workplace if Mrs. Boyd's standards are universal? The office will 
be a rather sterile place. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment is not universal, nor is love for employers. Women who enter 
the traditional male workplaces have to understand and appreciate what they are 
doing. I'm sure there are circumstances where men, too, will avoid work places 
because of sexual harassment. Every job cannot be evaluated on the primary 
basis of whether it can provide an income through litigation. And every job can 
have some difficulty. You can tolerate it or quit.

 I had the pleasure of working as Mickey Conroy's secretary for almost a year 
after he was elected in 1991. I was shocked to read that a former employee has 
accused him of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a young, attractive woman in my early 20s. During my employment with 
Mickey, he would occasionally put his arm around me and give me a hug. 
Sometimes he would grab a male staffer by the back of the neck or playfully 
give them a punch in the stomach. He could also tell some pretty lame jokes. In 
no way could I or anyone around me construe his behavior to be anything but 
platonic. It was the same treatment you might get from your grandfather or 
uncle, friendly but nothing sexual. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never met the woman who claims this treatment was harassment. I can 
only assume that she is hypersensitive to normal social interaction, or she is 
trying for an easy retirement with a expensive lawsuit that is difficult to 
disprove. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time I see Mickey I hope he'll still give me a hug when he asks how 
I've been. He's a genuinely kind man who doesn't deserve to be attacked for 
being friendly.

BICYCLISTS BROKE LAW, MADE AN ENEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a bicycle enthusiast of over 30 years, I find that I have nothing but 
contempt for the organizers and participants in the bicycle demonstration (Aug. 
19) in Huntington Beach. While there are valid reasons for bicycle commuting, 
the participants in this action are clearly in violation of California Vehicle 
Code No. 21202, (which states) bicyclists must ride, in a single line, as close 
to the right-hand curb as possible.As such, all of the participants in the 
critically mass brain-dead ride should be given tickets and have their bicycles 
impounded pursuant to CVC 39012. 
</P>
<P>
 (In) making several passes up and down the construction-clogged section of 
Beach Boulevard, while there are parallel avenues with generous bicycle lanes, 
these politically correct yuppies not only put themselves in danger but the 
safety of automobile passengers as well. It's obvious that these bicyclists 
were not going from work to home and as such constituted a parade without a 
permit. Since the Huntington Beach police didn't ticket these morons, I'll 
personally see the next participants at curb side with citizen's arrest 
citations.

COMMENTARY ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; CENTRALIZED RESOURCES ESSENTIAL TO ATTRACT, 
RETAIN BUSINESSES; 'ONE-STOP SHOP' WOULD ENABLE THE COUNTY TO BETTER COMPETE IN 
THE STATE, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ARENA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By H. FRED MICKELSON, H. Fred Mickelson is the Orange County regional vice 
president for Southern California Edison Co. and the current chairman of the 
board for the Orange County Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
 An attempt to establish a full-blown economic development program in Orange 
County is not new. There have been at least two abortive attempts in the last 
10 or 15 years. The vision to establish such a program was and is still right 
on the mark; the problem has been to achieve critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to a couple of years ago, it was the best of times. Sure, businesses and 
jobs were leaving Orange County, but there were two or three other companies 
lined up to fill the vacated space. Orange County was the land of milk and 
honey. And it seemed the good times would last forever -- we put ourselves on 
cruise control. We enjoyed rubbing our backs in the fur-lined rut of 
complacency. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we had a good run, but our decades-long growth was built on a narrow 
premise -- many people didn't like the deterioration they saw where they lived 
and worked, especially around Los Angeles, so they moved. And a lot of them 
came to Orange County -- to live and to do business. So the growth was driven 
in some major part by developers responding to demand built on flight from 
unwanted circumstances, rather than a broad-based, deep-rooted growth built on 
the generations of investment experienced in many other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a couple of years ago, realization struck home. More businesses were 
relocating and growing elsewhere, and the waiting line of replacements had long 
since dried up. We were losing jobs, and few of us didn't have a relative or 
close friend who was suddenly unemployed or a son or daughter just entering the 
work force who had to move out of state to find employment. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? An unusual combination of events compounded the pressure on 
our besieged business climate: the changeover to a peacetime economy; 
government regulation of financing; a series of natural disasters; a depressed 
economy worldwide; and, as a result of all this, a lack of consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as a final straw, we woke up to the fact that poachers from many 
countries, states, counties and even cities were skulking about in Orange 
County, taking aim on our businesses and many times bringing home world-class 
trophies. We were so out of touch with our business community that there were 
many cases where we didn't know a business was considering relocating until it 
was already gone and the parking lot was permanently empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, much has been written and discussed these past two years about Orange 
County coming of age in the economic development arena. And much has been 
discussed and cussed about the hurdles facing business in Orange County and, 
for that matter, California. There's the AQMD and regulation in general; 
there's the number of and the time required to obtain permits; there are 
workers' compensation issues; there are tax incentives and tax credits (or 
rather the lack of same when compared with our competitors) and a myriad of 
other valid issues. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not my point to rehash the obvious. (But we must keep working on them 
till resolved, to be sure.) Rather, let's focus on what has been accomplished 
as a foundation for what actions will achieve critical mass and will allow 
Orange County to join the likes of Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, Colorado, 
Phoenix, Albuquerque, N.M., and the rest of the hunters in a solid, 
job-creating, tax revenue-generating, crime-reducing economic development 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 So what are our foundational achievements these past two years? 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orange County Economic Development Consortium, under the auspices of the 
Orange County Chamber of Commerce and Industry and working in partnership with 
utilities and local chambers of commerce and local, county and state public 
agencies, has substantially reduced the hemorrhaging of business relocation 
with its business retention programs and actions; 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 20 businesses considering relocation -- and the 5,100 jobs they 
represent -- were retained in the last year alone; 
</P>
<P>
 * Partnership 2010 has strategically focused our thinking about what industry 
clusters we should target as Orange County matures; 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orange County Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Industrial League of 
Orange County and the Building Industry Assn. have worked together to help 
achieve legislative change to develop a more favorable business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 All these efforts must continue and expand on all fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 But with all that said, there is one key series of actions that will 
jump-start our Orange County business economy and allow us to compete in the 
state, national and international economic development arena. And it won't 
require a group of mental gymnasts creating from ground zero, because these 
actions have been successfully taken in varying measure by almost every other 
state in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 First, we must get out of the denial stage and recognize that the last several 
years' downturn in the business health of Orange County is not just a cycle and 
that it won't get better all by itself. Then we must go on the offensive and, 
through a public-private partnership, form a professional, hard-hitting, 
single-point-of-contact, centrally located economic development operation that 
is well-funded, professionally staffed and led by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's vital that our existing businesses are able to call one number or visit 
one location to obtain needed information and/or enlist the aid of experienced 
professionals in solving key business issues. And our existing businesses who 
wish to grow or businesses who are considering locating in Orange County should 
have information regarding the resources of the entire county at their 
fingertips at this "one-stop shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's serve notice that stealing businesses and jobs from Orange County is no 
longer like knocking over ducks in a shooting gallery, that we know many other 
areas want to become what Orange County already is and that we're ready to go 
to war to retain, grow and attract new business. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's focus our efforts through a countywide economic development organization 
that advocates and achieves the changes required to once again make Orange 
County a great place to live and do business.

SOME FACTS ON MARINA BACK RENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your Aug. 23 editorial regarding the 35-year-lease extension to Goldrich & 
Kest (G&K) in the Sunset Marina Park in Huntington Harbor (the "marina") and 
your previous newspaper articles display an appalling lack of knowledge, 
starting with your constant statement that G&K owed $200,000 in back rent. The 
facts are as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 In the lease among Jona Goldrich, Sol Kest and Mel Grau and the Orange County 
Harbor District dated Sept. 15, 1969, Section 9 contains a formula for revision 
of percentage rentals. Basically it states that commencing in 1979 and every 
five years thereafter any of the percentage rents shall be subject to revision. 
It also states that such adjustments shall be made by negotiation, but if the 
parties cannot agree, there is a procedure by which each party shall select a 
qualified real estate appraiser and the two chosen shall select a third 
qualified real estate appraiser. 
</P>
<P>
 The county in 1989, with no agreement from the tenant, G&K, arbitrarily 
increased its percentage rental from 20% to 25% effective Jan. 1, 1989. G&K was 
not in agreement with this increase, but because of the fact that they were in 
negotiations with the county for a lease extension, it was agreed that this 
increase be set aside to a later date. After the initial negotiations broke 
down on May 7, 1992, in a letter from John R. Kraemer, Esq., to Mr. John 
Sibley, chief deputy director, G&K signified its willingness to increase its 
percentage rentals to 25% effective Jan. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent to this increase by the tenant, the county approached G&K to reopen 
negotiations regarding the lease extension. The county approached G&K for the 
following reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 1. County staff had approved a development plan to expand the facilities at 
the Marina and wished to implement this expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The county had available to it a loan from the state of California in the 
amount of $4.4 million at a favorable rate of interest and it would lose such 
loan if the development plan for the marina was not implemented in an 
expeditious manner. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The county's lease for the marina expires Sept. 15, 1999, and the county 
wished to implement and conclude the development plan for the marina prior to 
the expiration. The agreement as it stands today, subject to the necessary 
governmental approvals, dictates that the development plan would be concluded 
prior to the 35-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
 4. It would be difficult for the county to find a tenant that would invest 
$5.5 million of its own monies into the expansion and redevelopment of the 
marina. G&K has promised to do this. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, one thing the paper neglected to point out is that even if the county 
had advertised for bidders to redevelop the marina, G&K had a right of first 
refusal to release the marina upon the terms and conditions as accepted by any 
successful bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason why the county and G&K originally agreed to waive the $196,621 (the 
correct amount allegedly owed to the county) was that G&K had a legal claim 
against the county because of the county's unwillingness or inability to allow 
G&K to develop the whole marina parcel. It was because G&K agreed to forgo its 
claim for lost profits due to the county's breach of its obligations that the 
county's claim for the $200,000 in back rent was also waived. 
</P>
<P>
 All newspapers have an obligation to secure all the necessary facts before 
making judgments and printing these judgments and opinions for public 
consumption.

DORNAN'S USE OF DISTORTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest the comments from Rep. Robert K. Dornan (Letters, Aug. 
21) in which the right honorable gentleman addressed the so-called 
"liberal-created mythology" directed at him. 
</P>
<P>
 I think much about what has been written in the media is biased against him. 
</P>
<P>
 I do, however, condemn Mr. Dornan's distortions that Marilyn Brewer, candidate 
for the 70th Assembly District is "pro-abortion." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who knows Mrs. Brewer and her family know this to be a fallacy. True, 
the candidate is pro-choice, as am I, but that in no way means that she 
encourages that abortions should take place. She does, however, believe that 
the U.S. Constitution guarantees that government should not dictate what a 
woman can or cannot do with her own body. 
</P>
<P>
 To further refer to Mrs. Brewer as a "Republican" in quotes, is condescending 
at best. 
</P>
<P>
 I encourage Mr. Dornan to speak for what he believes on the abortion issue, 
however unpopular. But, Mr. Dornan, please stop distorting Mrs. Brewer's 
record.

MYSTERY SURROUNDS COMPROMISE; IT'S OPEN TO QUESTION WHETHER DELAYED DEVELOPMENT 
OF BLIGHTED BLOCK IS SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be nice to be able to cheer the recent announcement that the awful 
"Scene of the Crime" block on Ventura Boulevard is about to be fixed up. 
Unfortunately, the end is long overdue, and the solution has obvious 
shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scene of the Crime" refers not to the block's felonious ugliness but to a 
mystery book store. It was the best known of about a dozen businesses east of 
Woodman Avenue that were evicted in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan for a large retail-office complex aroused neighbors' ire, and the city 
threw up roadblocks. The developer sued but lost a preliminary round in court. 
After the weak economy undermined the original project's feasibility, he 
proposed a retail and housing project, half low-income and with some public 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, five years later, the blight will finally give way to one floor of stores 
and two of elderly people in one-bedroom apartments, if the City Council 
approves. 
</P>
<P>
 Two questions hover over the Scene of the Crime: Why five years of blight? And 
how good is the solution? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, here's your chance to be a civic sleuth by playing Clue and picking your 
villain: 
</P>
<P>
 The Developer / On the Boulevard / With Eviction Notices. Critics blame 
developer Jacky Gamliel for throwing out the tenants before his plan was 
approved. While the fight went on, the buildings went under, attracting 
vagrants, taggers and rodents. 
</P>
<P>
 NIMBYs / In the Neighborhood / With Mike Woo. Galmiel's lawyer argues that the 
plan complied with zoning law and needed only routine permits. Protesters had 
no legal leg to stand on, this version runs, just a pal in City Hall. Woo, the 
area's councilman, delayed the permits long enough for adoption of a 1991 
boulevard plan that blocked the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Galmiel proposed the new scheme in 1992. Negotiations -- wrapped in the mantle 
of settling a lawsuit despite the city's early court victory -- were done 
largely by Woo and the area's councilman since 1992, Zev Yaroslavsky. Financing 
took 1 1/2 years, during which the city issued toothless demands that the 
decaying buildings be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential villains aside, maybe the compromise is as good as possible in a 
time of diminished possibilities. Given the economy, revitalized one-story 
retailing might be only a nostalgic dream. Mixing residences with shopping is 
intriguing, and the city badly needs low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the solution has problems. The new project violates the Specific Plan 
height limit. Critics fear side-street parking, traffic problems, and think the 
deal was rushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, Mike Woo vowed: "I will say no until we get a building that 
satisfies the community." Now, even if we can't cheer, we can sigh with relief 
and mark the case closed.

POLICE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO RELY ON DONATIONS; CITY SHOULD FUND ALL DIVISIONS -- 
EVEN IF IT MEANS TAX HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consider the following scenario: You've been victimized by crime and head down 
to your local Los Angeles Police Department division to have a report filed. 
You arrive, and the officer helping you has to wait in line to use a barely 
functioning typewriter. Maybe the officer even has to wait to use a desk. Can 
someone at the station fax you some information? No, they don't have a 
facsimile machine. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past several months, we've maintained something of a drumbeat on this 
page about equipment shortages and people-power shortages at the LAPD. Our 
refrain: we're fortunate to have a declining crime rate, because this is the 
most under-policed of the nation's largest cities. And when the size of the 
force is too small for the city it attempts to serve, you at least want it to 
be a department that is as technologically advanced as possible. Well, we're in 
sad shape in that regard as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing both matters figures to be an expensive proposition, but the 
message appears to be getting through in some parts of town. One of the most 
impressive examples involves the LAPD's Devonshire Division, and the work of 
neighbor Becky Leveque. Two years, ago, Leveque organized a community meeting 
on police issues, expecting a turnout of two dozen people. She was stunned when 
500 people came. 
</P>
<P>
 Leveque founded a group called SOLID, or Supporters of Law enforcement In 
Devonshire. Now, the group claims a Neighborhood Watch membership of 11,000. 
But even more impressive is what SOLID has done for the LAPD at Devonshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this is a well-to-do community by Los Angeles standards, but this is also 
the Northridge area, close to the epicenter of an earthquake that caused the 
most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history. It is in that context that the 
generosity of the Devonshire division's neighbors must be viewed. 
</P>
<P>
 SOLID has donated computers for nearly every desk in the division. It has 
supplied laser printers, linens, bunk beds and a $3,000 telephone system that 
notifies neighbors of burglaries on their street. They have also donated 
cellular telephones, answering machines, a paper shredder, even night-vision 
goggles. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as we praise the civic-mindedness of the Devonshire Division's 
neighbors, we have concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the police shouldn't have to rely on unusual generosity to obtain this 
kind of standard equipment. It's the kind of thing that the city as a whole 
must be willing to fund for all police divisions, particularly those in less 
affluent neighborhoods, even if it means a tax increase of some kind. 
</P>
<P>
 This city is better served by a department that is equally well-equipped 
throughout its divisions, regardless of the financial might of the neighborhood 
in which those stations are located. For example, it will hardly matter that 
Devonshire has a strong computer capability if few other divisions around town 
have the hardware and software needed to share information. 
</P>
<P>
 Local elected officials should also note SOLID's work for another reason as 
well. Perhaps it is a sign of a "sea change," in the form of an increasing 
willingness among residents to fund the kind of police force the city truly 
needs.

BRAUDE TENDS TO GLAMOROUS BRENTWOOD, IGNORES VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You recently reported about Brentwood and all the wonderful things Councilman 
Marvin Braude has done for San Vicente Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 This is astounding to me, since Mr. Braude's district includes the area on Van 
Nuys Boulevard from Magnolia Boulevard up to Sherman Way, one of the most 
unsightly areas in the Valley.I have lived here for over 40 years and have done 
most of my shopping on Van Nuys Boulevard, until the last few years when the 
nice shops left and we have nothing but tacky stores with tacky signs and 
merchandise displayed on the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Mr. Braude should take a trip from Brentwood, where he lives, to Van 
Nuys Boulevard, where he is supposed to be in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 To quote the article, "Low density, beauty and substantial public benefit, 
that's what I'm concerned about," Mr. Braude said. So take a good look at Van 
Nuys Boulevard, Mr. Braude's bailiwick, and you wonder how he can sleep at 
night.

FUTURE GETS HAZIER FOR EDWARDS AFB; PENTAGON REPORTS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO 
PRESSURE LEGISLATORS INTO DEFENSIVE ACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month, we said that the growth of Edwards Air Force Base was one of the 
few economic bright spots to savor in this region. Indeed, Edwards AFB in the 
Antelope Valley's high desert had actually grown and prospered in the rounds of 
military base closings to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we've had a month to savor it. Now, it's about time to start worrying 
again about the future of the sprawling 300,000-acre base. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last Monday, for example, The Washington Post was reporting that the 
Pentagon's top leadership has ordered each of the military services to plan for 
the possible cancellation or delay of nearly every large new weapons system now 
in the planning or development stages. The Air Force, for example, was told to 
prepare for the outright cancellation of a new attack missile, and for delays 
of from four to seven years on its F-22 fighter jet and its Joint Primary 
Aircraft Training System. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards AFB is the Air Force's top flight test center, and military 
installations that perform weapons testing functions have largely been spared. 
But 1995 and the next round of closings will be upon us before we know it, and 
the base closure commission is expected to take a hard look at test 
installations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer already have been entertaining 
thoughts about Edwards and have proposed linking it with other high-tech 
weapons testing facilities as a kind of "Southwest Complex." 
</P>
<P>
 In case you needed an indication of what kind of a turf battle this is going 
to be, it is only necessary to note the howl of protest that the 
Feinstein-Boxer proposal produced in Maryland and Florida, where bases that are 
similar to Edwards are located. Now is clearly the time for the region's 
elected officials to put their heads together to consider the Feinstein-Boxer 
idea, and any others that might emerge. The future of Edwards AFB may depend on 
them.

FACTS, FIGURES SHOULD SUPPORT PIERCE PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My July 31 letter to the editor questioned the equity of the use of hundreds 
of acres on Pierce College campus devoted to nine disparate programs attracting 
few students and inappropriately called a farm. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to my missive, the college president, Mary Lee, wrote a letter 
published Aug. 7, telling us anecdotes about the farm walk and the "wonderment 
of 3-year-old toddlers" looking at sheep and the function of the acreage as a 
nature preserve. The last sentence, purely ad hominem , implied I was a 
naysayer. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not a naysayer. I'm a truth-telling, reality-based taxpayer. As such, I'd 
like to know how many veterinarians resulted from the pre-veterinary medicine 
program at Pierce in the last 20 years. I suspect fewer than five, if any. And 
how many skilled jobs were obtained by graduates of the other eight so called 
agricultural programs? Besides the hundreds of acres devoted to them, how much 
does it cost us to keep these obsolete programs on the books? 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to share a little truth and reality with the public.

 I cannot believe the attitude of Mary Lee, President of Pierce College, on the 
college's journalism budget crisis. It appears she'd rather see Pierce 
College's most successful program go down the drain than provide the necessary 
support it needs.  
</P>
<P>
 As a graduate of the Pierce College journalism program, I am shocked and 
dismayed that one of the best journalism programs in the country is being put 
at risk. As a citizen I am worried that this disregard for education is going 
to continue to degrade every program to benefit the sports program. 
</P>
<P>
 The journalism program prepares students for a career and provides skills and 
abilities. The graduates who continue their education are guaranteed a place in 
society and the workplace. The athletics department doesn't provide that 
security. How many student athletes go on to the professionals? Very few. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lee better put her priorities in a proper place if she wants Pierce 
College to survive into the next millennium.

 A recent letter spuriously attacking State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal was out of 
line, mean spirited and totally unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 I have found Sen. Rosenthal to be one of the finest elected representatives I 
have ever worked with.He exhibits some rare qualities unfortunately missing in 
too many of our elected officials. He listens to his constituents, he cares 
about our issues, he does what he promises to do and he's accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Rosenthal has represented portions of the Valley for many years and has 
gone out of his way -- and beyond his own district boundaries -- to assist 
Valley residents when we have asked for his help. 
</P>
<P>
 When a developer wanted to bulldoze a four lane road into Topanga State Park, 
he sponsored legislation to protect the Valley's largest and closest state 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 When open space in the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area has been threatened 
with commercial development or industrial uses, Sen. Rosenthal has stood with 
the Valley residents in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 When a proposal was made to incinerate hazardous waste in Van Nuys, he was 
successful in forcing the State Health Department to withdraw its permit. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the author of SB 561, which will allow earthquake victims the ability to 
deduct 100% of their uninsured losses from state income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 I am delighted that my family now has an opportunity to vote for Sen. Herschel 
Rosenthal. Those of us who reside in the newly created 20th Senate District 
will be fortunate to have such a strong advocate on our side.

NEW PARENT SERVICES UNIT WILL OFFER EVEN MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As one of the many parents from across the Los Angeles School district who has 
been working on the development of the new Parent Community Services Unit, I 
found Beth Shuster's article, "Unwelcome Support" (Wednesday, Aug. 24) totally 
off the mark. This unit will in no way "take charge and standardize" Parent 
Centers or any other programs in this district, as charged in the article. 
</P>
<P>
 On the contrary, this historic new unit can be viewed as a "One-Stop Super 
Store" of services, training and support for parents and parent groups. 
Although all schools will be informed of its offerings, individual schools and 
clusters will make decisions regarding their specific needs and will be able to 
use the units as a resource for obtaining what they need. For once, parents 
whose children need help will be able to call one number and get results, 
rather than having to fight their way through the complicated LAUSD maze. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Valley parents will not be legally able to avail themselves of these 
services unless the board approves the General Fund Allocation, which has been 
recommended by the superintendent, when the board votes on the final budget 
Monday.

'BUSINESS FRIENDLY' CURE WORSE THAN DISEASE; GRANTING LIQUOR LICENSES TO SPUR 
THE LOCAL ECONOMY WORSENS CRIME, LOWERS THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN OUR COMMUNITIES 
AND GIVES RESIDENTS ANOTHER REASON TO LEAVE LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SCHULTZ, Don Schultz is president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. and a 
director of the San Fernando Valley Alcohol Policy Coalition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deplorable aspect of the "business friendly" attitude in City Hall may 
actually be contributing to the migration of residents from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 With the economic upturn in Los Angeles lagging far behind other major U.S. 
cities, policy makers at the state and city levels are desperately attempting 
to spur the local economy. Unfortunately, they are doing it by sacrificing 
various environmental protections and limiting public participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers demand due process in the courts when attempting to make a case 
against decisions that hamper their projects. Homeowners deserve due process, 
too. If they want to protect their neighborhoods from a development that will 
cause problems, they deserve the same consideration from City Council that the 
developer gets. But they are seldom afforded even a reasonable amount of time 
at council meetings to make their case. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowner organizations are an important safeguard in protecting the integrity 
of residential neighborhoods. When they are purposely eliminated from the 
planning process, that safeguard is compromised. My own organization, the Van 
Nuys Homeowners Assn., was recently frozen out of the final stages of 
negotiations over the layout of a supermarket and other stores at Hayvenhurst 
Avenue and Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that the economy needs a shot in the arm and that some 
businesses have relocated to greener pastures in other states. But that should 
not mean favoring businesses such as liquor stores and convenience markets 
offering liquor in high-crime areas and locating pawn shops adjacent to 
residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan's campaign promise to make Los Angeles streets safer by 
adding 3,000 officers to the police force and developing a "business friendly" 
attitude at City Hall has the potential to improve everyone's life in this 
city. But 3,000 more policemen would not be enough enforcement to offset the 
increased street crime brought by additional alcohol licenses in high-crime 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime examples are in South-Central Los Angeles and the Westlake 
Pico-Union district of the inner city. There the state had the opportunity to 
limit liquor sales in areas of high crime and a heavy over-concentration of 
alcohol outlets. But instead of recognizing the problem, the state sought only 
to increase revenue by issuing one liquor license after another, knowing the 
social problems that these additional liquor outlets caused. 
</P>
<P>
 This is also happening in the San Fernando Valley. Based on crime statistics 
and the number of existing outlets, parts of North Hollywood, Van Nuys, Pacoima 
and Canoga Park should not get new liquor stores -- but they do. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles has an established conditional-use permit process, 
which has coordinated local control over new alcohol license requests with 
local land-use policy. For the most part, this process has been effective. 
</P>
<P>
 However, recent decisions reflect a new, less-restrictive attitude. The Board 
of Zoning Appeals has overturned six out of 10 zoning administrator's decisions 
in the past few months in which the zoning administrator made the appropriate 
finding and denied a liquor license request. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, I will shortly be testifying before a City Council committee to 
protest the zoning board's overturning of a license denial to a market on 
Sherman Way in North Hollywood. Owners of the market on Bel Air Avenue want to 
sell beer and wine even though this census tract has ample supplies: eight 
off-site liquor licenses, two more than the number recommended by the state 
Alcoholic Beverage Control Department. In addition, the property is in police 
crime reporting district No. 1511, which shows 829 crimes, 58% more than the 
city's "high crime" threshold, 524. 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again I have heard zoning board members explain the questionable 
granting of unneeded liquor licenses with the rationale that Los Angeles needs 
to encourage small business. 
</P>
<P>
 The give-them-what-they-want attitude must not prevail. The more liquor 
outlets that there are in a neighborhood, the more crime a neighborhood must 
suffer. It's as simple as that, and the government knows it. It's why the ABC 
guidelines include crime data as well as population. 
</P>
<P>
 A healthy economy and adequate law enforcement are on the horizon for Los 
Angeles, but neither is present today. Sacrificing public safety for the wrong 
types of new businesses will send the wrong message to those of us waiting 
patiently for Los Angeles to recover.

24TH DISTRICT RACE FOR HOUSE SEAT PROMISES TO BE INTERESTING; SO FAR, REP. 
ANTHONY BEILENSON HAS BEATEN ALL CHALLENGES, FROM REDISTRICTING TO POLITICAL 
RIVALS, BUT THERE IS YET ANOTHER THIS YEAR: REPUBLICAN RICHARD SYBERT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CLARKE, Paul Clarke of Northridge is a corporate political consultant. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People have been out to get U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) for 
18 years. It's not only the candidates who have run against him since 1976. 
It's even other elected officials who have twice tried to reapportion him back 
to his private law practice. Each time, Beilenson has beaten back the 
challenges to hold on to his seat while the pundits were writing his political 
obituary. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson's first race in the 24th District, which straddles the Santa Monica 
Mountains, was against Tom Bartman, who was later to serve on the L.A. Board of 
Education. Bartman won the San Fernando Valley's flatlands. Beilenson won the 
Westside. They split the hillsides. The Westside's weight was enough to give 
Beilenson the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who reapportion congressional seats have tried to give Beilenson a 
district that he would have a tough time holding on to. In 1981, the late Rep. 
Phil Burton punished Beilenson for refusing his support for House majority 
leader. Burton moved Beilenson's district farther into the Valley to make room 
for districts he had tailored for Howard Berman and Mel Levine. School board 
member David Armor raised a big war chest in 1982, with help from the national 
Republican establishment. He lost to Beilenson by nearly 47,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the politicians considered Beilenson expendable. Liberal-leaning 
Westsiders were needed to shore up other Democrat districts. So the Legislature 
pushed his district even farther from its roots. It now encompasses a smaller 
Westside portion and the entire southwest Valley stretching west to Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he was challenged by Assemblyman Tom McClintock, whose Assembly 
district was centered in Thousand Oaks and who had participated in drawing the 
district's new boundaries. McClintock didn't even match Armor's showing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the boundary changes, Beilenson's remains one of California's 
highest per-capita-income congressional districts. Its voters are 
overwhelmingly Anglo. They are mostly professional and managerial. It's full of 
families who own their own homes. It's the American Dream district. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley and the other-points-west portions of his district tend to vote 
more conservatively than Beilenson. This was Reagan country in 1980 and 1984. 
It went narrowly for George Bush in 1988. It went for Bill Clinton in 1992 by a 
smaller margin than other suburban areas of Los Angeles County. But, each time, 
even the Valley portion went solidly for Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Beilenson's traditional strengths with voters has been his 
unwillingness to compromise his principles in return for support. If he 
disagrees with you, he will tell you so straight out and tell you why he feels 
the way he does. If you still disagree, it's OK with him. People of good will 
sometimes disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a parade of "sacrificial lamb" candidates who have been put up against 
him with little chance to win, Beilenson still debates each one of them 
multiple times. Audiences typically come away saying, "I may not agree with his 
positions, but he believes in what he says." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 31 years in public office, Beilenson has played the role of maverick. 
His independent streak may be one reason his Democrat colleagues have twice 
tried to reapportion him out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson also has a knack for surprising even his most ardent supporters. He 
wrote an article some years ago suggesting that Social Security benefits be 
taxed. Taking that position is the closest thing to political suicide any 
politician can commit. Nearly 40 million senior citizens, who vote in higher 
numbers than any other group, have crucified politicians for less. Beilenson 
survives. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago he co-sponsored a Republican congressman's bill to deny 
automatic citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. Liberal 
groups were outraged. Beilenson survives. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponent this time, Richard Sybert, is a former Pete Wilson appointee who 
moved into the district to run. He is employing the now familiar tactic of 
using a portion of his sizable wealth to finance his campaign. That funding 
helped him outdistance a large field in the Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert's themes mirror those of past opponents -- Beilenson is too liberal for 
the district, he's been there too long, he doesn't really live here, he's part 
of the House leadership that's been obstructing meaningful legislation for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet on this page two weeks ago when both candidates put forth their visions of 
welfare reform, with some minor exceptions, both proposals were the same. 
Strikingly, both leaned toward a traditional conservative point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, both candidates are doing the fund-raising and organizing work 
that has to be done to finance the mailings that will overflow mailboxes in the 
final weeks of the campaign. Sybert will bring more funds than the usual 
challenger to the fight. But others in the past have brought hefty war chests 
to the battle only to be defeated handily by Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, the challenger is grousing that the incumbent is doing 
opposition research on him. Most challengers don't have a public service record 
to attack. Sybert does, and Beilenson's operatives are moving to take whatever 
advantage they can of any missteps Sybert may have made. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Sybert's anti-incumbent message hit home this time? Will lack of 
political coverage produced by the O.J. Simpson trial during the last six weeks 
of the campaign help or hurt the incumbent? Will the campaign fall off the 
issues wagon into the muddle of name-calling ooze? 
</P>
<P>
 As the election approaches, I will look at the issues and styles separating 
the two candidates and the course of their campaigns as they enter the home 
stretch. Stay tuned. This one could be interesting.

 THEIR LEAGUE: A new baseball league makes its debut here with three games 
today. It's the Women's National Adult Baseball Assn., beginning its first 
season. Playing in the first game at Pacifica High School in Garden Grove is 
Pepper's Peaches, named after their backer, Pepper Davis, 70, of Van Nuys, a 
star in the short-lived women's pro league that was a basis for the movie "A 
League of Their Own." . . . . Davis is excited to be back in baseball: "We're 
here to put the joy back into the game."

 HIGH OPERA: If you didn't make it to see the Big Three -- Placido Domingo, 
Luciano Pavarotti and Jose Carreras -- in concert at Dodger Stadium in June, 
you can catch their act for free Monday night at Triangle Square in Costa Mesa. 
. . . A tape of the concert will be shown on an outdoor screen in the shopping 
center's town square at 10 p.m. Afterward, the Virgin Megastore will keep its 
doors open to midnight, if you want to be among the first to purchase the 
concert in video, CD or cassette form -- official first sale day is Tuesday.

talk shows, religion and music -- all broadcast in their native language. Plans 
are in the making to syndicate the program in other cities across the nation. .

 CRYING FOWL: When Knott's Berry Farm built a pond next to its Independence

many of them dropped off as unwanted pets by their owners. People often drop 
off chickens too. . . . "Some people think of Knott's as an animal orphanage," 
grouses spokesman Bob Ochsner. But the amusement park has made them its own: 
when it had to drain the lake temporarily this summer, it moved the ducks to a 
lake in Camp Snoopy.

2 WORKERS TURN RUBBLE INTO PROFIT FOR FILLMORE; AFTERMATH: BRICKS THAT FELL 
DURING THE JAN. 17 EARTHQUAKE ARE BEING HAND-CLEANED, THEN SOLD FOR WALKWAYS, 
WALLS AND OTHER LOCAL USES. 
</P>

 One by one, Bruce Munoz and Jose Herrera slice white mortar from red-clay 
bricks. Using air-powered chisels, they peel away the cement that once glued 
together Fillmore's turn-of-the-century buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men work eight hours a day on the huge piles of bricks, literally 
scraping a profit from the rubble of the Jan. 17 earthquake that devastated 
downtown Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Used brick fetches a premium these days, and these men are converting waste 
heaps into a popular material for walkways, walls and other brickwork. 
</P>
<P>
 When they finish with one, they lug it to a flat wooden pallet nearby. There 
it joins about 70,000 others hand-cleaned since June. They have a mere 500,000 
more to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first started off we were using hammers," said Munoz, cradling a 
power chisel in his hands. "But we weren't getting that much done so we started 
using the gun." 
</P>
<P>
 The bricks rattled loose last January when the 6.8-magnitude quake shook the 
buildings and their masonry facades. Many of them toppled into Central Avenue; 
others were deliberately dumped in the street as wrecking crews demolished 17 
buildings condemned as unsafe after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of six men was working at the recycling project, but federal 
earthquake-relief funding was pared earlier this month, leaving the two men to 
attack the seemingly endless piles by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a hot, dirty job that pays $7-an-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the dust gets into your lungs and you can't even breathe," said 
Herrera, 30, of Fillmore. "Especially on windy days." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before cleaning them, the two men must dig through the rubble-strewn 
piles to search out the fullest pieces of brick. They spend two or three hours 
of their day just gathering bricks to clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boss is a little (upset) because he wants more production," Herrera said, 
brushing sweat from his forehead with a chalky right hand. "With six people we 
could do about four pallets a day. But now we have to stop cleaning the bricks 
just to go and look for more." 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for their jobs runs out in December, when they hope to have cleaned 
more than 130,000 bricks. The Fillmore City Council plans to use them in civic 
projects and offer the bricks to downtown businesses during their 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do any better than putting (Fillmore) back together with the broken 
pieces," Councilman Don Gunderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the bricks, city officials hope, can be crushed up and used for 
ground cover at the city baseball diamond, or sold as-is to wholesalers for 25 
cents each. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are things from real life," City Engineer Bert J. Rapp said. "Sure, 
some of them are chipped and some are cracked, but it just adds to the (city's) 
character when you build something out of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the used bricks, which tumbled from turn-of-the-century landmarks like 
the Fillmore Hotel, the Masonic Lodge and the Central Market during the quake, 
already have been installed at the new sheriff's substation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made a sidewalk with the bricks," said Munoz, a 31-year-old father of 
six from nearby Santa Paula. "That's pretty neat because I can look back and 
show my kids what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Roger Campbell said he wished he had used some of those bricks to 
rebuild his home, which was knocked off its foundation in the earthquake. 
Instead, he bought used bricks for his front porch from another supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it made a real difference in how the house looks," he said. "But I'm 
going to buy some from the city and put them somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman said dressing up the re-emerging downtown with recycled bricks 
will maintain a sense of history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nostalgia thing," said Campbell, one of the first homeowners to 
rebuild after the quake. "I don't think of them as leftovers, I think of them 
as historical pieces. Besides, it was cheaper to do this than pay the dump 
fees." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council decided last week not to hire more help for Herrera and 
Munoz.

<P>
 Instead, they will keep as many of the bricks Herrera and Munoz are able to 
clean and reserve them for future city projects like the planned Central Park. 
Others they will offer to merchants rebuilding along Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, what we want to do is keep bricks in town if we can," Gunderson 
said. "It'll help us keep the look we had before the earthquake, or keep it 
authentic when it's restored."

TOUGH LEADER EARNS RESPECT AT YOUTH PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Youth Authority's Ventura School locks up a younger, harder 
breed of juvenile delinquent than it did 20 years ago, when Vivian V. Crawford 
was the school's psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, at 45, Crawford is wiser, more experienced and more powerful. Now 
she runs the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Named superintendent of the Camarillo-based juvenile prison 17 months ago, 
Crawford oversees more than 900 young murderers, assailants, robbers and 
thieves -- almost a third of them female. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising sexual abuse, gang violence and poverty have made tougher criminals out 
of the youths sent there, Crawford said. Some, she added, have so many problems 
and are so stubbornly resistant to treatment that they are doomed to lives of 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crawford said: "We never give up." 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years," she said, "I've found some of the ones you think were not 
going to make it have made it. And others, you put all kinds of resources into 
them, and they come back into the system." 
</P>
<P>
 As a strong administrator and the first African American woman to run a youth 
authority institution, Crawford has won almost universal respect from employees 
and supervisors, who praise her as tough, attentive and fair. 
</P>
<P>
 And while some wards at the coeducational institution gripe that Crawford is 
overly serious and refuses to allow the regular boy-girl social events they 
once enjoyed, others praise her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's a great role model to us, especially because there are so many 
females in here that are minorities," said Antanette Durr, 19, of Carmel 
Valley, who is serving time for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford has fought hard for the chance to earn that respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Born the eldest daughter of a tile-maker and a maid, she grew up in a poor 
family of seven children, living in the house her father built in segregated 
Palestine, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to schools with all black folks, my neighborhood was all black folks 
-- I didn't really see other people except to go out to stores, or people that 
my parents dealt with in their jobs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she turned 15, the family moved to California. Crawford traded the calm 
Texas town for East Los Angeles, arriving on the scene just as the 1965 Watts 
riots were about to explode. 
</P>
<P>
 She also found herself trading concerned, demanding teachers for a sprawling 
metropolitan school system where many students encouraged mediocrity and many 
teachers were, at best, indifferent about her future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a culture shock," she said. "In Texas, just about everybody 
studied and tried to do well. It was just the opposite in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 But in her senior year at Theodore Roosevelt High School, one teacher took 
note of Crawford's grades and encouraged her to try for college. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford was reluctant at first, but then she seized the opportunity and 
packed her final high school year with courses that would enable her to apply 
for college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to fight to take biology, I had to fight to take chemistry," she 
recalled. "I had to fight my counselor." 
</P>
<P>
 After earning her bachelor's degree in sociology at UC Santa Barbara, she 
moved on to the graduate school to pursue a master's degree in counseling 
psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford volunteered for a taste of her future life's work with a 
semester-long internship counseling inmates at Lompoc Federal Prison Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had a picture of it," she said. "I was this little, young person in 
a room with about eight to 10 cons." 
</P>
<P>
 She admitted feeling a little lost at first. But she said her charges, whom 
she calls "gentlemen," caused her no problems as she learned how to counsel 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 After earning her master's degree, she studied an extra year to earn 
credentials as a school psychologist, and began applying for work. She signed 
on as a school psychologist for the California Youth Authority and started her 
work at the Youth Training School at Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 After several months, she moved to the Ventura School, and then to the Fred C. 
Nelles School in Whittier, where she worked on a training team that developed 
special programs at five CYA schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found it rewarding," she said of her work counseling wards and training 
staff. "It's a challenge, but when you see a positive change taking place, it 
is very rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
 Wanting to have a stronger impact on the wards' lives, she pursued an 
administrative career. She worked her way up from an administrative assistant's 
post in Sacramento to a three-year stint overseeing educational programs back 
at the Ventura School. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, she further bolstered her skills at the CYA's Preston School of 
Industry in Ione, overseeing programs for intensive treatment, counseling, 
substance abuse and forestry. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, she was promoted to assistant superintendent, and then 
superintendent, of the 439-bed O.H. Close School in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 She then went to serve a two-year stretch as superintendent of the Southern 
Reception Center and Clinic in Norwalk, the gateway to the youth authority 
system for all young offenders. She returned to Ventura for a third time in 
February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 With an annual budget exceeding $27 million, a two-year college program, joint 
ventures with two private companies and the only female population in the CYA, 
the Ventura School is perhaps the most complex and demanding institution of its 
kind in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just purely a school," she said. "You've got to run all of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since arriving, Crawford has made several moves to improve treatment and 
education for the female wards -- not the least of which was eliminating a time 
limit on rape counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, you would go for six to eight weeks and then be cut off," said Durr, 
who serves on the ward advisory committee. "They'd expect you to get over it in 
six to eight weeks and then get on with your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford also made more programs available to the young women. For instance, 
she doubled the TV and sound production class from two hours a week to four for 
female wards, who once had half the time male wards had in that class. 
</P>
<P>
 She expanded the Free Venture program that currently employs wards as 
telephone airline ticket agents for TWA, allowing a Port Hueneme firm to pay 
wards to sew together upholstery, wheel covers and awnings for recreational 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford also set up a pre-parole life-skills class that begins 90 days before 
release so wards can learn the intricacies of job hunting, house hunting and 
home finance. 
</P>
<P>
 And she gave Eddie Cue, the school's gang information coordinator, the 
go-ahead to give a taste of life on the inside to youths on the outside who are 
at risk of joining gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the program has sent 3,000 Ventura County youths through the facility 
to meet with young inmates, who warn them about the dangers of gang life. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Wards) will say, 'I've never driven a car, I've never been to a prom, I've 
never been to a football game. It's 10 years since I've eaten a McDonald's 
hamburger.' And these kids listen to this," Cue said. "I put this request 
through the past three superintendents, and she said, 'All right.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford is a strong and fair administrator, said Allison Zajac, who has 
worked off and on with Crawford for nearly 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very thorough," said Zajac, former assistant superintendent of the 
Ventura School and now superintendent of the O.H. Close School. "She's going to 
be solid, and when she makes a decision, it is going to be well-researched, and 
she'll also consider the personal impact and the human side of the decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The union is also pleased with her, said Joe Turner, president of the local 
chapter of the Correctional Peace Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's doing a pretty good job," Turner said last week. "She keeps the lines 
of communication open. She has a real professionalism that basically the 
administration and the union both stand for." 
</P>
<P>
 The union is negotiating for more money to spend on counseling the wards, 
hoping to increase the time from three hours a week to 16 hours a week, Turner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarthy, 21, a member of the Ward Advisory Committee, who is serving 
time for murder, said Crawford is more receptive than her predecessor, Manuel 
Carbajal. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's more open-minded and more willing to talk to us," she said. "Her office 
door's open if we need to talk to her. . . . She'll hear us out, even if she 
doesn't approve." 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford said she has not been persuaded yet to give in to one demand -- that 
the school reinstitute co-ed dances that were halted several years ago after 
several wards got pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she is weighing the possibility of segregating more of the mostly 
co-ed classes by sex to make the interactions between males and females easier 
to manage. One hang-up is finding money to support the extra teaching time that 
would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a chore to supervise a co-ed situation, especially when they are the 
groups we're dealing with and the hormones are raging," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford, who is single, devotes long hours to her job, say co-workers. Though 
she has never married, she may in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 She does have a large extended family, including her late brother's three 
children, whom she is helping to put through private school. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the long hours, she finds time to travel to places such as China 
and Africa and to spend time with her relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford's greatest frustration, she said, is "the time that it takes to 
affect change." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just that when you're dealing with people, it takes a while for 
everybody to get on board and understand that you need to get people to the 
point where they're trusting your decisions."

VENTURA COUNTY FAIR; CHILI COOK-OFF HOT ATTRACTION AT FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just an hour after fair-goers descended upon Kris Pustina's stand Saturday 
with scores of requests for her special blend of turkey and chicken chili, she 
realized that disaster was about to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to cry," lamented Pustina, owner of Franky's Place of 
Ventura. "We can't make everybody happy now because we're going to run out of 
chili. . . . I'm shocked, I thought it would last to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pustina and her crew huddled together to consider what they should do. A 
minute later, a determined Pustina took off for Franky's to round up more 
turkey meat and search for leftover chili. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the 14 other contestants at the International Chili Society's 
district competition, the Franky's group aimed to please both fair-goers and 
judges with their simmering mixtures of meats, tomatoes, spices and beans. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Ventura County Fair entered its next-to-last day, fair spokeswoman Teri 
Raley said that by Friday evening, 193,844 people had filed through the gates, 
down about 5% from last year. The fair ends at midnight today. 
</P>
<P>
 Raley called the decline only a nominal decrease. "We're genuinely pleased," 
she said. "Obviously, we've been favored with incredibly good weather. 
</P>
<P>
 The chili cook-off -- held on a grassy, wood-chip covered square from noon to 
4 p.m. Saturday -- drew contestants from around Southern California and some 
chili enthusiasts from much farther away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I flew in from Salt Lake City last night just to come here," said 28-year-old 
Robert McMichael as he shoveled heaping scoops of beefy chili into his mouth. 
"My buddy David Stratemeyer told me about it. . . . It was the best excuse I 
could find to come see him again." 
</P>
<P>
 McMichael and Stratemeyer, of Calabasas, used to work together in Woodland 
Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a real fan of hot chili," McMichael announced, adding that the best chili 
has a good orangish-brown color that shows "it's been stewed with the tomato 
base and the chili pepper." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he said: "If it's brown, it hasn't extracted the fluid from the chili 
pepper." 
</P>
<P>
 And even though McMichael discovered a favorite delicacy with that "hearty, 
earthy flavor," he said none of the chili brews were spicy or hot enough for 
his flame-resistant palate. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the ones here have been tamed down from the real spicy flavor because the 
average bear can't take it," he figured. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the chili cook-off, Saturday's fair featured the second day of the 
professional rodeo -- which kicked off Friday evening and ends today -- as well 
as a turtle and tortoise show, an arm-wrestling contest and a cow chip toss 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the chili cook-off, participants started stirring and tasting their slushy 
mounds of red, orange and brown stuff before noon. They were given three hours 
to craft their brews from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm using something a little bit different this year," said Harry DeWitt of 
Santa Barbara, as he glanced over at his steel vat of chili. "Last year I used 
a little bit different spices, but they went bad over the winter." 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitt's wife, Dianne, who sported chili pepper shirt, shorts and earrings, 
has competed alongside her husband on the contest circuit for the last four 
years. They enter about 15 contests a year, said Harry DeWitt, 55. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitt used to have spices shipped from Arizona and New Mexico, but they 
weren't breaking down fast enough and left a gritty texture, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So this year, he bought his spices from a former world chili cook-off champion 
from Fillmore, and "they have a little bit better flavor" and a higher oil 
content, allowing them to break down more easily. 
</P>
<P>
 The change paid off, because for the second year in a row, DeWitt's "Ambrosia 
Chili" took first place in the taste competition, judged by about 25 to 30 ICS 
members and celebrity judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Second place went to "Gear Jammers Chili" by Bob Dylan of San Bernardino; 
third to "Double D Chili" by Dianne DeWitt; fourth to "Swick & Swick Chili" by 
George Swick of Bakersfield, and fifth to "7/8 Chili" by Kenton Stafford of 
Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 The people's choice award went to "Wild Wheat's Chili" by Gene Wheat of 
Angelus Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The cooks weren't the only winners. Hundreds of fair-goers took advantage of 
the chance to gobble up a wide sample of the spicy chili. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe and Lisa Garcia of Moorpark shared their 4-ounce white Styrofoam cups of 
the brew, which sold for 50 cents a pop. Lisa, 28, said the four or five cups 
they devoured were not a health concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we came to the fair," she said. "To pig out."

LATINOS BEMOAN THE ETHNIC SHIFT IN MOORPARK; POPULATION: WITH THE INCREASE IN 
ANGLOS, MOST RECOGNITION OF MEXICAN HERITAGE IN THE FARMING COMMUNITY HAS 
DISAPPEARED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a time when women in black rebozos would line Charles Street in 
Moorpark in a procession for the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny farming community used to regularly hold fiestas, its streets coming 
alive on Mexican Independence Day and Cinco de Mayo. But that was all a 
generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark is now one of the few California cities where Latino residents make 
up a shrinking portion of the overall population. 
</P>
<P>
 As the debate heightens over immigrants and their impact on California, 
old-timers in Moorpark provide a different spin on the issue: It is Anglos from 
the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles who are invading this city. And it's 
people with names like Castro, Sepulveda, Lopez and Bravo who are lamenting how 
the newcomers have changed their hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican American gatherings of the past have all but vanished in a 
cultural shift that now reflects the complexion of Moorpark's new hillside 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The city stopped funding a Cinco de Mayo fiesta last year. And now the only 
real citywide celebration, says lifelong Moorpark resident Ruben Castro, is a 
Western theme parade complete with mock gunfights and line dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have Moorpark Country Days," said the 65-year-old Castro. "They play a 
little country and western music and sell hot dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro and his contemporaries remember Moorpark as a small town that was as 
much Latino as it was Anglo: Latinos made up at least half the city's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city's statistics were first broken down in the 1980 census, they 
showed that Latinos accounted for about 45% of the population. Ten years later, 
the figure had dropped to about 20%. Planners say that percentage has fallen 
even lower, and is likely to continue its slide as more upper middle class 
families flock to the upscale tract homes planned for hills that surround the 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot think of any other city in Southern California where this is 
happening," said Leo Estrada, a UCLA professor of urban planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada said the only other California cities he was aware of with a drop in 
the percentage of Latino residents are San Francisco, Redding and a small town 
in Sierra County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite interesting because it provides a flip side to what we're 
experiencing here in Los Angeles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What some of the locals in Moorpark lament most is what they remember as a 
tightly knit and proud community. Some worry that the influx of newcomers will 
roll over their history and erase it from the town's memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Historical Society President Connie Lawrason, whose husband is Mayor 
Paul Lawrason, said she does not know of any local tradition of Mexican 
American celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've looked through all of the old photographs and haven't been able to find 
any of Mexican fiestas," said Lawrason, who has lived in Moorpark for 10 years. 
"I've asked a lot of the old-timers and nobody seems to remember any of those 
festivals." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro shrugs off such suggestions. "Ask anyone that grew up here," he said. 
"They don't remember, either because they weren't here or because they're 
white." 
</P>
<P>
 A farm town before World War II, Moorpark was largely segregated. Latinos 
lived on the east side of the railroad tracks that dissect the town and shopped 
mostly at their own stores, such as Castro's father's store La Mas Barata . 
</P>
<P>
 The town's Latino population had separate celebrations from the town's Anglos, 
Castro said. He and his neighbors attended a segregated elementary school on 
Charles Street up until the fourth grade. When they went to the movies they 
were allowed to sit only on the right side of the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah it was a racist place, but no different from the rest of California," 
said Moorpark resident Henry Bravo, 68. 
</P>
<P>
 World War II broke down many barriers. While on leave from the Army, Bravo 
remembers seeing Latinos protesting the segregated seating at the local 
theater. "They figured if we were good enough to get shot up in the war and die 
over there we were good enough to sit anywhere we wanted to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo, like other young Latino men, returned from the war in uniform and 
demanded equal treatment. He was the first Latino to move his family across the 
railroad tracks to a housing development called Sunshine Acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Latino residents are concentrated on both sides of the tracks in that part 
of the city, around High Street. Many of the modest single-story homes in that 
area have become run-down. Bravo says newly arrived Mexican immigrants crowd as 
many as three or four families into a home, looking to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood's character contrasts sharply with the bigger tract homes in 
the hills. Homes with sloping porches and dirt yards have chickens and roosters 
strutting about inside a fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting under a carob tree he planted behind his well-kept home nearly 40 
years ago, Bravo reels off the Spanish surnames of the families from his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's old-time Moorpark," he said. "Some of them are still around, but a lot 
of them are dead or gone."  
</P>
<P>
 Then he lists some of the men who served in WWII, Korea and Vietnam 
memorialized on a plaque on the corner of Moorpark and Los Angeles avenues. 
"I'd say 60% of those boys names are Hispanic," he said. "We had a town with 
pride. We don't have that anymore; it will never come back. That's history." 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo fondly recalls the Mexican bands that used to perform at the T.B.S. 
Dance Hall on Charles and Bard streets. His wife was a ticket taker there in 
her youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance hall is gone, he said, as are the dances. "All they do now is this 
parade," he said. "There is no dancing. And the only band they have is the 
Moorpark High School Band. You see group after group of white kids on these 
floats. You very seldom see a Chicano kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark was a town of about 1,200 in the 1930s and 1940s. It grew to about 
7,000 people by 1980. That's when things changed the most. The apricot, walnut 
and citrus orchards gave way to housing developments. Between 1983, when the 
town incorporated, and today, the town has grown almost four-fold with a 
population of about 28,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind the growth," Bravo said. "What I mind is that they seem to 
ignore us. Everything in this town is done for them. They forget we're still 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 A local Republican group last month invited Bernardo Perez, the city's only 
Latino city councilman, to spend an evening in one of the hillside 
neighborhood's centers. He was asked to join in a debate on the Save Our State 
initiative on the November ballot. His argument that Mexican immigrants help 
the California economy did not seem to sway any of the hillside residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said it struck him as ironic that the debate was held in hills 
overlooking the historic center of town. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to Moorpark in 1970 because of the even ethnic mix and the small-town 
atmosphere. He said his challenge during his six years in office has been to 
bridge the gap between the Latinos who live downtown and the Anglos in the 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what people miss is that a community can thrive by accepting change," 
he said. "These sorts of shifts -- going either way -- are nothing new under 
the sun for California. It's ironic that people, especially here, don't realize 
that. But the negative light cast on the immigration issue makes it that much 
more difficult for people to accept someone who's different." 
</P>
<P>
 Susano Lopez, 93, brought his family to California from Mexico in the late 
1920s. They settled in Moorpark in 1936. For decades he worked on the local 
ranches and in the orchards. His son, Benny, 67, followed in his father's 
footsteps, working his way up to crew foreman for a citrus grower. 
</P>
<P>
 They live in one of the oldest Latino neighborhoods in town called the 
Virginia Colony or La Colonia. It was only four years ago that their streets 
were paved. The homes they built with their own hands sit in the shadow of a 
freeway overpass next to the Arroyo Simi.  
</P>
<P>
 "We built something here," said Benny Lopez. "I mean look at it. It's 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Lopez doesn't begrudge the newcomers. He welcomes them, but he 
misses the celebrations of his youth -- the Mexican dances, and the festivals 
when the workers finished a harvest.  
</P>
<P>
 "I take a walk every morning and I see those big houses up there," he said. 
"They're really nice. I wonder though if they know what it was like here." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of local women who call themselves the Guadalupanas formed about 10 
years ago to try to keep some of the local Mexican American traditions alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Ruiz, 59, said the group's activities center around the church and the 
annual feast day for Our Lady of Guadalupe, in honor of an apparition of the 
Virgin Mary in Mexico in 1531. But since a new chapel was built outside 
downtown, she said, participation has begun to falter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes on and off," she said. "We try to keep it alive and we still have 
special masses, but doing something like the Cinco de Mayo just takes so many 
permits and things." 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Silos, another member of the Guadalupanas, said part of the 
responsibility for keeping the traditions alive falls on the younger generation 
of Latinos. Her father, a ranch hand, sponsored the local Mexican Independence 
Day celebration into the 1950s. She remembers fondly the traditional dancing, 
music and food that made up the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the younger generation doesn't want to participate," she said. "It's 
all about remembering your history and where you come from. You have to want to 
celebrate that." 
</P>
<P>
 Eloise Brown, a former city councilwoman who came to Moorpark in 1980, said 
she doesn't believe the Latino culture is being subverted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember culture can't be maintained by government fiat but by 
the people that appreciate it," Brown said. "It might be that the new people 
coming in want to have an Oktoberfest, who knows, but you can't depend on 
someone else to protect your culture." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ruben Castro, the responsibility falls on the whole community not to 
forget. He admits that he has little contact with the "people in the hills," 
but wishes that they could work to bring the community together. He wishes the 
hillside dwellers would venture into town and embrace Moorpark's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't talk to each other," he said. "But our issues are the same. We want 
good schools, a secure neighborhood that's crime-free, and an economy with good 
jobs. We worked hard to get that here, and we want them to remember that."

THOUSAND OAKS PATRONS WILL GO THE EXTRA MILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once a week, Marilyn Kellogg and her 8-year-old daughter, Kristi, drive from 
their home in Camarillo to the Thousand Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Ventura County library system has a branch in Camarillo, Kellogg 
prefers the city-run library in Thousand Oaks. It has more materials, more 
staff and is open more hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming here ever since they opened the library," she said. "There's 
just so many more books. It's a great library." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks officials opened their library in 1982 in the belief that they 
could provide better service than the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Thousand Oaks Library, which includes a branch in Newbury Park, is 
widely considered among librarians and patrons to be the best in the county. It 
is also the most heavily used, with an average of 1.4 million books checked out 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a phenomenal use level for a community of 110,000 (people)," said 
Steve Brogden, deputy director of the library. "Our circulation is among the 
highest in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Library also boasts the largest book collection of any 
single library in the county, with 325,000 volumes, compared with the county 
library system's collection of 733,000. It also houses a large video collection 
and is renowned for its American radio and television broadcasting archives. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most important, though, the Thousand Oaks Library is open 55 hours a 
week over six days, far more than any of the county's 16 library branches, or 
even the municipal libraries in Oxnard and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the only library between Beverly Hills and Santa Barbara that is open 
on Sunday," Brogden said. The library is dark on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, thousands of residents from Los Angeles and Ventura counties, such 
as Kellogg, would drive to Thousand Oaks to take advantage of the library's 
extensive collections and services. In 1991, a city-commissioned study 
discovered that 38% of the library's cardholders lived outside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 To help pay operating costs, while giving more priority to its residents, the 
city began charging non-residents a $55 annual checkout fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of non-resident users has since declined sharply, there 
are still about 2,500 library cardholders who live outside Thousand Oaks, 
Brogden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some people, especially from Los Angeles County, where some 
libraries have been closed for a long time, come up and buy a library card 
without blinking an eye," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee has not deterred Kellogg from using the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it, but what can you do?" she asked. "I can't afford to buy a 
lot of these books." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Biery, the city's finance director, said about $2.5 million of the 
library's budget comes from a combination of property taxes, fees and fines. 
The city supplements the library budget with $2 million from its general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, the city spends $41.20 a year per resident on library books and 
services -- nearly twice the national average of $21.24. In contrast, the 
county library system spends $15.74 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs; there's no question about that," Biery said. "But the community has 
decided to make this a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 The only other city-based library in Ventura County is Oxnard's, which 
completed a $12-million state-of-the-art facility in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Oxnard Library is larger than the Thousand Oaks Library -- 
72,000 square feet compared with 62,000 square feet -- Oxnard's library budget 
and full-time staff are less than half of what there are in Thousand Oaks. 
Also, the Oxnard Library is closed two days a week -- Fridays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Santa Paula High School Public Library District operates the 
65,000-volume Blanchard Community Library, catering to Santa Paula residents. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Thousand Oaks residents, the high costs of running the city's library 
are outweighed by the educational opportunities offered to its youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of young people who can't afford to take college courses or 
that have no other access to books," said Mary Nuzum, a regular library patron. 
"With a library, you can educate yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Patti Hanson said her 10-year-old daughter, Jessica, is dependent on 
the library to help her with book reports and other school projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely important to students because they have all the reference 
materials they need," Hanson said. "We come here three or four times a week to 
check out books and rent videos." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rubenstein, executive director of the Thousand Oaks Chamber of Commerce, 
said the library is also good for business, giving the city one more advantage 
in attracting companies whose workers want and need good information services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of being a well-rounded community," he said. "When you have a 
well-educated community, it raises the socioeconomic level." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all of its resources, the library has had its share of problems. The 
Jan. 17 earthquake caused about $2 million in damage, forcing the library to 
close for three months. The building reopened in April, but repairs are not 
expected to be completed until late next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to budget cutbacks, a hiring freeze has been in effect at the library 
since 1991. At that time, six full-time staff members were let go. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Brogden said the library remains on solid footing, offering more 
services than many other city and county library systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this economic climate, we're doing very well to be open six days a week," 
he said. "People have heard me say this before, but this library limping is 
better than many libraries at a gallop."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; PRIVATE DONORS HELP REFURBISH AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty-five years ago, the federal government paid workers to build the Ventura 
High School auditorium as part of the federal Works Project Administration that 
helped lift the country out of the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, a group of Ventura parents, students and community residents 
finished refurbishing the Art Deco-style auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, public funds were unavailable, so most of the money came 
from private donors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,500-seat auditorium, the largest in Ventura and one of the largest in 
the county, was built by the WPA in 1939 when the school was the site of both a 
junior college and a high school, Ventura High School parent Valerie Chrisman 
said. The campus was called Ventura Senior High. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the auditorium's large size, which makes it a popular site for 
recitals and other local events, the building boasts amenities uncommon to high 
school assembly halls, Chrisman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditorium has an orchestra pit that sinks below the stage, a high-quality 
sound system and an ornate decor that includes an Art Deco statue and frieze in 
its airy, sunlit foyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a community asset," Chrisman said. "It's rented out all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of the building's value to the school and the community, Chrisman and 
other parents launched an effort three years ago to renovate the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this era of state budget cuts, the Ventura Unified School District was 
unable to pay for most of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The district paid to repair torn auditorium seats. And on Friday, the district 
paid workers to replace the roughly 50 auditorium windows that had been broken 
and cracked by vandals over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the labor and money came from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups of students, including the band and girls volleyball team, have spent 
hours sanding layers of old paint off blond-wood benches in the auditorium 
foyer. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ventura High alumni, the nonprofit Ventura Unified School District 
Foundation, local businesses and service clubs helped raise $8,000 to buy new 
windows and update the school's sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 Next spring, Chrisman said parents hope to have enough money to paint the 
outside of the building, restoring some of the original Art Deco detailing. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, she said she is excited for students to see the auditorium 
renovationcomplete when they return to school next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll see the little bits we've chipped away at every year have all come 
together," she said. MAIA DAVIS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FILLMORE; THEFT OF EQUIPMENT CHALLENGES STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A score of video production students at Fillmore High School have been 
learning this week that the show must go on. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the theft of about $16,500 in video equipment, the 20 to 25 students 
enrolled in the class at Fillmore Middle School on Shields Drive "have been 
making do," said assistant Supt.Jane Kampbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Rick Barber said the equipment -- two studio 
cameras, two field cameras, tripods, cables and microphones -- was reported 
stolen Wednesday from a room at the middle school used by students of the 
adjacent high school. A window had been smashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kampbell said it appeared that the thieves, who used a hacksaw to remove the 
studio cameras from their stands, knew where the equipment was. GREG RIPPEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; RATE HIKE COVERS COSTS OF RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perplexed Ventura residents have been calling City Hall to ask why they are 
being billed for recycling their yard waste in September when that service 
won't be offered by the city's trash hauler until October. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has received several calls since Monday, when E.J. Harrison & Sons 
began distributing brown barrels for yard trimmings to 21,000 customers in 
Ventura, said John Betonte, a city maintenance supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although E.J. Harrison won't begin emptying the 100-gallon barrels until Oct. 
10, the company is already bearing costs for manufacturing and delivering the 
barrels, Betonte said. 
</P>
<P>
 So the city agreed to let the trash company tack on a 14% rate increase to 
cover the costs of the so-called green waste pickup beginning Sept. 1, Betonte 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have started in October, but it would have been at a higher rate," 
Betonte said. "The yard-recycling program costs a certain amount each year to 
work, and they had to cover those costs. We decided to spread it out over more 
months." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in October, E.J. Harrison will pick up lawn clippings, small branches 
and other yard waste every other week on a household's regular trash pickup 
day.  
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to reduce the amount of trash going to the county's landfills, 
Betonte said. Cities are required by law to reduce waste in landfills 25% by 
1995 and 50% by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura has reduced landfill-bound trash by about 30%, Betonte said. The green 
waste program will help the city trim back landfill waste even more, he said.

SELF-RIGHTEOUS INTOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you were to think that our area is free of anti-Semitism and homophobia, 
I'm sorry to say you would be wrong. As my sister sat down to lunch with her 
children at a popular Westlake eatery recently, she heard a man speaking 
loudly. He had a Bible in front of him and several admiring listeners at his 
table. As he finished a reading from the Bible, he said in a pedantic voice, 
"And that is why to this day the Jews cheat us and steal from us." He continued 
to berate Jews and then homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager of the restaurant remained silent as this went on. So did the 
other customers. Unable to eat her lunch, my sister approached the man and told 
him that she is Jewish, that her children are Jewish, and that she found his 
comments offensive and dangerous. He responded in a hostile manner, while his 
listeners characteristically claimed, "We love the Jews -- they are the chosen 
people." My sister left the establishment, unwilling to engage in a futile 
theological debate with these people. 
</P>
<P>
 What would you have done in this situation? What should have been done? What 
did the average German or Polish citizen do during the 1940s? Let's not forget 
that another famous homophobic anti-Semite began with relatively few followers; 
we know the result. And let's not forget that the neo-Nazi movement is on the 
rise worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 If we permit ignorance and hatred to flourish in our communities, it will. If 
we permit people to misrepresent the Bible for their own purposes, they will. 
One incident in one restaurant in one city may not be much, but citizens of 
Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village, be aware. There may be an insidious disease 
lurking in your fair cities; it's called self-righteous intolerance.

BATTLING RV PARK PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With our beachfront condo being listed on the real estate market, the hot 
summer month of August would certainly seem like a logical time to sell. Not so 
in the city of Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 According to The Times' Economic Profile, we rate the very lowest in Ventura 
County. Home and condo prices came in at -23.8% below a year ago with beach 
properties down as far as 60%. The second lowest on the chart is the town of 
Fillmore, at -19.1%, which was practically demolished by the January 
earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, we were spared Fillmore's shock and devastation. However, we have 
our own man-made disaster: the proposed RV park. City Manager Dick Velthoen and 
his friends have held this city hostage for five years, creating havoc with 
property values. Surfside property owners are applying for, and getting, 
drastic property tax reductions based on these lower values, creating a fiscal 
crisis in Port Hueneme. We have become citizens at war with our own City Hall, 
and rightfully so. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the city has not received any approvals from outside agencies for its 
doomed RV park, the sensible thing to do would be to withdraw the project from 
the Coastal Commission agenda in September. That would free up to $2.6 million 
-- and could save our Police Department from the budget ax without needing any 
of the city's five new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 We are a city in tremendous economic peril due to the incompetence of City 
Hall. Come November, a change is necessary for our city's survival.

A DEAL FOR PERKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any time a candidate for office receives endorsements from public employees 
before the filing date, voters can automatically assume that a deal has been 
made between the employees union officials and the candidates to support higher 
wages and perks for the employees in exchange for a voting block of city 
employees. Employee perks can include city-paid expense accounts of public 
officials such as bar bills and expensive dining clubs and restaurants, or 
deluxe health care benefits paid by the city long after the officials have left 
office. These perks are seldom revealed to the taxpaying public.

SCOTT HARRIS: CHILDREN'S HEALTH IS OFFICER'S OTHER BEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Crime is down, and complaints against police officers are down. This trend is 
continuing." The connection crackled with static. "It's like a doctor looking 
at the vital signs of a patient, saying, 'This patient is not healthy. But he's 
moving in the right direction.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Mark A. Kroeker on the line. He's the deputy chief of the Los Angeles Police 
Department, and he called on his cellular phone while making his morning 
commute from Santa Clarita to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kroeker wasn't calling to talk law enforcement. He was indulging in his 
favorite off-duty pastime -- the World Children's Transplant Fund, a charity 
devoted to improving pediatric medical care on a global scale. Kroeker wanted 
to remind me that the last time we talked, before he was transferred from 
command of the Valley Bureau to command of the South Bureau, I said I might 
want to write about the charity some other time. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he suggested, might be a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the World Children's Transplant Fund, it helps to understand a 
little about Mark Kroeker. He might be the closest thing the LAPD has to Dudley 
Do-Right of the Mounties. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the force nearly 30 years ago, in the days of Joe Friday, when the 
LAPD, rightly or wrongly, was not merely considered L.A.'s finest, but a police 
department without equal. He took command of the Valley Bureau in March, 1991, 
not long after a new TV image became associated with the LAPD -- a gang of 
officers beating a black man in Lake View Terrace.

<P>
 Quick to acknowledge problems, eager to reach out to the community, Kroeker 
became one of the LAPD's best goodwill ambassadors. If he sometimes seemed an 
Eagle Scout, it also seemed true that Kroeker, the son of Mennonite 
missionaries who raised their boy in Africa and Europe, came by his manner 
naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the story of World Children's Transplant Fund. Kroeker isn't just 
active in this charity, he's the founder. Today, actor Lorenzo Lamas, the 
agency's celebrity spokesman, will lead hundreds of motorcycle enthusiasts on a 
70-mile backcountry caravan from Newhall to Lake Casitas to raise money for the 
charity. But in another sense, this journey began in a small town in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1987, Kroeker had traveled to the province of Cordoba, Argentina, 
as part of a police exchange program. An Argentine physician told him about an 
11-year-old girl named Veronica Arguello who was dying of idiopathic cirrhosis 
of the liver. A transplant might save her, but Argentina lacked the medical 
technology. Kroeker took it upon himself to bring Veronica, her brother and her 
mother to Los Angeles with the hope of locating a medical facility that could 
perform the operation as inexpensively as possible. He started a fund-raising 
drive to help Veronica, who ultimately underwent surgery at the Hospital for 
Sick Children in Toronto in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica's story does not have a happy ending. Her weakened condition and scar 
tissue from previous operations made the transplant process difficult. Her body 
rejected three transplanted livers. A group of supporters in Argentina, the 
United States and Canada mourned her death. Veronica's mother thanked Deputy 
Chief Kroeker for his efforts and asked him to continue to help children like 
Veronica, so that her death would not be in vain. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultations with leading transplant surgeons made it clear that the solution 
isn't to bring the children from faraway lands to medical centers capable of 
such feats, but to find a way to export the technology and expertise. A chief 
problem in the United States, Kroeker learned, is that people aren't aware of 
the acute need for organ donation. "Children are dying right here in Los 
Angeles because organs aren't available," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeker founded the World Children's Transplant Fund to encourage organ 
donation, to bring medical teams to the United States for intensive training 
and to help establish pediatric organ transplant centers. So far, the charity, 
based in Encino, has helped develop transplant capabilities at the Hospital 
Nacional de Ninos in Costa Rica; the Hospital Italiano in Buenos Aires, and the 
Filatov Children's Hospital in Moscow. Long-range plans include doing the same 
at hospitals in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Czechoslovakia and Armenia within the 
next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, Dudley Do-Right never did anything like this. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just the other day, Kroeker took a call from a grieving Whittier woman. Her 
16-month-old granddaughter had died while doctors searched for an organ. Now 
the woman wanted to do volunteer work for the World Children's Transplant Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeker says he has seen many happy endings as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of joy," he says. "It's been a tremendous experience for me 
personally. . . . To see a sick 2-year-old and a family that's all desperate 
and distraught. . . . And then, what do ya know, there's going to be a tomorrow 
for the little guy after all." 
</P>
<P>
 Such moments make Kroeker realize that the charity benefits much more than the 
children and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a beneficiary," he says. "I have been absolutely, abundantly blessed."

 Wetlands Tours--Guided public tours of the Bolsa Chica wetlands will be held 
Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The tours, sponsored by Amigos de Bolsa Chica, will depart from the wetlands' 
ecological reserve every 20 minutes beginning at 9 a.m. The last tour will 
depart at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Chica is one of the best bird-watching sites in the county. Birds likely 
to be seen on the tours include great blue herons, avocets, egrets and 
sandpipers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who would like to take the tour are asked to meet at the ecological 
reserve on Pacific Coast Highway about one-half of a mile south of Warner 
Avenue, across from Bolsa Chica State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Bird House--The Audubon House in Irvine is a great place to observe a variety 
of birds in their natural habitat. The house is located at a trail head leading 
to five ponds of varying depths. The ponds attract a variety of local 
shorebirds. Red-tailed hawks are also often spotted in the vicinity. The ponds 
also provide one of the last breeding grounds in Orange County of the 
white-tailed kite. September also marks the beginning of the migration season 
for shorebirds migrating from Canada, including western sandpipers, long-billed 
dowitchers and cinnamon teals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Audubon House also serves as a educational outlet, featuring programs and 
exhibits, and houses a small in-house library. 
</P>
<P>
 Open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily, the Audubon House is at 3512 Michelson Drive 
on property owned by the Irvine Ranch Water District offices. 
</P>
<P>
 To get to the Audubon House, take the San Diego Freeway to Jamboree Road and 
head south. Turn left on Michelson Drive, then go to the second signal and turn 
right. The street is unnamed, but the Irvine Ranch Water District offices 
should be on your right. Follow the signs leading to the Duck Club. The Audubon 
House is next to the Duck Club. For more information, call (714) 261-7963.

WESTSIDE WATCH: SENATE RIVALS BLOW THEIR OWN HORNS IN BILLBOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During his primary campaign, State Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) deployed 
billboards that showed him tooting a saxophone with the slogan "Too Old to 
Quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Now his Republican challenger in the 28th Senate District, which stretches 
from the South Bay to Venice, has a billboard of his own -- saxophone and all. 
Redondo Beach attorney David Barrett Cohen's dueling billboard reads: "Time to 
Change the Tune." 
</P>
<P>
 "It captures the people's desire for change," Cohen said. "It's the best way 
to answer Ralph's campaign in kind." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cohen campaign so far plans to put up one billboard, at Western Avenue and 
240th Street in Harbor City. Dills' campaign, which plans to place more than 40 
billboards, calls the move a ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Cohen) is trying to capitalize on 'Too Old to Quit,' " campaign coordinator 
Tim Mock said. "He's trying to turn it around and make it disadvantageous to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, don't expect the two candidates to turn a political debate into a 
musical matchup. Concedes Cohen: "I don't really play the sax. That's the one 
thing he has over me." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 ON THE BRANDO FRONT: Thanks largely to the O. J. Simpson case, the rumor mill 
these days has been spinning out of control. Try, for instance, finding out 
what drew a swirl of journalists, photographers and rubberneckers to Marlon 
Brando's Mulholland Drive home Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 We tried, and here are some of the reasons they offered: 
</P>
<P>
 He's dead; a low-flying helicopter pilot saw a body on the estate. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a false leak from a New York publisher seeking publicity for a new 
Brando bio. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a prank called in to a news station by a visiting paparazzo.  
</P>
<P>
 And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, two sergeants arrived from the Bel Air Patrol, the community's 
private security service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is anyone dead inside the house?" asked a reporter. "Actually, no," said a 
patrolman. "A woman called from the residence asking that we move everyone off 
the driveway." 
</P>
<P>
 A UPS delivery truck was granted entry. Ten minutes later, the vehicle tried 
to exit. 
</P>
<P>
 A momentary swarm. "What's in the truck?" "Is there a body in there?" a few 
intrepid reporters yelled to the harried driver. A denial. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen more minutes under the hot sun. Reporters interviewing reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Brando needs to do is walk up to the gate and show he's not dead," 
grumbled a TV cameraman. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercifully, a Los Angeles Police Department squad car pulled up. Finally, a 
definitive answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who told you to come out here?" a reporter asked an LAPD sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bel Air Patrol," says the sergeant. "I'm out here because you're out 
here. Now please get off and stay off the property."

YAROSLAVSKY, FEUER CLAIM OVERLAPPING CONSTITUENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky's decision to run for the Los Angeles City Council has 
already sparked soul-searching in liberal Jewish political circles on the 
Westside as activists decide between her candidacy and that of Michael Feuer, 
head of a highly regarded legal-services program for the disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political observers have even speculated that it will soon be evident 
either to Yaroslavsky -- who is hoping to succeed her husband, Zev -- or to 
Feuer that their constituency is not big enough to support both and that one of 
them will have to bow out. 
</P>
<P>
 Some would bet that Barbara Yaroslavsky, wife of a popular, 19-year veteran of 
Westside politics who was elected in June to the Board of Supervisors and will 
take office in December, is more likely to survive in this hothouse political 
environment. But others are not sure Feuer will bend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's in the race to stay, but there's no question that she has done 
him damage," said consultant Steve Afriat. "If I were him, I'd try to branch 
out and appeal to (San Fernando) Valley voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Feuer acknowledged that the road ahead has been made tougher by Yaroslavsky's 
decision. "But I like to take on challenges," he said. "I'm in this race to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have remained very supportive," Feuer added last Friday, "The message 
to me is that if the electorate will focus on the merits of the candidates, I 
can win. My challenge is to get the voters to stay focused that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Yaroslavsky said she has been heartened by the "phenomenally 
positive response" to the news that she had decided to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's good," Yaroslavsky said. "They should stick to their commitments. But 
there's enough people to go around for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed that former Los Angeles Board of Education member Roberta 
Weintraub, who is already in the race, and Deputy Dist. Atty. Leah Purwin 
D'Agostino, who is all but in the race, are likely to find their heaviest 
support among moderates. Others with their hats in the ring include Jeff Brain, 
a San Fernando Valley real estate broker; Bill Christopher, a Westside 
community activist, and Ryan Snyder, a transportation activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, 36-year-old Feuer has been executive director of Bet-Tzedek Legal 
Services, a platform that also helped spawn the political career of state 
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood). 
</P>
<P>
 During Feuer's tenure, one of Bet-Tzedek's most serious challenges has been to 
survive financially as the government grants it once relied on have shrunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapting to leaner times, the agency has launched annual -- and increasingly 
successful -- campaigns to raise private donations. Now, more than one-third of 
Bet-Tzedek's $2.9-million budget comes from private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the agency's board members are essential to Bet-Tzedek's financial 
strength, Feuer has been a key player in major decisions, including the 
selection of board members with more corporate experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Bet-Tzedek provides legal services to poor, disabled and elderly clients. It 
also has made a name for itself by providing legal aid to Holocaust survivors, 
victims of the Jan. 17 earthquake and small-business owners hurt by the 1992 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Feuer has used his access to political activists and contributors as the 
launching pad for his quest for public office. Virtually the entire Bet-Tzedek 
board of directors -- about 35 members -- have endorsed him. 
</P>
<P>
 In statements filed with the Los Angeles Ethics Commission in July, Feuer 
reported raising more than $60,000 for his campaign, making him the race's 
early financial leader. Critics, however, point out that half of Feuer's 
reported war chest consists of pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see how much of those pledges are paid now that Barbara is in the 
race," said one Yaroslavsky partisan, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as it became increasingly evident that Barbara Yaroslavsky would run, 
Feuer has shown staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, for example, a letter went out to hundreds of Westside Jewish 
leaders -- many of them lifted from Zev Yaroslavsky's lists of supporters -- 
urging them to back Feuer as the "tireless crusader" for the disadvantaged 
clients of Bet-Tzedek and a man of "impeccable integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 It was signed by several well-known Jewish liberals, including Bruce Corwin, 
president of Metropolitan Theatres, attorneys Lisa Specht and Ed Sanders, and 
community activist Marcia Volpert. 
</P>
<P>
 That these people would offer political backing in the face of Barbara 
Yaroslavsky's impending move was a good sign for Feuer, according to some 
observers. Their presence in Feuer's camp also points to some of the rifts in 
the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
 Corwin, for example, is president of Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills, where 
Barbara Yaroslavsky is a member of the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barbara is a very good friend of mine," said Corwin, a veteran of Democratic 
politics. "But Michael is an extraordinary person."

SCIENTOLOGISTS FILE PETITION TO RENAME STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some neighbors of the Church of Scientology headquarters in Hollywood are 
opposing efforts to rename a one-block stretch of Tamarind Avenue between 
Franklin Avenue and Yucca Street in honor of L. Ron Hubbard, the church's late 
founder. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they received a petition, dated May 26, to rename a portion 
of Tamarind "to honor author, educator and humanitarian L. Ron Hubbard for his 
specific contributions to the citizens of Hollywood and Los Angeles, as well as 
his contributions to society as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 But since the request was made, a growing number of neighbors have objected, 
saying that to put Hubbard's name on the street would jeopardize the 
neighborhood's historic character and too closely link the area to the 
controversial church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at L. Ron Hubbard as my leader," said Carla Robinson, a 
screenwriter who lives on Tamarind and is fighting the proposal. "And I don't 
want to create any allegiance with him or his group by living on a street that 
bears his name." 
</P>
<P>
 Practically since its inception in the 1950s, Scientology has been accused by 
critics of being a high-pressure business masquerading as a religion to take 
advantage of government tax exemptions. Yet the church has no shortage of 
high-profile defenders -- counting, for instance, numerous celebrities among 
its members. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether opposition to the Hollywood street renaming will head 
off the project. A church official said last week that the original petitioner 
has asked that the city delay consideration of the name-change petition. But 
Desmond Lew, a supervisor at the Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering, said the 
request lacked specificity and that the city would continue to consider the 
renaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Lew said the petitioner is Jeffrey Scott, whom church President Shirley Young 
identified as a Scientology member. Scott could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 27, Lew said, his department received a letter from Scott asking that 
the application be put on hold "until we resolve current problems." Lew said 
the letter did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually we get (a delay request that's) a little more in-depth as to a 
reason," Lew said. "I probably would like something in greater detail" before a 
postponement is granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Lew added that bureau officials are continuing efforts to notify community 
members of the application and prepare a report summarizing the response. The 
report must be approved by the full City Council before any name change can 
take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, when asked the church's position on the proposal, said: "Well, of 
course we're not against it. That's a silly question." But she expressed 
surprise that the city was proceeding with the application process after 
receiving Scott's July letter. "I don't know why the city would continue using 
taxpayer money for this after the petitioner has asked for a delay," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activists, meanwhile, are going ahead with efforts to block the 
petition. Kay Tornborg, an arts administrator who lives in an 85-year-old 
Craftsman-style bungalow on North Tamarind, says she has collected about 120 
signatures on a petition opposing the name change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all for people being recognized, but I don't think this is the way to do 
it," said Tornborg, who is not a Scientologist. "This gets into the very 
complicated issue of what the neighborhood is about. L. Ron Hubbard is not our 
exclusive interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals to change street names often cause conflict, with opponents 
typically citing the expense and inconvenience of changing printed checks, 
business cards and stationery. Last year a proposal to change the name of 
Brooklyn Avenue in Boyle Heights to honor labor organizer Cesar Chavez drew 
protests from some residents who felt the change would mar the area's heritage.

INNOVATIVE EDUCATOR STEPS DOWN; EDUCATION: RICHARD MOORE, ICONOCLASTIC 
PRESIDENT OF SANTA MONICA COLLEGE, RESIGNS TO TAKE OVER AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
IN LAS VEGAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BUZBEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica College President Richard Moore, who had foreign language tapes 
played in campus bathrooms, brought continuing education to thousands of senior 
citizens and expanded student diversity, announced Thursday that he's leaving 
his post after two decades for a similar position in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who college officials said was the longest-serving community college 
chief in the state, made the announcement at an emotional meeting with faculty 
and college officials, surprising many despite rumors that he had been 
considering the job of president of the Community College of Southern Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, 61, said he was attracted to the challenge of helping the college keep 
pace with the expansion of Las Vegas, one of the nation's fastest-growing 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to build and get ready for the next 50 years," he said. "They need 
to get the community college caught up with the town." 
</P>
<P>
 His departure shocked many at the Santa Monica campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I choked up when he said he was leaving," said Manahil Jad, student 
government president. "He's done a lot of good for the campus. He believes in 
people and he believes in their visions." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Quinn, chairman of the Santa Monica College Board of Trustees, said he 
was initially surprised by Moore's decision to take the Nevada post. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was sitting on the top of the world with all this success," Quinn said. 
"He likes challenges. He likes to start innovative things." 
</P>
<P>
 During Moore's tenure, Santa Monica College grew from 14,000 to more than 
21,000 students. It now sends more students to the University of California 
system than any other institute of higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after taking the job in 1974, Moore launched Emeritus College, which 
offers 3,000 senior citizens an education in everything from Yiddish poetry to 
Chinese exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also steadfastly guarded the budget of public radio station KCRW, 
fought for a bond issue in 1992 that provided $23 million for capital 
improvements and guided the recovery from the Jan. 17 earthquake, which caused 
about $75 million to $100 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be remembered for less dramatic achievements as well. He had Spanish, 
French and Japanese language tapes piped into the bathrooms, provided faculty 
members 30 minutes of free reading time a week and gave a restless high school 
graduating class a three-word commencement speech: "Feelings. Adventures. 
Ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a bright, creative leader," said Ilona Katz, a college trustee. "I'm 
very surprised we were able to keep him as long as we did." 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a feel for what the community would want in their community college," 
said Marilyn Hall, director of Emeritus College. "That was one of his 
priorities: Don't just start something, but maintain it. He's done that for 20 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 He has also kept a strong commitment to increasing diversity in the student 
body and faculty, which represents the ethnic makeup of Los Angeles, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore decided to apply for the Las Vegas job after a friend mentioned the 
opening. Moore will oversee three campuses and several satellite classrooms 
with 25,000 students. His predecessor retired this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said she expects Moore will be replaced through a nationwide search that 
will take six to nine months, although the trustees have yet to approve a 
recruiting plan. Moore has recommended that they appoint chief business officer 
Tom Donner as interim president.

LOS ANGELES CITY HALL JOURNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A summary of selected City Hall actions last week that affect the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * PAWNSHOP HOURS -- Instructed the city attorney to draft an ordinance that 
would limit the hours and manner of operations for pawnshops. Some pawnshops 
are open 24 hours, and others have drive-through service so that customers 
pawning items don't even get out of their cars. Police and neighbors have 
complained that these types of operations may attract criminal activity and 
create nuisances. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * NEEDLE EXCHANGE -- Approved a resolution that will allow the operation of 
needle exchange programs in the city. The resolution, introduced by 
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, is intended to help prevent the spread of AIDS by 
the contaminated needles of intravenous drug users. Councilman Rudy Svorinich 
Jr., in voting against the resolution, said he believes this is sending a 
message that the city supports illegal drug behavior. Passed 10-1. Voting yes: 
Goldberg, John Ferraro, Marvin Braude, Nate Holden. Absent: Ruth Galanter, Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 * LOADING ZONE PARKING -- Authorized the Department of Transportation to 
implement a one-year pilot program that will offer operators of commercial 
vehicles the option of buying personal parking meters enabling them to extend 
the parking time permitted in commercial loading zones, no parking zones and 
time limit zones from the current 30 minutes to a maximum of four hours. The 
first 30 minutes will be free, as it is now. Instead of getting a ticket after 
30 minutes, those with personal parking meters will be charged, via computer, 
$1 for an hour, $3 for two hours, $6 for three hours and $10 for four. The 
parking meters, sold by a private company, cost $70 and will be operated with a 
Smart Card Reader, which the city will sell for $4. Passed 11-1. Voting yes: 
Ferraro, Yaroslavsky, Holden, Goldberg. Voting no: Braude. Absent Galanter, 
Ridley-Thomas.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MARINA DEL REY; BOARD APPROVES CONSTRUCTION OF RALPHS MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite objections from hundreds of residents, the Los Angeles zoning board 
has granted a permit that will allow construction of a 48,000-square-foot 
Ralphs supermarket on Lincoln Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Zoning Appeals, responding to residents' objections to the 
project, denied Ralphs request to be open 24 hours, allowing the store to 
operate only from 6 a.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The company must also install double-paned windows and air conditioners as 
noise buffers on the adjacent units of the 685-unit Villa Marina condominium 
complex. Ralphs officials said they were uncertain when construction would 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents from Villa Marina have fought the project for almost two years, 
contending a market on the former GTE site would create too much noise and 
traffic and would annoy neighbors with its parking lot lights. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's approval has not fazed Terry Conner, who has lead neighborhood 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Conner said he was told by a Ralphs official that the project would not go 
forward if a proposed merger of Ralphs Grocery Co. and the Yucaipa Cos., owners 
of Alpha Beta, Food for Less and Marina Market, is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Conner said he is so certain that the project will be killed that he said the 
group is already focusing on opposing any future tenant that would lead to 
increased traffic and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ralph's official, however, maintained that the project will go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be very surprised if a Ralphs official indicated (the project would be 
stopped)," said Sandy Yavitz, Ralphs Grocery Co. vice president of real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative merger, in which the Yucaipa Cos. would acquire Ralphs, remains 
under negotiation. Property developer Jim Wood, who is purchasing the site in 
order to lease it to the grocery chain, said he was told by Ralphs officials to 
continue on. 
</P>
<P>
 If the merger is completed, some stores in overlapping areas can be expected 
to close, while an undetermined number of Alpha Beta stores would be converted 
to Ralphs outlets, sources have told The Times. Some Ralphs stores might also 
be converted to operate under the Food 4 Less warehouse format. 
</P>
<P>
 Yavitz declined to comment on the possibility of conversions. SUSAN STEINBERG

COVER STORY; A NEW AGE OF AQUARIUS; BOOMING INTEREST IN ASTROLOGY AND OTHER 
PSYCHIC ARTS MAY BE RELATED TO A NEED FOR COMFORT AND SECURITY IN UNCERTAIN 
TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Chris Georgas returned to Los Angeles recently after seven years in 
Minneapolis, she found herself grateful for a number of things: the weather, 
the presence of her immediate family and, perhaps as important, the abundance 
of stores and services specializing in the psychic arts -- astrology, palmistry 
and Tarot card reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminded me of Coney Island, with all the advertisements for shops along 
Ventura Boulevard and on Melrose," said Georgas, a Beverly Hills cosmetologist 
who has used the counsel of psychics for more than 30 years. "I was pretty 
shocked that it had opened up to that point. I just couldn't believe . . . the 
public display of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Long a haven for the paranormal, the City of Angels has now become a psychic 
Mecca of sorts. Following a 1985 state Supreme Court decision that overturned 
local bans on fortunetelling and psychic readings, shops offering metaphysical 
services, books and goods have proliferated -- with the Westside one of the Los 
Angeles area's busiest markets. No longer relegated to dingy private bungalows 
or semi-secret rooms above businesses, psychics today are reading palms, 
advising the anxious and surfing the astral plane in mini-malls, Wilshire 
Boulevard storefronts and -- most lucratively -- on private 900 telephone 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychics, of course, aren't for everybody; they have more than their share of 
critics. However, the growing number of soothsayers in recent years reflects a 
steadily growing demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public has become more aware of the metaphysical in the last five or six 
years," said Robert Leysen, who nine years ago founded the Psychic Eye 
Bookstore, which now has 10 locations throughout California and Nevada, 
including one on Main Street in Venice. "It has come out of the closet." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychic Spencer Grendahl, who teaches a course in palm reading at the Learning 
Annex in West Los Angeles, agreed: "The market has been rather flooded." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychics and others in the field say there are several reasons for the trend. 
One has to do with the general tenor of the times -- that is, Southern 
California's ongoing recession and the anxiety it provokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the economy gets worse, people get more interested," said Ed Helin, a 
psychic and astrology instructor at the Carroll Righter Foundation in 
Hollywood. "When things get bad, we always see an upturn because people like to 
know what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In Helin's case, the effects of such financial anxiety are readily discernible 
-- more than half of his work is for businesses that hire him to help in 
personnel matters, or in decisions concerning expansion or investments. Such 
businesses are image-conscious, Helin adds quickly, and put a premium on 
keeping their use of psychics a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor is the greater openness of people to consider so-called 
alternative philosophies, coupled with the growing distrust many have of 
science and technology. That willingness to ponder different, non-traditional 
realms of thought, say psychics, has led to a more tolerant cultural milieu. 
</P>
<P>
 "People weren't eagerly talking about their visits to astrologers in the 
1950s, but they were still going to them," said Martin Bravin, a clinical 
psychologist and director of the Psychic Science Institute in Encino. "Before, 
psychics used to be pulled in by the police. In 1994, they've got storefronts." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoed Century City attorney Barry A. Fisher, who represented the 
fortunetelling plaintiffs in the 1985 state Supreme Court case: "There's much 
less of a stigma today than before." 
</P>
<P>
 That has made soothsaying less daunting for prospective customers -- and more 
convenient for regular seekers of psychic advice. For Georgas, who used to have 
to drive to San Bernardino to seek spiritual counsel, psychics have always been 
worth the trouble to find. One, in fact, predicted her move out-of-state to a 
northern clime, which occurred when she later married and moved to Minnesota. 
Now, she consults a reader about once a month -- right in Los Angeles. "I just 
need someone to talk to, who knows more than I do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the tolerance now accorded palm readers and other psychics has in 
some ways made business tougher -- the result of greater competition. Though 
well-known psychics and places such as the Psychic Eye continue to do well 
(Leysen averages 55 readings a day in his Sherman Oaks store and around 35 a 
day in Venice), the hot area of growth is one that didn't exist a few years 
ago: 900 lines on which customers can phone in for readings by staff psychics. 
At $4 a minute or more, such services can be more expensive than private 
psychics, who usually charge around $100 for an hour-length astrological 
consultation and as little as $5 for a quick palm reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most successful service has been the 900 line begun three years 
ago by the Psychic Friends Network. The network, promoted in 30-minute TV 
infomercials in which celebrities such as Dionne Warwick and Phyllis Diller 
preside over re-enactments of psychic events, fields more than 5,000 calls a 
day for its 1,500 psychics. It may have seemed like an offbeat idea in the 
beginning, but executives behind the infomercial insist that a psychic network 
is fully in keeping with Americans' attitudes and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been using psychics and reading astrology for hundreds of years," 
says Robert Hoffman, a vice president of the Baltimore-based Imphomation Inc., 
producers of the 30-minute commercials, which air in 250 markets nationwide. 
"It's a very ingrained part of our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychics who work with private clients say that 900 lines can do little for 
those who phone in. Mostly, the psychics who staff the lines, they say, are 
those unable to sustain their own businesses and are therefore reduced to 
taking on anonymous callers. "They can't give you a good reading over the 
phone," declared Psychic Gloria, who runs the Psychic World shop near Century 
City. "A lot of people call them, (but) they're a rip-off." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, many skeptics make the same claim about all psychics. Gallup Poll 
figures show a minority of Americans profess some belief in psychic power (in 
one 1990 survey, 46% said they believed in spiritual or psychic power, while 
36% believed in telepathy and 24% in astrology). 
</P>
<P>
 Nonbelievers find that level of acceptance surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the triumph of hope over intellect," said Chaytor Mason, associate 
professor emeritus of human factors psychology at USC. "It's amazing that 
people hang on to this when time after time it isn't proven true." 
</P>
<P>
 Mason said many of those who believe in psychic power are "anxious, frightened 
people" who lead lives of much uncertainty -- like the actors and politicians 
who abound in Los Angeles. "This is a city built on anxiety and lack of 
support," Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Detective Tom Henton of the Los Angeles Police Department's Bunco 
Unit, which is charged with rooting out fraud, said the majority of psychics 
simply listen to people's problems and offer guarded advice based on 
intimations they pick up from their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety percent of the time, that's what people are looking for when they go 
to psychics," Henton said. "It's almost like a priest-subject relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Such soothsaying can spiral out of control. Henton recalls one case several 
years ago in which a man was bilked out of more than $200,000 by a mother and 
daughter team who were later arrested and sent to state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very common (for people) to spend $10,000, $20,000, $25,000," said 
Henton, adding that many customers become psychologically dependent on psychic 
consultations. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-established psychics such as Helin and Grendel don't deny that their 
profession has its share of people they say are poor or phony practitioners -- 
but no more so, they contend, than any other field. Eventually, they say, such 
psychics get weeded out because they fail to gain customer satisfaction and 
repeat business. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good psychic is not someone who tells you what to do with your life," said 
psychic Charlene Whitaker, who has been in business for 15 years and who 
teaches astrology at the Carroll Righter Foundation. "But there are a lot of 
people who are not qualified, who hang that shingle up, go to town and make the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Kaplan, executive director of the Parapsychology Institute of America, 
based in Elmhurst, N.Y., is more blunt. Although the psychic arts are 
themselves legitimate, he says, most of the people who practice them are not. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should be very skeptical of this field," said Kaplan, who recently 
finished a book on what he calls the hoax of the Amityville Horror. "It's only 
about 95% fake. Most of the people who try to make money in it aren't real." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Kaplan is an adamant foe of professional skeptics and debunkers who 
want to abolish the entire profession. "I'm not ready to throw it out just 
because the field is so filled with corruption," he said. "There is some truth 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in many instances, customers are looking not only for truth but for some 
psychological comfort as well. Psychics say that, just like bartenders and 
barbers and others who come in regular contact with the public, they spend a 
lot of time letting people unload on them, usually about career and 
relationship matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Leysen of the Psychic Eye said some clients have said they derive "as much 
satisfaction having a reading as visiting (their) psychiatrist." 
</P>
<P>
 Helin boasts that a good psychic can use his or her powers to "do in an hour 
what it takes a therapist six months to do." 
</P>
<P>
 For Isabelle, a retired writer in Beverly Hills, her patronage of psychics has 
as much to do with their company as with their prescience. Yet she recalls one 
instance several years ago in which her astrologer advised that a male friend 
of hers was about to have a bad accident. The next day, the man suffered a 
severe fall and ended up hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident, coupled with other pronouncements that have come true over the 
years regarding her personal life, has made Isabelle a stalwart believer. And, 
as the Swedish immigrant points out, in Los Angeles she is hardly alone in 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that especially here in this country, and especially in Los Angeles, 
more people believe in it than not," said Isabelle, who has been using psychics 
on an intermittent basis for more than 20 years. "Some of my friends say it is 
stupid because it doesn't exist. . . . For me, to talk to (a psychic) is better 
than having to pay for advice from a psychologist." Soothsaying 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunetelling takes many forms. Among the most widely used are astrology, 
palmistry and Tarot card reading.  
</P>
<P>
 ASTROLOGY: Perhaps the most popular of the occult beliefs, astrology is based 
on the assumption that the position of the sun in relation to the stars and 
planets affects individual fortunes and the character of certain days. Western 
astrology can be traced to 2000 BC and, until relatively recently, was 
associated with the science of astronomy. Each of the Zodiac's twelve signs is 
associated with definite character traits, temperaments and physiology. 
</P>
<P>
 PALMISTRY: Also called chiromancy, palm reading has a long history, extending 
back to ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome. Palm readers focus on four lines and 
seven "mounts" on a person's hand to analyze character and predict destiny. The 
lines, which run across and down the hand, are called the head, heart, life and 
fortune lines. The mounts, located at the bases of the thumbs and fingers, and 
on the sides of the hands, are named for various planetary figures and are 
supposed to reveal character traits. 
</P>
<P>
 TAROT CARD READING: Introduced in Italy during the 14th Century, Tarot card 
reading is used to tell fortunes and predict the future. Sizes vary, but the 
most elaborate Tarot pack contains 78 cards -- 56 of which are divided into 
suits of 10 numbered cards. The remaining cards are numbered from one to 21 and 
are adorned with figures that represent natural laws, elements, virtues and 
vices.

FOR SENIORS; L.A. SHANTI WORK BRINGS VOLUNTEER AN 'INNER PEACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joan Howard's life was getting smaller and smaller. Her fears were taking 
over, leaving her feeling empty. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was close to four years ago. Today, the woman who greets you at the 
door of her West Los Angeles home wears a T-shirt that says "Still Perfect 
After 60 Years." She credits her work with Los Angeles Shanti -- an 
organization that provides emotional support to people who are affected by AIDS 
and other life-threatening illnesses -- for turning her life into one of 
accomplishment again. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, a retired nurse, was taking care of her husband, a diabetic, and her 
father, a stroke victim -- both of whom died in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was totally overwhelmed," she said. "You muddle through and I didn't do it 
very well. I was bitchy, cranky, difficult and depressed and the only end was 
for the two of them to die and that's just so awful to think like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, she says, was that she was alone. Her children were too young to 
lean on and needed support of their own. She was, in her words, "burned out." 
</P>
<P>
 So after the deaths, she did nothing. She rarely left her neighborhood. She 
was afraid to drive at night. This college-educated woman had essentially 
become a recluse. Then one evening she was watching television and saw an ad 
asking for volunteers for Los Angeles Shanti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drove to the first interview at night in the pouring rain and I was 
terrified. I had never been east of La Cienega. But once I got there and met 
these wonderful people, I remember leaving thinking, 'Please don't turn me 
down, I want to do this so bad,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard admits she was naive because she expected to meet a lot of blue-haired, 
old lady-type volunteers. Instead, the majority were gay men. She had had no 
connection to the gay community. What she did have, though, was the conviction 
that no one should be alone when they are struggling with either their own 
illness or that of a loved one. She understood the struggle and eventually saw 
the similarities between the symptoms of AIDS and what her husband went through 
-- first losing his sight, then the use of his limbs. And her father's 
incapacitation from a stroke and subsequent dementia. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Shanti -- the word shanti means "inner peace" in Sanskrit -- has spent 11 
years caring for people with AIDS. Originally, the group provided individual 
counseling. Then support groups were formed to help those with HIV and 
full-blown AIDS. More than 50,000 people have used Shanti's services, which are 
free. The organization holds weekend seminars for people who have recently 
tested HIV-positive. And they operate 31 support groups for people living with 
AIDS as well as groups to help the bereaved, women with HIV, people who have 
suffered multiple loss and "significant others." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard and co-facilitator Chuck Russ lead a group for significant others -- 
people who have a loved one with HIV or AIDS. "It's a safe place where people 
truly understand what you're going through and how devastating it is for 
patients and for those who love them," Howard said. "We have parents, close 
friends, lovers -- anyone who has someone close to them with HIV." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Howard said, most people wait too long to join the group. By 
the time they do, she said, their loved one is so sick they are overwhelmed. 
Still, the group approach helps. "I have seen people come in who were suicidal 
and leave with their lives back. So, at least for a couple of hours, the burden 
is lifted and shared," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said that when she first started, the groups were made up entirely of 
gay men. But now she sees more women, and Shanti has started a group for women 
with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 She also remembers how she remained quiet for several sessions. "I was a 
nervous wreck the first few weeks but a young woman joined the group. Her 
husband had AIDS and I identified with her more. . . . I don't feel (nervous) 
now. There's nothing harder in the world than watching a loved one die and if 
you've played some part in making this experience less painful for someone, 
nothing compares with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Shanti is at 1616 N. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles. Information: (213)

DISEASES: LIFELONG HEROICS OF A 'TIN MAN'

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: A Man of Steel, David Altman Rises Above His Debilitating Lifelong "Tin 
Man's Disease" (cover story, Aug. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Hill-Holtzman's article about David Altman's success story, with the 
help of his determined mom, is one for (Steven) Spielberg to let the world know 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost too good to be true, and if it weren't that my own 
developmentally disabled daughter was able to accomplish against all odds, to 
be gainfully employed, live independently, cook, clean, shop, entertain, I 
would not believe Altman's achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for that uplifting true story.

 Re: Article on Brentwood in Westside Aug. 14 (cover story). 
</P>
<P>
 The photo of the San Vicente Strip on page 14 is either reversed or Brentwood 
has become so tony that only English cars are permitted and the traffic 
patterns have been adjusted accordingly.Apparently, I have been driving my 
Mercury Sable on the wrong side of the street all these many years. Will I now 
need a visa to enter this enclave from my less upscale neighborhood in Los 
Angeles?

 Re: Supplying Compassion, Aug. 21 (cover story). 
</P>
<P>
 In the article about AIDS patients and the elderly living side by side in a 
Palms nursing home, we discover that none of the regular geriatric staffers 
wanted to help the AIDS-afflicted.Administrator Michael Togan traced this to an 
employee in charge of staff development who had a phobia about AIDS, and he 
fired her. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the irony of this situation is lost on many readers and on writer 
Linda Feldman. In our New Age society, populated by Boomer managers, the 
Americans With Disabilities Act protects just about every employee from 
discrimination -- from those with acute alcohol problems to those who see 
"little green people everywhere" or any similar phobia. But the Politically 
Correct Police can run rampant over the employment rights of those who do not 
agree with their view of the world. Even if that disagreement is anchored in 
mental difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Suffice it to say that this country and this community is setting itself up 
for quite serious problems that will derive from the dictums of the liberal 
control freaks who have taken to telling us what to think and how to live. The 
issue here is that the self-righteous Politically Correct Gestapo views itself 
as possessing the right to apply a whole raft of double standards when it comes 
to their causes. Their dogma has this infantile way of running headlong into 
itself and I hope this terminated employee explores her legal rights.

SIT DOWN WITH LOAN ARRANGERS AT TIMES' EXPO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Learning about federal and state low-down or no-down mortgage programs can be 
time consuming and frustrating. Where to go? Who to call? What are the rules? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, now you can sit down with federal, state and commercial loan officers 
who can explain the programs to you at the first Los Angeles Times' Low-Down 
Home Loan Expo. 
</P>
<P>
 The expo, an all-day consumer education event, will be held from 10 a.m. to 4 
p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24, at the Burbank Hilton Convention Center, 2500 
Hollywood Way, Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Three one-hour panel discussions will be presented in the morning and then 
repeated in the afternoon. Experts will explain the programs in detail and 
answer your questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Learn about the FHA 3% down program or the no-down Cal-Vet home loans. Home 
buyers who want the money to buy a "fixer-upper" along with a home improvement 
loan can find out more about HUD's 203(k) rehab loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides answering your tax questions, the Internal Revenue Service can help 
explain the Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) program, which is available 
through participating cities. The MCC permits first-time buyers to receive a 
direct income-tax credit of as much as 20% of annual interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash-strapped home buyers who are looking for a bargain can sometimes find HUD 
foreclosure properties for as little as $100 down. Information will be 
available at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the all-day expo is $5, but clip the discount coupon in the ad in 
today's Real Estate section and save $2. 
</P>
<P>
 To get more details about the Expo, call TimesLink at 808-8463 and press star 
9420, or see the ad on K7.

HOT PROPERTY: STAND-UP JUST CAN'T SIT STILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 JERRY SEINFELD, star of the NBC comedy series "Seinfeld," has put the 
Hollywood Hills home he bought two years ago on the market at just under $3.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Seinfeld, 40, won Golden Globe awards last year as "Best Sitcom Actor" and a 
producer of the "Best Comedy Series." 
</P>
<P>
 His first book, "Seinlanguage," a compilation of observations and anecdotes 
from his comedy routines, was a bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brooklyn-born comic, who was raised on Long Island and made his mark on 
the New York club circuit before he started producing, writing and starring in 
his own TV show five years ago, has been bicoastal, with homes in New York and 
the L.A. area, for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Before buying the Hollywood Hills house, he owned a condo in West Hollywood 
for six years. He sold the condo for about $290,000 in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Seinfeld, who has been dating Shoshanna Lonstein -- a teen-ager from New 
York's Upper East Side who was a freshman last year at George Washington 
University in Washington -- is said to prefer apartment living when in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Hills house, which he bought for close to $3 million, is gated 
and has views from downtown Los Angeles to the ocean; a theater, guest house 
and 55-foot-long pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly 6,000-square-foot home was built in the 1960s by actor George 
Montgomery, but it was gutted and redesigned just before Seinfeld purchased it. 
It's listed with Joyce Rey and Jade Quittman Mills, both of Rodeo Realty, 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The house that is being used to portray O.J. SIMPSON'S home in the upcoming 
Fox-TV movie about the former football star accused of murdering his ex-wife 
has been put on the market at just under $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie is in production, with filming under way at the house. And though 
the nearly 7,000-square-foot, gated estate is in the Longridge Estates area of 
Sherman Oaks, it's being called "a dead ringer" for O.J.'s Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks house is listed with Connie Nelson at Prudential/Rodeo 
Realty, Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox had scheduled the movie to air on Sept. 13, one week before Simpson is due 
to stand trial on charges of first-degree murder, but Fox Inc. CEO Rupert 
Murdoch then made the decision to delay the broadcast at least until after the 
jury is selected. 
</P>
<P>
 TAMMI GOWER, co-owner of the Derby -- a celebrity-frequented nightspot in Los 
Feliz -- has purchased a home in the foothills of Griffith Park that was built 
in 1926 by producer Hal Roach Sr., of the original "Our Gang" and "Little 
Rascals" fame, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4,500-square-foot home has a rotunda in the entrance and three bedroom 
suites, each with a walk-in dressing room, plus guest quarters over the garage; 
a butler's pantry, skyline views and a pool with an underground grotto. 
</P>
<P>
 Listed first at $1.6 million, the home had been reduced to $845,000 when Gower 
"negotiated a significant reduction" and bought it for a couple of hundred 
thousand dollars less through Richard Malvaez at Jon Douglas Co., Los Feliz, 
another source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Derby, a year-old supper club with live music booked by Gower's partner -- 
ex-husband Tony Gower, was built in 1926 by producer Cecil B. DeMille as 
Willard's Chicken Inn, rumored to be a speakeasy. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1940 to 1960, the building housed one of the original five Brown Derby 
restaurants. In the '70s, the exterior was used as Arnold's Drive In for the TV 
series "Happy Days." More recently, some scenes from the film "Speed," starring 
Keanu Reeves, were filmed there. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothing designer MONICA HARRI has sold her Pacific Palisades home of three 
years to Tom Hormel, scion of the Midwestern Hormel meatpacking family, and his 
wife, Rampa, for a bit more than $2.8 million, sources say. The house had been 
listed at just under $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1929, the Mediterranean-style, 6,000-square-foot house was completely 
restored by Harri. Situated on a knoll overlooking the ocean, the home also has 
ponds and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Harri is moving back to her native state of New York, and the Hormels 
relocated from Brentwood, sources say. Sandie Sutton of Jon Douglas Co. had the 
listing, and Jody Fine of Fred Sands Realtors was the selling agent. 
</P>
<P>
 A newly built, 10,500-square-foot Beverly Hills mansion, which has elements of 
an old chateau but also features a 35-mm Cinemascope theater, has been listed 
at nearly $3.5 million, or $25,000 a month to lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Costumed trumpeters, valet parking, a string quartet and a gourmet buffet were 
all part of an afternoon party last week that was designed to market the house, 
listed with Sherry Sexton of Celebrity Properties in Beverly Hills.

HOME AT LAST; AFTER MAKING THEIR HOME IN PARK LABREA FOR 40 YEARS, COUPLE IN 
THEIR 90S TIRE OF PAYING RENT AND BUY THE FIRST PLACE THEY LOOK AT -- FOR CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN MELINKOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Had the same landlord since the Carter Administration? Stuck in the same 
apartment for years? Does it seem like you'll never own a place of your own? 
</P>
<P>
 Take heart, and meet Charles and Virginia Nelson, who finally bought their 
first home in June, after living in an apartment at Park LaBrea for more than 
40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nelsons, you assume correctly, are older than most first-time buyers. They 
may even set a record: Charles is 93 and Virginia turns 90 in September. 
</P>
<P>
 After 63 years of marriage, they were looking to buy their first home. (People 
ask Virginia Nelson why buy now? "I got tired of paying rent" is her answer.) 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, she saw a splashy ad in the paper for Country Club Manor in the 
Hancock Park area. The French Normandy architecture appealed to her, reminding 
her of places they'd stayed in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 She cajoled her husband into driving over and taking a look. "When I walked 
in, it felt like home," she said. "It's a little Old World, and I'm a little 
Old World." 
</P>
<P>
 Defying most people's notion of nonagenarians, both Nelsons are mobile, 
engaging, well-informed conversationalists. Their affection and respect for 
each other remains strong; they don't seem to waste time bickering. They give 
old age a good name. 
</P>
<P>
 David Long, the real estate agent for the building, didn't peg them as 
potential buyers when he first saw them. "I thought they were visiting someone 
in the building," he said. "They were sitting there in their Sunday best and 
asked if I was a salesman. They were interested in buying and they wanted to 
see a few units." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the home-buying bug bit, Virginia Nelson was decisive. Long showed them 
around and they settled on a first floor, three-bedroom, two-bath unit (the 
asking prices for three-bedroom units range from $229,000 to $449,000). 
</P>
<P>
 Country Club Manor was the first development they looked at -- and the last. 
After all, it had just what they were looking for. A concierge to call in case 
they need help. An on-site maintenance man. A maid's room in case they need 
assistance at some point. And plenty of Old World details such as leaded-glass 
windows and wide moldings. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 43 years, the couple rented a one-bedroom apartment in Park 
LaBrea, the 4,000-apartment complex at 3rd and Fairfax. They made many friends, 
but they also spent considerable time traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Nelson's career -- he was a film editor for 40 years, mainly at 
Columbia Pictures -- often took them to London, Paris and Rome for eight or 
nine months at a time. It was a life they both relished. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson worked with the big stars of the day and won an Oscar for "Picnic" 
(1955). At her request, Nelson edited most of Rosalind Russell's pictures (he 
does not call them "films"). 
</P>
<P>
 Much as they both enjoyed their overseas sojourns, keeping their Los Angeles 
apartment was important. It gave them a sense of coming home to familiar rooms 
and old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few years, they had considered their housing options. They could 
have lived in the Motion Picture and Television Fund retirement home in 
Woodland Hills. When they went to check it out, Nelson was turned off: "Too 
many old people." Friends in Texas were lobbying them to move close by and they 
investigated rest homes there. But none would allow them to bring their 
furniture. So, until a few months ago, they opted to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nelsons' choice of a new home seems perfect for their tastes and memories. 
The 1929 vintage building (its original sales brochure boasted of an ice 
machine in the corridor) was lovingly restored in 1990 by a Belgian developer, 
Daniel Boulange, with his own strong sense of European style. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they decided to buy, the couple told only one good friend. They didn't 
want people pooh-poohing their plan or finding fault with their choice. When 
their lifelong friend Marie concurred, that was enough. "We didn't tell another 
soul," Virginia Nelson said, until they signed the papers. 
</P>
<P>
 When they made their offer on the condo, Long cautioned that it seemed a 
little too low. Virginia Nelson, the family negotiator ("She's the general and 
I'm the private," her husband jokes) instructed Long to submit it to the 
developer. Sold! 
</P>
<P>
 But not before everyone concerned, including the developer, was assured that 
the couple would not be depleting their reserves. They were, after all, paying 
cash, which simplified the buying process. No pesky loan applications to pour 
over. They chuckle at the idea of getting even a 15-year mortgage at their age. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was still plenty of paperwork to go over, including pages of condo 
covenants. Virginia Nelson scrutinized the fine print with the help of a 
magnifying glass she keeps on a cord around her neck -- the same scrutiny she 
gives the financial pages. She plays the stock market with great enthusiasm 
that shows no signs of abating, devouring the latest issues of Fortune and 
Forbes for hot tips. 
</P>
<P>
 With no financing to worry about and a glitch-free, 30-day escrow, the Nelsons 
began telling their friends. Some came from out of state to make sure they 
hadn't taken leave of their senses. "They wanted to see where we were putting 
up housekeeping," Virginia Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 When you haven't moved in 43 years, moving costs can be a shocker. Last time, 
they paid $75. This time it was $700 to move three miles. They had the movers 
do all the packing. "Ten years ago it would have been a snap," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Nelson now has her first microwave, first dishwasher, first "trasher 
masher," as she calls the trash compactor. And, finally, they'll have room for 
overnight guests. Like many new home buyers, they ate out five times the first 
week they moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 They fret and apologize for not having everything in place three weeks after 
the move. In fact, they look remarkably settled. They've put up a street map of 
Paris in the foyer. The Oscar is displayed prominently and the living room 
walls are lined with oil portraits in gilded frames, painted by Virginia Nelson 
over the years. Nelson has gotten his easy chair's side table arranged with 
favorite books and 1950s-style transistor radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The still-packed boxes are off in the spare room and Virginia Nelson is 
starting to think about furniture shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nelsons don't think it's such a big deal to buy their first home at their 
age. Seems perfectly natural to them. And owning doesn't feel much different 
than renting. "I always felt I owned at Park LaBrea," Virginia Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is probably why they got their security deposit back.

YOUR MORTGAGE; PORTFOLIO LENDERS CAN FILL UNUSUAL NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 What are the pros and cons of using a portfolio lender? 
</P>
<P>
 A portfolio lender generates home loans that will become a part of that 
lender's own investment portfolio. This is in contrast to lenders who generate 
loans that are later sold to other investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders who sell their loans usually sell them on the secondary money market 
to Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Assn.) or Freddie Mac (Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corp.), two organizations that purchase home loans at a discount 
to resell to investors. Loans that are intended for sale to Freddie Mac or 
Fannie Mae must conform with rigid guidelines. Consequently, you'll find it 
harder to qualify for these loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Portfolio lenders usually have more flexibility in qualifying borrowers. For 
example, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae won't permit all of the down payment to be 
a gift if the borrower is applying for a 90% loan. Some portfolio lenders, such 
as Great Western Bank, will permit all the down payment money to be a gift from 
parents or grandparents on a 90% loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Portfolio lenders may be able to stretch the qualifying ratios if your income 
is shy of what would be required for a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Your qualifying ratio is determined by dividing your monthly housing expense 
(which is the total of your loan payment, property taxes, hazard insurance, 
mortgage insurance and homeowner association fees, where applicable) by your 
gross monthly income. 
</P>
<P>
 For a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae loan, this ratio shouldn't exceed 30% to 33%. 
A portfolio lender might allow a 40%, 50% or even 60% ratio, depending on how 
much cash you have to put down and if your credit rating is superb. 
</P>
<P>
 Portfolio lenders are not only more flexible in approving borrowers, they also 
have more latitude in approving property condition. A portfolio lender might be 
your only option if you need an "as is" loan to buy a property in its present 
condition. Some portfolio lenders will allow funds from the seller's proceeds 
to be held in an account so that termite or other repair work can be completed 
after closing. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans won't permit holdbacks for such 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 First-Time Tip: Although portfolio lenders can work wonders for borrowers 
whose home purchase circumstances are out of the ordinary, this will not always 
be the case. Some portfolio lenders are enormous financial organizations with 
centralized loan origination operations. In some cases, this means less rather 
than more flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Before submitting a loan application with a portfolio lender, sit down with a 
loan agent and review your particular home loan needs. Find out if the loan 
processing and underwriting will be completed by local people knowledgeable 
about local conditions or if it'll be handled elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 One disadvantage of using portfolio lenders is that they usually offer a 
limited number of loan programs. If you don't qualify for the one you apply 
for, you may be out of luck. Mortgage brokers, on the other hand, usually have 
access to a multitude of programs and they can switch you from one to another 
quickly if you happen to be denied your loan of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Closing: Portfolio lenders often don't charge a separate appraisal fee. 
From time to time they offer promotional deals to stimulate business: A coupon 
for several hundred dollars off your loan origination fee, a free month's 
mortgage payment or an initial interest rate on an adjustable rate mortgage 
that no one else can match. Keep a lookout for such deals in the coming months 
as competition for your purchase home loan business intensifies.

THE INDOOR GARDENER; GOOD, BAD NEWS ABOUT URN PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL RAPP, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: About six months ago I bought an "urn plant," which had large, 
powdery-looking grayish leaves and a beautiful pink and blue spike-like flower 
growing from the center. The flower eventually dried up and died and there's no 
sign of a new one blooming. How can I get the plant to bloom again? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Alas, you can't! The urn plant, a bromeliad known as Aechmea fasciata, 
normally only blooms once in its lifetime. (I've heard of exceptions, but I've 
never seen it myself.) 
</P>
<P>
 The good news, however, is that these plants produce offsets, or "pups," which 
develop at the base of the mother plant and each of these pups will bloom just 
like mama did before them. One bromeliad can produce dozens of pups during its 
long lifetime, and the pups will produce pups, ad infinitum, which will all 
bloom if kept in medium light and watered regularly in the cup of the plant as 
opposed to the soil. (Bromeliads are air plants and don't need root watering.) 
</P>
<P>
 You can help force an urn plant to bloom by putting half an apple in the 
center of the plant and then covering it with airtight plastic. Ethylene gases 
from the apple will help stimulate the bloom. Why Did Snake Plant Bloom 
Unexpectedly? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My snake plant recently bloomed! It produced a stem covered with beautiful 
and fragrant white flowers. I've had that plant for years and years and it 
never bloomed before. What did I do right? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Everything, I would guess. But the real factor here is luck. Snake plants 
(Sanseveiria spp.) will bloom regularly outdoors in their native habitats, just 
as will every other plant in the kingdom save ferns and conifers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indoors, however, is another story. Conditions have to be just exactly right 
and the plant has to be in the mood! I've heard and seen this "phenomenon" 
frequently, and it's always exciting when a plant such as a snake plant or a 
philodendron blooms unexpectedly. How to Care for Palm Growing in Coconut 
</P>
<P>
 Q: While at the nursery the other day, I spotted a little palm growing out of 
a small coconut. It looked so cute I couldn't resist buying it, but not I don't 
know how to take care of it. Please help. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Although basically a novelty item, coconut palms can be grown indoors under 
proper conditions and with a bit of luck. The keys: Lots and lots of sunlight 
and frequent watering. If you want the plant to reach its full potential, 
transplant it from time to time into larger pots. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well your coconut palm will grow to height of three or four feet 
in your home, but don't expect it to produce a lovely bunch of coconuts unless 
you live in a hut on the beach, in Hawaii.

YEAR-ROUND BONUSES OF CONTAINER GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Container gardening offers year-round bonuses to the inventive gardener. 
Indoors or out, month in and month out, gardeners can derive pleasure from the 
plants they pots. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many advantages to growing plants in small containers, which can be 
moved at whim to take advantage of bloom color where it's needed.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Divide crowded clumps of Shasta daisies now for better flower size next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your azaleas have set their buds switch to 0-10-10 fertilizer to promote 
bigger flowers in the spring. Using a high nitrogen fertilizer will cause the 
azaleas to drop their flower buds and keep on growing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Support chrysanthemums by staking. The fuller they become the greater the 
possibility they may break. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep baiting slugs and snails especially once you've set out new seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water Japanese Iris thoroughly before and during the blooming season to 
promote a spectacular bloom.

CLEANING OUT THE BUGS AT A REAL SNAIL'S PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading Donna Englander's "Green Thumb article ("Fighting Never-End 
Battle of the Bugs," July 31), I feel I must reveal the ultimate and 
politically correct way to banish snails and bugs from a garden forever without 
using poisons or chemicals or rolled-up wet newspapers or plastic collars or 
any other clever devices recommended in gardening tips. For my small, 
snail-infested, pill bug-ridden English cottage garden, I have the same 
aversion to using poisons that could harm the environment that Englander 
mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The magical cure for all this misery in my garden are my two friends, Rapunzel 
and Wolfgang, North American Box Turtles. No snail bait or poison spray -- just 
two environmentally correct, low-maintenance turtles. 
</P>
<P>
 One year after I put them into my garden, they are finally accepting food from 
me after stripping their environment clean of tasty bugs, but leaving the 
plants untouched and healthy. For a full year I put out fresh water every day 
and thrilled to the sound of crunching and munching as Wolfgang ate the snails 
shell and all, and Rapunzel more delicately went the escargot route, daintily 
removing the slugs from the shell before dining. Even the ants are scarce -- 
delicious hors d'oeuvres that the turtles pick up on the ends of their orange 
tongues. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Rapunzel and Wolfgang eat mostly frozen mixed vegetables, nectarine 
slices and carrots. They are still vigilant, however, making a daily tour under 
the foliage for any possible bug morsels. I defy anyone to find even one bug 
bite our of any leaf of any plant -- what a wonderful effort-free garden. Now, 
if I could just teach those turtles to pull weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're interested in trying this method, here are some important facts 
about captive turtles: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Your turtle may go into shock when you first purchase him or her. This is 
common, and they usually will get an upper respiratory infection that must be 
treated with antibiotic shots at the vet. Both of my turtles started out with 
colds, but got better in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Turtles are expert escape artists. Deep wall footings will keep them in, or 
bury fencing below the ground to keep them from digging out. They can also 
climb low walls and fences. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give your snails a few weeks to be free of pesticides before placing the 
turtles in your garden. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Provide shade and a place to hid and burrow. They also love the sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Large dogs may try to eat the turtles, but cats and small animals don't 
seem to bother them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be aware that healthy box turtles will live 30 to 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buy a good turtle book such as "The General Care and Maintenance of Box 
Turtles" by Philippe de Vosjoli.

PLANT FLOWERS THIS MONTH FOR FALL COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 August is a good time to be thinking of fall color. Pansies and violas can 
furnish you color quickly and brilliantly.During August you can purchase these 
lively garden entertainers at your nursery in cel paks. 
</P>
<P>
 Planted from cel paks they will begin showing their colors in five or six 
weeks. They are wonderful for edging beds and borders. Alternate groups of them 
in flower beds and you'll create a wonderful effect. Plant them together in the 
window boxes or alone in pots and containers. They'll assert their colorful 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
 If you generally think of violas as blue, take another look! Today violas 
offer flowers of yellow, apricot, white, blue, violet, ruby and more. Pansies 
maintain the pace with varieties available in apricot, white, yellow, ruby, 
ruby, pink and shades of blue from light lavender to deep violet. And don't 
forget the spectacular bicolored varieties, clear-faced pansies and the 
familiar varieties with the prominent blotch. 
</P>
<P>
 Pansies and Violas will do well in full sun along coastal areas. In the hot 
inland valleys, it might be best to wait to plant them until the cooler weather 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 This pair like a lot of moisture and heavily enriched soil. See that the soil 
has plenty of compost worked into it. Give them a chance to get their roots 
well established. Fertilize them with a good commercial fertilizer every six 
weeks and they'll reward you with truly wonderful masses of color. Planted in 
beds, pansies need about eight inches of room between plants. Violas may be 
spaced more closely. Check with your local California Certified Nursery 
Professional for recommendations on the best planting time and varieties for 
your area.

GREEN THUMB; MATURITY IS ONE KEY TO BEAUTIFUL GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE GRINGERI-BROWN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm one of those gardeners who's always poring over glossy coffee-table books 
and Times' gardening calendars, envious of the bountiful borders and casual 
cottage plantings that have become so popular in the last few years. Gardens 
that seem to call for a full-time gardener and a revolving charge account at 
Burkard's or Sassafras Nursery. Gardens that make me look outside my 1928 
bungalow and wonder what I'm doing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, I'm doing nothing wrong. This season, I've come to realize 
that what's been missing in the past is simply maturity, an attribute not 
considered a plus in green beans or sushi, but irreplaceable in a landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been gardening for 20 years, but belonging to the mobile, down 
payment-less generation, never stayed for more than three years at any one 
rental. I never fully understood just how great an impact established roses, 
abundant ferns and full-sized shrubs could have on my garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years ago we were finally able to buy a modest home, and my current 
landscape is now finally showing the benefits of my previous years of 
gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether I'm taking a break from the latest project to sit and enjoy the 
flowers or watching my husband show our neighborhood children how to pick snow 
peas, our garden has added an element to my life that is hard to define. 
</P>
<P>
 Roses clamber up the four corners of the house, reach across the roof and wind 
their way through peach and lemon trees. The mixed flower beds are full to 
bursting with campanula, violets, delphinium, iris, aubrieta, Shasta daisies, 
coreopsis, impatiens, calla lilies, mint, various ferns and over 25 varieties 
of modern and old-fashioned roses. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer nasturtiums and Johnny-jump-ups have insinuated themselves into any 
bare patches, weaving a graceful tapestry that far surpasses my own studied 
attempts at casual opulence. The garden has finally come into its own. 
</P>
<P>
 When we became homeowners, our very first project was to eradicate the 
thigh-high foxtails in the back yard, which was pretty indicative of our 
priorities. Never mind the 1970s bender board in the kitchen or the unpainted 
shutter out front, get out there and rent that rototiller. 
</P>
<P>
 Overgrown shrubs and trees were removed and several hundred dollars worth of 
compost and other amendments tilled into anything that even resembled soil. 
When a tree which was supporting a Belle of Portugal rose collapsed on the 
driveway we never even considered removing the rose, but cashed in vacation 
time and quickly built an eight-foot arbor to handle its considerable weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Project by project, we've made over our 50 by 150 lot so that it rivals some 
of those seen in the garden books. 
</P>
<P>
 Time has a way of pointing out your errors and suggesting solutions. I've had 
my share of missteps: the Australian violets I chose for the front yard ground 
cover, while lovely in January at the Arboretum, were no match for our summer 
sun. We won't even discuss the shade cloth we rigged to try and nurse it along 
(the neighbors were polite but perplexed) before bowing to the practicality of 
a Marathon lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese maple I painstakingly chose picturing its burgundy filigree 
shading the porch, is still only four feet tall at best, while the crepe myrtle 
planted at the same time is easily 15. Or the King-Kong-proof, industrial 
strength, hyper-ugly vegetable garden enclosure that was our first foray into 
woodworking. Creeping fig is stealthily covering its wire fencing, surrounding 
the snow peas, lettuce and strawberries with a green hedge that will presumably 
pass for an English mini-maze. I hope. 
</P>
<P>
 I never anticipated getting this dedicated to my garden -- it just crept up on 
me. My mother always said my green thumb skipped a generation, which in her 
case was not entirely true. The Belle of Portugal that spawned the driveway 
arbor was her favorite rose, while the boysenberries bordering the fence speak 
to me of my grandmother's Sierra Madre garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I thought we were finished landscaping, my latest project is building 
river rock paths and flower beds. The only offense of a perfectly serviceable 
20 by 30 foot St. Augustine lawn was dullness -- for me a cardinal sin. Most 
people would probably see a soothing expanse of green, but to me it screamed 
plantable square footage. Two loads of rock later, we're pricing flagstone and 
jockeying for days off before the summer heat permanently moves in. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually I figure we'll run out of room or ambition. But you know, the 
driveway sure would look good if it was redone with pavers and creeping thyme. 
I wonder how hard it would be to rip up that asphalt. . . .

11TH DISTRICT COST OF FUNDS INDEX DOWN SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I take issue with Robert J. Bruss' comments regarding the 11th District Cost 
of Funds index.("Is Adjustable Rate Loan Better Than Fixed Rate?" Real Estate 
Q&A, Aug. 14). 
</P>
<P>
 There are other viable adjustable indexes that are also lagging indicators 
that move as or even more slowly than the costs of funds, for example, Bank of 
America's 12 Month Treasury Average Index. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Bruss neglected to mention that the majority of 11th District Cost of 
Funds loans have negative amortization, which means that loan balances can 
increase rather than decrease.

 Regarding the article headlined "Being on Waterway Is Like Living Outdoors," 
(At Home feature on the Venice Canals, Aug. 14): Your reporter's reference to 
"once-worthless salt marshes" shows an orientation that is so ecologically 
retrograde that it is difficult to take seriously the celebration of nature

TIMES READERS ACT ON TRUST ARTICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On behalf of Scripps Foundation for Medicine and Science, I would like to 
thank Betty Lukas for her article on charitable remainder trusts in the May 22 
issue of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of your subscribers read the article on that Sunday evening and called 
their attorney on Monday morning.By Friday of that same week, we had met with a 
wonderful couple, their attorney and their accountant. By the following Friday, 
their $4 million home had been appraised, put in a trust, listed with the 
realtor, and our new donors were on their way to a new home in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they will receive income for life as soon as the home sells, avoid over 
$600,000 of capital gains taxes and over $2 million of estate taxes, and 
receive a current income tax deduction of over $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also very pleased that at the end of their lives a magnificent gift 
may help find a cure for inflammatory bowel disease.

DON'T CHANGE TREE, CHANGE THE GRASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your "Gardening Q&A" column for July 24 answered a letter requesting the name 
of a tree that the writer can plant and still have a green lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 May I suggest the opposite approach? Change the lawn to a type of grass that 
grows well under virtually any tree. 
</P>
<P>
 I planted a grass called "Adelaide" (because it originated in Adelaide, 
Australia) over 15 years ago, and it has been just about all that the nursery 
that advertised it said it was. In appearance it is similar to bermuda but 
better looking. It is weed resistant because it is dense (15 to 20 minutes of 
weed pulling, total, in 15 years). It is more drought resistant than it is weed 
resistant. It is grown high -- about 2 1/2 to 3 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelaide is grown only from plugs or stolons; it has no seeds. During most of 
the year it is green. It goes dormant from Thanksgiving to March. This past 
year I planted winter rye in the lawn and the results were perfect -- a rich 
green during dormancy for the Adelaide then gradually fading out as the 
Adelaide came in with its own green color.

WULF CRIES AND 'GUILTY PIGS' SQUEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The letters in response to the well-written "Speaking Out" article by Carrie 
Wulf on "The Evolution of Getting Escrewed" show an interesting trend, to say 
the least. The majority of the responding letters are written by realtors, 
escrow personnel, appraisers and other individuals affiliated with making a 
living on the sale of a home. Almost all wrote about how infuriated they felt. 
Have they forgotten what the buyer feels? 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you, Mrs. Wulf, for your letter. It was a letter written to describe 
your experience with the real estate "world." As a new homeowner myself, I 
relate to feeling "escrewed." The article was of great value because it has 
challenged those who have forgotten what it is like to be on the other side of 
the fence. To all who were angered by the article, wake up and remember who you 
are serving! Let's not forget that the buyer is the customer who provides your 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 DAN GARCIA, Los Angeles

</P>
<P>
 After reading all the moaning, groaning and self-righteous cries from the real 
estate community (Letters, Aug. 21) about the "Speaking Out" article by Carrie 
Wulf, what immediately comes to mind is a quote from my father years ago: "The 
guilty pig always squeals." 
</P>
<P>
 RON CARTER, Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm responding in defense of Carrie Wulf. I listed my home for sale this year 
and have been truly "educated" in many ways in the wonderful world of real 
estate. So I can sympathize with the Wulfs. 
</P>
<P>
 My estimated statement of sales cost (excluding the 6% commission) is 30 1/4 
times more that original escrow costs in 1968! 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming one's income to be $10,000 a year in 1968, it's very unlikely an 
employer now pays that same employee $302,500 per year. No matter how much 
paper work and complexities of the job have increased. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest that today's man-made complexities were deliberately introduced to 
confuse the layman and justify "garbage fees," the real purpose being to use 
this as a conduit to produce more money. How many sheets of paper were used to 
process a sale in the 1960s compared to today? And are they all really, really 
necessary?

GOOD FAITH ESTIMATES MINIMIZE CLOSING SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Kenneth Harney presented various statements about the mortgage lending 
industry fee/expense practices on a nationwide basis, (" 'Garbage,' 'Junk' Fees 
Spur Consumer Lawsuits," Your Mortgage, Aug. 21) it was unfortunate that he was 
unable to specifically discuss the practice occurring here in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Real Estate in their mortgage broker audits is specifically 
looking for the correct and complete presentation of estimated closing costs 
that the borrower should incur as the result of a mortgage transaction.These 
anticipated costs must be presented to the borrower in writing at the time of 
the loan application or within three days following this activity. The borrower 
must sign and date the Good Faith Estimate of Financing Charges, which 
signifies their understanding and acknowledgment of these fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the licensed representative of the company or banking institution 
must also sign and date the papers to signify that they have reviewed these 
anticipated charges with the borrower. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, when a mortgage loan package is submitted to a financial institution 
for purposes of underwriting and funding, this organization will immediately 
mail another edition of the Good Faith Estimate to the borrower. Thus they have 
twice been informed of the anticipated charges and have acknowledged these same 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 If this activity is done correctly, there should be minimal "surprises" of new 
fees at the completion of the transaction.

 The writer asked about selling a home in a R-1 zoned area that had an illegal 
studio apartment.Their realtor had told them to correct the problem before 
trying to sell their home. The astounding comment made by Bruss was that the 
"realtor has a negative attitude. I wouldn't list my home for sale with him or 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the advice coming from the major Los Angeles newspaper when we are 
battling to prevent the deterioration of our neighborhoods? Zoning ordinances 
are made to help protect neighborhoods that are designated for single-family 
residences.

AT HOME: ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE DRAWS FAMILIES; RIVERSIDE: THE HISTORIC SECTION 
IS THE HEART OF THE CITY AND THE PREFERRED AREA FOR HOMEOWNERS WHO LIKE ITS 
SMALL-TOWN AMBIENCE.

 When Ophelia Valdez-Yeager decided to attend UC Riverside in 1965, her 
counselor warned that she would be surrounded by farmers. "I'd grown up in the 
city so I thought it would be fun to go to college in the country," 
Valdez-Yeager said. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation and marriage, Valdez-Yeager, and her husband, Ley Yeager, now 
an elementary school principal, thought Riverside, with its small-town feeling, 
would be a good place to buy a house and raise a family. In 1972 they bought a 
Mission Revival style home for $30,950. 
</P>
<P>
 "We settled in the 'wood' streets part of town," Valdez-Yeager said. "Oakwood, 
Elmwood, Rosewood. Our block was lined with well-maintained, older homes. The 
moms bonded and we all helped raise each other's children." 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside no longer has the rural and open feel she remembers from college 
days, but Valdez-Yeager, a part-time assistant to the mayor, believes the 
historic core of the city, with its rich past and architectural heritage, still 
gives a sense of how "life used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 While Riverside, located 56 miles east of Los Angeles, extends over an 
82-square-mile area, the much smaller historic section remains the heart of the 
city and the preferred location for homeowners who enjoy its small-town 
ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic area is bounded by the Santa Ana River on the west, by the 60 and 
215 freeways on the north, by Chicago Avenue on the east and by Jurupa Avenue 
on the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by John North in 1870, Riverside was settled by 25 adventurous 
families who came west with little agricultural experience. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1873 colonist Eliza Tibbets planted two Washington navel orange trees that 
had been sent from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The resulting seedless 
oranges were superior to other cultivated varieties. After Matthew Gage 
developed Riverside's extraordinary irrigation canals in the 1880s, large-scale 
planting of the Washington navel became economically feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next decades, oranges became the main crop of a 100,000-acre 
agricultural empire in the Riverside area. One of the original trees planted by 
Tibbets is still bearing fruit in a protected spot near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of citrus in the development of Riverside can be seen in 
exhibits in the new California Citrus State Historic Park, an outdoor museum 
re-creating the orange grove setting of pre-World War II Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Moses, 46, worked to establish the museum and to preserve remaining 
portions of the "orange belt" around the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses enrolled at UC Riverside in the late 1970s, and he remained in the area 
when he became curator of history at the Riverside Municipal Museum. He and his 
wife, Cate Whitmore, 49, and stepsons, Robert Ostlund and Ingmar Ostlund, live 
in a historic bungalow near Mt. Rubidoux. "We love our home, which is close to 
a river bottom and has almost a rural feel, but city services are nearby," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Moses received an appealing job offer in Northern California three years 
ago, "My family was broken-hearted," he said. "The children had grown up 
exploring the wonderful architecture in town. Living here had given them a real 
appreciation of California's heritage. I decided to turn down the new job." 
</P>
<P>
 "In Riverside there is a sense of a small town mixed with suburban sprawl," 
Moses added. "It's still possible for individuals to have an impact on the 
direction and character of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Modern-day Riverside was born after World War II, when many of the orange 
groves surrounding the town came down for housing development, and industry 
replaced agriculture in economic importance. New suburbs spread south of the 
original downtown area. Retail stores followed, and soon, downtown Riverside 
became a mix of historic structures, professional offices and government 
buildings, but few residents. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the small-town size and feel of historic Riverside that attracted Zelma 
Beard, who first became acquainted with the community while living at nearby 
March Air Force Base. Divorced, and with modest business experience, Beard and 
a friend, Sue Mitchell, took a gamble and began Riverside Personnel Services in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in town recognized our efforts to make a life and business here. We 
worked hard, became active in the community and, before we knew it, Riverside 
was accepting of us," Beard said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989 Beard, 47, purchased a 1908 two-story Craftsman bungalow for $290,000 
in the Mt. Rubidoux Historic District near Fairmount Park. "I wanted an older 
home," Beard said. "But every house I looked at needed a lot of work. When I 
walked into this house, it reminded me of my grandmother's home in Texas, and I 
knew right away I wanted to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My house is like a person," she said. "It has character, soul and warmth. It 
puts its arms around people who come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Beard likes the central location of Riverside for her numerous athletic 
pursuits. "I can go skiing or be at the beach in an hour, and there are plenty 
of places in town for bicycling and golf," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing prices in the historic part of Riverside range from $105,000 for a 
two-bedroom starter home to $1.9 million for a contemporary 5,173squarefoot 
home and guest house perched on a granite rock overlooking the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get more for your money in real estate in Riverside," said Marie Hemphy 
of Shelter Realty. "And there is a wide variety of housing units available, 
from modest bungalows to estate properties." 
</P>
<P>
 From its early Citrus Experiment Station serving the agricultural industry, 
the University of California has influenced Riverside's development. In 1954 a 
full-sized campus opened on the east side of town, bringing the cultural and 
educational opportunities of university life. 
</P>
<P>
 Reasonable housing costs and job availability kept Christopher and Deana Morse 
in town after they completed graduate school at UC Riverside in 1989. The 
couple, both teachers, purchased a new, three-bedroom home in 1990 for 
$132,000. "We feel we got real value for our money here," Morse, 32, said. "Our 
house is right on the riverbed and it's very quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 However, increasing crime in the area has Morse apprehensive. "In the past 
years there have been several murders within a mile of our house," Morse said. 
"The police are doing their best, considering finances and other constraints. 
But we're worried about the future. When our 3-year-old son is ready for 
school, we'll have to consider the question of safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Mario Canale, the Riverside Police Department's commander of Area One, the 
policing precinct that covers the historic district, understands citizen 
concerns about crime issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strategy is to work with the public in identifying the causes of crime. 
Then together we can whittle away at the problems that lead to crime. The 
citizens in Area One need to be thanked for their participation and desire to 
reduce crime in their neighborhoods," Canale said. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of historic Riverside is the Mission Inn, one of the region's 
architectural delights. In 1902 Frank Miller renamed his family's hotel as the 
Mission Inn. Capitalizing on nostalgia for California's Spanish heritage, 
Miller pieced together an incredibly opulent and stylistically diverse hotel of 
240 rooms over the next 30 years, furnishing it with antique treasures from 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 After closing in 1985 for a $40-million-plus renovation, the Mission Inn 
reopened in 1993 as a defining center of a revitalized historic downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 An element of the renewal strategy includes public/private partnerships for 
the preservation of historic homes and the rebuilding of downtown 
neighborhoods. Raymond and Susan Wade purchased one of these partnership homes, 
a two-story Colonial Revival, for $192,000 in 1992. The price included moving 
the house and rehabbing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Wade, 47, was reluctant about Riverside until she met members of her 
husband's congregation at the Eden Lutheran Church. "I came from Anaheim with 
my feet dragging," Wade said. "My first response to Riverside was 'I hate heat 
and I hate smog.' But we were drawn to the people in this parish, and I 
overcame my objections to the climate." 
</P>
<P>
 "When we bought it, our house had been badly damaged from an arson fire. But 
next door was a house that had been rehabbed and it was easy to imagine what 
this neglected house could become. The house was so beautifully redone that we 
were invited to be on the Historic Homes Tour this spring," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of bringing a neighborhood back is full of risks, Wade added. "But 
people who buy these wonderful old homes are trying to establish neighborhoods 
as safe and nurturing places. It's a step-by-step process and we're glad to be 
part of it." At a Glance

GIVEN THE SLIP; ESCAPE: POLICE SAY THAT A MAN ACCUSED OF GROWING MARIJUANA GOT 
OUT OF HIS HANDCUFFS AND QUIETLY LEFT THE STATION. 
</P>

<P>
 Just before he was supposed to be booked Saturday for allegedly growing 
marijuana, James Robert Crofton slipped out of his handcuffs and walked out of 
a police station to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities, who said the incident is "not typical," said Crofton and alleged 
accomplice Brian Parris, 26, were arrested about 2:30 a.m. when Los Angeles 
Police Department patrol officers noticed them loading up a van with 
30-inch-high marijuana plants potted in white plastic buckets. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men were handcuffed, brought into the LAPD's West Valley station and 
were seated on a bench to await processing, said Sgt. Roger Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 Although West Valley has a holding room, it was already occupied, Ferguson 
said. When that happens, suspects are seated on a bench, facing a wall. Their 
handcuffs, secured behind them, were attached to a second set of cuffs, which 
are permanently attached to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, who was not on duty at the time of the escape, said the patrol 
officers in the station were called out just after the two men were brought in. 
A watch commander and a desk officer stayed behind, but were sitting away from 
the holding bench, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, while Parris watched, Crofton slipped out of the cuffs that attached him 
to the bench and made his way out a nearby back door, about 15 feet away, said 
arresting Officer John Futrell. He apparently was still wearing Futrell's 
cuffs, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't necessarily keep an eyeball account of every person handcuffed to 
the bench. For the most part, when we cuff someone to the bench, they stay 
there," Ferguson said. "Any time something like this happens, we're not proud 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Futrell said when he and his partner came upon Ferguson and Parris on Del 
Valle Street near Ventura Boulevard, Parris was loading the plants into the 
van. Crofton, he said, came out with more plants and then ran back inside an 
apartment building when he spotted the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Crofton was arrested inside the apartment, which Futrell said was a "jungle" 
of marijuana plants. Police recovered 134 plants, ranging in size from 
seedlings to 7-foot-tall stalks.  
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen a seizure of marijuana this high since the '70s," he said. 
"These are pros all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment did not appear to be anyone's home, Futrell said. The walls were 
covered with plastic sheeting, he said. Stockpiled in the room were 
fertilizers, dirt, heat lamps, drying racks, plastic baggies and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Crofton, whose last known address was in Westlake Village, is not considered 
dangerous, Ferguson said, although he has previously been convicted for 
enticing a minor to work as a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incident is not typical," Ferguson said. "If I tried to explain it or 
make excuses, it would sound like just that." 
</P>
<P>
 Crofton, 41, is 5 feet, 9 inches tall, 150 pounds, with receding brown hair 
and blue eyes. He was last seen wearing a purple print Hawaiian shirt, Ferguson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parris is being held on $50,000 bail, on felony charges of cultivating 
marijuana.

CSUN'S RECOVERY ENTERS 2ND SEMESTER; EDUCATION: LESS CHAOTIC TERM IS EXPECTED 
FOR STUDENTS. MANY TRAILERS WILL STILL BE USED, BUT MOST CLASSES FORCED OFF 
CAMPUS BY QUAKE DAMAGE WILL RETURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Thanks to construction crews who worked round the clock during the summer, Cal 
State Northridge students will return Monday to a campus that is a little 
closer to resembling its pre-earthquake state. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the classes still will be held in trailers, professors still will 
compete with noisy construction crews for students' attention and the collapsed 
multilevel parking structure C -- one of the most horrific images from the 
devastating Jan. 17 temblor -- still will sit crumpled behind a chain-link 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
 But nearly all the classes that were forced to relocate to off-campus sites 
during the spring semester will be held on campus this fall, three new 
buildings under construction at the time of the quake will open and the core of 
the Delmar T. Oviatt Library -- considered the heart and soul of the campus -- 
will reopen for research and study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ready for a full program in the fall," CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN officials predict less chaos Monday than on Feb. 14, opening day of the 
spring semester, which was plagued by unusable temporary classrooms and 
confusion over how to get around the 353-acre campus that suffered nearly $350 
million in quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the campus layout remains virtually the same as it was in the 
spring, with its "recovery villages" of portable trailers for classrooms and 
offices scattered around the campus. Repairs will continue through the semester 
and officials are optimistic that they can remove as much as 25% of the 
trailers by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellow safety signs depicting a hard hat with a mortarboard will warn students 
that they are at a site where "academic and construction people meet." 
Chain-link fences that had surrounded construction sites have been replaced 
with plywood fences that are safer and more appealing. Students will be allowed 
to use the fences as canvases to "communicate." 
</P>
<P>
 Maneuvering around campus could also be easier because there may be fewer 
students to bump into. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment for the spring semester, which started a month after the quake and 
only two weeks late, was 24,813, only about 450 less than had been expected, 
according to Lorraine Newlon, director of admissions and records. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last week, just over 23,000 students had registered for fall, and Newlon 
said she expects a final count of between 24,000 and 25,000. If those numbers 
hold up, that still would be about 10% less than enrollment last fall, when 
27,282 students registered. 
</P>
<P>
 Newlon attributed the drop to a general decline in enrollment at CSU campuses 
statewide and a 10% increase in fees rather than to any concerns about 
earthquake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not had too many people explicitly say, 'I'm not coming because of 
the earthquake,' " Newlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our students come from the surrounding area and our students are not 
going to give up on Northridge so easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Students should also have an easier time getting to their labs this fall 
because the opening of three new buildings and the reopening of at least parts 
of all four science buildings will mean fewer classes off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The new buildings are business administration and economics, education and a 
new engineering wing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are making dramatic steps forward toward resuming use of regular 
classrooms and labs," said CSUN spokesman Bruce Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 Because so many buildings were damaged, CSUN officials conducted seismic 
reviews of every building on campus, in many cases breaking away concrete to 
inspect steel connections for cracks. The quake also shook loose asbestos in 
many buildings, and it had to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other buildings that will be at least partially opened this fall include the 
first floor of Sierra South, the Magaram Center, the Art & Design Center, 
Chisholm Hall, and the music, physical education and speech and drama 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of anxiety about building safety, but we can assure everyone 
that any building we open is safe," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those closed indefinitely are Sierra North and Tower, the Computer 
Center, fine arts building, Monterey Hall and wings in the engineering and 
speech and drama buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The administration building is also closed indefinitely, and is at the bottom 
of the priority list for repairs, along with parking structure C, Erickson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorms for 3,000 students have been refurbished with new carpets and furniture, 
and newly wired for cable television and computers. The Student Union, 
bookstore and most of the eating areas are also open. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening classrooms for labs and the main portion of Oviatt Library were made a 
priority after a survey of students and faculty members indicated they were the 
most important. Prior to the survey, officials had decided to build a 
warehouse-type structure as a temporary library. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students and faculty really missed the library," Erickson said. "We found out 
it was the center of campus life. It was an oasis for people." 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty President Nancy Owens, a professor of family environmental sciences, 
said the faculty had been excluded from early decisions about earthquake 
repairs, a situation that created tension between professors and 
administrators. The creation of faculty-represented committees to oversee major 
repair alleviated the friction. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had not been for the faculty, Oviatt would not be opened," said Owens, 
who has taught at CSUN for 25 years. "We think that without a library, you are 
not a university. The library is the nerve center of the campus." 
</P>
<P>
 During the spring semester, students had to take an hourlong shuttle ride to 
use the UCLA library or use two makeshift library facilities on the CSUN 
campus, a 15,000-square-foot hall known as the North Annex and a 
13,000-square-foot Lindley Dome. Both temporary library annexes will remain 
open until the Oviatt is completely repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the damage to the 220,000-square-foot Oviatt was to its two wings. The 
wings will remain closed as repairs continue, but the building's 
130,000-square-foot center will reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 600,000 of the library's 1.1 million volumes ended up on the floor 
after the quake. Thomas Enterprises, the company that helped restore the 
collection at the Downtown Public Library after the devastating fire there, was 
hired to reshelve the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every book was individually dusted," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 There should be plenty of parking spaces on campus, although they may not be 
convenient. There will be 6,500 spaces available for student parking, but about 
half of them are in north campus lots. Free shuttle buses will circle the 
campus every eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus officials said that during the spring semester, the lots never filled 
to capacity. However, the lots did not open until after the semester began and 
regulations concerning street parking around the campus had been suspended for 
most of the semester. 
</P>
<P>
 All street parking regulations will be enforced this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to funding uncertainties, it is unclear when the campus will be totally 
repaired.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not all the way back, but we're getting there," Owens said.

ANAHEIM'S BEAUTIFICATION PLAN NOT WITHOUT FLAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The city's ambitious plan to eliminate urban decay around Disneyland is not so 
grand to some people. 
</P>
<P>
 The $200-million to $300-million plan has drawn sharp criticism from two local 
school districts and officials in neighboring Garden Grove. Even the Walt 
Disney Co. has expressed some concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for "the Anaheim Resort," as the city has dubbed the area, call for a 
massive overhaul of the 550 acres around the theme park as a companion to the 
proposed $3-billion Disneyland Resort. It would allow up to 16,000 new hotel 
rooms in the area, and would aim to encourage development, increase tax 
revenues and keep Anaheim competitive in the tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will hear public testimony on the plan during a 
special hearing Monday. But already, concerns about overcrowded schools, 
increased traffic and impacts on housing have been detailed in letters 
submitted to the city during a 45-day review period for the proposed plan and 
its environmental impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove was especially critical of the city's environmental report, which 
identifies significant impacts that the new development could have on the area 
as millions of additional tourists come to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In a July 29 letter, Garden Grove officials charged that there are "major 
deficiencies" in the report, because it does not address traffic congestion, 
increased crime, inadequate housing for hotel employees and impacts on police 
and fire services in that city. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the issues as they affect Garden Grove are discussed in the EIR. It 
is as if the project impacts ended at the Anaheim city boundaries, which is 
clearly not the case," the letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Two local school districts are also unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 A law firm representing both the Anaheim City and the Anaheim Union High 
School districts submitted letters stating that the plan will be a significant 
drain on their finances and resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The districts contended that the plan will bring more students and cost them 
significantly more money than is indicated in the environmental report. They 
are asking that the discrepancies be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of both letters stated: "While the city and private industry will 
benefit greatly from economic growth related to (the plan), public education 
will suffer tremendously. These burdens should not be borne by the schools, but 
by those individuals benefiting" from the development.  
</P>
<P>
 A similar dispute arose last year when the Anaheim City School District, the 
county's largest elementary school district with 16,300 students, filed a 
lawsuit challenging the environmental findings for the proposed Disneyland 
Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 In its lawsuit, the district contended that the Disney expansion project would 
also further overcrowd their schools and drain limited resources. The district 
dropped the lawsuit after reaching an agreement that gives it $2 million 
upfront and additional income later. 
</P>
<P>
 Other school districts, including Anaheim Union, dropped their legal 
challenges in return for a commitment from Disney to provide various 
educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the Walt Disney Co., whose proposed project would be the driving 
economic force within the Anaheim Resort district, also had some concerns about 
the environmental report, although the company expressed its overall support of 
the plan in a July 29 letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The company requested that all property owners and developers within the 
Anaheim Resort area share the cost of improvements in transportation, fire and 
police services, water systems, sewers and storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 The company contended in its letter that both its resort plan and the city's 
plan will benefit the entire commercial area and that "therefore, the cost of 
the improvements should be distributed proportionally among all developers in 
the area."  
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's plan, only developers whose projects would attract a certain 
amount of traffic would be required to contribute to some of those costs.  
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Planning Director Joel H. Fick said Friday that the city is confident 
that it has responded to concerns raised by Disney, the school districts, 
neighboring cities and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have carefully analyzed every comment on every issue that has been 
raised," Fick said. "We believe they have been adequately addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said that their revitalization plan will go forward 
regardless of whether Disney goes through with its expansion, which would 
include a second theme park and thousands of hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Resort district includes Disneyland, the Anaheim Convention Center 
and most of the area's high-rise hotels. It is roughly triangular in shape and 
is bounded by Orangewood Avenue to the south, Walnut Street to the west, Haster 
Street to the east and the Santa Ana Freeway running diagonally to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 The area would be heavily landscaped with wide walkways and plants. Overhead 
utility lines would be buried. Businesses in the area would also be encouraged 
to have understated signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really believe this is a monumental step forward for the city and will 
enhance one of the most important areas in the community and the county at 
large," Fick said.

POLICE SEEKING 2 MEN, DODGE TIED TO KILLINGS 
</P>

<P>
 A dark blue Dodge Ram Charger used in an attempted purse snatching at grocery 
store Saturday may be the same vehicle stolen after a double homicide in 
Arizona earlier that day, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men fled in the vehicle after the failed robbery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks good that it's the same vehicle," said Mohave County Sheriff's 
Department Lt. Dale Lent from Arizona. "If we're lucky someone will get these 
turkeys tonight or tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Huntington Beach Lt. Jeff Cope: "We want people cognizant that this is 
serious. These people are armed and dangerous. If they see the vehicle, boom, 
dial 911." 
</P>
<P>
 Lent said the Ram Charger was stolen after a man in a remote area of west 
Arizona, 35 miles east of Kingman, stopped to help the driver of a vehicle 
stuck in the sand along Interstate 40.  
</P>
<P>
 The occupants of the stranded car -- later determined to have been stolen from 
Missouri -- shot the man, then drove three miles to his home and shot his wife 
early Saturday, Lent said. The owner of the Missouri vehicle remains missing, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeared the male was trying to help them dig out their car when they shot 
him," said Lent from Bullhead City, Ariz.  
</P>
<P>
 The couple, whose identities were being withheld, were discovered about 9 a.m. 
Saturday by a hunter, Lent said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any motive right now. Just robbery for their vehicle," he said. 
"All we have right now is foot tracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Cope said a vehicle with the same description came to the attention of local 
authorities after two men in the Charger -- which has "4 x 4" painted on the 
side and Arizona plates -- bungled an attempt to snatch a woman's purse at the 
Hughes Market on Algonquin Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Cope said a 30-year-old Huntington Beach woman was shopping at the market 
about 6:35 p.m. when a man wearing a red baseball cap grabbed her purse from a 
shopping cart and ran from the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Another shopper, a 40-year-old Huntington Beach man, chased the man into the 
store's parking lot where he dropped the purse and headed for the parked Ram 
Charger, police said. As the shopper approached the truck, a man in the vehicle 
fired three shots with a semiautomatic pistol and sped off. None of the shots 
hit the shopper. 
</P>
<P>
 The two suspects were described as white, both about 30 years old. One man is 
about 6-feet-2, with a thin beard and mustache. The other man is thin with a 
"transient-like" appearance.

INSURANCE CANDIDATES AGREE ON KEY ISSUE; ELECTION: TORRES, QUACKENBUSH SAY 
MORTGAGE LENDERS SHOULD NOT CONTROL HOW QUAKE VICTIMS SPEND PAYOUTS. GROWING 
DISPUTE COULD END UP IN THE COURTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 No matter who wins the November race for state insurance commissioner, 
thousands of angry earthquake victims will gain a valuable new ally on at least 
one controversial issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates for the post, Democratic state Sen. Art Torres and Republican 
Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush, agree with owners of damaged homes and 
businesses that their mortgage lenders should have no control over how they 
spend the insurance proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage lenders have insisted that insurers make out quake insurance checks 
to them, as well as to policyholders, so the lenders control how homeowners 
spend the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeowners, particularly those not required by their lenders to carry 
quake coverage, want the freedom to spend the money as they choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar disputes arose after the 1991 Oakland hills fire, but it has never 
been legally settled. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than $7 billion in insurance claims pending, a brewing legal battle 
could decide the issue. A San Fernando Valley-based consumer group is 
threatening to sue dozens of insurers and lenders to force them to back down. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Citizens Against Unfair Treatment by Insurance and Mortgage 
Companies has sent letters to dozens of insurers and lenders, putting them on 
notice that they face a lawsuit unless they back down. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue raises the hackles of Torres and Quackenbush. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a serious problem when people are trying to get their lives back 
together and they continue to be victimized by banks, insurance companies and 
mortgage companies," said Torres, chairman of the state Senate insurance 
committee.  
</P>
<P>
 If the consumer group makes good on its threat, both candidates said they are 
resigned to a tough court battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lenders should be helping quake victims instead of fighting them on shaky 
legal grounds," Quackenbush said. "I don't see that they have a leg to stand 
on. Mortgage companies that are trying to get a foot in the door now ought to 
have been courageous enough to put something specific in their contracts to 
begin with." 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi did not seek reelection, running instead 
for the gubernatorial nomination in last spring's Democratic primary. He lost 
to state Treasurer Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi was also unsuccessful in his attempt to settle the payout conflict 
peaceably. He said he gave up after insurers and lenders threatened to go to 
court -- and withhold all payments to quake victims until the issue was 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres and Quackenbush said they would have taken a tougher stand. 
</P>
<P>
 When the problem surfaced after the Jan. 17 temblor, "I would have issued a 
regulation and let them (insurers and lenders) take me to court," Torres said. 
"Instead, now homeowners have to pay for their own attorneys, go through a 
lawsuit. It's another victimization." 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush said: "The current commissioner jumped into this thing as some 
type of honest broker, but I don't think he needed to get into the argument. I 
would insist that the insurance companies pay off to homeowners. I don't think 
anybody should be able to bully their way between an insurer and a 
policyholder." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the threat to withhold insurance payouts was empty. "Threats don't 
work real well with me," Quackenbush said. "The insurance commissioner can't 
give in to threats from any industry. You have to be tough, have to stand your 
ground and do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush said that unless lenders insist homeowners carry quake coverage, 
they have no right to the proceeds, though he conceded: "In those cases where a 
lender has required earthquake insurance, the argument isn't quite as strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Most banks and mortgage companies do not make quake insurance a condition of 
their loans, as they do with fire insurance.  
</P>
<P>
 Banks and mortgage companies contend that they have the right to protect their 
financial interest in quake-damaged properties that are used to secure their 
loans to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 They fear that on their own, quake victims who have waited months for their 
insurance checks may use the cash to pay bills that have piled up or meet other 
expenses.

AMID THE SPLASHING AND FUN AT PUBLIC POOLS, IT HAS ALSO BEEN A SUMMER OF; 
TROUBLED WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Hoover Crips begin arriving at the pool each day in the early afternoon. 
They come in twos and threes, all baggy clothing and menacing looks. 
</P>
<P>
 They hang out just outside the fence of the swimming pool, under the shade of 
two trees. On some days there are dozens of them, gang members drinking and 
talking and shooting dice in the middle of the block-long dead-end street that 
leads to the Sutton pool in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Invariably, the anarchy of the street finds its way inside the pool area, 
where lifeguards in red swimming trunks watch for any sign that the mood might 
be turning on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, lifeguards do not blow their whistles with authority and yell at kids 
running on the pool decks. Instead, they speak softly to all. "Talking down," 
said one pool official, "is like lighting a fuse to a bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 The young boy who is running may have a brother who is in a gang. And the 
guards know it takes only a wisp of an excuse for the gang members to come 
streaming over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a power game," said Billy Wilson, a manager at the pool at 88th and 
Hoover streets. "Sometimes we have to give respect in order to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 In some urban pools -- once a haven, a cooling-off place during the hottest 
months -- this summer has been an uneasy and incongruent time, a season of 
joyous splashing juxtaposed against an ever-present threat of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 As they work through a season that ends Sept. 5, the trick for some lifeguards 
has been to get through the summer, to avoid a mistake that could get them 
hurt. And the same has been true for some of the swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Los Angeles -- with 54 city-run pools and 33 operated by the 
county -- has plenty of thriving programs, such as swimming lessons, inner tube 
water polo and synchronized swimming. In many areas -- economically depressed 
neighborhoods where a back-yard pool would be an undreamed of luxury -- the 
recreational opportunities offered by public pools are all the more precious. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Brown, the aquatic director at Rancho Cienega pool, a popular facility in 
Southwest Los Angeles, said the key to the success of his program has been 
getting adults in the community to become more active in what goes on at the 
pool. "When the parents are involved, children are more motivated and less 
likely to act up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other areas have been less successful in overcoming gang troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth McManus' front door overlooks the parking lot of Sutton pool, but she 
refuses to allow Demitrius, her 13-year-old great-grandson, to swim there since 
he was punched by a gang member last year in an argument over a kick board. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gangs have their own set of rules and those are not the rules I want 
Demitrius to live by," McManus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she takes him to the county-run Will Rogers pool in Watts, which has 
a more structured program. But that pool also has a history of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, a Will Rogers lifeguard tried to restrain a youth who had been 
roughhousing in the pool. A band of gang members, maybe 30 in all, spotted the 
confrontation and came over the fence. When the melee was over, two lifeguards 
had been cut and beaten. One had a broken nose, another had several cracked 
teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day at the same pool, lifeguard Paul Alba was trying to protect a 
13-year-old boy who was being hazed by older swimmers. The guard was so 
severely kicked and beaten by gang members that he slipped into a coma. Alba 
has regained consciousness but, more than a month later, is undergoing 
rehabilitation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials did not directly link them, the attacks happened in the 
midst of widespread displeasure over a county decision to charge pool admission 
fees for the first time. After widespread coverage of the melees, enough 
private funds were donated so that swimmers at Will Rogers and 13 other county 
pools in disadvantaged areas could be admitted free for the rest of the summer. 
Funding for next year remains in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere across the nation, violent incidents have sparked outrage at the 
intrusion of crime into places where it was once considered a daring act for a 
swimmer to direct the spray of a cannonball dive toward the lifeguard stand. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York City this summer, there have been a number of sexual assaults -- 
dubbed "whirlpooling" -- in the public pools. The assaults -- in which a group 
of young males surround a single female and take off her bathing suit top and 
in some cases attempt to rape her -- are a continuation of last summer, when 17 
such attacks were reported at New York's public pools. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington this year, a concerted effort is being waged to keep pools safe 
after six children, ages 5 to 14, were shot in a single incident last summer. 
The shooting rampage, which involved children shooting at other children, was 
believed to be gang-related. Now, police patrol the perimeter of the pool 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a lot safer because the police are here all the time," said 
11-year-old Nick Makle, who dove into the pool last year and swam underwater to 
escape the spray of bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 In Milwaukee, sheriff's deputies have confiscated two dozen weapons, ranging 
from knives to sawed-off shotguns, at the city's pools and beaches. In June, 
four lifeguards were beaten by more than a dozen swimmers at one of the public 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles area, there are regular notations in daily logs kept by 
pool management that allude to violence lurking nearby. One, written June 27 at 
the Sutton pool, reads: "Gang fight outside pool in parking lot facing pool. 
Emergency. Closed pool." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pacific region of the city pool system -- which includes an area south 
of Downtown and goes as far west as Venice -- there have been nearly 300 
reports of break-ins, thefts and vandalism in the last four years. There have 
also been more than 100 incidents including gang fights, sexual assaults, 
weapons confiscations and drive-by shootings. And those are just the ones that 
are considered serious enough to be noted in the log book. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 4, one of the busiest days of the year for public pools, gang members 
began taking over the Green Meadows pool on 89th Street in South-Central for 
their own private party, according to lifeguards. The gang members had gone so 
far as to put up sheets on the chain-link fence in preparation for a bikini 
contest when lifeguards convinced them to call it off. Their argument: partyers 
probably would be charged with trespassing and those with two prior convictions 
could be sentenced to long prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 At the county-run Jesse Owens pool at 98th Street and Western Avenue last 
month, a lifeguard was threatened by a man with a gun who was extorting money 
from a line of children waiting to get in the pool, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Will Rogers pool has a roped-off area for young women to swim because of 
complaints by teen-age girls last summer that they were being sexually 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have it, some girls just wouldn't come to the pool," said Art 
Thompson, a senior lifeguard there. 
</P>
<P>
 The separate section has eased many of Gertie Mathews' concerns about going to 
the pool for a dip with her 1-year-old daughter. "Sometimes the girls are 
afraid to get in the water because they don't want to be messed with," she 
said. "Guys are not allowed in the girls' section and girls are not allowed in 
the guys' section. That way there are no problems. It's better to be safe than 
sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 At the city-run Harvard pool on Denker Avenue in South-Central, manager 
Danielle Upton said many young girls choose to stay away altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys harass them, dunk them in the water or try to fondle them," she 
said. "Most young ladies get out; they'd rather stay away and not be bothered." 
</P>
<P>
 At the indoor pool of Fremont High School on Towne Avenue, students taking 
lifeguard courses that extend into the evening are driven home in a city-owned 
van because of the danger of being around the school at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just unsafe," said Richard Godino, aquatics director for the Pacific 
region of the city recreation and parks department. "They're smart enough to 
say they're not going to risk their lives just to get a job." 
</P>
<P>
 At outdoor pools, the scene extends into the night as well. Pool employees in 
many parts of the city begin almost every morning by finding chain-link fences 
that have been snipped with wire cutters so gang members can have their evening 
swim. A repair truck makes daily rounds to patch the holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pool offices are regularly vandalized and sprayed with graffiti. At the Sutton 
pool, lifeguards and pool managers painted the offices to cover gang markings 
at the beginning of the summer season, but they know that they will only find 
more of the same after the pool is closed for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Benches in the changing rooms are long gone because they were found at the 
bottom of the pool almost every morning. A tall, sturdy, chain-link fence 
separates pool employees from swimmers entering from the park, the better to 
keep the pool till from being robbed or have the telephone used with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most cases we are in charge only because they are letting us be in 
charge," said Samuel V. Jones, assistant director of the Los Angeles County 
Department of Parks and Recreation. "We can't put armed guards at every pool 
and keep them there. We have to depend on being able to relate to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, many people who live around public pools have put aside fears 
of violence this summer and gone swimming anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Rachal was initially cool to the idea of taking her 11-year-old son 
Jonathan, who has chronic asthma, to Will Rogers pool to swim, especially after 
she heard reports about the lifeguard beatings. She said she spent several days 
checking out the program before she became convinced that it was the right one 
for her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the parents sitting around the pool watching their children swim and I 
fell in love with the program," she said. "I'm not one of these people who is 
afraid to go somewhere in my community. I can't live like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Tension at the public pools is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 News accounts from more than 40 years ago tell of the agony of desegregating 
public pools, particularly in the South. Along with buses and restaurants, the 
pools were often the focal point for desegregation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1949, riots broke out in St. Louis when the City Council ordered the 
desegregation of an all-white pool. As late as 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court was 
ruling on the desegregation of public pools. In that case, the court ruled that 
Jackson, Miss., city officials could close city recreational facilities rather 
than desegregate them. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, African Americans, Asian Americans and Latinos for years were 
only allowed to swim on what was known euphemistically as "International Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Sammy Lee, 73, the Korean American who was a two-time Olympic gold medal 
diver, remembers his "International Day" swims at the Brookside Park Plunge in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We laugh at it now, but it was painful," recalled Lee, 73, who now lives in 
Huntington Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the memories still rankle Lee: a pool supervisor who refused to hire 
Lee as a locker room attendant because of the supposition that he would be an 
immediate suspect if anything was stolen. And the fact that he could not attend 
his high school graduation party at Brookside, although he was senior class 
president, because it did not fall on an "International Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Violence has long been a problem at Los Angeles pools as well. In 1972, a 
lifeguard was shot and killed at the swim stadium adjacent the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 One particularly trouble-plagued year was 1970, when about half the city pools 
were threatened with a shutdown because of an outbreak of violence and 
vandalism. But at the time, the disturbances were caused by firecrackers and 
cherry bombs and glass bottles thrown onto the pool decks during the night. 
Now, pool officials eye gang members on pool decks and wonder what kind of 
firepower they have hidden under their baggy clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have always been problems at these pools," said Alfredo Giddens, 
athletic director at Fremont High School, who has worked at virtually every 
pool in South-Central and Watts over the last 38 years. "To deny that would be 
wrong. But one of the big things to happen is that the gangs used to fight, but 
they didn't have the weapons they do now. You didn't have kids coming out with 
an Uzi." 
</P>
<P>
 Giddens is outspoken about what he sees as a lack of support by police and 
city officials. He said police are slow to respond to calls for help at the 
pools because they are low on the priority list. And, he said, sometimes they 
do not come at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still waiting for them to respond to some of my calls from four summers 
ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. John Dunkin, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department, concurred 
with Giddens' assessment, saying that calls from the pools and parks are often 
bumped down the list because of a steady stream of more serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's correct," he said. "If we have a choice between a robbery in progress 
and a juvenile group at a local park, the robbery gets the priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Some pool officials do not even call police except as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually take a bigger chance calling the police than what it may be 
worth," said Andre Brent, who oversees many of the public pools in the Pacific 
division. "They (gang members) will definitely be waiting on you when you're 
going home. They're going to find out who called the police."

NAMES SOUGHT OF SLAIN YOUTHS FOUND ON TRAIL 
</P>

 The two teen-age boys were found sprawled in the brushy, willow-shaded fringes 
of the Backbone Trail in the Santa Monica Mountains. Both were shirtless, both 
wore black swim trunks and both bore the marks of their deaths -- bullet wounds 
to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, a day after their bodies were found, Los Angeles County sheriff's 
detectives said they still have no clues to the boys' identities, only that 
they were 14 to 16 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Hikers found the boys about 9 a.m. Friday in a creek bed at Malibu Creek State 
Park near Piuma and Malibu Canyon roads, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each had been shot once in the head with what investigators believe was a 
small-caliber handgun. One was also shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without somebody telling us who they are, we have no way of knowing," said 
Sgt. Ron Spear of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "Without knowing 
who they are we can't find out who their enemies were." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the teen-agers wore a gold chain with a religious medallion and half of 
a heart. The other wore a silver, scorpion-shaped ring and silver-toned 
wristwatch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both boys appeared to be Latino, coroner's Investigator Tom Schwabe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spear said the teen-agers had been dead 12 to 24 hours when their bodies were 
found. They may have been dragged 10 feet from the nearby hiking trail, Spear 
said. Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff's Department at 
(213) 890-5500. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials removed the bodies from the southeastern reaches of the 
8,000-acre state park.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's several puddles, depending on the amount of water that runs through 
the creek -- which isn't much right now -- that could be considered swimming 
holes," said Terry Brann, supervising ranger. "On a real busy day, you might 
see 15, 20 people there." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the area, often Latino families, come to swim and picnic, Brann 
said. Rangers do not patrol the area often, working instead in the busier areas 
of the park, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members sometimes cause problems in nearby Tapia Park, just across Malibu 
Canyon Road from the murder scene, but there have been no incidents around the 
swimming site, Brann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Vadnais of West Hills said she and two friends were riding horses about 
11 a.m. Friday on a branch of the Backbone when she saw police cordoning off 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody says, 'I can't believe it happened here,' " Vadnais said. "But I 
think it happens everywhere. It's just you don't hear about it unless it's O.J. 
Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Moir, who lives on nearby Crater Camp Drive, said: "You live out here 
with no stoplights and no sewers and no sidewalks. . . . It's just a real 
shocker. It's not the kind of neighborhood where you find murders."

CANDIDATES SIDE WITH POLICYHOLDERS; QUAKE: CONTENDERS FOR INSURANCE 
COMMISSIONER WANT VICTIMS, NOT MORTGAGE LENDERS, TO CONTROL CLAIM PROCEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 No matter who wins the November race for state insurance commissioner, 
thousands of angry earthquake victims will gain a valuable new ally on at least 
one controversial issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates for the post, Democratic state Sen. Art Torres and Republican 
Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush, agree with owners of damaged homes and 
businesses that their mortgage lenders should have no control over how they 
spend the insurance proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage lenders have insisted that insurers make out quake insurance checks 
to them, as well as to policyholders, so the lenders control how homeowners 
spend the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeowners, particularly those not required by their lenders to carry 
quake coverage, want the freedom to spend the money as they choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar disputes arose after the 1991 Oakland fire, but it has never been 
legally settled. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than $7 billion in insurance claims pending, a brewing legal battle 
could finally decide the issue. A San Fernando Valley-based consumer group is 
threatening to sue dozens of insurers and lenders to force them to back down. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Citizens Against Unfair Treatment by Insurance and Mortgage 
Companies has sent letters to dozens of insurers and lenders, putting them on 
notice that they face a lawsuit unless they back down. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue raises the hackles of both Torres and Quackenbush. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a serious problem when people are trying to get their lives back 
together and they continue to be victimized by banks, insurance companies and 
mortgage companies," said Torres, chairman of the state Senate insurance 
committee.  
</P>
<P>
 If the consumer group makes good on its threat, both candidates said they are 
resigned to a tough court battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lenders should be helping quake victims instead of fighting them on shaky 
legal grounds," Quackenbush declared. "I don't see that they have a leg to 
stand on. Mortgage companies that are trying to get a foot in the door now 
ought to have been courageous enough to put something specific in their 
contracts to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi did not seek reelection in 
order to run for governor in this spring's Democratic primary. He lost to state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi was also unsuccessful in his attempt to settle the payout conflict 
peaceably. He said he gave up after insurers and lenders threatened to go to 
court -- and withhold all payments to quake victims until the issue was 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Torres and Quackenbush said they would have taken a tougher stand. 
</P>
<P>
 When the problem first surfaced after the Jan. 17 temblor, "I would have 
issued a regulation and let them (insurers and lenders) take me to court," 
Torres said. "Instead, now homeowners have to pay for their own attorneys, go 
through a lawsuit. It's another victimization." 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush said: "The current commissioner jumped into this thing as some 
type of honest broker, but I don't think he needed to get into the argument. I 
would insist that the insurance companies pay off to homeowners. I don't think 
anybody should be able to bully their way between an insurer and a 
policyholder." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the threat to withhold insurance payouts was empty. "Threats don't 
work real well with me," Quackenbush said. "The insurance commissioner can't 
give in to threats from any industry. You have to be tough, have to stand your 
ground and do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush said that unless lenders insist homeowners carry quake coverage, 
they have no right to the proceeds, though he conceded, "In those cases where a 
lender has required earthquake insurance, the argument isn't quite as strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Most banks and mortgage companies don't make quake insurance a condition of 
their loans, as they do with fire insurance.  
</P>
<P>
 Banks and mortgage companies contend they have the right to protect their 
financial interest in quake-damaged properties that are used to secure their 
loans to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 They fear that on their own, quake victims who have waited months for their 
insurance checks may use the cash to pay bills that have piled up or meet other 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody wants to abandon a piece of property, there are other legal means 
of going after a person who walks away from their contractual obligations," 
Quackenbush said.

PAYING THE HIGH PRICE OF POLITICS; CONGRESS: PRIMARY LOSS TO RICHARD SYBERT 
COST ROBERT HAMMER AND HIS FAMILY DEARLY IN TERMS OF MONEY AND DREAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert K. Hammer stood on the sun-baked lawn of the Newbury Park home that his 
family has outgrown and pointed to a new and brighter subdivision being carved 
into a distant hillside. It might as well have been Shangri-La. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what my wife gave up so I could run for office," the 44-year-old 
Hammer ruefully told a visitor two months after he lost his bid to be the 
Republican Party nominee in California's 24th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, sacrifice and heartache at times seem to be the legacy of Hammer's 
yearlong tango with that often cruel and expensive blood sport of California 
politics, a sport that regularly leaves hundreds of its players disappointed, 
sometimes debt-ridden and frequently bewildered by their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June 7, candidate Hammer joined the ranks of the walking wounded of 
politics when he came in second in the GOP primary, outpolled by party rival 
Richard Sybert, a former cabinet-level officer in Gov. Pete Wilson's 
Administration who spent more than $300,000 on his own campaign -- much of it 
his own money. Sybert will face U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could actually see myself in Washington," Hammer said as he sat in his 
living room, a room decorated in a style that could be termed late 20th-Century 
earnest patriotism: Four tastefully framed watercolor scenes of Washington, 
including one of the Capitol and one of the White House, hang on one wall, 
while a print depicting the Founding Fathers at the 1789 Constitutional 
Convention graces another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been the first time in a very long time that I've seen something so 
clearly, that I wanted and it didn't come to pass," Hammer added. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are Hammer's campaign trail sacrifices and epiphanies singular. 
</P>
<P>
 The hustings are littered with candidates who have spent their health, 
reputations, moral fiber, family ties and their own money toiling in the 
state's political vineyards, only to find that just a few are chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Ventura County businessman Sang Korman sank more than $750,000 of 
his own money into four unsuccessful congressional campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Steve Afriat, now a successful political consultant who lives in 
Sherman Oaks, was among the battered and disappointed. Afriat, as a 27-year-old 
Democrat, ran that year for a San Fernando Valley-based state Assembly seat 
against GOP candidate Marion LaFollette. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the dust had settled, Afriat had persuaded his parents to mortgage 
their home to help finance his political habit. In 1980, Afriat lost by fewer 
than 700 votes to LaFollette. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not until Afriat had lost a second Assembly race in 1982 -- by 
3,000 votes -- and accumulated $60,000 in campaign debts that he called it 
quits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a very difficult time after losing the first race," Afriat recalled. "I 
was emotionally depressed." By the time he lost his second bid, Afriat was 
relieved, relieved the pain was over and he could get on with his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer also knows the special pain of competing -- and losing. 
</P>
<P>
 During one crowded year in the political arena, the maw of politics swallowed 
up Hammer family birthdays, outings and anniversaries, and Hammer's job as a 
self-employed banking consultant went begging amid a blur of engagements to 
speak to Republican women's clubs, walk precincts and make fund-raising 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I spent the weekend of our silver anniversary manning a booth at 
the Conejo Valley Days festival," said Hammer, whose voice still carries hints 
of his Kansas roots. It was 30 hours of smiling, shaking hands and telling the 
Bob Hammer story to milling, often indifferent, throngs -- all in the name of 
politics. "He must have met half of Thousand Oaks at the fair," recalled Ken 
Calcutt, a fair organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 On the campaign trail, Hammer found himself exposed to the inevitable slings 
and arrows, including efforts to belittle both his business experience and his 
sporadic voting record.  
</P>
<P>
 The slights still rankle Hammer, the father of 17- and 23-year-old daughters, 
so much that he has refused to endorse Sybert, failing thereby to abide by an 
unwritten law of party politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have my daughters read things that the other candidates were saying about 
me in the newspapers that were untrue -- that was hard," Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally there was the $68,700 of Hammer family life savings that was 
placed on the altar of the political dream, money that had been earmarked to 
buy a new, bigger home. The fund-raising ability of a defeated political 
candidate being virtually nil, Hammer is now resigned to the fact that his 
"loans" to the campaign will never be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I didn't do was mortgage the house," Hammer said, sounding 
almost like a recovering addict. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer's own retired parents, residents of Lawrence, Kan., were supportive but 
also perturbed by his adventure in politics. "But they didn't have the 
advantage of all the soul-searching we had done before we launched this," 
Hammer said. "I wouldn't have risked 25 years of business experience and nearly 
$70,000 of our life savings unless I felt strongly about this and thought I 
could win." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer first considered running against Beilenson in 1992, a quest nipped in 
the bud when Tom McClintock, a GOP standard-bearer from Ventura County, threw 
his hat into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dream would not die, fueled as it was by a desire to "serve my 
country," said Hammer, who lived in Kansas most of his life and moved to Iowa 
in his late '30s with his family (he met his wife at their alma mater, Emporia 
State University, in Emporia, Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer became a vice president of marketing with Norwest Corp., a 
Midwest-based bankholding company. In 1986, Hammer took up residency in 
California as a credit card executive with First Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, Hammer had felt the same desire to serve tugging at his sleeve and 
joined the U. S. Marines, doing a four-month stint in Vietnam as an 
intelligence officer. "It was not the popular thing to do then, but I had a 
strong feeling that I wanted to serve my country," said Hammer, who vaguely 
traces his public service sentiments to his upbringing and to the boyhood 
influence of one of Kansas' most famous native sons, Dwight Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 As he considered a possible political future, Hammer took several people into 
his confidence to discuss his dream. One of these was Wayne Lee, then-publisher 
of the Simi Valley Enterprise, a community activist, a Republican and, perhaps 
most important of all, a fellow Kansan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer was a rare breed, according to Lee, now the editor-publisher of the 
Hutchinson (Kan.) News. "He was a very sincere and thoughtful person who had 
reached a stage in his adult life where he wanted to serve his country," said 
Lee, who used to receive long letters from Hammer about his travels (Hammer's 
credit card work has frequently sent him abroad). 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd have been a real 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' type if he'd been 
elected," Lee speculated. "But I told him after years of covering politics that 
it takes three things to win: money, money and money." 
</P>
<P>
 After a particularly good stretch in his private consulting business, Hammer 
in 1992 decided he had enough personal financial reserves that he could stop 
working for a year and give wings to his dream of public office. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hammer calculated it, 24th Congressional District Republicans -- with their 
fiscal conservatism, moderate social views and skepticism about professional 
politicians -- should have been ripe to be picked by his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the time was right for a citizen politician," Hammer said. "With my 
perspectives as a businessman, a former soldier and a father of two children, I 
thought I was a close match to the average citizen. And I was willing to take a 
pay cut to go to Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 It was vision, vague though it sometimes was, that attracted a sturdy band of 
followers, not the least being Pat Cook, president of the Encino Republican 
Women's Federated Club. Cook personally interviewed the top GOP candidates -- 
Hammer, Sybert and Mark Boos Benhard -- before she decided to go with Hammer 
and spend seven days a week working on his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it may be that Bob was too much of a gentleman for politics," Cook 
said recently. "If you don't have a million bucks and can't get into the name 
calling, it sometimes looks like you're not fit for it. . . . You have to have 
a cutthroat mentality. Bob was naive. I guess maybe we all were." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, not much tangible remains of the Hammer's $70,000 investment in politics 
but a few unused yard signs, crafted with touchingly naive simplicity in the 
shape of hammers and a collection of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are some fond memories and hard lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those lessons: While winning in politics is about idealism and ideas, 
it is also about money -- lots of it, more than Hammer had or could raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all decry checkbook politics, but then we find that money establishes a 
pecking order in the eyes of party officials and the media," Hammer said. "It 
boils down to this -- $400,000 is greater than $100,000. If I'd had more money 
to put up front, it might have been different." Sybert contributed $400,000 of 
his own money to his campaign, and with $30,000 in donations from contributors, 
Hammer had a campaign budget of about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Another lesson, also difficult for Hammer to swallow, was that it may be 
playing a fool's game to take the high road in a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the biggest question in my mind," his wife, Malinda, said recently 
when asked if winning at politics and playing above board were mutually 
exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our case, it didn't work," Hammer quickly added. "Maybe if there's a next 
time, we'll run a campaign that's a little smarter and more streetwise." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of the lessons of the campaign were hard ones, Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a woman who gave up her presidency of a civic club so she could 
work on my campaign, and the stockbroker who laid his business aside to help 
out," Hammer said, reciting these as only a few examples of the commitment of 
people who were part of what he called his "volunteer corps." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say this about running for office," he said. "You can never be 
humiliated if you run because you believe what you are doing is right. But you 
can be humbled by the support others give to you. I sure was." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign also broadened his perspective on life in general, said Hammer, 
who several times sought out nitty-gritty opportunities for personal experience 
to deepen his understanding of social issues. "I got an education about a lot 
of things, including what it means to be policeman, homeless and a teen-age 
runaway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the Christmas holidays, Malinda and I served food to the homeless at a 
temple in Thousand Oaks. A lot of what I was struck by was that the people on 
the other side of the serving line were much like me -- professional people, 
with families -- except I had a job." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, two months after the election, Hammer has a lot of work to do, 
putting his life and family finances back on an even keel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came pretty close to being broke financially, but I'm not broken," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to Malinda at one point during the campaign: 'It's a pretty bumpy 
ride, and I guess I'm going to owe you big time when it's over,' " Hammer said 
recently. "And she said: 'Big time, honey, big time.' 
</P>
<P>
 "When all is said and done, I'll be spending a good part of the rest of my 
natural life making up for this."

STAR PREP ATHLETE INJURED IN CRASH FIGHTS FOR HIS LIFE; ACCIDENT: EL TORO HIGH 
CROSS-COUNTRY RUNNER IS WORST HURT OF FOUR TEAMMATES. HE IS SURROUNDED BY HIS 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS AS HE LIES COMATOSE.

<P>
 A gifted young cross-country runner was fighting for his life Saturday, a day 
after a traffic accident left him comatose and injured three of his El Toro 
High School teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomas Mejia, 16, remained in the intensive care unit at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, surrounded by family and friends, including his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just need people to be praying," said Rick Hagin, the boy's cross-country 
coach at El Toro High. "He's a fighter. If anybody is going to make it, he 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 The others injured were in better condition Saturday. Carlos Marchan, 15, was 
in stable condition at Western Medical Center with broken bones, while Martin 
Pennell, 17, was in fair condition at Children's Hospital at Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center. A fourth runner, 15-year-old Andy Eads, was treated 
for a slight concussion but was not hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Chevrolet, David Mancino, 33, suffered minor injuries and 
was recovering Saturday at his home in Buena Park with his wife and three young 
daughters. The Sheriff's Department is investigating the accident and has not 
issued any citations. 
</P>
<P>
 The teens had left practice at school Friday shortly before the crash at 10:50 
a.m. They drove to a nearby Del Taco to get some food, Hagin said, and were 
heading back toward the school when the accident took place. The Honda Accord 
they were riding in collided with a 1970 Chevrolet Impala at Toledo Way and 
Ridge Route, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department.  
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters had to use "jaws of life" equipment to free the boys. A 
helicopter was brought in to lift Mejia and Marchan to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mancino said his son David told him the crash happened so suddenly he 
couldn't do anything to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really in shock yesterday," his father said. "As his mind clears, he's 
pretty much saying the same thing. He was going about 35 m.p.h. and had the 
green light. It happened so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just too bad, you hate to see any kids hurt like this," he continued. 
"My heart goes out to the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 From his hospital bed Saturday, Pennell said he was feeling much better, 
although he faced reconstructive surgery on his cheek bones, which were 
fractured in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was very worried about Mejia, one of his best friends on the 
cross-country team. His nurses made frequent calls to Western Medical Center to 
check on Mejia's condition for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennell said he and Mejia shared a love of competitive running. "I don't know 
how well I can run without him and how well he can run without me," Pennell 
said. "I need him with me because he really inspires me when I am running." 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro team, among the largest in the county, was poised to have its best 
season ever, Pennell said. The team finished fourth in the Sea View League last 
year, and Mejia and Pennell qualified for the Southern Section meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennell said that only a week ago Mejia, Eads and he had returned from 
high-altitude running camp in Big Bear. Before the crash, they had run 10 miles 
from the high school to Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was just like the worst thing that could ever happen," he said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the accident, Pennell said, teammates and other friends, Coach Hagin and 
coaches from other schools have come to the hospital to show their support. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 15 out there (in the hall) right now and it has been that way since 
noon yesterday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, John, who flew from a business trip in Seattle as soon as he heard 
of the crash, was thankful for his own son's improvement, but concerned about 
the others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our prayers are with them," he said. "They're just a real great group of 
boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, stunned school officials and classmates worked Saturday to set up a 
fund to help families pay for medical expenses. Paul LaBlanc, dean of students 
at El Toro High School, said he hoped to do so this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a shame," LaBlanc said. "One day you see them laughing and running. 
And then the next day their whole lives are changed."

GUN FANCIERS LOADING UP ON RIFLES AND CLIPS; CRIME BILL: NEW FEDERAL LAW WILL 
SOON BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS, HIGH-CAPACITY AMMUNITION MAGAZINES. BUSINESS IS FAST 
AND FURIOUS AT LOCAL STORES. 
</P>

 At the Crossroads of the West Gun Show at the Orange County Fairgrounds 
Saturday, a Heckler Koch SR9 semiautomatic rifle that sold for about $1,500 a 
few months ago, now carried the jaw-dropping sticker of $3,750. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't an ammunition magazine packing more than 10 bullets to be found 
at the Costa Mesa Gun Shop, and more than 60 people were on a list for incoming 
stock. And up the freeway at B&B Sales in Westminster, antsy folks started 
lining up for the high-capacity magazines, now priced $5 to $10 higher, before 
the store opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after Congress passed the much-debated crime bill, Orange County gun 
stores are jammed with people demanding soon-to-be-illegal guns and magazines 
or clips that hold more than the legal limit of bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew why we were packed today," said Jim Murray, manager of Sam Fowler's 
Stockade in Westminster. "People are scared." 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation will stop the manufacture, sale and possession of 19 
semiautomatic models and dozens of "copycat" firearms, including the AK-47 and 
the Colt AR-15, a civilian model of the U.S. military M-16. 
</P>
<P>
 It also puts restrictions on firearms modified with two or more pieces of 
now-prohibited equipment such as a folding or telescoping stock, pistol grip, 
flash suppressor or threaded muzzle (for silencers), bayonet mount or grenade 
launcher. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the new laws don't take effect until the bill is signed by President 
Clinton, gun store owners such as Murray are seeing a business boom. And the 
demand has upped the prices of every item on the crime bill's hit list. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, more than 200 customers thronged Fowler's Stockade -- more than 
double the usual number -- and about 60% of them were buyers, Murray said. Most 
of the customers were "disgusted with their President," Murray said. "I 
couldn't find a person that voted for Clinton in here today." 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase of choice at six Orange county gun shops? Semiautomatic handguns, 
such as the Glock 45, that use magazines that hold more than 10 bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first rumblings about the bill started three months ago, the Glock 
45, for example, jumped in price from $525 to $630 at Fowler's Stockade, and 
this week the price of magazines to fit the gun were marked up from $39 to $65, 
Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Miller, manager of the Costa Mesa Gun Shop, said he's had a tough time 
even getting the guns to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous. It's only been a few years since we had a whole rack of 
assault weapons. They're gone and they're never coming back," said Miller, 
referring to California's earlier ban on assault weapons. "Now the magazines 
are gone and they're never coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Crossroads of the West Gun Show, sales of the soon-to-be banned 
magazines were especially brisk, and were selling for at least double the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you tell people they can't have something, the first thing they want 
is to go out and get it," said Fred Buswell, of the Heritage Gun Room in Santa 
Ana, one of the dozens of vendors at the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Allred, another show vendor, said: "Any of the firearms that are banned 
by the crime bill are a hot seller. 
</P>
<P>
 "See this gun here?" he said, pointing to a Polytech M-14 rifle. "I'm selling 
it for $550, but some people are selling them for $900. I couldn't believe it! 
I have scruples. I wouldn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers were not happy about the increases, but many seemed willing to pay 
the price. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought some high-capacity clips," said Irvine resident Tony San Miguel, 33. 
"I am fully aware that these won't be available, so when I heard about this 
show, I decided to come and obtain what I need." 
</P>
<P>
 San Miguel spent $300 on four magazine clips that can each fire 30 rounds, 
which he said are more convenient to use for target practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prices are just exorbitant," he said, as he clutched a plastic bagful of 
Barretta magazines. "I was at a show about five months ago and I could pick 
them up for about $12. Now, they are selling for about $40, and today I saw 
some being sold for $70." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside one of the display tents at the show, 37-year-old Wayne Stone picked up 
the Heckler Koch SR9, a semiautomatic rifle, that had a price tag of $3,750. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible to see how the price has gone up," Stone said to a companion 
as he examined the rifle. "I think this same gun was selling for about $1,500 
before. This is just because people are thinking, 'I'm going to grab these 
things before I can't anymore.' "

VALLEY BRIEFING: WORK IN PROGRESS; CSUN READIES FOR CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge officials predict less chaos for Monday's opening of the 
fall semester than they had for the opening of the spring semester on Feb. 14, 
which was plagued by unusable temporary classrooms and confusion over how to 
get around the quake-wracked 353-acre campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the classes still will be held in temporary trailers, but nearly all 
of the classes that were forced to off-campus sites during the spring semester 
will be held on campus this fall. Three new buildings under construction at the 
time of the quake will open and the core of the Delmar T. Oviatt Library -- 
considered the heart and soul of the campus -- will reopen for research and 
studying. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus layout remains virtually the same as in the spring, with "recovery 
villages" of portable trailers for classrooms and offices scattered around the 
campus. Repairs will continue through the semester, and officials are hopeful 
they can remove as many as 25% of the trailers by the end of the year. Tips on 
Getting Around 
</P>
<P>
 Using the campus shuttle bus: A free shuttle bus will circle the campus every 
eight minutes from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and until 6 p.m. 
on Friday. There will also be free shuttle buses from each arriving and 
departing Metrolink train (Northridge station) 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking on campus: There will be more than 6,600 student parking spaces 
available on campus, about half of them in the North Campus lots. All street 
parking regulations are now in effect, so pay attention to posted signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety precautions: Avoid construction sites. If you have questions about the 
safety of any area, you can call campus security, 24 hours a day, 885-2111.

NAMES SOUGHT OF 2 BOYS FOUND SLAIN ON TRAIL; CRIME: YOUTHS, 14 TO 16 YEARS OLD, 
ARE BELIEVED TO BE LATINO. BOTH WORE BLACK SWIM TRUNKS AND HAD BEEN SHOT IN THE 
HEAD. 
</P>

<P>
 The two teen-age boys were found sprawled in the brushy, willow-shaded fringes 
of the Backbone Trail in the Santa Monica Mountains. Both were shirtless, both 
wore black swim trunks and both bore the marks of their deaths -- bullet wounds 
to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, a day after their bodies were found, Los Angeles County sheriff's 
detectives said they still have no clues to the boys' identities, only that 
they were 14 to 16 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Hikers found the boys about 9 a.m. Friday in a creek bed at Malibu Creek State 
Park near Piuma and Malibu Canyon roads, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each had been shot once in the head with what investigators believe was a 
small-caliber handgun. One was also shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without somebody telling us who they are, we have no way of knowing," said 
Sgt. Ron Spear of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "Without knowing 
who they are we can't find out who their enemies were." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the teen-agers wore a gold chain with a religious medallion and half of 
a heart. The other wore a silver, scorpion-shaped ring and silver-toned 
wristwatch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both boys appeared to be Latino, coroner's Investigator Tom Schwabe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spear said the teen-agers had been dead 12 to 24 hours when their bodies were 
found. They may have been dragged 10 feet from the nearby hiking trail, Spear 
said. Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff's Department at 
(213) 890-5500. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials removed the bodies from the southeastern reaches of the 
8,000-acre state park.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's several puddles, depending on the amount of water that runs through 
the creek -- which isn't much right now -- that could be considered swimming 
holes," said Terry Brann, supervising ranger. "On a real busy day, you might 
see 15, 20 people there." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the area, often Latino families, come to swim and picnic, Brann 
said. Rangers do not patrol the area often, working instead in the busier areas 
of the park, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members sometimes cause problems in nearby Tapia Park, just across Malibu 
Canyon Road from the murder scene, but there have been no incidents around the 
swimming site, Brann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Vadnais of West Hills said she and two friends were riding horses about 
11 a.m. Friday on a branch of the Backbone when she saw police cordoning off 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody says, 'I can't believe it happened here,' " Vadnais said. "But I 
think it happens everywhere. It's just you don't hear about it unless it's O.J. 
Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Moir, who lives on nearby Crater Camp Drive, said: "You live out here 
with no stoplights and no sewers and no sidewalks. . . . It's just a real 
shocker. It's not the kind of neighborhood where you find murders." 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers often stay at two nearby camps, but no one has been reported 
missing since the bodies were found, said officials at Camp Mount Crags and 
Camp David Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp Mount Crags, run by the Salvation Army, is holding an annual family 
camp-out this weekend for visitors ranging "from tiny babies to senior 
citizens," an official there said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Camp David Gonzales, a Los Angeles County probation camp that 
houses about 130 juvenile offenders behind 14-foot walls, count heads eight 
times a day and has not had an escape in nearly a year, said Kenneth Brouard, 
supervising deputy probation officer.

N. HOLLYWOOD WOMAN IS ARRESTED AFTER INJURY DURING POLICE CHASE 
</P>

 A woman was in jail Saturday after she led authorities on a 30-minute chase, 
crashed her car, and then was rescued from her burning vehicle by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Carliss McWhorter, 32, of North Hollywood, was treated for minor injuries at 
Tarzana Medical Center, released, and then booked at Van Nuys Jail for evading 
arrest.She was held in lieu of $35,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase began at 5:15 a.m. at the North Hollywood intersection of Radford 
Street and Victory Boulevard when police tried to stop McWhorter for a traffic 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 McWhorter allegedly raced her 1992 Hyundai on Victory and Vanowen boulevards 
toward Tarzana. She lost police once but was spotted again and chased along the 
southbound Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 She then exited the freeway at Tampa Avenue and sped down that street until 
she crashed at Wells Drive, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She stopped under a tree where her car caught fire and police had to rescue 
her," said Los Angeles Police Sgt. John Stilo, adding that McWhorter was 
knocked unconscious in the accident.

HELICOPTER CONTEST GETS OFF TO A FLYING START; HOBBIES: ENTRANTS ARE JUDGED IN 
HOVERING, CIRCLING, LOOPING AND MAKING 180-DEGREE TURNS, ALL DONE BY RADIO 
CONTROL OF MINIATURE CHOPPERS. EVENT CONCLUDES TODAY.

<P>
 Troy Turley learned an important lesson Saturday afternoon: It is a lot easier 
to fly his radio-controlled helicopter in his own back yard than in front of a 
panel of poker-faced judges. 
</P>
<P>
 With shaky hands maneuvering the controls, Turley tried to hover the small 
aircraft steadily before lowering it onto a small landing pad at Mile Square 
Regional Park, the site of the 1994 West Coast International Radio Control 
Helicopter Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my performance was pretty shaky today," a dejected Turley said as he 
carried his 12-pound, 4-foot-long helicopter to the sidelines. "Hopefully, I'll 
get the bugs out next time. This is my first competition, and it's tougher than 
you think." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day event drew about 40 entrants Saturday, some who traveled from as 
far as New Jersey and Florida to compete, organizers said. Contestants range in 
skill from novice to expert and are judged in categories such as hovering, 
circling, looping and 180-degree turns. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants have four opportunities to perform the feats, and the winners 
will be determined today when the contest ends.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think people love the competitive nature of this sport," said event 
organizer Clint Williams. "It's not a simple thing to go out there and hover 
smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his less than stellar debut, Turley said he was glad he drove down 
from Bakersfield to get his first taste of competition in the hobby he took up 
after giving up remote-control model airplanes four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe how much more difficult the helicopters were," Turley 
said. "You have a whole lot of things going on at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow enthusiast Marco Diaz agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The helicopters are much more of a challenge because you are constantly at 
the controls and you can't relax like you can with the airplanes," said Diaz, 
who wasn't competing Saturday but traveled from Indio to watch the two-day 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz and his wife, Vera, picnicked on the sidelines Saturday with his brother, 
Fernando Diaz, and Fernando's girlfriend, Mary Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diaz brothers are both helicopter enthusiasts but said they are not ready 
for competition. But they said they have begun to master the hobby through 
trial and error. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they crash, I'm always ready with the camera," Castro said, laughing. 
"Once, we had to go through a bunch of tumbleweeds to find one of the 
helicopters. I had stickers all over." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those at the contest admitted to a near-obsession with the hobby, 
flying every weekend and spending anywhere from $500 to $3,000 on their 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a challenge, and it's interesting too," said Barry Margo of Garden 
Grove. "For people who are used to flying model airplanes, this is a whole new 
experience."

CAMPAIGN '94: ISSUES AND ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election to represent the 38th state 
Senate District. They are Democrat Thomas Berry of Laguna Hills, Libertarian 
August Anderson of Encinitas, Peace & Freedom candidate Mary Ann Nikl of 
Carlsbad and Republican William A. Craven, the incumbent, of Oceanside. Here's 
where they stand on four issues. "Three Strikes" Crime Law 
</P>
<P>
 Berry: "An alternative might be a boot camp for all Californians between the 
ages of 19 and 22 who are not in higher education. The camp could be paid for 
by parents, the state and federal government." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson: "I favor the ideal behind the 'three strikes' law. However, I 
believe the law as written is our elected officials' feeble attempt to put a 
bandage on a broken arm. Criminals found guilty of violent crimes should serve 
full sentences without parole. However, this law does not fix the underlying 
problems that exist within the entire criminal justice system. The entire 
system needs an overhaul." 
</P>
<P>
 Nikl: "I oppose the 'three strikes' law. It violates the freedom judges must 
have to ensure that the punishment is proportional to the crime. Violent crime 
is actually down. Crime hysteria is up and the 'three strikes' law feeds that 
hysteria. It is no coincidence that the U.S. has the highest percentage in the 
world of citizens being imprisoned and the lowest academic test scores of any 
industrialized country. 'Three strikes' will fill up prisons while draining 
billions of dollars that can be used for social programs. I favor lighter 
sentences and more money for education." 
</P>
<P>
 Craven: "I favor the law. I firmly believe tougher penalties act as a 
deterrent. Endless appeals and the lack of punishment have only exacerbated our 
crime situation." Save Our State Initiative to Curtail Benefits to Illegal 
Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
 Berry: "California needs to secure the international border and should end 
economic incentives for people to cross the border seeking work." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson: "Again, the S.O.S. law is a minor attempt at fixing a major problem, 
but it is philosophically a step in the right direction. The entire welfare 
system needs to be virtually eliminated. The United States Constitution does 
not create 'entitlements' for anyone. We need to fix the underlying source of 
all these problems, not just treat the symptoms on a piece-by-piece basis after 
the problems have reached emergency status. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikl: "All immigrants, including undocumented workers, provide benefits to the 
economy by doing work that Americans are unwilling or unable to do. At both 
ends of the spectrum, immigrants fill a void: In math and sciences, Americans 
are behind; at the low end, Americans won't do needed work for low pay. 
Californians need to know that people immigrate to other places when their way 
of living is destroyed by big corporations and farmers are forced to look for a 
way to feed their families." 
</P>
<P>
 Craven: "I favor SOS. By definition, illegal immigrants are here without the 
acquiescence of government and therefore should have no expectations of 
receiving government services. Stricter border enforcement is essential, but 
the issue is largely within the purview of the federal government. If the 
federal government mandates services by the states, then federal matching 
dollars must be made available." Single-Payer Health Initiative 
</P>
<P>
 Berry: "I would like to see health care for all Americans and reduce the cost 
of health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson: "The answers to these first three questions take far more than 100 
words each to address. I would suggest that if a reader really wanted to 
understand all the issues, problems and solutions facing our state and our 
nation today, they should read my book 'Bridge Over Troubled Waters' (penned 
under the name Rasputin)." 
</P>
<P>
 Nikl: "I favor the single-payer health plan. It will save billions of dollars 
that under the present system are wasted by allowing insurance companies to run 
an inefficient system that requires an enormous administrative bureaucracy. I 
favor full universal coverage for all with an emphasis on preventive health 
care. I believe that if all other industrialized countries can provide health 
care for all their citizens, we must do the same. Do not forget that Medicare 
is an efficient government-run system." 
</P>
<P>
 Craven: "I oppose it. It's been estimated that the combined cost would be 
greater than the entire state's budget. Further, a comprehensive solution is 
needed on a federal rather than state-by-state basis. Otherwise, California 
invariably becomes a health-care magnet for residents of other states in search 
of health care." Future Uses for El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
</P>
<P>
 Berry: "The El Toro base should be used as a regional park or as a 
desalination facility selling water to California." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson: "The El Toro base is not within my district and it would take a 
significant amount of research along with an understanding of the people's 
views within that jurisdiction to be able to answer that question from such a 
distance. However, in general I believe that military facilities that no longer 
serve a military purpose should be put to the highest and best civilian use." 
</P>
<P>
 Nikl: "I oppose an airport at the El Toro base. This facility was bought with 
tax dollars and it would be unfair to continue subsidizing big business. If the 
airlines want another airport, let them build one with their own money. The 
facility should be converted to a park and recreation area for public use. 
Runways can be converted into ball courts, biking and running trails. 
Undeveloped areas could be used as a green belt by planting trees that all 
citizens can enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Craven: "It is premature to develop a plan for El Toro until the Base Reuse 
Authority studies are completed. El Toro represents a unique asset. Decisions 
as to future use deserves careful consideration after all options have been 
presented."

CSUN LOOKING MORE LIKE A CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to round-the-clock work over the summer, Cal State Northridge students 
will return Monday to a campus more closely resembling its pre-earthquake 
condition.  
</P>
<P>
 Most classes will still be held in trailers, professors will still compete 
with noisy construction crews for students' attention and a multilevel parking 
garage -- one of the more devastating images from the Jan. 17 temblor -- still 
sits collapsed behind a chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 But nearly all classes have returned to the Northridge campus, and the core of 
the Delmar T. Oviatt Library -- considered the heart and soul of the university 
-- has reopened for research and study. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last week, more than 23,000 students had registered for the fall 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
 For returning students, administrators offered these tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * The campus layout remains virtually the same as it was in the spring, with 
the "recovery villages" of portable trailers for classrooms and offices 
scattered around the campus.  
</P>
<P>
 * Yellow signs bearing a hard hat with a mortarboard have been placed at 
construction sites. Rebuilding will continue on the 353-acre campus, which 
suffered $350 million in quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * At least portions of all four science buildings will be open. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dorms for 3,000 students have been refurbished. The Student Union, bookstore 
and most of the eating areas are open. 
</P>
<P>
 * There will be 6,500 spaces for student parking. Free shuttle buses will 
circle the campus every eight minutes.

POLICE FIND MOVIE PROP, NOT BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department's Bomb Squad was called out to a salvage lot 
to investigate a possible bomb Saturday only to find a movie prop, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At noon, an employee of Pick Your Parts salvage yard in the 11200 block of 
Pendleton Street reported that a pipe bomb was found in an abandoned car on the 
lot. The bomb squad was notified and hundreds of customers were evacuated from 
the five-acre lot with the help of a police helicopter, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After two hours of examining the two bricks marked C-4, the bomb squad 
"determined them to be movie props," said Sgt. Joe Flores of LAPD's Foothill 
Division.

<P>
 An 18-year-old man was shot to death outside his apartment complex early 
Saturday as he was attempting to open a locked security gate, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Alvarez was returning home to his complex at 416 S. Birch St. just 
before 4 a.m. when he was confronted by unknown assailants, police said. A 
fight apparently broke out and someone shot Alvarez in the chest with a small 
caliber handgun, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager died at the scene.

OFFICER SHOOTS, WOUNDS ASSAULT SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A police officer responding to a reported assault on two people shot a 
29-year-old man in the shoulder Friday evening when that man appeared to pull a 
handgun from his waistband, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio De Los Angeles of Costa Mesa was treated at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana and was later arrested there on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Alan Kent said.De Los Angeles was in 
stable condition Saturday in a room guarded by a police officer. His bail was 
set at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident started about 8:40 p.m. Friday, when officers were called about a 
possibly armed man outside a home near Wilson Street and Raleigh Avenue. When 
officers arrived, witnesses pointed them to De Los Angeles, who allegedly had 
threatened two men, Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
 An officer, who was not identified, shot De Los Angeles in the shoulder as the 
suspect "appeared to be removing the handgun from his waistband after failing 
to obey the officer's orders," Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police recovered the suspect's weapon, which turned out to be a pellet gun 
designed as an authentic replica of a revolver, Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the officer nor the two alleged assault victims, identified by police 
as Enrique and Christian Gomez of Costa Mesa, were injured in the incident. It 
is being investigated by the Orange County district attorney's office, as is 
standard in all officer-involved shootings.

$5,000 IN FIRE DAMAGE TO CONDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A three-story condominium complex in Tarzana caught fire and suffered an 
estimated $5,000 in damage, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 City fire officials said minor earthquake damage had exposed one side of the 
building at 5334 Lindley Ave., allowing the flames to race up an exposed wall 
and making the fire more difficult to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 25 city firefighters half an hour to extinguish the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The building was occupied when the fire broke out at about 7:43 p.m. Friday, 
but no one was injured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fire is under investigation.

LOW-SPEED RACERS MOW DOWN THE COMPETITION; FAIR: DRIVERS GO FROM PUTTERING 
AROUND THE YARD TO ZOOMING AROUND A DIRT TRACK, VYING TO MAKE THE CUT. 
</P>

 Few people think of riding lawn mowers as high-performance racing vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 But they will soon if Gerry Smith has his way.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith is the president of the U.S. Lawn Mower Racing Assn. The group sponsored 
the Sta-bil West Coast Regional Championship lawn mower races at the Antelope 
Valley Fair on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great way to have fun without paying thousands of dollars," Smith 
said, "and you don't really risk your life either."  
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis 500 drivers need not worry about losing any sponsors to these 
racers, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Although specially modified mowers have hit speeds of more than 50 m.p.h. in 
other races, the average speed Saturday was more like 10 m.p.h.  
</P>
<P>
 In the first race, drivers puttered around the dirt track at even slower 
speeds in ordinary riding mowers without modifications.  
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of using a stop watch, we'll be using a sundial," one announcer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the race between the souped-up mowers in the factory experimental class 
was more exciting. Drivers zoomed around the track, jockeying for position, 
their back tires catching air as they whipped around bright orange pylons.  
</P>
<P>
 The first lawn mower race to be held on the West Coast, the event is one of 
eight regional races being held nationwide. Winners from each racing class will 
win a trip to Chicago to compete in the nationals this Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 spectators were on hand for the Lancaster event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was humorous," said Christine Jennings of Lancaster. "It's typical for the 
Antelope Valley to go out for this kind of thing. There's not much to do, so 
you find little things." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Shetler, who owns a lawn mower shop in Palmdale, was a spectator this 
year, but said he plans to race next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the guys that do the circuit were going to be racing. It's all 
local people," Shetler observed. "I didn't want to race against one of those 
fast guys." 
</P>
<P>
 When the checkered flag came down for the last time, John Degan of Palmdale 
beat out comers from all classes in the handicap race, Cal Allsup of Lancaster 
won the factory experimental race and Giovanni Simi of Quartz Hill was first in 
the stock class.  
</P>
<P>
 Degan said he had made only minor changes to his lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to cut my lawn when I go home today," he explained.

THEY CONNED AMERICA; IN 1956, HERBERT STEMPEL TOOK A DIVE ON THE TV QUIZ SHOW 
'TWENTY-ONE.'; WHY DID HE DO IT? WHY DID AMERICA TAKE IT SO HARD? 'QUIZ SHOW' 
TELLS THE STORY OF HOW A SIMPLE TV SHOW ROBBED A NATION OF ITS INNOCENCE.

<P>
 Anyone alive in the late 1950s remembers the national love affair with the 
television set, and the deflowering of America by the most seductive of all its 
offerings: the popular quiz-show programs and their rags-to-riches promises. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday nights in late 1956, restaurant business slowed to a halt, movie 
theaters were empty and commerce in general stopped across the country as 
friends and family gathered around flickering black-and-white television sets 
to cheer their favorite NBC "Twenty-One" contestants. Quiz-show mania hit 
approximately 50 million Americans who tuned in to watch people much like 
themselves become rich beyond their wildest dreams -- simply by knowing the 
right answers. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept was brilliant. What could be more American -- more democratic -- 
than earning riches based purely on intelligence? 
</P>
<P>
 But the need for riveting programming ultimately displaced the very thing that 
made the quiz shows so enticing. By the late '50s, a scandal involving a scam 
of huge proportions forced the collapse of the popular shows and left the 
country disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, Robert Redford unveils his newest directorial effort, Disney's 
"Quiz Show," based on the "Twenty-One" scandal that hit just after he moved to 
New York City as a young acting student.  
</P>
<P>
 "The quiz shows were very much a part of the innocence of the country at that 
time," says Redford, who co-produced and directed the film. "This was the first 
shock wave to hit the American public that everything they saw on TV was not 
the way it was. It was the beginning of the erosion of trust in an institution 
that was supposed to give us the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 "Quiz Show," which stars Rob Morrow ("Northern Exposure"), John Turturro 
("Barton Fink") and Ralph Fiennes ("Schindler's List") as Charles Van Doren, 
the academic at the epicenter of the scandal, is an intimate, emotional look at 
the people involved in the scam and the motivation -- mostly greed and power 
lust -- that drove them. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1940s, America was rapt with a radio quiz show called "The 
64-Dollar Question." When television, so much splashier than radio, came along, 
nothing less than 64 thousand dollars would do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The $64,000 Question," conceived by Lou Cowan, an early TV mogul, became an 
instant hit when it went on CBS in 1955. The show, whose motto was "Where 
knowledge is king, and the reward king-sized," climbed to the No. 1 spot in the 
ratings in only five weeks. Contestants had the chance to win as much as $8,000 
in half an hour, then return the next week to see if they could win more. 
Viewers identified with the returning players, which built suspense and created 
celebrities, including a young psychologist named Joyce Brothers, who was the 
second person ever to win $64,000 when she answered questions about boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 After the blazing success of Cowan's quiz show, similar programs glutted the 
networks. "Twenty-One," which debuted on NBC in September, 1956, was one of the 
most popular. The show's premise, based loosely on the card game of the same 
name, was that two contestants -- locked in soundproof isolation booths by an 
attractive set of twins in evening attire -- would answer questions for points. 
The first to reach 21, without going over, won. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither contestant knew how many points the other had, and the difficulty of 
the questions increased with the number of points he or she bet. When the 
questions were worth nine or 10 points (the highest bet on a point was 11), 
they would often have three- and four-part answers. For example, after 
listening to an aria, the contestant would be asked to name the opera, the 
aria, the character and the soprano who was singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Enright, who created "Twenty-One" with partner, fellow producer and emcee 
Jack Barry, thought it was destined to be an immediate hit, but he was wrong. 
Enright later admitted that the show's premiere was "a dismal failure, just 
plain dull." Matthew Rosenhouse, president of the company that manufactured 
Geritol, the sponsor of the program, sent word to Enright: "Do whatever you 
have to do, and you know what I'm talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 What the show seemed to lack was drama. It needed players who would come back 
week after week to battle wits -- and to connect with the viewers. The catch 
was that no contestant, no matter how smart, would know all the answers all the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the problems -- and the loss of America's trust in the media -- 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 W hy did "Twenty-One's" contestants agree to lie to the viewing public? Money, 
for one thing. Not only did the contestants come away in a few weeks with more 
cash than they might have made in a lifetime -- many tens of thousands of 
dollars -- but they also became overnight celebrities. Besides, the producers 
were quite persuasive. It's television , they said. Entertainment .  
</P>
<P>
 Yet what made the quiz shows so believable was the effort by the producers 
themselves to build the image of integrity. On "The $64,000 Question," the 
questions remained in a sealed bank vault until guards delivered them in an 
armored truck directly to the studio on the night of the show. On "Twenty-One," 
every detail -- from a contestant's mopping his brow to his asking for a 
question to be repeated -- was choreographed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular contestants on "Twenty-One," Herbert Stempel (played 
by Turturro, who gained 25 pounds for the role), was a stocky Jewish man with 
bad teeth. The folks at home liked seeing the Queens-born underdog shine. 
Enright and co-producer Al Freedman hyped his background, instructing him to 
wear the same dingy suit every week and to call quizmaster Barry "Mr. Barry," 
instead of Jack, as the other contestants did. They also fed him the questions 
every week, and coached him on how to create suspense by acting like he was 
fishing for the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 When, after reviewing the ratings after several weeks, the sponsor decided 
Stempel's charms had "plateaued," Enright anointed another king of the show, 
the dashing Columbia professor Charles Van Doren, and directed Stempel to bow 
out on a question so easy it would haunt him for the rest of his life. On Dec. 
5, 1956, after winning nearly $50,000 (more than any contestant before him), 
Stempel flubbed the question, "Which movie won the Academy Award for best 
picture in 1955?" As it happened, he had seen the winning movie, "Marty," three 
times. The embarrassment of having to answer "On the Waterfront" would 
ultimately lead him, in 1958, to report the rigging to authorities. (Stempel, 
however, was not the first ex-contestant to turn whistle-blower on game shows; 
a contestant on the short-lived "Dotto" raised the issue earlier in 1958.) 
</P>
<P>
 The memory still rankles for Stempel, who is now 67, still living in Queens, 
with his second wife, Ethel, 66, a computer systems operator. "After 37 years, 
I'm getting a taste of deja vu," Stempel, says. "On the set, John Turturro 
answered to my name. It's weird to see yourself actually being portrayed in a 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 After Stempel's fall, Van Doren came into his own. Van Doren came from one of 
the oldest academic families in the country; his father was the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning poet and professor Mark Van Doren, and his uncle was Carl Van 
Doren, who had won a Pulitzer for biography in 1939. His mother, Dorothy Van 
Doren, had been an editor of the Nation and a novelist. Charles, not yet a full 
professor, earned a yearly sum of only $4,000. Although he initially declined 
to be part of the rigged show, he was swayed by the convincing arguments of 
co-producer Al Freedman, who persuaded him that his participation would "help 
glamorize intellectualism." 
</P>
<P>
 And sure enough, the thoughtful, modest Van Doren was an instant hit with the 
viewers, who wrote him letters telling him that he represented America's hope 
for the future of education. Geritol loved him. He kept his title on 
"Twenty-One" for a record 15 weeks, winning a hefty $129,000 -- approximately 
$800,000 in today's dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I saw him," says Stempel, "I knew my days on the show were numbered. He 
was tall, thin and WASPy, and I was this Bronx Jewish kid. It was as simple as 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 When the time finally came for Van Doren to take his fall, he received a 
$50,000 per year contract to discuss cultural issues on NBC's "Today" show with 
its host, monkey-toting Dave Garroway (played in the movie by director Barry 
Levinson, whose Baltimore Pictures initially developed the script). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, Richard Goodwin, a rookie lawyer for the House Subcommittee on 
Legislative Oversight, read a minuscule story in the newspaper about a 
nine-month New York grand-jury investigation of the quiz shows. Stempel, still 
reeling from his embarrassment over "Marty," had reported the rigging to the 
authorities. But the findings of the grand jury were sealed to the public. 
Goodwin, on a hunch, reopened the case. Using Stempel's testimony and other 
pieces of incriminating evidence, he pieced together the truth: that 
"Twenty-One" and several other quiz shows were fixed and that producers and 
network officials as well as product sponsors helped mastermind the plan. His 
findings led to the downfall of "Twenty-One," and, later, full-scale hearings 
in the House in 1959 and federal regulations of the quiz shows. 
</P>
<P>
 America was stunned. When Van Doren, troubled by a guilty conscience and 
Goodwin's relentless investigation, finally admitted at the House hearings that 
he had been in on the scam, it seemed that nothing was sacred. Van Doren's 
career and image were shattered. His face, which had appeared on the covers of 
Time only weeks before as an American icon, now stood for corruption and greed. 
 
</P>
<P>
 An angry John Steinbeck wrote a letter to Adlai Stevenson, which was reprinted 
in the New Republic under the headline "Have We Gone Soft?" It read: "If I 
wanted to destroy a nation, I would give it too much and I would have it on its 
knees, miserable, greedy, and sick. . . . On all levels, American society is 
rigged. . . . I am troubled by the cynical immorality of my country. It cannot 
survive on this basis."  
</P>
<P>
 John Crosby, one of the country's foremost television critics at the time, 
wrote: "The moral squalor of the quiz show mess reaches through the whole 
industry. Nothing is what it seems in television . . . the feeling of high 
purpose, of manifest destiny that lit the industry when it was young . . . is 
long gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Doren was fired from Columbia and retreated to Chicago with what was left 
of the money he had won, where he made a private life for himself and Geraldine 
Bernstein Van Doren, whom he had met when she was employed by "Twenty-One" to 
answer his fan mail. Through a family connection, he landed a job editing the 
Encyclopedia Brittanica and has never spoken or written publicly of the 
incident again. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Van Doren, now 68 and living in Cornwall, Conn., declined Redford's 
offer to participate in "Quiz Show," Fiennes wanted to meet him at least once 
to study his mannerisms. The actor, still relatively unknown last year before 
the release of "Schindler's List," drove to Van Doren's house, waited for him 
to emerge and asked for directions, claiming he was lost. That anonymous 
five-minute conversation, Fiennes says, along with many kinescopes of 
"Twenty-One" and television interviews, gave him what he needed to play the 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one went to jail, Van Doren, Freedman and near ly two dozen 
contestants were charged with second-degree perjury. Almost all the other quiz 
show producers lost their jobs and were unofficially blacklisted by the 
networks for years. Congress passed laws making TV fraud illegal, which have 
come to be known unofficially as Stempel laws.  
</P>
<P>
 But the controversy cost Stempel his public dignity and, he believes, 
readmittance to New York University to complete his doctorate. (NYU officials 
say his files state that he was denied readmittance in 1960, but do not provide 
reasons.) Stempel went into the hosiery business and taught public school 
before landing in the early '80s at the New York City Department of 
Transportation in Manhattan as a researcher, where he still works. Disney paid 
him $30,000 to be a consultant for "Quiz Show," and he currently is at work on 
a book of memoirs about his experience, only recently having broken his 
self-imposed silence about the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so depressed and so disgusted, I just didn't want to have anything to 
do with anything connected with it," Stempel says. "Finally, I got tired of 
being in the shadows and said to Ethel, 'The next person who calls gets my 
story.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That person turned out to be Julian Krainin, an Academy Award-winning 
documentary film maker who was making a film of the subject, "The Quiz Show 
Scandals," that aired on PBS in 1991. He went on to become one of "Quiz Show's" 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What fascinated me about about the subject was that all of us could have been 
lead down this trail," says Krainin, now 53. "It was like a Faustian deal with 
the devil that happened in small, gradual steps and compromises until people 
became trapped by fame and money.  
</P>
<P>
 "Also, you were dealing with one of the most brilliant and clever producers in 
history of television," Krainin says about Enright, who died in 1992 at age 74. 
"Enright was brilliant at not only devising the concept of the game shows, but 
keeping people in line. He knew how to say the right things and get you to 
trust him.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sadness in Herb and it comes from spending 30 years of his life in 
shame," adds Krainin. "When I came to him to do the documentary, I spent a long 
time convincing him that he had nothing to be ashamed of, but should feel proud 
that he tried to expose the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 'I remember watching Van Doren on TV -- he was as popular as Elvis," says 
Redford, who in 1959 at age 21 won a $75 fishing rod (as an actor that 
contestants guessed about) on "Play Your Hunch," a quiz show hosted by Merv 
Griffin. "Watching him and the other contestants was irresistible. The actor in 
me looked at the show and felt I was watching other actors. It was too much to 
believe, but at the same time, I never doubted the show. I hadn't had evidence 
television could trick us. But the merchant mentality was already taking hold, 
and as we know now, there's little morality there." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was just that commercial mentality that originally made "Quiz 
Show" a tough sell. Though the newsreel version had all the elements of high 
drama, no one had been able to make the movie. In fact, TriStar had put "Quiz 
Show" in turnaround in September, 1992, after developing it with Levinson. 
Luckily, Disney, which had a Herb Stempel story already in the works, scuttled 
that project last spring when it persuaded Redford, flush with the success of 
"A River Runs Through It," to bring over his version of the tale, which focused 
the story evenly on the three main players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always risky to do a movie from more than one point of view," says 
Redford. "Studios tend to like black hats and white hats." Especially when the 
movie doesn't have all the elements of a box-office blowout. But Redford says 
he isn't concerned about the lack of high-speed chase scenes and blinding 
explosions. He says his movie's theme -- ethics -- will touch everyone.  
</P>
<P>
 "Three decades of scandal after the quiz shows, the country has become numb," 
the director says. "There's a moral ambiguity that has made us change our 
behavior, hopes and dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Redford, Goodwin, who later became a Kennedy speech writer (and 
co-producer of the movie), believes that the rigging of "Twenty-One" and the 
other quiz shows was a symbolic event in American history -- one that has had 
lasting implications. "Certainly up 'til then people tended to believe their 
Presidents and believe what they saw on television. Remember, we were only four 
years away from the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. At that point the country in 
general was taking a wrong turn in the road." 
</P>
<P>
 That initial loss of faith in the media laid the groundwork for the 
contemporary understanding that on television, what you see isn't necessarily 
what you get; witness TV dramatizations, computer-driven image manipulation and 
even the "Dateline NBC" investigation, in which the producers rigged an 
explosion to illustrate General Motors' dangerously installed gas tanks.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in this cynical age, it can be a little hard to understand the impact 
of "Twenty-One's" blow. To explain the scope of the shock to screenwriter Paul 
Attanasio, 34, Goodwin suggested he imagine the feeling of betrayal if he were 
to find out the Super Bowl were fixed. "There was something very noble in 
Charles' capacity to feel ashamed," says Attanasio, who also wrote the 
screenplay for the upcoming "Disclosure" and helped with rewrites on "Crisis in 
the Hot Zone," pre-production on which was shut down recently after Redford 
abandoned the project. "Just as there was something wonderful about the 
capacity of the viewers to be outraged. I think that's all gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow, 31, wasn't even born during the quiz-show era, but says the movie's 
subject matter has a modern message. "Take those so-called reality-based 
shows," says Morrow. "People take it, myself included, as fact -- reality -- 
but once you put a camera on something, it's subjective, not objective. I think 
'Quiz Show' will remind people you can't take that as the final word, no matter 
how objective it seems." 
</P>
<P>
 But could a wary public resist another charismatic Van Doren? After all, 
Americans raise actors and sports figures to godlike proportions all the time. 
And, like Van Doren, these heroes can let their fans down. "We so want to 
believe they're innocent," says Morrow. "It's actually good if the guys we 
deify fall -- if you learn the lessons. Unfortunately, instead of learning," he 
pauses, "we just make new gods."*

OLD EYESORE OR HISTORICAL FIXER-UPPER?; ARCHITECTURE: RESIDENTS WANT TO 
REFURBISH THE MIXED-STYLE HOUSE IN WEST ADAMS AS A COMMUNITY CENTER. BUT THE 
CITY SAYS THE STRUCTURE IS HAZARDOUS AND MAY DEMOLISH IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When some city officials look at the house at 2301 W. 24th St. in the West 
Adams district, they see a run-down, boarded-up eyesore whose fading aqua paint 
is sloughing off like sunburned skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents and preservationists look beyond the weeds piled high in the 
front yard and see nothing less than an architectural treasure whose marriage 
of turn-of-the-century Edwardian and Polynesian styles is unique in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At a homeowners meeting Wednesday, residents bought some time to save the 
house from demolition. Councilman Nate Holden agreed to give preservation 
forces until Dec. 31 to come up with a plan to save the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in bad shape, but it just endears itself to people," said Karen Haas, 
who lives across the street from the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1902 by Los Angeles music patron Joseph DuPuy, the two-story "South 
Seas Edwardian" house is actually an amalgam of several styles -- Craftsman, 
Gothic, Queen Anne and Victorian, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Its most dramatic feature is an oversized, sharply pitched roof unlike any 
other constructed in that era, preservationists say. The clapboard outer walls, 
arroyo stone pillars and triangular attic vents lend touches of whimsy that 
distinguish the structure from neighboring Victorian and Craftsman houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The city acquired the house 23 years ago with the intention of tearing it down 
and widening Arlington Avenue, a plan that was never carried out. Now city 
officials say the house attracts trouble and is better off razed. But about 100 
homeowners are working hard to retain and rehabilitate it, applying to Holden 
for help because the house is in his council district. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident David Raposa presented a proposal Wednesday to Holden aide Louis 
White that outlined plans to rehabilitate the house and bring in local 
nonprofit groups to operate youth programs. The 50 residents at the meeting 
backed the proposal, and White guaranteed the group that it would get the four 
months they said they need to raise $100,000 to fix the structure and line up 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're willing to work with the community, but we can't afford to let the 
building stand as it is," White said. "The house is a total blight to the area. 
If we don't have something in writing saying how it's going to be saved, we 
have to move on it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave them my word I would work with them," Holden said before the meeting, 
"and I intend to do that."  
</P>
<P>
 Last month the City Council voted to demolish the house. Holden said he 
introduced that motion because the house endangers residents by attracting 
vagrants and vandals and poses a fire hazard. He said many longtime residents 
have asked him to get rid of the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are tired of looking at it," he said. "I can't keep vagrants 
out of there forever. At some point, we have to protect the city from potential 
lawsuits that could result if someone is hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden said that, if he decides the community proposal to save the house is 
viable, he can help residents acquire the house from the Recreation and Parks 
Department, which plans to level it to expand 2nd Avenue Park at the west end 
of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors say they don't want to see the park expanded because the 
existing one is a magnet for drug dealing, shootings and other trouble. They 
point out that another house stands between the South Sea home and the park, 
and it would have to be acquired before expansion could take place. That, said 
resident Laura Myers, could take years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, nobody is saying that they want the house to stay the way it is," said 
Myers, who was co-author of a recommendation to the Cultural Heritage 
Commission that the house be granted historical monument status. "We just want 
the chance to save it." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has not yet made a decision on the application. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say they have been in touch with nonprofit groups, including the Los 
Angeles Conservation Corps and the Getty Institute, that are interested in 
moving their administrative operations or youth job training programs into the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Ludlow, a director with the Conservation Corps, said that he is 
skeptical that Holden will follow through on his latest pledge of support. 
Holden initiated the motion to demolish the house shortly after promising the 
West Adams Heritage Assn. in May that he would work with residents to save it. 
"A hundred residents shouldn't have to come together and scratch up money to do 
this," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tearing it down is a knee-jerk reaction to the problem -- you don't like it 
so just get rid of it," said Raposa, a Los Angeles Conservancy board member who 
lives on 4th Avenue and who has helped restore several homes in the area.

SOME SKEPTICAL OF MEXICO RESULTS; SOME LOCAL EMIGRES AREN'T RECOGNIZING 
ZEDILLO'S VICTORY YET. HIS BACKERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, PRAISE HIS WIN AS 
'CONTINUITY OF PROGRESS' 
</P>

 As the final tally shows Ernesto Zedillo as the winner of Mexico's 
presidential election, some Mexican citizens residing in Los An geles remained 
skeptical last week about the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's 
(PRI) victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not recognizing anyone's victory yet," said Saul Samaniego, a local 
official with the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). "We're in 
constant contact with our companeros in Mexico City, and they haven't 
recognized anything either." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the PRD's presidential candidate, asserted last week that 
the Aug. 21 election was the most fraudulent in Mexican history. 
</P>
<P>
 In the southern state of Chiapas, where rebels from the Zapatista National 
Liberation Army staged an uprising New Year's Day, public demonstrations last 
week accused the PRI of fraud. Similar protests were held by PRD supporters in 
the capital of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 The heightened concern expressed by some local Mexicans interested in the 
election contrasted with the lack of sentiment many in the area felt toward the 
entire event. 
</P>
<P>
 No large-scale protests have been planned in Los Angeles, Samaniego said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're waiting to hear what Cuauhtemoc and the others in Mexico City decide to 
do," said Samaniego, who has been affiliated with the PRD since its conception 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary reports from at least three American groups monitoring the 
elections were contradictory. Global Exchange and Grassroots International, two 
groups that were among the first foreigners authorized to witness a Mexican 
election, reported widespread vote fraud by the ruling party. Other observers, 
such as the delegates sponsored by the National Democratic Institute, said the 
vote was Mexico's cleanest and fairest. 
</P>
<P>
 According to watchdog groups from both the United States and Mexico, there was 
a "significant" shortage of ballots at special voting booths for people living 
outside their city of origin, and at one-third of the precincts monitored, 
observers reported procedures to guard secrecy were lax. 
</P>
<P>
 "These accusations of fraud are overstated," said Miguel Escobar, the media 
liaison with the Mexican Consulate. "It was a clean election with a very high 
turnout." Escobar said about 75% of those eligible in Mexico cast votes, the 
highest in Mexico's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Many local emigres were glued to Spanish-language television and radio news 
reports last week for election news because, for the first time, they were 
allowed to vote at booths in border cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Moreno, the director of a pro-PRI committee that receives candidates 
when they visit Los Angeles, said that voting opportunity was evidence of the 
PRI's growing commitment to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a jubilant experience: There were so many different people voting and 
the best party won," said Moreno, who cast his vote in Tijuana. "Zedillo means 
continuity of progress, continuity of the same policies that made Mexico grow 
in the last six years."  
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, who owns a Downtown tire shop, said he might return to Mexico now 
since he feels more optimistic about Mexico's future. 
</P>
<P>
 While standing under a shade tree in front of the Mexican Consulate near 
MacArthur Park on Thursday, Amalia Rodriguez was fatalistic in her commentary: 
"How could they say these elections were clean, when the winners are the same 
bandits as ever?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-year-old East Los Angeles housewife said she was unable to vote because 
the polls in Tijuana were too far away.  
</P>
<P>
 If the PRD's Cardenas would have won, she said, she would have returned to her 
native state of Michoacan. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the vote, Irma Montoya, 26, said she won't return to Mexico 
because life here is easier for single women. 
</P>
<P>
 Montoya, who has lived in Pico-Union since 1983, said she learned at the 
Mexican Consulate that she was eligible to vote. She traveled to Tijuana on the 
eve of the election with 11 others in a van, leaving her three young 
American-born children with her ex-husband. The group spent the night in the 
border town and voted first thing the next morning in one of eight polling 
places set up there for Mexicans living outside the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Montoya said she also voted for the PRI, but for a different reason: "My heart 
lies with the PAN (National Action Party), but I thought that if another party 
won, there would be violence."

URBAN RADICALS GO RETRO; ROBERT VENTURI AND DENISE SCOTT BROWN SAY CIVIC 
BUILDINGS SHOULD BE 'GUTSY' BUT 'FIT LIKE A MITTEN RATHER THAN A GLOVE.' NOW, 
THEY ARE TESTING THEIR FORMULA ON LA JOLLA'S ART MUSEUM.

 Standing in the bright La Jolla sun -- he in a navy blazer, gray trousers, 
sober tie and horn-rimmed glasses, and she in a nicely cut putty-colored 
jacket, black skirt and good, black, low-heeled shoes -- Robert Venturi and 
Denise Scott Brown appear more like an upper-middle-class couple visiting from 
the East than a pair of world-famous architects. 
</P>
<P>
 Given this conservative camouflage, you wouldn't expect the Philadelphia-based 
husband-and-wife team to be infamous architectural radicals, either. Their 
manner is kindly, unpretentious, professorial (they have taught at the 
University of Pennsylvania, Harvard and Yale, and have lectured extensively). 
Their work has garnered them prestigious "mainstream" awards such as the 
National Medal of Arts and the American Institute of Architects' Architectural 
Firm Award. Venturi was awarded the coveted Pritzker Prize in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it was a feather in the cap of the Museum of Contemporary Art, San 
Diego, when Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates Inc. agreed to design the 
expansion and renovation of the museum's flagship building on Prospect Street 
in La Jolla. (La Jolla-based David Raphael Singer is the project's associate 
architect.) The expansion, which is now scheduled for completion next year, was 
announced in 1987, but stalled and remained in limbo until last fall, plagued 
by recession-related fund-raising difficulties and community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Venturi and Scott Brown, by virtue of age and recognition, appear to be 
becoming elder statespeople of the profession, they haven't lost their edge. It 
has been nearly 25 years since the publication of Venturi's landmark book 
"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture," in which he dismissed three 
decades of increasingly soulless modern architecture with the oft-quoted 
dictum, "Less is a bore," and asked that architects re-examine historical 
architecture rather than bulldoze it. And it has been nearly as long since 
Venturi and the South African-raised Scott Brown denounced the strategies that 
had produced dreary, depopulated, modern downtowns by proclaiming that -- in 
all its haphazard diversity -- "Main Street is almost all right," in "Learning 
from Las Vegas" (a book they wrote with their partner Steven Izenour). 
</P>
<P>
 And, it has been more than 30 years since Venturi shocked his peers (and the 
neighborhood) by designing a house for his mother in Chestnut Hill, Pa., that 
subverted traditional domestic architecture (a style no self-respecting 
architect was doing at the time, anyway) -- by taking its windows, gables and 
arches and breaking them up or distorting their accepted scale. But Venturi, 
Scott Brown continues to create buildings that are quite ordinary in their 
basic forms, but which bespeak their function and symbolism in surprising ways. 
One recent example is the emergency-services building the architects created 
for Disney in Orlando, Fla. Since the building houses a fire station, the 
architects clad part of the facade in very modern enameled metal panels -- 
silk-screened with large-scale bricks, a reference to an earlier era of 
firehouse architecture, and equally big Dalmatian spots, a reference to the 
traditional firehouse mascot. These designers still relish the role of 
architectural provocateurs . 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the fact that (Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, director) Hugh 
Davies is into the latest radical art, but for his building he chooses me, an 
old guy," quips Venturi. (Venturi, at 69, is not exactly ancient for an 
architect. Philip Johnson is still architecture's chief power broker at 88, and 
Frank Lloyd Wright died with his boots on at 91.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Venturi and Scott Brown are no architectural terrorists; they come not to 
deconstruct but to re-weave. When you combine an inclusive approach to design 
(his), pragmatic, humane and prodigiously informed theories of urban planning 
(hers), and an impressive knowledge of architectural history (theirs), you have 
a potent triple-threat design weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, all that firepower seems a bit overwhelming when you consider that in 
La Jolla, it's aimed at a relatively small target: an $8.3-million reworking of 
the MCA's exhibition, education, art storage and retail (bookstore and cafe) 
facilities, with the addition of a new facade and an entrance atrium, Axline 
Court, that will double as a space for museum-related social events. 
</P>
<P>
 But good things do come in small packages, even for big-time architects, and 
the MCA project is a gem -- or rather, a diamond in the rough -- in need of an 
expert cutter of stones with exactly Venturi, Scott Brown's know-how -- to make 
it rather than break it. While the museum's current agglomeration of 
modernist-influenced structures is undistinguished, its site is an architect's 
dream come true. Its back side, which includes a sculpture garden, commands a 
sweeping view of the Pacific, while its front faces an unusual and historically 
important concentration of early 20th-Century buildings -- the La Jolla Woman's 
Club, the La Jolla Recreation Center and the Bishop's School -- all of which 
were designed by Irving J. Gill. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill, who is now considered a Southern California icon but who died in 
relative obscurity in 1938, is regarded as an architect's architect for his 
transformation of the Mission Revival Style into elegantly austere compositions 
of unadorned planes and volumes that heralded the arrival of International 
Style modernism. Gill's abstraction of the historic makes him a particular 
favorite of Venturi's. "One good test of art is tension, and there is an 
ambiguity in Gill," he notes. And in the 1960s, Scott Brown was one of the 
people who fought (in vain) the demolition of Gill's 1916 Dodge house in Los 
Angeles. Moreover, the museum's original home, now obscured under decades of 
additions and renovations, was a 1916 house that Gill designed for noted 
philanthropist Ellen Browning Scripps. It was purchased by a group of artists 
and civic leaders from Scripps' estate in 1939 to house the Art Center of La 
Jolla, which was incorporated in 1941 and which evolved into the present-day 
MCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Venturi, Scott Brown's design for the museum's Prospect Street facade pays 
homage to Gill by using the abstracted arches, unembellished surfaces and 
pergolas that characterize the late architect's work. Also incorporated into 
the facade will be the front of Gill's Scripps house, which will be restored 
and used as a garden entrance (the museum's main entry will be through Axline 
Court). 
</P>
<P>
 But the architecture firm was not interested in a simplistic mimicry of the 
museum's historic surroundings, so the new elements of the street facade are 
designed at a larger scale than that of the Scripps house facade, to connect 
them to the contemporary urban fabric. "The arches are the exact proportion of 
Gill," explains Venturi, "but bigger. It's not 1915 La Jolla; it's 1995 La 
Jolla." (Fortunately, notes Scott Brown, the museum's downtown San Diego 
building, which opened last year, precluded the need to expand the La Jolla 
building to a point that would destroy its intimate scale.) 
</P>
<P>
 While the La Jolla project presented the firm with a jewel-box context, it has 
had plenty of experience with museums in far more challenging settings. Indeed, 
while waiting for the La Jolla project to revive, Venturi, Scott Brown 
completed a new downtown home for the Seattle Art Museum as well as the 
Sainsbury Wing of London's National Gallery, a controversial design (replacing 
in turn one that inspired Prince Charles' famous "carbuncle" remark) that 
ultimately opened to critical acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 And while both those museums were larger and situated in grittier urban 
settings, their connection to the sunny, affluent backdrop of La Jolla's museum 
is not so far-fetched. "The issues they face are similar," Scott Brown points 
out. "There is the outreach to more people, the widening scope of a museum to 
involve education and public-private partnerships." Furthermore, civic 
buildings -- the nature of which she discusses at length in her 1990 book 
"Urban Concepts" -- have to be what Scott Brown calls "tough and gutsy," but 
they also have to work for diverse users. "They should fit like a mitten rather 
than a glove, so many hands can fit into them," she argues. 
</P>
<P>
 The mitten theory extends to the design of exhibition spaces too. At the 
National Gallery, Venturi, Scott Brown created suitably traditional galleries 
for the display of a collection of early Renaissance paintings. Here, the firm 
has designed relatively neutral spaces befitting contemporary art -- or, as 
Venturi puts it, "The galleries are appropriately recessive places to show art. 
A lot of museum architecture in the '80s was too 'whammo.' The art -- by the 
time you got to it -- was an anticlimax." 
</P>
<P>
 The only part of the La Jolla design that qualifies in Venturi's book as 
"whammo" (a word that takes on new richness when uttered in Venturi's clipped 
manner, with a slight but unmistakable Philadelphia accent) is the lantern -- a 
sort of extruded skylight -- that crowns Axline Court. It was redesigned last 
fall from its original elliptical shape to that of an irregular seven-pointed 
star. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, says the architect, the scheme's one "bit of fanfare." Even then, it is 
meant to be a surprise; you don't see it full-on until you're in the court, 
which will also have a patterned terrazzo floor that is as eye-catching as the 
lantern above it. Ultimately, it is the one flamboyant gesture in a design that 
Venturi calls "generic architecture that gets its quality not from being 
'whammo' originally but from being careful in detail and proportion." 
</P>
<P>
 This notion of generic architec ture -- which by nature you can't really 
categorize stylistically -- is a thread that has run through the architects' 
entire body of work, but it seems more on Venturi's mind than ever these days. 
Even though he is considered the theoretical godfather of Postmodernism, which 
revived architects' interest in historical styles, Venturi pooh-poohs the 
movement, with its dependence on a Classical tradition, as irrelevant to modern 
life. Neither does he approve of the neo-Modernist style, with its pristine, 
elegant forms and highly crafted steel structures, that is now fashionable 
among younger architects; it continues "to depict the image of an old 
engineering technology," that has long been obsolete, he recently wrote in 
Architecture magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's so great about generic architecture? For one thing, explains 
Venturi, it has been great for thousands of years. Plain buildings have been 
made expressive of their use and their symbolic value to their communities 
through the ornament and information that was applied to them, rather than 
through the willful creation of new forms. As examples, Venturi cites Egyptian 
temples, with their hieroglyphic reliefs, or Early Christian basilicas, which 
were basically just long sheds of buildings, the walls of which were adorned 
with mosaics. As he explains in his Architecture article, "These images are 
signs -- explicit sources of information virtually independent of the planar 
forms and sheltering surfaces of the generic architecture they are applied to. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Venturi has been singing the praises of these "decorated sheds" for years, but 
now, in our high-tech-information age, they seem more engaging to him than 
ever. The hieroglyphics and mosaics of the past have been replaced by giant 
video screens and Gargantuan electronic billboards, where, as Venturi explains 
in his Architecture article, "Images can change over time, information can be 
infinitely varied rather than dogmatically universal, and communication can 
accommodate diversities of cultures and vocabularies, vulgar and tasteful, Pop 
and highfalutin. . . . Electronic sparkle can parallel the glitter of mosaics." 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to effect this major change in architecture won't come, Venturi 
continues, from the profession's academically oriented avant-garde, but from 
young people "who are attuned to computer techniques of our time, and who can 
exploit the substance of a real electronic technology, rather than continue to 
depict the image of an old engineering technology. . . ." Here Venturi speaks 
not only from observation but from parental pride as well. His and Scott 
Brown's son, Jim Venturi, is a 23-year-old computer whiz who makes a living in 
New York designing, among other things, computer systems for architects. 
</P>
<P>
 Venturi, Scott Brown are using such technologies right now in their major 
renovation of New York City's Whitehall Ferry Terminal, the front of which will 
have a gigantic clock, and the interiors of which will incorporate large-scale 
electronic signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Venturi's interest in "electronic sparkle," why didn't he use it in La 
Jolla? Not appropriate, replies the architect. "We couldn't do the electronic 
thing there. We're in a very sacred kind of place," he explains, referring to 
what he calls the museum's "Gill precinct." "You can't always practice what you 
preach," he continues. "Your buildings should not be a justification of your 
theories. Jean Labatut, who was trained at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and who was 
my teacher at Princeton, referred to 'creative forgetfulness.' When you design, 
you have to forget everything you know and focus on the immediate." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it is precisely this absence of dogma that has worked against 
making Venturi and Scott Brown quite as famous as some of their colleagues. 
They have, after all, no AT&T Building to their credit like Philip Johnson 
(although Venturi would dearly love to design a skyscraper), no seat on the 
Disney board like Robert A. M. Stern ("We get to design their little 
buildings," deadpans Venturi), no magazine ads for kitchen appliances featuring 
their faces like Michael Graves (although Venturi has created well-known 
furniture and tableware designs). 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't really that Venturi, Scott Brown lacks an identifiable style; its 
"generic" buildings with historical and pop-culture references are pretty easy 
to pick out. But what they aren't is splashy; if anything, they're a little too 
subtle. Neither are they "easy." Sometimes, the firm's distortions of scale 
seem awkward, making buildings appear almost frumpy (like the schoolmarm you 
know would be a dish if only she'd take off her glasses and let down her hair), 
and its cultural references can be disquietingly ironic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the architects can't be faulted -- nor are they willing to be -- for 
creating buildings that aren't "architecture lite." "You're building a 
background for life, not a stage set for actors," insists Venturi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some clients are afraid of us," says Scott Brown. "They want architects like 
themselves. One told us, 'We want a vanilla building.' But we're not good at 
second-guessing, at giving a bad building to get a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 And they don't care -- as well elder statespeople shouldn't -- that they're 
not easy to pigeonhole. "Are we avant-garde?" asks Scott Brown rhetorically. 
"Are we rear-guard? It doesn't matter. We're cooking with gas."*

DANCING THE L.A. SHUFFLE; NAOMI GOLDBERG'S COMPANY REFLECTS THE CREATIVE POWER 
OF THE CITY, BUT THAT WAS THE EASY PART. NOW IT HAS TO TACKLE WHAT'S TOUGH: 
STABILITY AND A COMMITMENT TO BRINGING DANCE TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS.

 Choreographer Naomi Goldberg doesn't seem to know the meaning of the word 
clash . She mixes modern dance and ballet idioms, choreographs to everything 
from Bach to Screamin' Jay Hawkins and leads a company that's as devoted to 
hip, postmodern concert dance as it is to folksy community center projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, eclecticism is her calling card. "She's a classicist who's got the 
heart of a romantic," says outgoing Mark Taper Forum associate artistic 
director Oskar Eustis, on whose upcoming Taper staging of Eduardo Machado's 
"Floating Islands" Goldberg is the choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has an ability to translate ideas, themes, emotions and text into kinetic 
terms. She gives it discipline and precision, but her work is suffused with 
emotional life." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's theater and opera choreography has included Han Ong's "Swooney 
Planet" and other works for the Taper's New Works Festival, "Carmen" for the 
Long Beach Opera, "The Mikado" for the Milwaukee Opera and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a kind of infectious enthusiasm -- I don't want to say it's ego-less, 
but it almost feels that way," says Eustis, who first worked with Goldberg on a 
Manhattan Theatre Club production of Philip Kan Gotanda's "Day Standing on Its 
Head." "She's astonishingly generous." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Goldberg's principal showcase is her 5-year-old company, Los Angeles 
Modern Dance and Ballet. On Saturday at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, the 
group presents "Three Tales," an evening of original works based on dramatic 
adaptations of legends and folk stories from a variety of cultural traditions. 
The scenarios are written by such playwrights as Gotanda, Luis Alfaro, Nasser 
Nasser and Kathleen Tolan and Charles Mee Jr., with music by Fredric Myrow, 
Robert Moran, Daniel Lentz and Carlos Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 But L.A. Modern Dance and Ballet isn't just another modern troupe with a slate 
of bookings at the usual chi-chi sites. What makes this company unusual is that 
it's also committed to teaching and performing in neighborhoods where dancers 
seldom tread. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's the interplay of the two identities that gives the troupe its drive. 
"There is this constant duality that comes down to the trained, perfectible 
form and the accepted free form, between the beauty that comes from training 
and the wonder of people just sharing in the moment," Goldberg says. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city where few companies stay together more than a year -- let alone long 
enough to develop an aesthetic and a mission -- L.A. Modern Dance and Ballet 
has already passed par. But it's at a Rubicon. Armed with an increasingly 
proficient style and an agenda, it's now got to tackle such new challenges as 
stabilization and touring. 
</P>
<P>
 And L.A. may be a tough place to do that. "Los Angeles is a very easy place 
for new ideas to come up and especially for individuals to surface," Goldberg 
says. "I don't think L.A. is really about the survival of groups of people, 
companies or something that has a plan for making roots." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's around 9 p.m. on one of those recent hot (and very humid) August nights, 
and Goldberg is rehearsing her company in its upstairs studio at the 
Hollywood-Los Feliz Jewish Community Center. Sweat-dripping brows go unnoticed 
and the camaraderie is evident as the members work. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Modern Dance and Ballet is a company that really does look like L.A. It's 
not just that the dancers are noticeably more varied in body type and ethnicity 
than in most modern troupes. It's also that the material sports a panoply of 
cultural influences and terpsichorean vocabularies. 
</P>
<P>
 The program that these dancers are rehearsing, "Three Tales," ties together 
several adaptations of classic stories from different times and places. It 
features the company (Susan Marie Castang, Damon Cavena White, Shawn Oda, 
Alissa Mello, Katherine Sanders, Teresa Enroth, Miki Inoue and guest artist Tim 
Fox), along with 20 girls who appear as guest performers in one section. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg herself will dance the prologue, "Mango," a scenario by Nasser based 
on a folk tale from Trinidad. The "Three Tales" themselves are: "Princess of 
the Moon," Gotanda's reworking of an 8th-Century Japanese tale; "La Llorona," 
Alfaro's take on the Mexican folk story, and "The Sisters Grimm," Tolan and 
Mee's adaptation of the fairy tale "Sleeping Beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 The prologue and three main dances all focus on female protagonists -- which 
comes in handy since L.A. Modern Dance and Ballet, like many modern companies, 
is composed mostly of female dancers. It's also in keeping with Goldberg's 
propensity for non-sexist choreography featuring strong women's roles. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, Goldberg, 33, is something of a strong female protagonist herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Born into a Jewish family that she describes as "intellectual" -- her father 
was a doctor, her mother an educator and her two sisters both hold doctorates 
-- Goldberg grew up in Teaneck, N.J. At age 9, she was accepted into the School 
of American Ballet, the academy of the New York City Ballet. By the time she 
was 12, Goldberg had to drop all of her other extracurricular pursuits because 
the dance training was so demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, Goldberg would spend an hour a day on her New Jersey campus 
and the rest of the time training in New York. "There was always this conflict 
because I went back and forth," she says. "I always had this split between this 
School of American Ballet/Balanchine perfectionism and this other side of my 
life that was just about this girl from New Jersey." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a happy straddling of two worlds. "My early- and mid-teens were the 
most difficult years of my life," says Goldberg. At 16 -- about the age when 
dancers typically advance into company apprenticeships -- Goldberg injured her 
ankle, capping an unfortunate series of sprains and strains. Within a couple of 
months, she decided to apply to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg enrolled as an English major at Barnard College at Columbia. She left 
after a year, though, to join the Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle. "Once 
again, injuries started happening," says Goldberg. "But I had discovered the 
West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 Sidelined from dancing and encouraged by her then-boyfriend -- a fire-eater -- 
Goldberg went on tour with a company of street performers. The group included 
such later-to-be-well-knowns as the Flying Karamazov Brothers and Avner the 
Eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
 For a nice Jewish girl from New Jersey, it was like running away to the 
circus. "I was still a pretty good girl, so my life went into this spin," 
Goldberg says. "(The tour) had a huge influence." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg eventually returned to New York, where she re-enrolled at Barnard as 
a dance major. "I started my first real study of classical modern dance 
techniques: Graham, Cunningham, Limon," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet modern technique seemed as restricting in its own way as ballet. "These 
(disciplines) were not interesting to me at all because I thought they were 
like ballet: Here's a vocabulary. But to me, a flexed foot was just the 
opposite of a pointed foot." 
</P>
<P>
 She found herself drawn instead to less codified, experimental forms. "The 
things I got into were contact improvisation and dance that was conceptually 
based or completely free form," says Goldberg, who also developed an avid 
interest in New York's then-burgeoning performance art scene. "I didn't have to 
worry about choreography. There were no mirrors. Everyone wore loose clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The passion for contact improvisation led Goldberg to San Francisco. After a 
year, however, she tired of trying to make it in the Bay Area and moved to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, L.A. seemed like a comparatively easy place to do your own thing. 
"When I first came, it was easy to do whatever," says Goldberg, who made ends 
meet first by working as an extra in TV and film and then later as a substitute 
teacher. "There were so many little places I could go and do little dances." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, she landed a role in the Taper production of "Ghetto," where she met 
the man who was to become her longtime mate -- stage director Brian Kulick -- 
as well as several fellow dancers with whom she would form a group known as 
Dance Diner. The group lasted only seven months, but it gave Goldberg her first 
taste of what it might be like to have a company. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Goldberg choreographed a work for the annual Dance Kaleidoscope 
festival. The piece, which featured 20 performers and was set to a Bach suite, 
combined dancers and non-dancers, and structured improvisation with 
choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Modern Dance and Ballet sprang from that experience. First the group 
needed a name. For lack of a better idea, it ended up with a name that Goldberg 
admits has been "problematic . . . If I had a better idea, I'd take it." It had 
better luck finding a base, striking a mutually beneficial arrangement with the 
Hollywood-Los Feliz JCC in Silver Lake, where the company is still 
headquartered. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg promptly got her administrative feet wet. "The first two years I was 
learning what leadership meant," she says. "The company actually began in a 
very open way and has been getting more streamlined." 
</P>
<P>
 An essential component of the streamlining process has been clarifying the 
group's dual-pronged commitment to concert dance and community projects. "We 
said, 'Let's develop the two separate sides -- the community work and a 
repertoire of work based on a method of training,' " Goldberg says. "We want 
dance to be beautiful, with the highest of aesthetic concerns, and we also want 
dance to be able to touch people in a way that comes from direct experience." 
She achieves her goal, in part, by bringing non-dancers onstage as part of her 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 This populist tactic may be unusual among modern dance companies, but it's 
integral to how L.A. Modern Dance and Ballet sees itself. "One of the most 
important things about the company is its long-term commitment to exposing 
people, and especially children, in L.A. to dance," says board member Sasha 
Emerson. "It's not about dance as an elite art form." 
</P>
<P>
 "They give a tremendous amount back, going around to gyms and schools," 
Emerson continues. "Everybody talks about multiculturalism, but it's all lip 
service unless you're really out there. Naomi gets as much back from that kind 
of work as she gives to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Major community efforts have included the 1991 Poinsettia Project, performed 
in the gym of the Poinsettia Recreation Center in Hollywood, in which 
neighborhood novices mixed onstage with professional dancers in a four-dance 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spring Gym Tour 1992 took the company to a string of Southland sites where 
dance is seldom performed. "It was then that I got the idea that I should hone 
in on the choreography more and start having more of a (fixed) group of 
dancers," says Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in 1992, Goldberg was diagnosed with lupus, an auto-immune disorder. That 
further reinforced her renewed focus on choreography and running the company, 
although she has continued to dance as well. 
</P>
<P>
 It also turned Goldberg's attention to the codification of an L.A. Modern 
Dance and Ballet method. "I'm not tied to this company doing just my 
choreography," she says. "I am tied to the company having a common technique." 
</P>
<P>
 The point is to refine a company language of movement that will enable both 
teaching and the company members' capabilities. "We had to sit down and discuss 
what our classes were going to be about," Goldberg says. "Out of that, we 
create our body of work as a company." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a consciously eclectic approach. "We asked what are the principles from 
modern dance that we want to keep? What are we getting from ballet?" Goldberg 
says. "I also wanted to bring in alternative approaches to the body."  
</P>
<P>
 The technique takes its leg work from the Balanchine style of ballet in which 
Goldberg was trained, particularly in its quickness of movement, jumps and 
sense of lightness. It also incorporates exercises from Graham, swing-like 
movements from Limon and some of the footwork and the rounded back of 
Cunningham. All of the dancers also practice yoga. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's signature choreographic style is based on this basic movement 
language and features an evocative mix of gender-ambiguous character study and 
imagery. That style has begun to clarify itself particularly during the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1993 show at Cal State L.A., Goldberg premiered two new works that may be 
the clearest articulation yet of the company aesthetic. "Sleepwalker's Travel 
Guide" is a highly theatrical multi-part dance set to New Orleans funeral 
procession jazz and "American Studies," set to music by John Adams, evokes 
images of church and community. 
</P>
<P>
 Those works -- combined, Goldberg hopes, with the new material on the Ford 
bill -- will form the basis of an L.A. Modern Dance and Ballet touring 
repertoire. The troupe has also continued with its community work, including 
the 1994 Angels Gate Dance Project in San Pedro, which culminated in two 
performances featuring 28 neighborhood residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the barrier that stands between the group and the even greater public it'd 
like to have is one that's familiar to most young L.A. companies. "We have one 
obstacle only and that's that we are just not raising the money we need to get 
this company into the proper venues," says board member Emerson. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Goldberg is optimistic, even in the face of an uphill battle. "What I 
found out quickly about L.A. is what a fluid place this is, which is also 
exactly why the company is now facing a difficult time," she says. "We would 
like to see our dancers make more of a living dancing. And the problem that 
we'll continue to face is building something that has a sense of stability to 
it."* Vital Stats

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; LOANS TO BE OFFERED FOR HOME REPAIRS

<P>
 The City Council has approved a $150,000 contract with the nonprofit 
Watts/Century Latino Organization to market and promote a $2-million pilot 
residential rehabilitation loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketing push will allow the agency and the city's housing department to 
help local property owners upgrade their single-family homes, said Alvin 
Jenkins, the Community Redevelopment Agency's manager for the Watts 
redevelopment project area. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Watts/Century) has the responsibility to go out with a bilingual team to try 
to get the confidence of the community," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency and the housing department will each put up $1 million in loans. 
The program will target an area bounded by 92nd Street on the north, the 
Century (105) Freeway on the south, Mona Boulevard on the east and the Harbor 
(10) Freeway on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing department will focus its loan program in an area west of Central 
Avenue, while the redevelopment agency will concentrate on areas east of 
Central Avenue, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty to 30 applicants are being processed through the "long pipeline" to 
receive a loan, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loans are available to property owners based on their home equity, ability to 
repay, employment status, income and other criteria. The application process 
takes about three months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency will provide low-interest loans of up to $30,000 for 
roof repairs, interior and exterior paint, new plumbing and electrical systems, 
new foundations and safety repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who qualify for rehabilitation loans also may be eligible for city 
grants of up to $7,500 for exterior improvements.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Department of Building and Safety doesn't look at the condition of 
exterior paint or broken-down fences," Jenkins said. "With this 'free money' we 
are essentially trying to make an impact on the exterior of homes to make the 
community look better." 
</P>
<P>
 The grass-roots Watts/Century organization will distribute information, 
conduct workshops to explain program requirements, help complete application 
forms and provide English-Spanish translation for applicants and the 
redevelopment agency's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to walk many miles, knock on many doors and meet face-to-face with 
many residents if our marketing program is to be a success," said Arturo 
Ybarra, executive director of the Watts/Century organization.

<P>
 Getting paid to catch crabs is hardly a job most South-Central teen-agers 
would consider. 
</P>
<P>
 But meet Trice Jones and Denise and Simboa Wright, three interns at San 
Pedro's Cabrillo Marine Aquarium whose summer jobs may lure them into 
environmental careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I was going to learn here," said Simboa, 15, as he attached a 
piece of squid bait to the end of a paper clip hook. "I just thought I was 
going to work and get money. But I've learned a lot, especially about marine 
biology." 
</P>
<P>
 The three led a group of elementary school students last week in a saltwater 
marsh crab-catching exercise to study the size, weight and the sex of the 
crustaceans. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers are among 59 high school students and recent graduates from 
East and South Los Angeles who have been placed in jobs with an environmental 
focus at 11 sites through the Youth in the Environment program. Some students 
from Wilmington and the San Fernando Valley also participated. 
</P>
<P>
 The crab-catching exercise is just one example of the exposure inner-city 
youths have obtained through the six-week $80,000 program that began in July. 
Interns at the aquarium have been assisting with daily classes for visiting 
elementary school students, studying the diversity of plankton, caring for 
vegetation native to the saltwater marsh and feeding the animals at the 
aquarium, said Steve Vogel, the facility's education supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a job, so they do have one foot in the door," said Vogel. "When we hire, 
we look for people that have some experience. It doesn't matter that they're 
not biology students from some upper-crust magnet school. For an entry-level 
position, you can teach them on the job." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Environmental Affairs Department began the Youth in the Environment 
program in 1992, providing economically disadvantaged high school students with 
paid summer employment. The idea was to create a greater diversity of people in 
environmental jobs, said Lillian Kawasaki, general manager of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Students work in specialized fields such as engineering, biology and 
waste-water treatment, performing hands-on tasks under the supervision of 
professionals.  
</P>
<P>
 Four recent interns went on to college, where one earned a waste-water 
operator's certificate, Kawasaki said. 
</P>
<P>
 "From last year's program, one of the students got a job working with the (Los 
Angeles Zoo). Who knows? Maybe there'll be a Jacques Cousteau out of all this." 
</P>
<P>
 Students also have been working at the California Museum of Science and 
Industry, the Los Angeles Aqueduct Water Filtration Plant, the El Segundo Dunes 
Restoration Project, the Hyperion and Terminal Island water treatment plants, 
and at offices of the Bureau of Sanitation and the Environmental Affairs 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Los Angeles Conservation Corps agreed to administer the 
environmental youth program in partnership with the Environmental Affairs 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The students' summer wages are provided by the federal Summer Youth Employment 
and Training Program, Kawasaki said.ENRIQUE LAVIN

<P>
 A decade ago, life was looking pretty good for William Hurt. In 1984, any 
filmmaker who wanted an ex plosive, sexy and thoroughly believable leading man 
thought first of Hurt, who had blasted onto the scene four years earlier with 
an attention-grabbing debut as the obsessed scientist in "Altered States." 
</P>
<P>
 His steamy role opposite Kathleen Turner in "Body Heat" (1981) and his 
brooding presence in "The Big Chill" (1983), along with his strong theater 
background at New York's Circle Repertory, secured his place as one of the most 
promising young actors of his generation. Janet Maslin, in a New York Times 
review of "Body Heat," wrote: "Once again, Mr. Hurt establishes himself as an 
instantly affable screen star . . . He seems thoughtful and funny, yet he has a 
comfortable physical presence, too . . . As played by Mr. Hurt, Ned . . . is a 
likable enough leading character to hold the film together." 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1985, when he won his first and only Academy Award for his bold 
performance as the flamboyant transvestite cellmate to Raul Julia's political 
prisoner in "Kiss of the Spider Woman," he was already becoming wary of the way 
the movie business operated. The honors, he found, were mitigated by doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very isolating," Hurt says now of winning the Oscar. "The instant they 
gave it to me, I thought, God, what do I do now? How am I going to walk into a 
room and have any other actor trust me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, his next two movies, "Children of a Lesser God" (1986) and 
"Broadcast News" (1987), both earned him Oscar nominations and an estimated $1 
million per role. It seemed, through much of the '80s, that he was unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, inexplicably, his career did stop -- or just seemed to. Though he 
worked almost every year after playing the brilliantly dense TV newsman in 
"Broadcast News," Hurt, as a movie presence, simply evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the screen, he'd already divorced his first wife, actress Mary Beth Hurt, 
in 1975, and in 1989, around the time of his breakup with Hollywood, Hurt was 
embroiled in a bitter palimony suit with dancer Sandra Jennings, with whom he'd 
had a son, Alex, now 11. It was also the year he met his second wife, Heidi 
Henderson, while they were undergoing alcohol and drug rehabilitation at the 
Hazelden center in Center City, Minn.  
</P>
<P>
 Starting in 1990, he was choosing roles in films like Wim Wenders' overly 
ambitious "Until the End of the World," the limp "Mr. Wonderful" and Camus' 
"The Plague," which flew straight to video. Even 1991's "The Doctor," which was 
made by a major studio (Disney) and starred Hurt, was largely forgettable. The 
films became so obscure, not only his fans but the studio executives who made 
him a star all but forgot about him. Moving to Paris, which he did after the 
breakup of his four-year marriage to Henderson, only worsened his alienation 
from Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 44, William Hurt is at something of a career crossroads. He actually 
has two new movies out next month, "Trial by Jury," from Morgan Creek, in which 
he plays a crooked ex-cop, and "Second Best," from Warner Bros., a quiet tale 
set in Wales, but both are small films, far from the blockbusters he so badly 
needs to catapult him back to his mid-'80s glory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no draw whatsoever," says a baffled senior executive at a major 
studio, who nonetheless says he could still pull off a comeback. "(Hurt's) name 
means nothing right now to studio people. He's done a bunch of weird cameos, 
and no one can understand why. I think his managers and agents have done him a 
disservice by encouraging him to be off-the-wall." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hurt, who says he makes his own decisions about work, sees it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being 'well-received' is not what I want," snaps Hurt, who looks at once 
benign and strangely debonair in his worn work shirt during a recent visit to 
New York. Born in Washington, D.C., and raised in the South Pacific and 
Manhattan, Hurt is now temporarily apart from his girlfriend, French actress 
Sandrine Bonnaire, the mother of their 6-month-old daughter (and his fourth 
child), Jeanne, both of whom are back in France. His beard, which creeps down 
his neck to just below his Adam's apple, has grown in a few shades darker than 
his sandy hair, concealing most of his face.  
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to warnings that personal questions might inspire a "punch-up" with 
the private actor, Hurt is gracious and relaxed when he receives a guest for 
the first time. He pads across the carpet in socks and nylon sandals to offer a 
choice of tea bags from a plastic sack he's smuggled into the hotel. But almost 
immediately after sinking comfortably into an overstuffed sofa, he unleashes a 
stream of articulate, though wildly manic, theories about what happened to 
Hollywood -- a place, he says, where an artistic temperament is "casually 
bludgeoned on a daily basis" -- and why his career has sputtered the way it 
has. 
</P>
<P>
 He addresses the system which made him a star with a bitterness that might be 
more appropriate for one of his many love affairs gone bad -- the same ones 
that were making headlines even when his movies were not. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hurt's version, anyway, he has been betrayed by a commercially minded 
studio system he says values personality over the process he studied at 
Juilliard and has used for years in roughly 70 theatrical productions, 
including his Tony award-winning performance in David Rabe's "Hurlyburly." 
Bluntly stating his irreconcilable differences with Hollywood, he says: "I'm 
coming from the notion that acting is an art. It is not a business. It is about 
building characters, not about selling personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be easy to dismiss Hurt's early movie success as a bad match for the 
actor who stubbornly lists his occupation on his passport as "theater" even 
after making 16 movies and pocketing an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 The perverse fact -- and problem with the theory -- is that Hurt likes making 
movies. And while his two new movies may not be the high-profile commercial 
successes Hollywood is looking for, he says he really couldn't care less. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does William Hurt care about? 
</P>
<P>
 "If a director tells me to make the audience think or feel a certain thing, I 
am instantaneously in revolt," he says, enunciating this thought clearly and 
opening his blue eyes wide behind wire-framed glasses. "I'm not there to make 
anyone else think or feel anything specific. I have agreed to something the 
whole piece says. Beyond that it is my only obligation to solve the truth of 
the piece. I don't owe anybody anything -- including the director." 
</P>
<P>
 This position is easy for Hurt, who says he is wary of most directors' 
knowledge of acting. By escaping what he calls the corrupting Hollywood studio 
system, he is trying, he says, to rediscover joy in making movies. Hollywood, 
he claims, took that away from him. "It's part of the plot that was concocted 
in the foundations of the studio system to separate the collaborators," his 
conspiracy theory begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "The director is no longer the director -- the port authority of ideas -- he's 
the hirer and firer, the bossman. They turned us all against each other. And by 
falsely glorifying the actor's personality, you turn him into his worst trap -- 
his own vanity, his ego." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is where Hurt's problems with so-called A-list actors, begins. "Are they 
A-list, or are they actors?" he asks with deadpan contempt. "For a lot of them, 
that's not what I would call acting." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, directors are just as wary of him. His reputation for being 
difficult has caused every director to pause before professionally jumping into 
bed with Hurt. In fact, Hurt's famous temper is often a result of his complex, 
sometimes close to insane need to inhabit his character. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I give more by solving the truth than by pandering to expectations 
and facile hopes," Hurt says of his methods, which for "Second Best" included 
spending several weeks with a Welsh farmer during lambing season. "I try not to 
give directors the easy stuff. I try to give them the stuff that's true. That's 
a gift. Some of them don't perceive honesty as generous, and I find that very 
sad." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Randa Haines, who directed Hurt in "Children of a Lesser God" and 
"The Doctor," Hurt puts out so much raw emotion, it takes an especially 
attentive director to wade through it all to find the art.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never backed off," says Haines, who says it was worth it. "But he's had the 
experience where directors have abandoned him -- because they're not sensitive 
enough or they're tired, or they just don't understand what this person needs, 
and it's worn Bill into the ground. He is a complicated man with a lot of 
demons. That was very clear when we were filming 'Children,' " she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, she says, in order to get at certain emotional content for a scene 
in that movie, she would provoke Hurt to violent outbursts. "It was almost as 
if that would free him to get to emotions that were not volatile -- like some 
of the sweeter moments or the humor. People in the crew thought we were 
fighting with each other, but we were never in disagreement about the work; it 
was simply the process, which was difficult for people outside that to 
understand. Some actors need love and gentleness and support. Others need 
conflict -- that was Bill, at that time."  
</P>
<P>
 "The Doctor," which they made together five years later, was a different 
story. "He was in a much better place emotionally," notes Haines. "As a result, 
the process was much less painful." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Haines, whom he grew to trust, commercial concerns somehow tainted 
his memories of filming "The Doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made a couple of films that were a little too wide and non-specific -- 
like 'The Doctor,' " says Hurt, adding that he was forced to shoot four endings 
for that film. "That's a little humiliating. They had to drag me to work -- 
ball and chain. That's not right." (Haines recalls pressure from the studio to 
shoot the final scenes in two, not four, subtly different ways.)  
</P>
<P>
 To avoid such problems in the future, Hurt is choosing his projects carefully. 
If "the play," as he calls the script, appeals to his personal vision, a 
lengthy interview with the director will tell him whether he'll be given the 
support -- and environment -- he needs to develop his character. If not, he 
simply won't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Wayne Wang ("The Joy Luck Club"), who is directing Hurt in "Smoke," 
in which he plays a writer whose wife dies leaving him with a crippling 
writer's block, says the actor's rehearsal demands took precious time from the 
$5-million film, which is due out next year. But in the end, he was glad for 
the pressure Hurt applied.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every actor is difficult in his own way," says Wang. "I respect Bill -- he 
has such incredible passion for his craft. You can see it take to take. He 
would never stop. He'd keep finding different ways to do a scene, which is 
really rare." 
</P>
<P>
 Heywood Gould, the director of "Trial by Jury," the more commercial of his two 
imminent films, also gave Hurt the time he needed. He asked Hurt to play a 
supporting role of a corrupt ex-cop who works for a mob boss, he says, because 
he knew Hurt could raise the character beyond cliche. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted another side of that cop," says Gould, who introduced Hurt to his 
character's real-life counterparts. "Bill showed me the vulnerability of the 
character. I always knew he existed on some level, but I don't think I could 
have explained it. Bill has something intangible. That's why you ask Bill Hurt 
to be in your movie." 
</P>
<P>
 And though Hurt brings enormous power to the roles he takes -- he simply 
doesn't have the eye, or the inclination, for making decisions based on career. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even director Chris Menges ("A World Apart") foresees a box-office hit for 
"Second Best," a character-driven story with a heavy moral undercurrent. "It 
doesn't have enough violence or sex," he says of his film. "But all one can do 
in the end is go for what moves you, and hope people can respond."  
</P>
<P>
 Hurt did. 
</P>
<P>
 The screenplay, about a repressed man who finds himself through his love for a 
boy he adopts, hit a nerve for Hurt. "I made this movie as an ode to my own 
sons -- especially my oldest son, Alex," he says in a rare reference to his 
often-tumultuous personal life, as his voice drops to a whisper. "I'm never 
happier than when I'm with my family." (His other sons are Samuel and William.) 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, living abroad, Hurt doesn't see much of his sons, due to court 
rulings giving their mothers custody.  
</P>
<P>
 That's why the work he's choosing meticulously these days is so important. "I 
don't want my children to have to wade through the crap to get to the cream, 
you know," he says. "I want them to be aware that I struggled to live with and 
tell my truth, and that it was a decent thing."*

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH; GRANT TO FUND FREE YOUTH DANCE SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN and LESLIE BERESTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Universal Dance Design, a Fairfax-area free summer dance school that caters to 
South Los Angeles children, received a $15,000 grant last week to continue the 
program through September. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, formerly based in Compton and now at 6009 W. Olympic Blvd., 
teaches children teamwork, discipline and self-esteem through dance, said Paul 
Kennedy, who heads the 14-year-old program.  
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy and his sister Arlene instruct local 7- to 16-year-olds who come from 
foster homes, juvenile probation centers, church groups and the 
Watts-Willowbrook Boys and Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a two-month project of intense dance study," said Arlene Kennedy. "We'll 
have them performing by the last weekend of September." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they had originally planned for no more than 40 young dancers, the 
studio ended up with nearly 60 youths. "How could we say no?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kennedys and six other instructors are coaching their new students -- most 
of whom have had no previous dance experience -- in tap, hip-hop, jazz, ballet 
and modern dance. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance school will use the money from a Community Development Block Grant 
through County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite-Burke's office to buy tap and 
ballet shoes, food, leotards and other equipment, Paul Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for the children to feel the artistic quality of having the 
proper equipment and also that they feel part of the program," said Kennedy, 
who has been teaching dance for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in the creative setting of dance and music, racial barriers are 
broken down, resulting in a new level of communication.  
</P>
<P>
 "We find that the children -- when they are in an artistic environment -- 
don't have to compete as much and are able to give more of themselves," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is planning a late September dance concert at a Hollywood theater 
to culminate the summer session. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully we will get more attention and more funding so that we can have a 
year-round program," Paul Kennedy said.

COVER STORY; ROCK'S TOP 40 POWER PLAYERS; TIME AGAIN FOR CALENDAR'S SURVEY OF 
WHO HAS THE MOST CLOUT IN THE RECORD BIZ. THIS YEAR, MORE THAN HALF THE NAMES 
ARE NEW. WHY THE SHAKEOUT HAPPENED AND WHY THE NEWS IS GOOD FOR MUSIC FANS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, the record industry in America was wearing a black armband. 
Reeling from seeing companies gobbled up by foreign conglomerates, countless 
executives worried about their jobs and the fate of the music itself. 
</P>
<P>
 There were ominous predictions that the new bosses, derided as "corporate 
suits," would squeeze the creativity out of the business by bringing in 
faceless number-crunchers who prized only bottom-line results. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the armbands are off. 
</P>
<P>
 With profits soaring and confidence at a record high, many of the same 
executives now speak of how healthy the mood is in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern sales tracking systems imposed by the giant firms have helped identify 
massive growth potential in musical genres once considered on the commercial 
fringe -- notably country, rap and alternative rock. 
</P>
<P>
 This emphasis on diversification has led to an explosion of new 
million-sellers at the top of the charts -- from rap's Dr. Dre to alternative 
rockers Pearl Jam -- as well as a battery of fresh faces in the corporate 
boardrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The shake-up has been so extensive that more than half of the names on 
Calendar's list of the industry's 40 most powerful people are different from a 
similar roll call two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes haven't been painless. Some industry legends have fallen as a new 
generation of executives assumes the mantle of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a revolution in music and it has forced major changes in the way 
the industry operates," says Doug Morris, who last month was named to head the 
domestic division of Warner Music Group, the world's largest record firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on a real roller-coaster ride. Musical tastes have changed dramatically 
and some of the people who have been in power for many years didn't see it 
coming and they didn't adjust." 
</P>
<P>
 Sums up Clive Davis, head of Arista Records and one of the industry's most 
successful figures for more than 25 years: "There's much more opportunity for 
original, cutting-edge thinkers to make it out there these days. Music is what 
record corporations sell and they must count on entrepreneurs who have ears to 
find the best stuff to market. The future of these corporations doesn't hinge 
on who's writing the check, it hinges on who's writing the music." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From a distance, the story of the last two years in the record business is 
simply a tale of the rich getting richer. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Music and Sony -- the industry leaders since the '60s -- continue to 
dominate the domestic and global musical market, accounting for more than a 
third of of the $10-billion U.S. recording market. 
</P>
<P>
 But it hasn't been business as usual in the '90s at either recording titan. 
</P>
<P>
 Both firms have gone through such major reorganizations that, in the words of 
one rival corporation, it's as if Sony and Warner Music were both "gutted with 
grenades." 
</P>
<P>
 The first shake-up began at Sony when Thomas D. Mottola, a former talent 
manager with scant record company experience, was tapped in 1988 to succeed 
Walter Yetnikoff, an industry kingpin who had ruled the former CBS music empire 
for more than a decade with an iron fist. 
</P>
<P>
 Mottola raised eyebrows by quickly installing a team of largely unproven 
executives in key roles, causing many in the industry to openly predict 
disaster for the already slumbering Japanese giant. The jokes were not kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Mottola is enjoying the last laugh, however. In the last two years, his team 
-- Michele Anthony, Don Ienner and Dave Glew -- has restored credibility to 
Sony by generating heat in a variety of areas. The team is admired by 
competitors for both the aggressive pursuit and marketing of such hot young 
acts as Pearl Jam and the revitalization of such veteran artists as Billy Joel. 
The result is Mottola and his three key aides have burst onto the Top 40 list. 
Sony Music's 1993 global revenue: $4.48 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson of Sony's reorganization wasn't lost on Robert Morgado, chairman of 
the Warner Music Group, whose chief labels -- Warner Bros., Elektra and 
Atlantic -- are home to such acts as R.E.M, Madonna, Metallica and Snoop Doggy 
Dogg. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his multibillion-dollar conglomerate was already the strongest music 
combine on the planet, Morgado felt that a shake-up could help him slash costs 
and bolster an even bigger market share. Warner Music's 1993 global revenue: 
$5.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 To spearhead the changes, Morgado turned in 1990 to Atlantic Chairman Doug 
Morris, with whom he had the best relationship of the three firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Mottola, Morris turned to a trio of untested young executives -- Jimmy 
Iovine, Sylvia Rhone and Danny Goldberg -- who, over the last three years, 
helped the Atlantic Group deliver an avalanche of hits and nearly double 
revenues. Morris was rewarded last month by being named the head of Time 
Warner's new domestic music division. 
</P>
<P>
 Upset over the new chain of command and orders to house-clean their 
operations, industry titans Mo Ostin and Bob Krasnow, heads of Warner Bros. and 
Elektra, respectively, abruptly resigned. Their replacements: Rhone and Lenny 
Waronker, an Ostin protege and former record producer. Along with Morris and 
Goldberg, they join the Top 40 list. 
</P>
<P>
 EMI Music is still not over the brutal changes it experienced last year, when 
a slew of veteran executives at Capitol Records were replaced with a team 
headed up by Gary Gersh, a Geffen Records executive with a strong music 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 And PolyGram is also in the middle of a significant restructuring plan, which 
many believe will lead to more hands-on participation from the much-respected 
Chris Blackwell, who sold his Island Records five years ago to the London-based 
conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bigwigs duke it out behind closed doors, the winners will be those 
companies who can best discover and nurture the emerging artists whose visions 
fuel the industry -- the ones who are able to adjust to changes the way 
upstarts like Geffen Records did in the '70s and '80s, and Interscope Records 
has done so dramatically in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter who ends up running what," says entertainment impresario David 
Geffen, "this business will continue to boom as long as the artists keep making 
good music and the companies ensure that music is available to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 A gainst all expectations, Inter scope Records has become the toast of the 
industry. The Los Angeles-based label's phenomenal rise has taught other 
executives the importance of pinpointing innovative talent and respecting 
creative freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Started from scratch in 1991 by record producer Jimmy Iovine and investor Ted 
Field as a joint venture with Warner Music Group, the company ignored the 
industry game plan of trying to sign veteran superstars in hopes of a quick 
financial fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of looking back at who has sold, they looked ahead at who was going to 
sell -- and bet boldly on their instincts that alternative rock and rap were 
the direction of pop in the '90s. Thanks to the mushrooming popularity of such 
acts as Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Nine Inch Nails, the company is now worth 
more than $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two guys have done more to raise the standards of what it means to be 
an executive at a record company than anybody I can think of in years," says 
Alain Levy, chairman of PolyGram N.V., a competing conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hilarious because I hear other executives whining about how while they 
were off playing golf in the Hamptons, Jimmy and Ted nabbed another band from 
behind their backs." 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on adapting to the changing musical marketplace has also resulted 
in breaking down the barriers of sexism and racial segregation -- opening the 
door slightly for a handful of talented women and African American executives. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of two more African American figures to the list since 1992 
boosts the number up to six -- which is still very slight considering the 
dramatic commercial and creative impact of black music in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black music is the pop music of the '90s," says Sony's Mottola, whose company 
has forged deals with such street-oriented labels as So So Def and Ruffhouse. 
"Its roots and influences have been prevalent in pop forever. Now, however, 
more than any time since Motown in the '60s, black music is the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, corporations have invested hundreds of millions of 
dollars in labels run by Rhone, Jheryl Busby, Andre Harrell and L.A. Reid & 
Babyface -- African American executives who have delivered huge hits by such 
multimillion-selling acts as Boyz II Men, En Vogue, Jodeci and Toni Braxton. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the biggest and most surprising breakthrough is America's 
increasing appetite for rap music. Interscope Records was sharply criticized 
from the industry's good old boy club three years ago when it invested a 
whopping $10 million to bankroll Death Row Records, a label founded by 
controversial rap producer Dr. Dre and his equally controversial partner Suge 
Knight -- two young African Americans from Compton with criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before Death Row pushed hard-core hip-hop into the mainstream -- 
successfully transforming "Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang," a gangsta rap song 
previously rejected by all its competitors, into a Top 20 hit. Knight, who has 
been arrested twice on battery and weapons charges since starting his 
multimillion-dollar firm with Dre, hopes the success of Death Row will pave the 
way for other aggressive, street-oriented businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, the industry didn't want anything to do with two guys from Compton, 
but I think our success has helped change the way the old guard now views rap," 
says Knight, whose record label has grossed more than $60 million in revenues 
this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They realize when Death Row makes a gang of money, it helps everybody in the 
industry. The best thing our success has done is open the door for other 
aggressive young entrepreneurs. The record business is much more open to change 
than it's ever been before." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't think there aren't any clouds behind the industry's silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the talk about how hot and heavy competition is among the Top 40 power 
brokers for market share, you'd never guess that the music industry is 
knee-deep in a federal antitrust investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Looming over the future is a price-fixing probe launched last year by the 
Federal Trade Commission, in which testimony was recently subpoenaed from 
record distribution executives at the six biggest conglomerates -- Warner 
Music, EMI Music, MCA Music Entertainment, Sony Music, PolyGram and 
Bertelsmann. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, five of those firms are under investigation for monopolistic 
practices by the Justice Department for their involvement with Ticketmaster in 
trying to create a video music channel to challenge MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 With the government snooping around the back door, executives are also 
beginning to take a second look at the controversial world of record promotion 
-- re-evaluating the cost effectiveness of hiring outside contractors and trade 
magazines called "tipsheets" that purport to have close relationships with 
radio station personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Now able to look at which records are played on the radio and sold in stores 
with previously unavailable accuracy, several label chiefs say they plan to 
reconsider their multimillion-dollar promotion budgets -- a move that could 
impact the power ranking of some of those in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, the biggest problem for the Top 40 cast on the information 
superhighway may be high-tech theft. Record companies are currently lobbying 
Congress to pass performance-rights legislation that would require royalty 
payments to artists and record companies any time a piece of music is 
electronically transmitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential for rampant piracy in the digital world of interactive on-line 
computer services makes catching thieves counterfeiting cassettes in their 
garages seem like a kindergarten problem," says MCA Music Entertainment 
Chairman Al Teller. "It's essential that the copyright laws be overhauled to 
protect intellectual property. This isn't just a national problem for our 
industry, it's a global mess." 
</P>
<P>
 It may be a global mess, but it's also a golden global opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 As copyright enforcement improves and markets open up around the world, labels 
expect global retail sales to soar far past last year's record-breaking 
$30-billion mark. Executives particularly look forward to exploiting burgeoning 
territories in Latin America and Southeast Asia, which many predict will soon 
become pop's premier touring market. 
</P>
<P>
 While corporations are tapping into the demand for indigenous music in new 
territories, executives anticipate that more than 60% of the music sold 
overseas will continue to come from sales of albums by U.S. artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of the industry, Warner Bros. Records President Waronker says, 
hinges on the ability to find those vital artists. "It's crucial for companies 
to maintain a musical point of view," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great music is what people buy. In the end, all that matters is the music. 
Everything I've learned in this business tells me that companies who do the 
best (in coming years) will be the ones who remember that fact." Album Sales

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WILSHIRE; JOBS PROGRAM LENDS A HAND TO YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day he finished classes at Glendale Career College for his associate's 
degree in accounting, Marco Izaguirre received an unexpected call from the 
Heart of Los Angeles youth center, where he had spent many afternoons as a 
youth participating in sports, arts and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me they had a job interview for me," said Izaguirre, who still 
maintained contact with staff and occasionally visited the Wilshire Boulevard 
center. "I hadn't talked to them in about two weeks, and they didn't know I had 
just finished school." 
</P>
<P>
 Izaguirre interviewed for a summer clerical job at a law firm that same day 
and was hired to begin the following morning. The opportunity presented to him, 
he learned, turned out to be part of Lend-a-Hand, a new program sponsored by 
the Los Angeles legal community to provide summer employment for urban youths. 
</P>
<P>
 A cooperative effort of the Los Angeles County Bar and the Southern California 
Chinese Lawyers' associations and the firm of Robbins, Berliner & Carson, the 
Lend-a-Hand program employed 20 local students in law firms and other 
corporations beginning in June. 
</P>
<P>
 One summer, lots of hard work and a few paper cuts later, two of the youths 
have worked out so well that their employers have chosen to keep them on 
year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked me if I wanted to stay. I said, 'Sure!' " said Izaguirre, who now 
works full time at the firm but hopes to continue there part time when he 
returns to school for his bachelor's degree next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramses Martinez, 18, a Los Angeles High School graduate who also learned of 
Lend-a-Hand through the youth center, will be keeping his job as well, adapting 
his work hours to his class schedule when he begins college this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest reward is that now people are calling, saying, 'Hey, can we keep 
your student for the fall?' " said Susan Forte of Forte Communications, whose 
clients include Robbins, Berliner & Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Forte committed herself to helping attorney and County Bar Assn. 
President John Carson -- who envisioned Lend-a-Hand after hearing of a similar 
program in St. Louis -- line up the jobs, as well as the youths to fill them. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to find young employees, Carson, Forte and others contacted local 
youth organizations, including Heart of Los Angeles, the youth employment 
centers of the Los Angeles Unified School District, the Educational Resource 
and Services Center for Children with Learning Disabilities, the California 
Academy of Mathematics and Science, and the Ketchum Downtown YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than a month, Forte said, Lend-a-Hand was ready to go, and the 
students -- most of them from area high schools, with the exception of 
Izaguirre -- were placed.  
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Moore, executive director of Heart of Los Angeles, plans to keep 
promoting Lend-a-Hand among the teen-agers who attend the center as the program 
expands to accommodate students wanting to work after school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad part is that we'll miss them here," he said. "But this job experience 
is really important for them."

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: MID-CITY AREA; JOINT REDEVELOPMENT MEETING PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The seven project area committees that voted last month to consolidate their 
efforts into one large redevelopment zone will meet jointly at 3:30 p.m. 
Tuesday in the multipurpose room of Pio Pico Elementary School, 1512 S. 
Arlington Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the seven commercial corridors will discuss the next steps 
in forming a redevelopment zone: preparing a draft preliminary plan and forming 
one elected joint-project area committee for the entire zone, which will 
oversee drafting and implementing a redevelopment program. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members will begin prioritizing projects and pinpointing 
redevelopment goals, said Community Redevelopment Agency spokeswoman Gail 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial corridors forming the tentative redevelopment zone include the 
Greater Mid-City Revitalization Area, which is bounded by San Vicente Boulevard 
on the north, Venice Boulevard on the south, West Boulevard on the east and La 
Brea Avenue on the west, as well as commercial strips along Jefferson, Adams, 
Washington, Crenshaw, Pico and Venice boulevards.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; EAST WEST PLAYERS MAY MOVE TO LATC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 East West Players, an Asian performance group, has started negotiations for a 
possible move from its 99-seat Silver Lake home to a 296-seat space at the 
city-owned Los Angeles Theatre Center, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have wanted to move for some time now," said Tim Dang, artistic director 
of the 29-year-old theatrical troupe. "Our audience is coming from all over the 
place, so we wanted to move to a more central location, which is Downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 The move to LATC would be temporary. East West Players plans to move to its 
permanent home at Little Tokyo's historic Union Church sometime in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 East West Players put its theater at 4424 Santa Monica Blvd. up for sale for 
an undisclosed sum because ticket sales have declined as much as 15% since the 
January Northridge quake, Dang said. Sales also dropped after October's 
Southland fires and the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people since the riots have become very wary of the area," which has 
also been plagued by car burglaries and vandalism, Dang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Downtown is also struggling to rebuild its image as a safe community 
for entertainment, business and dining, Dang said, at 514 S. Spring St., LATC 
has a better chance of drawing larger audiences. The facility is run by the 
city's Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cultural Affairs (officials) are making it quite clear to us that they have 
increased their security, in terms of the lighting, in terms of the parking 
situation," Dang said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still looking at other places," Dang said, "but LATC seems one of the 
best. . . . We would be making a step up from where we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking over operations of the Downtown theater in October, 1991, the 
city has spent $100,000 a year on security and made efforts to beautify the 
Spring Street area with trees, said Lee Sweet, LATC business manager. Although 
panhandlers can still be seen on the street, that hasn't stopped audiences from 
watching the multiethnic shows at the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 5,000 to 7,500 people came to the theater in the 1991-92 season, 
compared to 19,500 in the 1992-93 season, Sweet said. 
</P>
<P>
 LATC is composed of four theaters -- seating 90, 296, 320 and 498. 
</P>
<P>
 If both sides can agree on a contract, Dang plans to relocate during a break 
in the group's performances, between late December and mid-January. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ECHO PARK/ ANGELINO HEIGHTS; FIREHOUSE MAY GAIN 
HISTORICAL STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's sixth fire station, built in 1929 and closed in 1987, could become 
the ninth to be tagged as a historical and cultural monument. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unique," said Jai Pal Khalsa, an architect who nominated the 65-year-old 
building for the designation. "The fact that that's a Mediterranean-style 
firehouse and that there are not to my knowledge other firehouses of that style 
makes it important." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this summer, the Cultural Heritage Commission recommended that the 
City Council add Fire Station No. 6 at 534 E. Edgeware Road to Los Angeles' 
list of 600 monuments. 
</P>
<P>
 A council committee is expected to vote on the issue next month, said Nancy 
Fernandez, executive assistant for the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacant and boarded-up firehouse rests in a community south of Echo Park 
called Angelino Heights, known for its Victorian homes and one of the first 
suburbs in Los Angeles. Angelino Heights was designated the city's first 
historical preservation area, Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monument status ensures that any future building rehabilitation will preserve 
as much as possible the structure's original architectural style, Fernandez 
said. It also protects the monument from demolition without a favorable 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 Built at a cost of $40,000, the two-story, light yellow fire station features 
a small balcony, a 2-inch-thick wooden front door, an arched entryway and an 
old-fashioned ceiling of stamped tin -- all signs of Mediterranean-style 
architecture, Khalsa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the building has brass fire poles, rather than the aluminum ones that 
were installed in stations built after the 1960s, said Jon W. Jacobsmeyer, an 
engineer for the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A city construction crew first erected Station No. 6 at 1279 Temple St. In 
1948, city officials had it moved to Edgeware Road to accommodate construction 
of the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Los Angeles Fire Department officials closed the station in 1987 and 
built a new one at 326 N. Virgil Ave., Echo Park and Angelino Heights residents 
have remained vocal about its future use. 
</P>
<P>
 As a historical monument, old Station No. 6 could become an ideal spot for a 
community center, said Danny Munoz, former president of the Angelino Heights 
Community Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community at large has been neglected for so many years, and it's time 
that they have a place where people can meet," Munoz said.  
</P>
<P>
 If that idea doesn't pan out, the city should reopen the station with engine 
trucks and firefighters once a seismic upgrade is completed, said another 
resident, Karen Jaeger. 
</P>
<P>
 A pastor at nearby Bethel Temple also has his eye on the building for church 
and community use. "If (fire officials) give it up, we're interested 1,000%," 
said Pastor H.M. Barfoot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fire Department has other plans for old Station No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not giving it up," said fire engineer Jacobsmeyer. The Fire Department 
is planning to seismically upgrade the building so it can house a disaster 
preparedness center that is now in trailers in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The move could take an additional year and a half, so fire officials have 
agreed to negotiate with Councilman Mike Hernandez for another building for 
disaster preparedness staff. "There's no doubt in my mind it's going to have a 
(historical) designation," the councilman said. "What I like to do is weigh all 
the options to see what's in the best interest of all the district." TOMMY LI

COVER STORY; ROCK'S TOP 40 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MICHELE ANTHONY, 37, executive vice president of Sony Music Entertainment.  
</P>
<P>
 This former Los Angeles attorney, whose clients included Guns N' Roses and 
Soundgarden, is widely admired for being skilled at both day-to-day operations 
and for relating to artists. She played a pivotal role in securing deals with 
Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and the return to Sony of Aerosmith. 
</P>
<P>
 KEN BERRY, 42, CEO of EMI Records Group International and Virgin Music Group.  
</P>
<P>
 This Brit quietly built Virgin into one of the industry's most attractive 
independent labels. If Virgin maintains its momentum, Berry -- who besides 
running Virgin is the No. 2 man in EMI's international operation -- could add 
the U.S. operations to his domain if business doesn't improve domestically for 
EMI. 
</P>
<P>
 CHRIS BLACKWELL, 57, chairman of Island Records.  
</P>
<P>
 After selling his Island Records to PolyGram in 1989 for $300 million, the 
word was that Blackwell -- who helped make Bob Marley and U2 international 
forces -- had lost interest in the music business. But he's back full-time 
following a new arrangement with PolyGram. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN BRANCA, 43, attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 He must be tired by now of hearing that he looks more like a rock musician 
than a lawyer, but one of the reasons Branca's the industry's top legal gun on 
the West Coast is that he relates so well to the artists, including Michael 
Jackson, Aerosmith and the Rolling Stones. He was instrumental in sculpting the 
Interscope and American Recordings deals. 
</P>
<P>
 TONY BROWN, 47, president of MCA Records/Nashville.  
</P>
<P>
 You got a sense this year of just how hot Brown is when other labels began 
throwing money at him, hoping to lure him away from MCA, where he had either 
signed or produced records by such stars as Reba McEntire, Vince Gill, Wynonna 
Judd and Lyle Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
 JHERYL BUSBY, 45, president and CEO of Motown Records.  
</P>
<P>
 Things have been slow at Motown, but this is a cyclical business and Busby is 
a hard worker with savvy instincts. So he remains a factor, especially with a 
roster that includes Boyz II Men, Queen Latifah and (don't forget) Stevie 
Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 CLIVE CALDER, chief of Jive Records.  
</P>
<P>
 You may never see a photo of Calder even in the trades, but you certainly hear 
the hits from his label. In Top 40 now: R. Kelly's "Your Body's Callin' " and 
Aaliyah's "Back and Forth." So why does this South African native in his 
mid-40s keep such a low profile? Responded his assistant, "No comment." 
</P>
<P>
 CLIVE DAVIS, 61, president and CEO of Arista Records.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics may not always agree with the taste of this hands-on music exec 
(bestsellers include Ace of Base and Kenny G), but no one can argue with his 
results. Last year, Arista racked up $220 million in U.S. sales in 1993 -- the 
best in its 18-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
<P>
 SoundScan's Mike Shalett, 42, and Mike Fine, 51, introduced a computerized 
monitoring system that for the first time told labels exactly how many of their 
albums were sold each week. Now look for a similar impact from Broadcast Data 
Systems, a tracking system that gives companies the same accuracy when it comes 
to radio airplay of records. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL DORNEMANN, 48, chairman and CEO of Bertelsmann Music Group.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect this former IBM and BMW executive to ever be mentioned in the 
same breath as Clive Davis or Mo Ostin, but BMG has moved during his watch past 
EMI and MCA into a third-place share in the domestic record industry. 1993 
worldwide sales: $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 DR. DRE/SUGE KNIGHT, both 29, co-owners of Death Row Records.  
</P>
<P>
 Rap producer extraordinaire Dr. Dre, left, and partner Marion (Suge) Knight 
couldn't get anyone to finance their gangsta rap record label three years go 
because both had criminal records and contract disputes. But Interscope took a 
chance and it paid off with an estimated $60 million in sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
 TIM DUBOIS, 46, president of Arista Nashville.  
</P>
<P>
 After early success as a songwriter (the novelty gem "She Got the Goldmine, I 
Got the Shaft"), this former financial analyst moved into production and then 
to his current post. Results of his golden touch at Arista: Alan Jackson, 
Brooks & Dunn and Diamond Rio. He's been rewarded with his own Texas label. 
</P>
<P>
 DON ENGEL, 64, attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 It's understandable why record executives get nervous when Engel's on the 
phone. The dapper Los Angeles attorney may come across as low-key, but he's 
widely regarded as the toughest litigator in the industry. When artists, 
including Clint Black and Don Henley, want to break or revise their contracts, 
Engel gets the call. 
</P>
<P>
 JAMES G. FIFIELD, 52, president and CEO of EMI Music.  
</P>
<P>
 There was lots of snickering two years ago when everyone thought this former 
General Mills manager, who heads the long-troubled, $2.64-billion EMI Music 
global empire, paid w-a-a-a-y too much ($1 billion) for Virgin Records. But 
Virgin is now the jewel of the EMI stable. Future challenge: Shore up the rest 
of that stable. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID GEFFEN, 51, founder of the David Geffen Co.  
</P>
<P>
 The big question is what he's going to do with his $1 billion once his 
contract with Matsushita (which now owns Geffen Records) expires at the end of 
this year. If he leaves the music business, it may be because the sharpest man 
in the industry wants new challenges. On to politics? 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID GLEW, 53, chairman of Epic Records Group.  
</P>
<P>
 With input from such aides as Richard Griffith and Glen Brunman, Glew has 
expanded the Epic image boldly in such varied areas as contemporary rock (Pearl 
Jam, Rage Against the Machine) and soundtracks ("Sleepless in Seattle" and 
"Forrest Gump"). 
</P>
<P>
 DANNY GOLDBERG, 44, president of Atlantic Records.  
</P>
<P>
 This former manager of Bonnie Raitt and Nirvana was brought in by Doug Morris 
three years ago to strengthen the label's rock credentials. In a remarkable 
series of moves, Goldberg, cut deals with four promising indie labels: Matador, 
Mammoth, Rhino and Curb Records. Look for him to be elevated to head of the 
entire Atlantic Music Group by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 ALLEN GRUBMAN, 51, attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 One reason so many superstars turn to him when it comes to renewing contracts 
is that Grubman is the man that the industry kingpins -- from David Geffen to 
Tommy Mottola -- also turn to when they need counsel. Billy Joel once accused 
Grubman of conflict-of-interest, but other stars who rely on him include 
Madonna, Bruce Springsteen and Mariah Carey. 
</P>
<P>
 ANDRE HARRELL, 33, CEO of Uptown Entertainment.  
</P>
<P>
 After the dramatic success of such acts as Mary J. Blige and Jodeci led to a 
spectacular $50-million pact with MCA in 1992, Harrell, to some degree, is on 
trial, following the loss of talent scout Sean (Puffy) Combs and staff producer 
DeVante Swing, who signed a production deal with Death Row Records. But he's 
still got the acts and is making a move into TV and movies. 
</P>
<P>
 DON IENNER, 41, chairman of Columbia Records Group.  
</P>
<P>
 Known as a sagacious worker with a quick temper, Ienner has reportedly doubled 
profits at the Columbia label, devoting as much time to such young mavericks as 
Cypress Hill and Alice in Chains as such established superstars Pink Floyd and 
Billy Joel. He's skyrocketing. 
</P>
<P>
 JIMMY IOVINE / TED FIELD, 41 and 42 respectively, Interscope Records.  
</P>
<P>
 Just as doomsayers two years ago were saying that there was no longer room in 
the conglomerate era for the maverick vision that built the industry, financier 
Field (left, above) and record producer Iovine parlayed a strong vision (for 
cutting-edge forces such as alternative rock and gangsta rap) and a Time Warner 
financial stake into the pop success story of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLES KOPPELMAN, 52, chairman and CEO of EMI Records Group North America.  
</P>
<P>
 The veteran music man was lauded for luring talent guru Gary Gersh away from 
Geffen Records, helping orchestrate last year's Frank Sinatra comeback for 
Capitol and the unexpected success this year with the Benedictine Monks on 
Angel. But many feel his ERG division is still in need of a life-support 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. REID & BABYFACE, 38 and 36 respectively, LaFace Records.  
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Reid and Kenny Edmonds (top, above) -- whose credits include writing 
and producing Boyz II Men's "End of the Road" and much of the Toni Braxton 
album -- may have called it quits as a studio team, but they'll continue 
running this hugely successful R&B and rap Atlanta label. 
</P>
<P>
 ALAIN LEVY, 47, CEO of PolyGram International.  
</P>
<P>
 As head of a $3.8-billion global operation, this Frenchman continues to try to 
find the formula to put PolyGram in position to make a serious run at the 
industry dominance of Sony and Warner Music. The latest, pricey acquisitions: 
Motown and Def Jam distribution pact. 
</P>
<P>
 JUDY McGRATH, 41, president of MTV Music Television.  
</P>
<P>
 There isn't anybody you'd rather have owing you a favor than McGrath because 
MTV remains the best way to build an audience for a new record. With the full 
support of chairman and CEO Tom Freston, McGrath is the one who pushed the 
cable channel to take a higher political and social profile in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT MORGADO, 50, chairman of Warner Music Group.  
</P>
<P>
 Morgado's bold directive to Doug Morris to overhaul Atlantic Records has 
resulted in dramatically increasing not only the bottom line, but the 
credibility of the company's artist roster. Now the industry is waiting to see 
if his equally daring moves in restructuring Warner Bros. and Elektra also pay 
off. 1993 global sales: $5.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 DOUG MORRIS, 54, chief operating officer of Warner Music USA.  
</P>
<P>
 No one has made more impressive strides since the last Calendar Top 40 in 1992 
than this New Yorker, who came out from the shadow of legendary Atlantic 
chairman Ahmet Ertegun into his own when Robert Morgado asked him in 1990 to 
rejuvenate the slumbering label. Morris delivered so well that Morgado elevated 
him to the No. 2 U.S. post. 
</P>
<P>
 THOMAS D. MOTTOLA, 44, president and chief operating officer of Sony Music 
Entertainment. This former talent manager (Hall & Oates and John Mellencamp) 
hasn't just prevailed at Sony, he is now widely regarded as a formidable player 
with strong leadership qualities. With Sony's troubles in its movie and TV 
ventures, Mottola's Music division is the jewel in the Sony entertainment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 MO OSTIN, 67, chairman of Warner Bros Records.  
</P>
<P>
 Tick . . . tick . . . tick. That's the sound of an era ending as this 
legendary figure in the business for three decades steps down on Jan. 1. He not 
only brought to the Burbank label a philosophy in the '60s that the artist is 
king, but he also instituted a competitive management system that remains a 
model for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 PEARL JAM, rock band.  
</P>
<P>
 Any rock act that sells 12 million albums in two years has power, but few use 
that muscle for anything other than to build a career. Pearl Jam (with singer 
Eddie Vedder, above) is the exception. In a complaint filed with the government 
in May, the band charged that Ticketmaster is a monopoly that prevented the 
group from staging a low-price summer tour. 
</P>
<P>
 SYLVIA RHONE, 42, CEO of Elektra/EastWest Records.  
</P>
<P>
 The status of women was so low in the industry two years ago that no one 
interviewed nominated a woman for Calendar's Top 40 list even though Rhone was 
already CEO of EastWest Records, whose roster included En Vogue. But Morris and 
Morgado were watching and they named her to head Elektra Records, one of the 
industry's most distinguished labels. 
</P>
<P>
 FRED ROSEN, 45, chairman of Ticketmaster.  
</P>
<P>
 If you want to go on tour in America, the road leads through Rosen's company, 
which virtually controls the nation's pop-rock ticket distribution system. But 
Rosen's power is being tested by the Pearl Jam antitrust complaint -- a move 
that he dismisses as a publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
 RICK RUBIN, 31, founder of American Recordings.  
</P>
<P>
 His label seemed ideally positioned two years ago to attract all the new 
cutting-edge rock and rap acts, but Interscope appears to have steamrolled past 
him. Though Rubin's roster -- which includes Danzig, Black Crowes and Sir 
Mix-a-Lot -- still has some punch, his strength may be tied more to his 
production credits. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL P. SCHULHOF, 51, CEO of Sony Corp. of America and Sony Music.  
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the revitalization of Sony in the '90s, this former physicist 
began the ball rolling by orchestrating Sony's $1-billion purchase of CBS 
Records and then installing the unproven Mottola to run it. The result: 
worldwide grosses of $4.5 billion, which puts Sony right on the heels of 
perennial leader Warner Music. 
</P>
<P>
 RUSSELL SIMMONS, 37, chairman of Rush Communications.  
</P>
<P>
 Simmons may often seem like he's moving in 10 directions at once -- from 
movies to TV to music -- but he's got a feel for the street pulse. That's why 
PolyGram's Levy paid an estimated $50 million for a record label that rivals 
say has been losing money. Latest Def Jam hits: Warren G and Onyx. 
</P>
<P>
 SEYMOUR STEIN, 52, president of Sire Records.  
</P>
<P>
 You don't hear as much about the godfather of alternative music as in the '70s 
and '80s when he was signing Madonna, Talking Heads and the Pretenders. One 
reason is the rest of the industry has learned from his daring and now competes 
with him for the acts that once seemed on the commercial fringe. 
</P>
<P>
 AL TELLER, 50, chairman of MCA Music Entertainment and executive vice 
president of MCA Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides running MCA Records, Teller oversees the entire MCA music distribution 
network, which includes the hot Nashville country division and the always 
potent Geffen Records. Respected as a sharp strategist and keen manager, Teller 
still needs to expand MCA's low domestic market share. 1993 worldwide sales: 
$1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 VIDEO JUKEBOX NETWORK 
</P>
<P>
 What to do if you can't get your controversial rock or rap videos on MTV? You 
turn to the Box, founded by former MTV executive Les Garland to play videos 24 
hours a day. Selection of videos on the Box cable channel is determined by 
viewer requests and "playola" -- a system that, for $27,000 from a label, gets 
play for a specific video. And don't think executives leave request lines to 
chance. They reportedly hire phone solicitors to jam the lines. 
</P>
<P>
 LENNY WARONKER, 52, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Records.  
</P>
<P>
 Because he has been so closely identified with Mo Ostin, it's hard for many 
industry observers to imagine Waronker taking over the reins at Warner Bros. 
Records. But he's going to start Jan. 1 -- and he's a popular choice within the 
company because he's so artist-oriented.  
</P>
<P>
 THE WILD CARD 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows exactly which budding computer genius will revolutionize the 
record business by changing the way we think about hearing and seeing music. 
But the chances are the hotshot already has a subscription to Wired, the 
Rolling Stone of the emerging computer culture. Companies already are 
scrambling to set up on-line services to tap into the world of virtual reality 
-- and exploit it.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; MERCHANTS CONSIDER A SELF-IMPOSED TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deserted streets at night. Poor lighting at key intersections. Lack of evening 
police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants in Little Tokyo have complained to city officials about such 
conditions since the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 While the city is strapped for money to promote and provide additional 
services to the area of more than 300 businesses, some merchants are 
considering another funding source: themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force of the mayor's Little Tokyo Community Development Advisory 
Committee has distributed two surveys to 271 merchants asking whether they 
would be willing to tax themselves and how they would want to spend that money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not getting the necessary services here in Little Tokyo," said Mark 
Takeichi, assistant project manager for Little Tokyo Service Center's community 
development corporation. The center is spearheading the survey drive and 
educating the community about the tax proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to do that, we need something that the business owners want to buy 
into -- something that would create more services and programs in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 That could be a business improvement district, similar to the city's first on 
Broadway, between 2nd and 9th streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeichi said money for the district would come from an increase in 
business-license taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city clerk's office would collect that extra money and give it back to the 
district's merchants committee, which would use the funds to promote businesses 
through special events or to beautify the area with street maintenance and 
renovation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Little Tokyo were to become the city's second business improvement 
district, 51% of its merchants would have to agree to the change, Takeichi 
said. The City Council also has to approve the merchants' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeichi said 71 of the 271 merchants polled in the first survey listed 
security and marketing of Little Tokyo as their top concerns. Results of the 
second survey, which asked how much of an increase businesses would agree to, 
are not yet available, Takeichi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money could be the stumbling block to the business improvement district, some 
merchants said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people might think the concept is good," said Frances Hashimoto, 
owner of the Japanese pastry shop Mikawaya. "(But) the climate right now is not 
real good. . . . A lot of the businesses are trying to maintain whatever little 
they have." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kurai, spokesman for the Japanese Village Plaza, said it could be a year 
before merchants are willing to invest in the area. The plaza houses 45 shops 
and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to do more education," Kurai said. "(Merchants) need to see more 
general positive increase in business here . . . something that will give them 
a little ray of hope." TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; PATIENTS' ARTWORK BRINGS LIFE TO CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The posters of paintings, sculptures and photographs that adorn the walls of 
5P21 make up an aptly named exhibit called "Transitions." 
</P>
<P>
 When County-USC Medical Center's HIV outpatient services building is 
dismantled soon to make way for a new hospital, the original artworks by 
patients and others whose lives have been affected by AIDS will be displayed 
again when the new clinic opens next year at Mission Road and Zonal Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, 5P21 has become a virtual art gallery. As many as 250 
pieces, many of them from the clinic's patients, grace its corridors, offices, 
conference and waiting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is important for people who are (infected) with AIDS," said R. D. 
Riccoboni, 35, who has shown his paintings at the clinic. "When an artist 
creates, there is no disease." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, started by patient and volunteer Roger D. Arthur, who died Aug. 
2, brought life to the clinic's stark walls and discovered artists among some 
of the patients. Many of the children, some as young as 5, now consider 
themselves artists as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The art itself has been therapeutic for patients who have discovered an 
artistic vein. "I'm going on the eighth year with HIV without developing any 
symptoms" of AIDS, said Steve Monroe, 38. "And I can attribute that directly to 
the art." 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe was a patient of 5P21 when it was on the fifth floor of General 
Hospital and recording 2,500 patient-visits a month. But in July, 1991, the 
outpatient clinic was opened as the number of patients increased, now to the 
point that the number of patient-visits has doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only have the original works brightened the clinic, but they have also 
drawn people there who ordinarily would not have come in, according to members 
of the Roger D. Arthur 5P21 Art Coalition, coordinator of the exhibits. 
Visitors see the place as friendly, members said, and some have come in for HIV 
testing after viewing the art. 
</P>
<P>
 The fastest-growing group of people with AIDS are Latinos, who make up half of 
the clinic's patients, said Thomas P. Licari, 45, one of the clinic's volunteer 
workers. More troubling is that about 60% of the new patients are entering the 
clinic with full-blown AIDS.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be willing to look at . . . educating people in a way that's never 
been done before," said Bonnie Stover, the clinic's volunteer programs 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, coalition members, under a $50,000 grant from the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, will take their art to the schools and let students 
meet the artists and learn more about their works and the disease.  
</P>
<P>
 The art effort has become a model at Midway Hospital in the Fairfax area, and 
other clinics and hospitals, Riccoboni said. "We started our own arts movement, 
really," he said. "This is a great thing for Los Angeles and part of its 
healing. This is one of the small little threads that is pulling the community 
together." MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; MTA, ARTIST CLASH OVER STATION DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority invited the community last week to 
help select the artists who will work with architects in designing the seven 
stations of the Redline's Eastside extension. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the design process begins, a controversy is brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist George Yepes, who was hired by the MTA to complete a $20,000 
cultural-needs assessment of the area, said he enlisted the research of 25 
scholars from throughout the country to examine the history, culture and people 
of East Los Angeles. What resulted is a 400-page document that Yepes calls a 
"working draft that can be a model for all major cities." 
</P>
<P>
 The document examines educational programs, the economic effects of the 
construction project, area art and cultural programs, and the effects the 
massive project will have on the Eastside. The 6.8-mile subway extension will 
stretch from Union Station to Whittier and Atlantic boulevards at a cost of 
$979.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the first segment, which includes stations at Little Tokyo, 
1st Street and Boyle Avenue, Cesar E. Chavez Avenue and Soto Street, and 1st 
and Lorena streets, is scheduled for late 1996 or early 1997 and will be 
completed by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 Yepes envisions the local subway line as a "seven-mile-long art piece" that 
200 artists would create with the engineers, architects and construction 
companies. But his views are apparently not sitting well with MTA officials, 
who, he said, are proceeding as if his report did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Diego Cardoso, project manager for the Eastside subway extension, said the MTA 
asked Yepes to complete a cultural needs assessment so that the agency might 
avoid the criticism it has received over art projects at some stations. 
Residents have complained that the stations do not reflect their communities' 
character, he said, but rather the artists' whims. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso said the Resident Advisory Committee wanted the assessment to include 
the community's character with social and historical research. But Cardoso said 
the document Yepes compiled does not include the history of the area's many 
inhabitants over time, including Eastern Europeans, Japanese, Chinese and 
Jewish immigrants. And the Mexican community is portrayed only "superficially," 
Cardoso said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are building a project that will be with us for centuries and we want to 
make sure that that reflects the deep history of the area," he said. One of the 
controversial proposals Yepes made in his assessment is that there be a lead 
design team and that he be its director, a proposal Cardoso calls "impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has tried to portray that we are not interested in coming up with a 
visionary plan for the Eastside, but many people see through what he is trying 
to do," Cardoso said.  
</P>
<P>
 At a Monday meeting of the Review Advisory Committee at Stevenson Junior High 
School, Maya Emsden, director of the MTA ART Program, asked for recommendations 
for an art advisory group and artists selection panel. Emsden said the artists 
will likely be selected as early as December to work with architects from the 
beginning of the design stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA allocates 0.5% of the cost of construction for art. The budget for art 
at each station may range from $50,000 to $150,000, which is provided by the 
county's Proposition A half-cent sales tax, grants and donations.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; $300,000 GRANT OKD FOR STREET CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Community Redevelopment Agency has approved a $300,000 grant to fund a 
street cleanup program for another year in Boyle Heights and Lincoln Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which contracts with the local chambers of commerce to administer 
the effort, awaits City Council approval after a hearing before the Housing and 
Community Redevelopment Committee on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Merchants say the program has helped to boost business while creating a 
greater sense of pride in the community," said Ed Avila, an administrator with 
the redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency will use federal dollars secured through the city's Community 
Development Department to operate the program through June. The program, which 
was started four years ago, is designed to reduce blight along major commercial 
streets and attract shoppers, Avila said.  
</P>
<P>
 Local residents make up the four-person work crews who collect litter, paint 
out graffiti and remove grime and gum from sidewalks. The crews also teach 
cleanup and maintenance techniques to merchants and business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, 24 jobs have been created and an additional 12 jobs will be 
formed, pending council approval, said redevelopment agency spokesman Marc 
Littman. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past four years, the agency said, crews in Boyle Heights collected 
more than 500 tons of trash, steam-cleaned nearly 400,000 square feet of 
sidewalk and painted more than 650 buildings defaced with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup in Lincoln Heights -- where the program was started last year -- 
collected more than 250 tons of trash, steam-cleaned almost 120,000 square feet 
of sidewalk and obliterated graffiti on more than 300 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The designated areas in Boyle Heights include Cesar E. Chavez Avenue between 
the Golden State (5) Freeway and Fickett Street; 1st Street between Chicago and 
Saratoga streets and the area surrounding Cesar E. Chavez and Evergreen 
avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The program in Lincoln Heights targets a larger area that includes Broadway 
between Avenue 17 and Lincoln Park Avenue and commercial areas along Pasadena 
Avenue and Daly, Main and Barranca streets. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTHEAST AREA; MANY CITIES REJECT SPECIAL LIBRARY 
TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prospects appear dim for restored county library service in several Southeast 
cities, where city councils have shied away from a household assessment tax to 
help finance the troubled institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maywood and Cudahy councils have given their approval but Bell's opposed 
the plan. Huntington Park's council postponed its vote until Monday, and South 
Gate's postponed a decision until Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the County Board of Supervisors voted 3 to 1,to set up a Community 
Facilities District to fund extended services in the county's beleaguered 
libraries. Only property owners in unincorporated parts of the county and 
cities that agree to the assessment -- estimated at about $28.50 per year for a 
single-family home -- would be taxed, according to county officials. And only 
those areas that agree to the tax will receive funding for their libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Countywide, of the 52 cities served by the library system, only 13 cities have 
decided to join the district; 22 opted out. Seven more decided to take no 
action. Still wrestling with the idea were 10 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28 unincorporated communities that have county library branches will 
automatically become part of the district. Supervisors will hold a public 
hearing Tuesday on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 people attended a recent South Gate council meeting to discuss 
the tax. About 25 residents spoke on the issue, most of them in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the item unraveled, people found out it was not in the council's hands," 
said South Gate City Clerk Nina Banuelos, who is also president of the Friends 
of the South Gate Library. "I was shocked, because I supported this 
resolution," Banuelos said. "But it became clear that the county was giving us 
so little control over our own library. The supervisors would have to authorize 
the City Council to exit from such a tax." 
</P>
<P>
 Banuelos suggested that in place of the tax, Southeast cities could form a 
consortium to operate area libraries: "We need to find out if we can run our 
own libraries by drawing upon one another's resources." 
</P>
<P>
 At Huntington Park's council meeting, council members heard pleas from 
residents who want their library to stay open longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The library has always been my friend," said Alderina Meldran, a Huntington 
Park resident since 1947. "Elderly people like me use it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Park library is open 28 hours, four days per week, down from 
seven days in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Wong, assistant director of the county libraries, said the Huntington 
Park library's budget was $985,000 last year, down from $1.5 million the year 
before. Wong assured the council that if the city decides to participate in the 
tax district, the library's hours and services would not be further reduced.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; BOOK PUTS PREMIUM ON LOCAL BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A coupon book is circulating that aims to give consumers a break while 
bolstering an area that has been economically discounted for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton Jenkins, president of Founder's National Bank, recently began 
distributing a 67-page Community Buyer's Guide to selected bank customers to 
help tout local merchants and reinforce the notion that goods and services in 
Crenshaw and South-Central are worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "This helps everyone all the way around -- the business owners in our service 
area, the customers and Founder's Bank," Jenkins said. "We all need the 
advertisement. And merchants feel comfortable spending money on ads when they 
know they're going to big-dollar customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Printed on weighty paper stock and boasting a wide array of goods and services 
-- from restaurants to art photographers to weight control centers -- the book 
counters the tacky images of clip-out newspaper coupons and throwaway 
circulars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it this way for a reason," Jenkins said. "Obviously, we want people to 
use them. We didn't want them to end up in the trash bin." 
</P>
<P>
 The guide grew out of an effort among Jenkins and several other business 
people to aid black business owners in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins, West Covina Lincoln Mercury and Golden State Mutual Life insurance 
agreed to underwrite the $3,000 it took to make up and print 2,500 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertisers are offering 10% to 20% discounts and free gifts to first-time 
customers through Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bulk of advertisers are in the Crenshaw and Central Los Angeles 
area, many are in Culver City, Mid-City and beyond. The idea, said advertising 
executive Rick Perkins, is to encourage people to recycle black dollars in as 
many areas of the Southland as possible, places they may not ordinarily think 
have black-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a chance for black business owners to develop a base they don't 
normally have," said Perkins, whose Culver City-based agency Port & Associates 
Advertising did graphics work for the guide and sold most of the $50 to $150 ad 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole point is to make people aware of the great businesses right in 
their own neighborhoods, and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 Advertisers also get a free month of service from (800) Unite Us, an 
Inglewood-based phone referral bank for black-owned businesses. Jenkins said he 
and other sponsors were careful to not to duplicate businesses in the book so 
that advertisers wouldn't be competing with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Such advantages were enough to persuade restaurateur Ron Washington to 
advertise.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're new, so it's crucial that we do everything we can to get the word out," 
said Washington, whose Uncle Darrow's Creole-style restaurant on Venice 
Boulevard opened in February. ERIN J. AUBRY

 Free vaccinations for children ages 2 and under will be given from noon to 
6:30 p.m. Tuesday at First African Methodist Episcopal Church, 2270 S. Harvard 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong immunization program is part of the "Give Your Child a Shot at 
Life" campaign.The nationwide effort by the National Congress of Black 
Churches' Community Renewal Initiative aims to protect black children from 
illnesses once thought to be eradicated, including polio, tetanus, whooping 
cough and measles. 
</P>
<P>
 Such diseases have re-emerged in recent years and are disproportionately 
affecting black children, said Martin Luther King-Drew Medical Center President 
Reed V. Tuckson. In Los Angeles, immunization rates for children under 2 are 
44%, and 35% for black children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Congress of Black Churches, which represents 65,000 congregations 
and more than 19 million members, is setting up community vaccination programs 
with the aid of a grant from the Centers for Disease Control. The West Coast 
region received $24,000.

CITY TIMES COVER STORY; SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS; BOXING HAS ALWAYS PACKED A PUNCH 
IN EAST L.A., WHERE YOUNG STREET FIGHTERS DREAM OF FOLLOWING FORMER CHAMPIONS 
TO FAME AND FORTUNE. BUT WHATEVER THE ODDS OF MAKING IT TO THE TOP, THE SPORT 
SERVES A LARGER PURPOSE AS A REFUGE FOR YOUTH, WHO DISCOVER A SENSE OF 
DEDICATION AND PURPOSE IN THE RING.

 THE DREAM: 
</P>
<P>
 A Latino teen-ager wants to help support his impoverished family. He believes 
he can earn money quickly with his fists. 
</P>
<P>
 He walks into a gym in East Los Angeles to pursue fame and fortune that others 
from his neighborhood have found: Paul Gonzales, Genaro (Chicanito) Hernandez 
and Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been a successful street fighter. Now he learns to box. "You'll have to 
work very, very hard if you want to win," he is told, over and over. His 
confidence grows as he trains for his first fight. He thinks he is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality: 
</P>
<P>
 In his first bout, the teen-ager is getting badly beaten, but refuses to lie 
down. By the third round, his face turns cherry, his knees buckle and he drops 
his hands to his sides when the referee stops the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did they stop the fight?' " he asks his trainer, who wipes blood from the 
boy's face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because you were not punching back," says the trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't train hard enough. Come back and try again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dreams do come true -- at a cost -- in East Los Angeles, home to some of the 
best fighters in the world and where boxing has become a way of life for 
thousands, regardless of professional aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 East Los Angeles has earned a deserved reputation as a producer of top-flight 
boxing talent. Many of the nation's most talented amateurs come from there, 
which has also produced two Olympic gold medalists and a handful of world 
professional champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the days of lightweight contender Art Aragon in the 1940s and '50s, 
boxing has been a force in the Latino community of East Los Angeles, where 
longtime residents still speak of the rough-and-tumble tradition of street 
fights going back to the '20s and '30s. Beyond tradition, its appeal owes to a 
variety of reasons, including economics: gloves, protective gear and a place to 
train are minimal requirements for a sport and usually available on a loan 
basis. And with boxing's many divisions, an athlete of average or even less 
than average height and weight can become a champion, whereas other sports 
demand great size or bulk. At 5-foot-1 and 108 pounds, Humberto (Chiquita) 
Gonzalez is one such champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "For kids in East L.A., boxing is still the last frontier to get out of the 
barrio," said Andy Stanke, boxing trainer at Hollenbeck Youth Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping to perpetuate the dream are professionals such as Chicanito Hernandez, 
the World Boxing Assn. junior lightweight champion who trains at Brooklyn Gym 
in East Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Youths seeking inspiration from a local hero also get it from the walls 
themselves. At the Sheriff's Department East Los Angeles Community Center, the 
image of Gonzalez gazes steadily toward the ring from a portrait painted as 
part of a mural. Gonzalez, the International Boxing Federation and World Boxing 
Council light-flyweight champion, trains at the center before he fights at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the fame and fortune, boxing is a popular, entrenched form of 
recreation. Whatever the odds of making it as a champion, boxing has taken on a 
larger purpose. In East Los Angeles, boxing gyms are a refuge for troubled 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see the aggression in them, the way they hit the bags," said Ray Morales, 
33, a postal worker and a former Golden Gloves champion, as he pointed to a 
boxer hitting the heavy bag. "They have troubles at school or they don't have a 
father at home to be a role model." 
</P>
<P>
 From Hollenbeck Youth Center and Los Angeles Youth Athletic Club in Boyle 
Heights, Lincoln Heights Youth Club, Eddie Heredia Boxing Club and East Los 
Angeles Community Center in East Los Angeles, dedicated youths train up to five 
hours a day, five days a week even when temperatures soar above 90 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other gyms -- Cache Boxing in Vernon and Resurrection Boxing Club in East 
Los Angeles -- train a mixture of amateurs and professionals, while Brooklyn 
Gym, also in East Los Angeles, is strictly for professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 1,291 amateur boxers formally registered with the Southern 
California branch of USA Boxing, according to Melanie Ley, Junior Olympic 
chairwoman. Of those, 85% have Latino surnames, including about 15% who live in 
the East Los Angeles. Thousands more box or follow the sport avidly. And many 
in the community are pleased that they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way to keep them off the streets," said Morales, head boxing coach at 
the Sheriff's Department community center. "Most of my kids box for 
recreational purposes. Right now we're fortunate to have a De La Hoya because 
kids look at him as a role model. They want to be the next De La Hoya because 
they come from poverty-stricken areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Hernandez, who represents District 1, points out that Latinos 
have always been part of boxing history.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like baseball, where we've recently become part of the tradition, or 
football, where we struggle to get Hispanics recruited by even college teams," 
Hernandez said. "Latinos have been part of boxing history since the Golden Boy 
days of Art Aragon," a lightweight contender during the 1940s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 4, Hernandez watched his father, Paul, train boxers in a gym in 
Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always seen boxing as a very positive sport," Hernandez said. "It's a 
clean sport with rules. It's not street fighting. And there is a certain status 
that comes with being a boxer." 
</P>
<P>
 From a boxing promoter's standpoint, Latino fight fans are "the backbone of 
the boxing industry," according to Olympic Auditorium promoter Dan Goossen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been proven at the pay-per-view level that they are the biggest boxing 
fans," said Goossen, who is also a vice president of the Top Rank boxing 
promotion company. "They're loyal, devoted and knowledgeable about the sport. 
It's also a very heavily populated area to find fighters. We don't get too many 
fighters, if any, from the Westside." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Top Rank's biggest drawing cards is former East Los Angeles resident De 
La Hoya, a gold medal winner in the 1992 Olympics. De La Hoya, the World Boxing 
Organization lightweight champion, was the headliner during the reopening of 
the Olympic Auditorium in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to become an Olympic champion, if you want to become a 
professional champion, you've got to dedicate yourself and really train hard," 
De La Hoya said. "When I go to schools and talk to kids, I tell them you've got 
to work hard. Nobody can stop you but yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even the hardest-working boxers fail to achieve De La Hoya's Golden Boy 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Gonzales became a hero in the community and in the United States when he 
won the Olympic gold medal in 1984 -- the first Mexican American to win any 
Olympic medal. But though he achieved tremendous international fame as an 
amateur, his professional career was beset by false starts and injuries. He 
recently retired from boxing 10 years after winning his gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales estimates the odds to be "one in a thousand" that one of his boxers 
will become a world titleholder. But, he says, they will still come away with a 
valuable lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We teach them how to box, but we also stress education," he says. "If they 
don't have the grades, they don't box." 
</P>
<P>
 Boxers are required to present their report cards on a quarterly basis. If 
they fail to meet the grade, they cannot compete, according to Morales. Those 
that show improvement or have outstanding grades are awarded gym bags and 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few make it to the top without worrying about getting an education first," 
Stanke said. Boxing itself is an education in which athletes learn discipline 
and motivation that they apply to their classroom studies. 
</P>
<P>
 At Eddie Heredia Gym, director Chuck Rios shouts instructions to 12-year-old 
Mario Miranda of Montebello, who is sparring with Mike Anchondo of Norwalk. 
Anchondo, also 12, has fought 80 more fights than his opponent and his 
experience is evident in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you waiting for, Mario?" Rios said. "Throw more punches. You will 
connect. You're as strong as him." 
</P>
<P>
 Heredia Gym specializes in training junior boxers, ages 8 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to keep kids off drugs and away from the gangs," Rios said. "These 
kids are tougher than gang members because they know how to train. The hardest 
part of boxing is training and that's what drives away the gangbangers."  
</P>
<P>
 Miranda shows promise as a boxer, but it's in the classroom where he has 
started to excel. He said he had a straight-A report card during the past two 
quarters at Montebello Intermediate School. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grades were OK until I started boxing," Miranda said. Now "I don't go 
outside and play. I go to school and I train. That's all I have time for." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Latino youths, Miranda became indoctrinated into boxing through 
Spanish-language newspapers such as La Opinion, which covers boxing with the 
same fervor that the English-language press devotes to the Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 "I learned about boxing by reading the papers and watching old videos," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Morales of East Los Angeles, the father of 9-year-old boxer Ricardo, said 
he takes his two sons to the Forum twice a month to watch boxing. He also 
collects newspaper articles about boxing and shows them to his sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good to have my son out of the streets doing something fun," said 
Morales, who also has another son. "I like my children to be professionals, but 
that will be their decision when the time comes." 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Garcia Jr., 15, of East Los Angeles is the nation's top-ranked Junior 
Olympic amateur in the 90-pound weight class for 15- and 16-year-olds. He took 
the gold medal in the Elite Junior Olympic program box-offs Aug. 5 in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., and was scheduled to compete Friday and Saturday in the 
USA-Ireland Junior Olympic duals in Dublin, Ireland. Garcia's grandfather was 
an amateur fighter in Mexico and his father fought professionally in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was a professional boxer for four months," Garcia said. "And my 
mother likes the sport too. She pushes me because she knows I have a chance to 
be a champion." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Irma Garcia, Salvador's mother: "I like boxing because I feel something 
inside. When I see my son box, I get excited because it's in my blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador, a sophomore at Roosevelt High, said he struggled in school until he 
took up boxing 1 1/2 years ago. Now he has a 3.5 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I used to hang out in the streets with my friends," Garcia said. "Now 
it's boxing, homework and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ley, of the Junior Olympics program, said that parents for the most part 
support their children in boxing. "You will hardly ever find a mother who 
covers her eyes when Junior is boxing," Ley said. "There have been some mothers 
who object to boxing, but not recently and I can't think of anybody from East 
L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Death is a fact of life, though, in a violent sport, no matter how skilled the 
participants. Critics point to the recent ring death of Wangila Napunyi, who 
died after suffering major head injuries during a welterweight fight with David 
Gonzalez in Las Vegas.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert O. Voy, USA Boxing Sports Medicine Committee chairman, countered 
that youths have a greater chance of getting killed in a car accident than in a 
boxing ring. In his 1992 article " 'Boxing Bashers' on the Bandwagon . . . 
Again," Voy estimated the odds of a youth dying in a ring to be 1 in 100,000 
while his chances of getting killed by a car are 6 in 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, getting knocked down is a painful experience. During his workout at the 
community center, Garcia's neighbor, 10-year-old Bobby Dominguez, took a hard 
shot to the chin. Dominguez, who said he has been knocked down in three fights, 
said he gave up karate to become a boxer after watching Julio Cesar Chavez of 
Mexico fight Pernell Whitaker to draw in a World Boxing Council welterweight 
title fight last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be a world champion like Chavez," Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said East L.A. youth centers that provide boxing have already paid 
dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing teen-agers who were once gang members coming into the gyms to 
settle their differences," Hernandez said. Some former gang members have become 
Explorer Scouts with law enforcement agencies after boxing at East L.A. police 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're also seeing fighters like Paul Gonzales and Oscar De La Hoya becoming 
bigger role models because they once fought in these gyms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the Hollenbeck boxing program, Stanke helps his prized pupils get 
part-time jobs with local businesses while they train. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe it's important that kids touch hands with community leaders," 
Stanke said. "Some continue working with the same business years after they 
quit boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although boxing is a tool, we utilize this tool to turn kids into good 
citizens. Boxing is a hard game and only a select few make it to the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer David Avila contributed to this report. On the Cover

 Boxing instructor David Aguayo spars with Jamie Cuevas, 11, at the Sheriff's 
Department East Los Angeles Community Center. For more than 50 years, boxing 
has been a cultural phenomenon in East Los Angeles, producing top-ranked 
contenders and champions and teaching youths about discipline and commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "In East L.A., you learn to fight before you learn to cry," said Eddie (The 
Animal) Lopez, a former heavyweight contender.

<P>
 It began in 1986 as a sweeping effort by the National Council of Negro Women 
to strengthen what many black people saw as a vanishing institution: the 
family.  
</P>
<P>
 Now in its ninth year, the Black Family Reunion Celebration provides a day of 
family fun, food, arts and entertainment in Atlanta, Chicago, Cincinnati, 
Memphis, Tenn., Philadelphia, Washington and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The local event is the largest, regularly attracting hundreds of thousands. 
Featured events today include a Gospelfest concert, a children's pavilion and 
presentations by renowned motivational speaker Les Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's theme is "Another Family For Peace," a reminder of the troubling 
domestic and urban violence that has taken its toll on black families in recent 
years. Accordingly, the day's  
</P>
<P>
 workshops, performances, exhibits and forums will focus on violence-related 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Height, president of the National Council of Negro Women, says it's 
time African Americans address the problem of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to put forth the call that we must take personal responsibility for 
finding a solution to the unprecedented violence in our cities," she said. "We 
not only want to raise consciousness, we want to put people in touch with the 
tools and the resources to make a difference."

MTA ABOLISHING MONTHLY BUS FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will begin a new bus fare structure 
on Sept. 1 that will abolish the regular $42 monthly pass and raise fees from 
$1.10 to $1.35 for one-way fares. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly pass, according to MTA spokesman Greg Davy, was not offering 
passengers an equitable fare."The people who most needed it could not afford 
it," Davy said. The increase in the fare was made to help balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA hopes the elimination of the monthly pass will lead to increased use 
of bus tokens, which cost 90 cents for a one-way fare, a 33% markdown off the 
regular cash fare. The tokens are sold in bags of 10 for $9. The gold and 
silver colored coins will be sold at 460 locations throughout Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>

 The workshop is being offered for the first time because of a recent change in 
INS policy, which requires immigrants who received their California permanent 
resident cards before 1978 to apply for new ones by Sept. 30, Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardholders will then have to pay a $70 renewal fee every 10 years.

VOICES: THE HIPPIE THING; COMMUNES HAVE COME AND GONE SINCE THE '60S, BUT ELLIS 
ISLAND IS STILL HOME TO RUSH RIDDLE AND HIS EVER-CHANGING HOUSEMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSH RIDDLE, Rush Riddle has lived in a commune called Ellis Island since 
1968, when he entered USC. The group currently has 11 members in its old 
Victorian house near campus. A regular on the underground music scene, Riddle 
has a day job as an electric station operator for the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power. Recently he has concentrated on producing and running Pronto 
Records and We Bad Studios out of the Victorian's large converted attic. He was 
interviewed by Mike Wyma. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ellis Island started in 1967 over on 35th Street. They did a year there. It 
was a hippie thing that started through SDS, Students for a Democratic Society, 
which was a radical student group on the campus of USC.  
</P>
<P>
 There weren't a whole lot of radicals at USC, so at a meeting they said, "Gee, 
we should live together. That's the thing now, communes. We'll have moral 
support because we're vastly outnumbered by the rest of the student 
population." One guy was living in a house that had some vacant rooms, so 
people started moving in. Eventually, they took that house over and expanded 
into the house next door. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year I arrived, in September of '68. The redevelopment agency said 
they'd help us find a house and in May of '69 we got this one. We paid $700 
down and signed a lease with an option to buy. We ended up buying it in '76 for 
the '69 price of $28,000. There are four of us on the title but it's owned by 
the group. Everyone pays $150 a month, no matter what room you have.  
</P>
<P>
 It's kind of turned into an old folks home. The last five years it's settled 
down a lot. Most of the people are about my age, which is 44, although one of 
us is pushing 70. When we moved in here we had two people over the age of 21. I 
mean we were kids. It was a mess. We had cars parked in the front yard. We had 
four dogs for several years. There was a Frisbee game in the front yard every 
evening. If there was an event or a party going on, we'd show up en masse. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd say we'd kick out one person a month. The policy was pay the rent, keep it 
clean and make a contribution. In the old days, say the first three years, if 
you did one of those, that was enough. You could get by. Since then it's been 
two of the three, but I'm pushing for three out of the three. 
</P>
<P>
 We've had some people who really weren't doing that much. They're just marking 
time. I like it when we have more dynamic people who are pursuing their muses. 
One of our guys' band is signed to a major label. That's the sort of thing I 
like. 
</P>
<P>
 I've always been in on the music scene. My first night in L.A. in 1968, I was 
on the Sunset Strip. My parents were musicians, and I've played just about 
every instrument. I've been in a bunch of really obscure bands, but I was in a 
band called Green Jello that's fairly notorious. They had a big breakup, then 
signed to a major label. They've had some success as Green Jelly. I believe in 
doing the art and having total control over it. I don't want to do it just so 
it sells. That means keeping your day job. You can look back at your art later 
and still be proud of it, even if it makes your life harder. For me the dilemma 
is that I have so many ideas I can't realize them all. 
</P>
<P>
 If I had good cash flow, I'd like to produce a film. I also have amassed a 
large collection of material and I'd like to do a 25th anniversary yearbook of 
this house. Writings, videotapes, audiotapes, recordings of people's music. 
Lots of the people who have lived here, I've asked them: Tell me the story 
about your years in Ellis Island. I've got a file about three inches thick. 
Combine that with 10 scrapbooks of photos, and that's just the ones that are 
organized. Then other people have video and film clips and novels. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime in the early to mid '70s I quit going to large venues. The Santa 
Monica Civic was the largest I'd go to. I didn't like the idea that rock stars 
were deities. They arrived in a limo and stayed backstage until it was time to 
come out and wiggle, then they left by a back door. They weren't real. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in on the punk rock scene from day one. Granted, a lot of the bands were 
terrible. But they talked to the people before a show. They were real. I'd sit 
through four acts to hear that one that was scintillating. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was in architecture school, I took art history and learned about the 
Dada movement. Marcel Duchamp and those people. They knew each other, they went 
places together, they were creative together. 
</P>
<P>
 So my dream isn't to be a movie star or be on the Letterman show. It's to bump 
shoulders with creative people. That's what I do when I produce records. And I 
find myself in the midst of a wildly vital scene. There's so much going on 
right now in the L.A. music scene, it's incredible.

VOICES: THE BIG PICTURE: A REAL STRIKEOUT; DODGER STADIUM'S DIAMOND VISION 
OPERATOR IS ONE OF MANY FEELING THE PINCH OF BASEBALL WALKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GUTIERREZ, Chris Gutierrez, 34, has been a member of the Diamond 
Vision crew at Dodger Stadium since 1981 and has served as the associate 
producer of the 875-square-foot video display system for the past five years. 
Gutierrez, who has worked more than 1,000 consecutive Dodger home games, is 
responsible for researching and assisting with editing of entertainment 
segments about the Dodgers and other major league baseball teams shown on the 
video board. He was interviewed by Kirby Lee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wasn't surprised by the major league baseball strike, but I am bitter about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 I have many responsibilities in my job with Diamond Vision, but the most 
enjoyable aspect to me are the games themselves. It's kind of a bummer to have 
the most enjoyable part taken away from you. It's very strange to be in the 
middle of August and not have any baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, I am still a full-time Dodger employee, but a good percentage of my 
salary comes from working games and game preparation. So as is the case with 
many front office employees at this time, we're deprived of that additional 
income we have come to rely upon. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to make it clear that I am not the only one affected. There are many 
who are definitely a lot worse off than me.  
</P>
<P>
 I am sympathetic to those like ushers, vendors and security guards who rely on 
supplemental income from baseball to support their family. Another group who is 
affected are the people who work free-lance for TV crews. They make a good 
living working games and when it's taken away, they are hit very hard. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is there are thousands of people directly affected 
financially. Unfortunately, we don't have strike insurance, so the money we 
lose doesn't come back. 
</P>
<P>
 I was riding on the elevator recently with some of the guys on the stadium 
cleanup crew who asked if I've heard any news about the strike. And they 
weren't asking in the interest of baseball; they wanted to know because their 
jobs are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 I've never been really good about saving money, but it's times like this when 
you have to be more aware because of what's been going on with layoffs and 
forced vacations in other organizations. You just can't be sure of what's going 
to happen if the strike continues for much longer. From a business standpoint, 
I can understand why some of these measures are taken. 
</P>
<P>
 With the lack of progress in negotiations thus far, I can't feel real 
optimistic about a resolution in the near future. There doesn't seem to be a 
sense of urgency to come up with a solution. Somehow, some way there has to be 
a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 My feeling about baseball strikes has changed over the years. In 1972, they 
had a strike for a couple of weeks. I was just a kid who loved baseball. And at 
that time, I was sad because I wouldn't be able to watch it. I was young and I 
really didn't understand the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 When the big strike came in 1981, it was my first year with Diamond Vision 
working as a game employee. I lost about 25 games' worth of supplemental income 
from the canceled games, but fortunately the Dodgers did well and ended up 
winning the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this strike I have a feeling of bitterness, because I am being affected 
financially but also because of the state of the game. A lot of fun is taken 
out of the game when these constant money issues keep arising. This has been a 
great season for baseball but again the business side has taken over and put a 
damper on it. 
</P>
<P>
 I find it hard to take sides because this is a dispute between millionaires 
and I can't relate to that type of money. I see right and wrong on both sides. 
The players are making an incredible amount of money. But on the other hand, 
the owners continue to pay those salaries because such high demands are placed 
on winning. The market value of players is way out of whack and there are many 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Superstars in any business are going to make the big bucks. It's when 
mediocrity is rewarded when troubles begin. Arbitration has been a big cause of 
that and a snowball effect started many years ago. Now, it's gotten out of 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people have said the players' union is just like any other union in 
America and its members have a right to strike. That's true, but in how many 
unions do members make an average salary of $1.2 million a year? And in other 
unions when disputes are settled it is usually a permanent thing and they don't 
haggle over it every few years. That's the problem with baseball: We have to 
get a long-term solution so we can get on with the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealing with the strike is difficult for me because I enjoy baseball and it's 
hard for me to separate my opinions as an employee and a fan. 
</P>
<P>
 If I didn't count on baseball financially and was just a fan, I would say "Let 
them strike and don't come back this season." It gets so tiring to hear about 
all this stuff. I would turn my attention elsewhere, which many fans have done 
already.

FILM CLIPS / 'SIEGE' SEQUEL: CLASH OF THE TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 'Under Siege II" couldn't be more aptly named. In recent weeks the film, a 
sequel to Steven Seagal's 1992 blockbuster, has been besieged by rumors of 
turmoil in the production ranks. And its budget has purportedly edged past its 
$47.5-million limit. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Warner Bros.' brass has finally had to step in directly to try to 
impose some order, by bringing in a new line producer, Steve Perry ("Die Hard 
II"), just three weeks before shooting was scheduled to begin on Sept. 7, a 
date that is a full month later than the original start date. And more exits of 
critical crew members may be likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sources on the project say they welcome Warners' stronger presence, since 
there has been so much friction among Seagal and his co-producers. Jon Peters, 
one of the film's producers, bailed from the project in late July, while Seagal 
and New Regency's Arnon Milchan, who produced the original, remain.  
</P>
<P>
 Since Peters' departure, line producer Chris Kinney ("The Last Emperor," 
"Batman"), who was brought aboard by Warners and Peters, was booted in favor of 
Perry after clashing with Seagal. Several of Kinney's key people, including 
Brian Frankish, the production manager, are reportedly nearing an announcement 
that they are the next to leave. (A line producer oversees the physical and 
fiscal components of the film's process on a day-to-day basis; a film's 
producer develops and produces the script, deals with the studio, looking at 
the overall picture, including the stars and director.)  
</P>
<P>
 Perry, considered to have a much harder edge than Kinney by the crew but 
equally capable, "can handle tough personalities like Seagal's," said one 
project source. "He has worked on films with ("Die Hard" producer) Joel Silver, 
who is one of the biggest screamers and toughest personalities in the business. 
You think it's an accident that Seagal named his company Steamroller 
Productions? The more successful he gets, the more pronounced his bad 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, as another source on the project put it, "has a reputation for kicking 
butt and being a hard-ass on keeping costs in line. He was brought aboard 
purely to control the budget." The studio also apparently felt he could handle 
Seagal a little better.  
</P>
<P>
 Peters, Kinney, Perry and Seagal did not return phone calls requesting 
comment. Warner Bros. declined to comment, except to confirm Perry's 
involvement and the new September start date. 
</P>
<P>
 The original movie, directed by Andrew Davis, involved thugs, including Tommy 
Lee Jones and Gary Busey, plotting to steal nuclear arms from a battleship. The 
sequel, directed by Geoff Murphy ("Young Guns 2"), is set aboard a train being 
ridden by Seagal and Katherine Heigl (who plays his niece), en route to a 
military convention and then a vacation in the Rocky Mountains, when Busey 
returns to try to hijack the train. Filming is to take place in Burbank and in 
the Rockies, a Warners source said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You never want to have to replace your line producer three weeks before a 
picture starts shooting," said one highly placed source on the project. "This 
picture will definitely happen but it has been a pain for Warners, which, by 
the way, has been very good to Seagal." The original "Under Siege" grossed $83 
million domestically. Seagal's last Warners feature, April's "On Deadly 
Ground," grossed only $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with Seagal's deal say that Warners paid him about $10 
million in salary and producer's fees for this project. And the picture's 
budget, originally pitched at $47.5 million, has reportedly climbed to $50 
million before the cameras have even begun to roll, sources say. That was 
supposed to happen Aug. 10, but because of the changes and turmoil, the start 
date was bumped to Sept. 7.

THEY LIKE IKE; SPEED AND TENACITY HELP JEFFERSON HIGH RUNNING BACK STRETCH HIS 
LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a nickname like Ike, Jefferson High running back Isaac Hatley seems 
destined to be in the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
 And with his speed, quickness and durability, Hatley is expected to remain in 
the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ike is a very tough, slashing-type runner with extreme quickness," said Ken 
Johnson, former assistant coach at Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pound-for-pound, he is one of the toughest kids I have been associated with 
at Jefferson." 
</P>
<P>
 When you are 5-foot-8, 160 pounds, tenacity is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "People try to take advantage of you when you are little, so you have to be 
tough," Hatley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But good things come in small packages." 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson Coach Hank Johnson must have thought it was Christmas two years ago 
when Hatley tried out for the varsity team as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatley made a name for himself in just his second game, rushing 31 times for 
114 yards and three touchdowns in a 33-14 win over Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Jefferson manhandled Jordan, 44-6, and Hatley rushed for 141 
yards and three touchdowns in only 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatley finished the '92 season with 895 yards and 12 touchdowns in 134 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 This Ike, unlike former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, needed no politicking 
to support his agenda. Everyone was already on his bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had something special in Ike, and everyone followed his lead," 
Hank Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He impressed everyone from the beginning and continues to do so until this 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Given his success as a small back, Ike may be swaying public opinion about 
bigger backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no problems with being a shorter back because I'm quicker, and 
linebackers don't have a big target to hit," Hatley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Hatley's rushing statistics as a junior declined from his 
sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
 He had fewer carries (116), fewer rushing yards (744) and fewer rushing 
touchdowns (four). 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ike's low numbers were more a result of his teammates' development 
than him having a bad year. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Anthony Martin had among the best seasons of area passers. Martin 
completed 64 of 153 pass attempts for 1,096 yards and 15 touchdowns and rushed 
for 491 yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last season, we had good play from the skill positions and we were better 
overall than 1992," Hank Johnson said. "Ike doesn't have to have big numbers to 
make an impact. His attitude and spirit on the field make his teammates play 
harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatley agrees that his role involves more than just running with the football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am one of the team leaders, so my teammates look to me for support and 
encouragement," Hatley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect Hatley's numbers to take another dip this season. With sophomore 
Ray Brown starting at quarterback, Hatley will have to shoulder a much heavier 
offensive load. 
</P>
<P>
 The task of shutting down Hatley will keep many of the area's defensive 
coordinators awake Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatley relishes that fact: "It makes me feel good to know other people will be 
working to stop me. It motivates me to work harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson plans to put a wrinkle -- a rather large one -- into its offense 
this season by also using 6-foot-3, 245-pound defensive tackle Eboni Wilson at 
fullback. 
</P>
<P>
 A scary prospect considering Wilson's size and Hatley's speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eboni will be a great blocker for Ike," Ken Johnson said. "All Ike needs is a 
hole, and Wilson should be able to make a few in the defense." 
</P>
<P>
 This may well be the season that Hatley breaks the 1,000-yard plateau and runs 
away with countless football honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ike and the Democrats are primed for a successful 1994 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team looks really good and I feel good," Ike said, "I'm expecting big 
things this season." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at some of the area's other top backs -- offensive and 
defensive: 
</P>
<P>
 Sirr Parker, Locke -- The Central City's Ultimate Weapon, Parker is Locke's 
fastest player and one of the area's quickest too. The 6-0, 185-pound tailback 
rushed for 1,088 yards and scored 11 touchdowns in 126 carries to make the City 
Times second team last year. He also caught 22 passes for 453 yards and two 
touchdowns. Parker was fifth in area scoring with 88 points, sixth in rushing 
and eighth in receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Omar Garnett and Travis Jackson, Cathedral -- The second-best backfield last 
season next to Dorsey's Che Johnson and Chris Phillips. The rushing tandem 
combined for 1,925 yards and 21 touchdowns. Garnett carried the ball 127 times 
for 964 yards and 11 touchdowns. Jackson had 127 carries for 961 yards and 10 
touchdowns. Garnett was 10th among local scorers with 66 points; Jackson was 
11th with 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrel Payton, Crenshaw -- Payton is a bruising, power runner with breakaway 
speed. The 6-2, 200-pound Payton rushed 86 times for 577 yards and seven 
touchdowns. Look for those numbers to increase this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Beckum, Manual Arts -- Beckum took a back seat to Dartanyum Smith last 
season, but this year he will be the No. 1 ballcarrier. At 5-6, 190 pounds, 
Beckum is strong and compact, which makes him difficult to bring down. Beckum 
rushed for only 364 yards and four touchdowns, but he had an impressive 5.2 
yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalonte Walker, Fremont -- Walker is a talented runner who keeps his feet 
moving even after the whistle has been blown. Walker's numbers were low -- 38 
carries, 232 yards, one touchdown -- but he will be featured more in Fremont's 
offense this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Antwain Wilson, Dorsey -- Wilson, who will play primarily running back this 
season, is best known for taking the place of injured Roderick Brown late last 
season and quarterbacking Dorsey to the City 4-A championship. Wilson rushed 35 
times for 214 yards and three touchdowns at wingback before moving to 
quarterback for the playoffs. Wilson, at 5-9 and 170 pounds, is Dorsey's 
fastest player. Defensive Backs 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Duff, Loyola -- The All-Del Rey League first-team selection is the Cubs' 
fastest player and hardest worker. The 6-0, 175-pound Duff is a superb athlete 
and guards the opposition's top wide-out. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamell Gordon, Dorsey -- Gordon split time at strong safety and running back 
last season but will see more time in the secondary in 1994. Good instincts, 
speed and the ability to hit hard make him Dorsey's top defensive back. Gordon, 
who had two interceptions in 1993, is 5-11, 180 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Lattimore, Locke -- To take advantage of Lattimore's 4.4 speed in the 
40-yard dash, Coach E.C. Robinson will play him at receiver in addition to free 
safety. Lattimore is good in man-to-man coverage and makes good reads. The 6-1, 
175-pound Lattimore did not play much last season but will be a key defensive 
player for the Saints in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevie Williams, Jefferson -- Williams has all the defensive tools to play 
cornerback except size, at 5-8, 150 pounds. However, he is explosive and 
attacks the ball once it is in the air. Williams is not very physical, which he 
will need to become in order to cover bigger receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Zamorano, Garfield -- Zamorano made All-Eastern League as a sophomore 
linebacker last season. Zamorano has a good combination of speed, strength and 
size at 5-11, 200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Cesta, Loyola -- An All-Del Rey League tight end who will make the move to 
inside linebacker. Cesta is 6-1, 235 pounds with good speed and hands. Coach 
Dave Newell expects Cesta to solidify the defense.

FILM CLIPS / GRISHAM'S LAW: FIRST, LET'S TOP-BILL ALL THE LAWYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Granted, critics seem to agree that "The Client" is the best of the 
adaptations of John Grisham novels to reach the screen (the jury awaits the 
forthcoming "A Time to Kill," whose rights sold for $6 million). But how much 
of that has to do with the filmmakers -- and how much has to do with the fact 
that all three entries in the Grisham oeuvre are essentially the same story? 
There's an old saying that there are really only eight plots in the world. 
Well, Grisham seemingly has found the one he likes best. Here, as uncovered by 
the Film Clips staff, are the key elements to making a Grisham book and film 
fly: The Hero 
</P>
<P>
 The Firm: Mitch (played by Tom Cruise), a bright young man from a poor family, 
who is embarking on a law career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pelican Brief: Darby (Julia Roberts), a bright young woman from a poor 
family, who is a law student. 
</P>
<P>
 The Client: Mark (Brad Renfro), a bright young man from a poor family, who 
hires a lawyer. Hero's Problem 
</P>
<P>
 The Firm: He knows something he shouldn't -- that the Mafia runs his law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pelican Brief: She knows something she shouldn't -- that a powerful oil 
billionaire paid for the killings of two Supreme Court justices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Client: He knows something he shouldn't -- where a Mafia thug buried a 
U.S. senator he murdered. The Villain 
</P>
<P>
 The Firm: Corrupt lawyers and vicious hit men. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pelican Brief: An oil tycoon, corrupt lawyers and vicious international 
hit men. 
</P>
<P>
 The Client: Vicious hit men. The Government 
</P>
<P>
 The Firm: The FBI wants Mitch to put himself at risk by gathering evidence 
against his company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pelican Brief: The FBI wants Darby to put herself at risk by turning 
herself in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Client: The U.S. Attorney wants Mark to put himself at risk by testifying 
against the mob killer. The Hero Doesn't Because . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Firm: He doesn't believe the FBI will keep its word. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pelican Brief: She's afraid the FBI is under the influence of the 
President's corrupt advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Client: He doesn't believe the FBI can protect him from the mob. The 
Unlikely Allies 
</P>
<P>
 The Firm: A private eye, the detective's feisty assistant and Mitch's convict 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pelican Brief: A Washington Post investigative reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Client: A novice lawyer who is a recovering alcoholic. The Hero's Arc 
</P>
<P>
 The Firm: From legal eager beaver to cynical attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pelican Brief: From scholarly go-getter to non-practicing recluse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Client: From carefree youngster to government-protected stool pigeon. In 
the End . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Firm: Mitch outsmarts both the Mafia and the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pelican Brief: Darby outsmarts both the billionaire and all the 
President's men. 
</P>
<P>
 The Client: Mark outsmarts both the Mafia and the U.S. Attorney. But Our Hero 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Firm: is forced to give up his job and start over. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pelican Brief: is forced to abandon her law studies and go into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Client: is forced to enter the Witness Protection Program and change 
identities.*

WITH TALENT LIKE THIS, PUT HIS NAME IN LIGHTS; BARRAGAN SHINES ON OFFENSE, 
DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Linemen rarely make headlines. But when they do, they like sportswriters to 
get their names right. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, linemen Steve Barragan of Fremont High was selected to the City 
Section 3-A Division first team by the Amateur Athletic Foundation and local 
sportswriters. Unfortunately, the selection committee got his first name wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please don't call me Mike," Barragan said. "I got a lot of abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 After the mistake appeared in print, Barragan was teased by his high school 
teachers and classmates. "I was teased as soon as I walked into class," he 
said. "They would say, 'Hey, Mike, you're late for class.' " 
</P>
<P>
 No one, however, questioned his name or talents on the football field. 
Barragan was the team's leading blocker and co-most valuable player on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the most tenacious player I've ever coached," Fremont Coach Taja Rodisha 
said. "The cat is awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodisha is not alone in his evaluation of Barragan. Stacked on his desk are 
letters and phone messages from college recruiters around the country. Among 
the schools recruiting Barragan are UCLA, USC, Arizona, Colorado, and Southern 
Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't care if his name is Steve or Mike," one recruiter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the 6-2, 257-pound Barragan played strongside tackle and 
defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 His main duty on offense was protecting the backside of quarterback William 
Yates, who often scrambled out of the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barragan: "Blocking for Will was kind of exciting because we never knew 
where he was going to be. Our job was to give him enough time to scramble."  
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the offensive line succeeded. Yates threw for more than 
1,500 yards and 17 touchdowns and the Pathfinders posted a school-record 11 
wins. Their breakdown came in the City 3-A title game when San Pedro humbled 
Fremont, 31-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Pedro was bad ," Barragan said. "First of all, they were big and they 
used good technique. I was so disappointed we lost that game." 
</P>
<P>
 While his season didn't end to his liking, Barragan did have his share of 
highlights. His brightest moment came in a nonleague game against Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Pathfinders trailing 10-0 in the third quarter, Barragan broke past 
the blocker shortly after the snap. Instead of trying to sack the quarterback, 
Barragan read the play as a sweep and followed the tailback after he took the 
handoff. Barragan wrestled the ball away from the tailback, broke three tackles 
and ran 72 yards for a touchdown. Fremont won 21-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Barragan's name was prominently reported in the game story. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lineman's dream to score a touchdown," said Barragan, who also scored 
a touchdown on an interception as a sophomore. "Usually, the defensive backs 
and linebackers score all the touchdowns on defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Barragan, however, will get more opportunities to handle the ball in 1994. The 
Pathfinders are moving their colossal tackle to tight end. When Barragan 
received his playbook, he was counting the number of plays where he could get 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our coaches want to get him the ball more often," Rodisha said. "He's a 
tremendous athlete. He's a monster with quick feet. He can play wherever he 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barragan: "In passing leagues, the coaches saw I had good hands and 
decided to give me a chance. I'm working on my touchdown dance." 
</P>
<P>
 When he is not catching passes and dancing, Barragan will be blocking for 
untested quarterback Robert Loera, who is a traditional dropback passer. "It's 
going to be a slower offense with Robert in," he said. "We're just going to 
drop back and block." 
</P>
<P>
 It might be mundane compared to blocking for Yates, but Barragan will do 
anything to help his team win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last season, we had two players carrying the team, Yates and Andre Johnson 
offensively, and we had a great defense," Barragan said. "This season we have 
six or seven Andres who can catch the ball, and Robert can throw." 
</P>
<P>
 And don't forget Barragan. That's Steve, not Mike.

ROLE SUITS MCDONALD TO A TEE; LOYOLA KICKER MAKES HIS POINTS QUICKLY, HEADS FOR 
SIDELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Don't get him wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark McDonald likes to watch football as much as anyone. The Loyola High 
senior, though, isn't too wild about playing it. Perhaps that's what makes the 
role of kicker so appealing to McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too much repetitiveness and just the idea of playing a sport that's 
so stop-and-go doesn't compare to what I experienced in soccer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's McDonald's skills as a kicker -- not as a soccer player -- that have 
interested recruiters from nearly 40 universities, including Arizona, Notre 
Dame and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2, 185-pound McDonald connected on 14 of 19 field goals as a 
junior, including a personal best of 53 yards. Nearly 90% of his kickoffs 
reached the end zone and one sailed through the goal posts. None of his 
kickoffs has ever been returned for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 An All-Del Rey League first-team selection, McDonald, 17, became Loyola's 
first kicker to earn All-CIF honors with his selection to the Southern Section 
Division I team. 
</P>
<P>
 "At his height, he could be a threat at wide receiver, but all he wants to do 
is place-kick," said Loyola Coach Steve Grady. "It's nice to know if it's third 
and five from the 30 and you don't make a first down, you still have a guy to 
give you a chance to make three points." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's those times when the game is on the line that McDonald relishes the 
most. 
</P>
<P>
 "A game shouldn't come down to one kick, but it really doesn't bother me," 
McDonald said. "I love the pressure and having one chance to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the chance to make friends, not field goals, that prompted McDonald to 
try football as a ninth-grader in 1991. He played wide receiver and kicked for 
the freshman team but didn't plan on staying with the sport as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a common thing for a lot of freshmen to go out for football to find 
friends and meet people," McDonald said. "Getting hit wasn't that bad. I just 
really didn't like football." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, McDonald tried water polo. He worked out with the team for about a 
week during the spring but made a hasty retreat to football once summer water 
polo workouts began. 
</P>
<P>
 "Water polo was real interesting, but I found out they practiced at 6 in the 
morning," McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only kicker on the sophomore team, McDonald worked out with the varsity 
kickers during the summer. Coaches elevated him to varsity for his sophomore 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing being pulled up, I really didn't know what to expect," 
McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald lived up to his billing with 49 extra points and six field goals to 
help Loyola reach the 1992 Southern Section Division I final against Bishop 
Amat, where he kicked a 42-yard field goal for the Cubs' only points. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald also played soccer as a sophomore, but plans to concentrate on 
kicking as a senior. This summer, he attended the Ray Pelfrey kicking camp in 
Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned a lot there," he said. "There is so much technique and scientific 
information about kicking I didn't realize. I was usually going up and blindly 
kicking the ball. My goal is to get 95% of my kickoffs into the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald estimates he will be spending 95% of his time on the sideline, 
waiting to showcase his newly refined technique this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time you spend on the field doesn't equate to the long time you've spent 
preparing, but I really don't mind," McDonald said. "If I weren't on the team, 
I'd be going to the games anyway. At least this way I'm getting a real good 
view from the sideline."

 Quinton Worthams, formerly of the Crenshaw YMCA, will travel to Argentina to 
perform basketball clinics for youth coaches from Buenos Aires and Concordia, 
Sept. 2-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthams was a youth coach for nine years at the Crenshaw YMCA and an active 
board member for three. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthams caught the attention of Argentine organizers after he conducted a 
clinic for youth coaches from Mexico in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican youth organization later competed in an international tournament 
sponsored by the Argentine Basketball Youth Club in December. Its four teams 
took first place in their respective age groups (6-8, 9-11, 13-15 and 16 and 
up). 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Catanaro, president of the Argentine Basketball Youth Club, contacted 
Ricardo Marentez, Worthams' translator. 
</P>
<P>
 Catanaro was interested in Worthams performing a youth clinic in Concordia for 
the Argentine Basketball Youth Club coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am looking forward to the experience because it gives me a chance to expand 
on what I have been doing in youth basketball and at the Amateur Athletic 
Foundation," Worthams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip is sponsored by the Argentine Basketball Youth Club.

THE FILMS OF WILLIAM HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carroll Lachnit 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it's the steely gaze, but William Hurt seems to have played more than 
his share of docs, profs and other cerebral types. But he has also played an 
ebullient dreamer whose imagination can't be imprisoned and a shallow but 
telegenic climber who instinctively manipulates his medium. His films, all of 
which are available on video:  
</P>
<P>
 Altered States (1980). Hurt made his debut in this film, adapted -- and then 
disowned -- by Paddy Chayefsky, from his novel about a brilliant scientist who 
experiments on himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyewitness (1981). Hurt is a janitor infatuated with a beautiful TV reporter.  
</P>
<P>
 Body Heat (1981). Hurt plays a lust-addled Florida lawyer of dubious ethics 
whose affair with a voluptuous woman (Kathleen Turner) puts him in the middle 
of a murder. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Chill (1983). Hurt is one of the old college friends who reunite at a 
funeral; also stars Tom Berenger, Glenn Close and Kevin Kline. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorky Park (1983). Hurt plays Arkady Renko, a stand-up cop in pre- glasnost 
Moscow, on the trail of a killer who has left his victim in the park of the 
film's title. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985). This adaptation of Manuel Puig's novel, now a 
musical on Broadway, starred Hurt as Molina, a gay window dresser who shares a 
cell with a tortured political prisoner, played by Raul Julia. Hurt won the 
Oscar for best actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Children of a Lesser God (1986). Hurt and Marlee Matlin, who won best actress 
Oscar, are appealing as a couple whose love is tested by their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcast News (1987). Hurt is the pretty but shallow anchorman who tantalizes 
the smart, principled producer played by Holly Hunter. Written and directed by 
James L. Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 A Time of Destiny (1988). Hurt and Timothy Hutton are World War II GIs whose 
friendship is tried by tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Accidental Tourist (1988). A faithful adaptation of Anne Tyler's novel 
about a travel writer for the journey-phobic whose life and marriage are 
destroyed by the death of his son. With Geena Davis and Kathleen Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 I Love You to Death (1990). Hurt and a pre-hunk Keanu Reeves are Harlan and 
Marlon, two dim-witted cousins who agree to be hit men. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice (1990). Hurt is the title character's uncaring husband in this Woody 
Allen comedy tinged with the supernatural.  
</P>
<P>
 The Doctor (1991). Hurt plays an arrogant surgeon who gets a taste of his own 
impersonal medicine when he is diagnosed with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the End of the World (1991). It's 1999. The world is on the brink of 
nuclear confrontation; Hurt is a mystery man who travels the globe with a 
special camera that uses the operator's emotional response to capture images.  
</P>
<P>
 The Plague (1992). Based on Albert Camus' story of a town beset by bubonic 
plague, but updated and moved from Algeria to South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Wonderful (1993). In a cameo, Hurt is a married professor having an affair 
with his divorced student, played by Annabella Sciorra. Carroll Lachnit

THEATER; JUNE KYOKO LU'S WAIT IS OVER; FOR THIS VETERAN ASIAN AMERICAN ACTRESS, 
HER ROLE AS FORGIVENESS FROM HEAVEN IN 'THE WAITING ROOM' AT THE MARK TAPER 
FORUM IS A HEAVENLY BLESSING INDEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Breslauer, Jan Breslauer is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lone fuchsia bougainvillea stem rises out of a tall vase at the center of a 
table covered with an off-white cloth, in a quietly elegant dining alcove. The 
dark wood-paneled walls are filled with tasteful prints and paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater posters for "The Phantom of the Opera" and "King Lear" hang alongside 
Asian masks in the adjacent living room where June Kyoko Lu sits, surrounded by 
more artwork, much of it of her own making. It is a setting as rich with 
cultural resonance and full of warm welcome as the actress herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu, who's currently appearing in the Mark Taper Forum production of Lisa 
Loomer's "The Waiting Room," has long been familiar to Los Angeles audiences 
from her work at the late Los Angeles Theatre Center and on smaller local 
stages, including, most notably, East West Players. 
</P>
<P>
 But this role is a breakthrough. Lu plays Forgiveness From Heaven, a wealthy 
18th-Century Chinese woman with bound feet. And though the actress is 
Korean-born, the role is strangely -- and perhaps sadly -- familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inner life of Forgiveness I know well from watching my mother," says Lu. 
"She was a college graduate, but she had no life. She lived through my dad, who 
was the worst womanizer. I forgave him. I had to, for my own happiness. But I 
don't forget what kind of life she led. I said to myself never in my life, 
never would I be like her, even though I adored her." 
</P>
<P>
 The actress does indeed make Forgiveness From Heaven ring eerily true. 
"Everything she does has the weight of experience behind it and yet she is 
beautifully open and has this innocence as an actress that is so beguiling," 
says director David Schweizer. "She is also fiercely committed. She'll work and 
work, but she does it all in this spirit of complete openness and 
truth-telling." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good example of how an actor can use her own background to bring a 
character to life. "It surprised me how easily I could step in (to such a 
role)," says Lu. "I know this so well in my bones. I know so many other women 
even in this day and age -- even some of my contemporaries -- who live totally 
for men with no lives of their own, no self-esteem, nothing. In Asian culture, 
it's like an insult to a man if a woman has a career. It's heartbreaking. (In 
the role of Forgiveness,) I can use all that I know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Waiting Room," which is a comedy about three women from different 
centuries who come together in a contemporary doctor's office, attacks 
America's current health-care system. And for this reason too, it strikes a 
chord with Lu. "I have six medical doctors in my family and I'm doing this 
play!" she says, clearly savoring the irony. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Lu puts her faith in precisely the kind of alternative therapies that 
"The Waiting Room" suggests are anathema to the Western health-care system. "I 
believe in holistic natural medicine," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a locked jaw one time and couldn't eat or speak and the acupressure 
person cured me in five seconds," Lu continues. "I tell my sister who is a 
doctor (such) stories and she says, 'Don't tell me about it. You are crazy.' 
This play connected me to all these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even if "The Waiting Room" didn't have such personal resonance for Lu, it 
would still be a rare opportunity. For even in the wake of 1990's "Miss Saigon" 
controversy -- which centered on the casting of a white actor in the role of a 
Eurasian -- multidimensional roles for Asian American actresses remain few and 
far between, especially on the main stages of such major regional theaters as 
the Taper. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (Asian American actresses) don't get this kind of stuff often," says Lu. 
"A 'Joy Luck Club' (comes along) maybe every 15 years and you cannot wait for 
it. I feel so blessed, I want to cry. I just feel like a lucky star shone on 
me. I just want more Asian American actors to experience this." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu herself knows many of L.A.'s Asian American theater artists from her days 
in the Asian American Theater Project at LATC. Lu also began working with the 
then LATC-based Women Artists Group during that period, as did playwright 
Loomer, and that is where "The Waiting Room" began. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just fortunate happenstance that both women were in attendance on the 
day that Loomer was ready to have a reading of what would eventually become a 
scene in her play. "I usually missed a lot of the Women Artists Group meetings 
because they were Saturday or Sunday mornings," says Lu. "That morning, I 
happened to be there. Talk about luck." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Loomer had only written one scene. "She was already writing 
something about cancer, because her mother (had) died of that," says Lu, 
referring to the disease that figures into the completed drama. "So she just 
kept writing, adding scenes." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu and Loomer hit it off so well that after that initial reading, the actress 
found herself becoming involved in the playwriting process. "I went to the 
Chinese library and checked out books for Lisa because she was writing for TV 
then and she was very busy," says Lu, who also availed herself of the same 
research materials in order to more fully understand her character. "If I saw 
any article about foot binding, I saved it so that she could read through it. I 
was more than happy to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 And the actress has stayed with the play from these initial phases up to its 
present full production. "She has done every workshop and every production of 
the piece so far," says director Schweizer, referring not only to Lu's Women 
Artists Group work, but also to the play's Taper New Work Festival and the 
Williamstown (Mass.) Theatre Festival workshops. Lu also will be the only 
member of the cast to go with the show in the fall to Trinity Repertory Company 
in Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be rehearsing something for the umpteenth time and she'll find a way to 
speak it as though she's never spoken it before," Schweizer continues. 
"Audiences respond to the sense of immediacy around what she's feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the changes of venue along the way have required that Lu make some 
alterations in her work. "It was an adjustment actually," she says of making 
the leap to the Taper. "I was doing small theater for a long time and it's all 
of a sudden 10 times as big. In the preview somebody said, 'June, we can't hear 
you,' and so I was able to make a quick adjustment before the press preview. 
Training helps." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other differences now as well. "Career-wise, I'm happy that I'm 
getting paid," says Lu. "But even if I didn't get paid, I would do it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 The artistic satisfaction of working on a character with a detailed emotional 
history is enough. "This character has a full life, coming from a different 
time," says Lu. "She comes from being a gracious and a kind person and being 
homeless and kicked out all of a sudden and losing her mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu -- who says that she'd be "committing suicide" if she revealed her age, but 
that her agent sends her out for parts for someone "between 45 and 55" -- has 
led a pretty full life so far herself. Born in Korea, she spent part of her 
childhood in Japan and speaks Korean and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother died when Lu was only 12 and she was profoundly affected by the 
loss. "In (an) Asian family, the mother is a kind of bridge between yourself 
and the father," she says. "I was quite vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a trauma from which the actress has never fully recovered. "I still 
mourn her death," she says. "It changed my life. I gained 30 pounds in eight 
months. I would scream at night with nightmares. It was horrendous." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu finished high school in Korea and came to the United States with her older 
sister, who had received a scholarship to study medicine in this country. The 
actress then began her own studies at Cal State L.A. But it wasn't smooth 
sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so shy that my speech teacher said, 'June, you go take some acting 
classes and get over this shyness.' I used to, if I was late for class, 
especially if the door was in front and I'd have to walk in, I'd shake, I was 
so shy. And that's when I started to take acting classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, who was still in Korea, wasn't thrilled with Lu's course of study. 
"When I was taking acting classes, he literally freaked out," she says. "He 
said, 'If you don't want to be a doctor, at least marry one.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even Lu, though, was hedging her bets against the stage. "I was actually 
majoring in education because you have to have a career," she says. "And I did 
teach (elementary school in the L.A. Unified School District) for about three 
years, but I was the most unhappy person." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu sought fulfillment by acting on the side. "I was doing theater at night and 
that didn't help," she says. "Both my acting career and my teaching career 
suffered." 
</P>
<P>
 After about three years of this regimen, Lu decided to break away. Calling 
upon the vocal training she'd had in college, Lu signed on as the featured 
singer with a group of local Asian Americans who billed themselves as Keiko and 
the Japanese Imperial Dancers. They embarked on a tour of Hiltons and other 
venues throughout the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 That stint lasted a few years, at which point Lu returned to L.A. to pursue a 
master's degree in fine art, also at Cal State L.A. She ended up quitting -- "I 
got sidetracked again," she says -- just seven units shy of completing the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu didn't abandon art, though. "I was doing some business with my art," she 
says. "I had a display at the Craft and Folk Art Museum and I was actually 
making some money." 
</P>
<P>
 She translated her knack for design -- and another side interest in political 
campaigns -- into a job designing clothes for Kathleen Brown (then Brown-Rice), 
when she ran for the L.A. Board of Education in 1975 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, though, Lu tired of going from job to job, avoiding what she had 
come to see as her true calling as an actress. "I was a late bloomer," she 
says. "My God, I was over 40 and here I was. I finally realized that what I 
wanted in life wasn't fame and money -- I just wanted to make a little dent 
before I left -- and it was OK if I ate cottage cheese and hamburger for the 
rest of my life. It didn't make any difference to me because I knew clearly 
that this is what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with that clarity, Lu sought further schooling for her chosen vocation. 
She studied at the Lee Strasberg Institute and with famed director Jose 
Quintero. "I had to come back to get proper training," she says. "I spent seven 
years in grueling training. And I saved every penny, and it was just fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late '80s, she's worked fairly consistently, including such LATC 
productions as Tennessee Williams' "Night of the Iguana" (1991)and a 1993 play 
by Michael Ahn called "Sidework," which the actress produced herself, and "The 
Wedding" at the Taper Too. Lu has also been seen in New York in David Henry 
Hwang's "Family Devotions" at the Public Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of her work has been in smaller theaters throughout Los Angeles -- at 
East West, she's been in "Rashomon," "Asaga Kimashita" and "The Threepenny 
Opera" -- and she's also appeared on TV in "Hangin' With Mr. Cooper," 
"Shannon's Deal," "Beauty and the Beast" and "MASH." Her most recent film 
credit is "Menace II Society." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu would naturally like to have more roles as fulfilling as Forgiveness From 
Heaven. So, partly in order to make that wish a reality, she coordinates the 
Asian Pacific American Friends of the Center Theatre Group's play-reading 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the 3-year-old series going was no mean feat. "It took years for it to 
materialize," says Lu, who brought the idea to Taper artistic director Gordon 
Davidson along with her fiance, Yet Lock, who serves on the Center Theatre 
Group board of directors. "It's volunteer work and I'm just thrilled and 
honored to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The mission is to help emerging Asian American playwrights develop their work. 
"I wanted to be in a position where I can at least make a change for people 
starting out," says Lu. "We need to nurture Asian playwrights. Otherwise, we 
have to wait until somebody else writes something for us, and sometimes the 
voice is different. Sometimes we look at it and it's not right." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, a number of scripts that have been read in the series -- such as 
Elizabeth Wong's "Kimchee and Chitlins," currently playing at the West Coast 
Ensemble -- have gone on to productions at other theaters. And that makes Lu 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is getting better, because we are pressuring," she says. "We can't just be 
complacent and not do anything. Ethnic groups have so much violence and 
friction, but we're basically all so much the same. And theater is a place 
where we can really learn about each other and solve some of the problems."

WHERE ARE THEY NOW?; THE 'LION' MAY SLEEP, BUT THEY'RE NOT RESTING

 The lion may be sleeping again, but the guys who first put him to bed, the 
Tokens, are wide awake. The Brooklyn-bred vocal group's most memorable hit, 
1961's "The Lion Sleeps Tonight," is enjoying a healthy resurgence through the 
song's use in Disney's animated blockbuster, "The Lion King," and as the 
centerpiece of a Burger King commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extraordinarily thrilled," says founding member Phil Margo, 52. "I've 
written a letter to (Disney chief) Michael Eisner and the CEO of Burger King 
thanking them for the break. Just to have Disney, Burger King and the Tokens 
mentioned in the same breath these days is pretty terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the film nor the commercial uses the recording by the Tokens, whose 
original lineup included Phil's brother Mitch, Jay Siegel and Hank Medress. But 
because the song was not included on the "Lion King" soundtrack, the only way 
for smitten listeners to "wimoweh" at home is to pick up the Tokens' 
self-released album, "Oldies Are Now," released on the group's own B.T. Puppy 
label, or RCA's reissue of the original single. RCA is banking on spillover 
from "The Lion King" exposure, having shipped 150,000 copies of the single to 
record stores. Sure enough, it's No. 56 with a bullet on the Aug. 27 Billboard 
chart.  
</P>
<P>
 The Tokens' version of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" spent three weeks at No. 1 in 
December, 1961. After a few more charting singles with the group, the Margos 
became producers, working on the Chiffons' "He's So Fine" and "One Fine Day," 
and on most of Tony Orlando & Dawn's biggest hits. 
</P>
<P>
 They also got the lion to crack the Top 10 again when they produced Robert 
John's 1972 remake of the song. That version was heard during a love scene in 
"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective." 
</P>
<P>
 The original Tokens got together in 1981 at Radio City Music Hall for what was 
to be a final performance. But the L.A.-based Margo Brothers have continued to 
perform as the Tokens, with Phil's son Noah now serving as drummer. Phil Margo 
says Medress is not interested in performing, and on the East Coast, Jay Siegel 
has his own lineup of Tokens. "There's no bad blood," Margo says. "Jay was the 
first person to call me after the earthquake. As soon as a momentous-enough gig 
comes along, we'll work together."  
</P>
<P>
 Margo says he's thoroughly enjoying the refocused spotlight on the Tokens. 
"We're having a great time. My mother is beside herself. There's a Jewish word 
kvell , and this whole thing is a major kvell ."

ALLIGATOR'S MONDAYS NEW AND IMPROVISED; EXPERIMENTAL ARTISTS ARE FEATURED IN 
SANTA MONICA CLUB'S NEW MUSIC MONDAY SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 You might not like it. Not even the musicians who play it always like it; 
that's a law of experimental music, "new" music, avant-garde , whatever you 
want to call it. Risking a kick from the classicist boot, you might even call 
it jazz. Why not? The word has been flexible enough to include ragtime, 
Dixieland, swing, be-bop, hard bop, modal, free jazz, jazz fusion. If they're 
all jazz, they have only one thing in common: improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 Improvisation is what Nels Cline, guitarist of the Nels Cline Trio, has in 
mind when he books the New Music Mondays he's been hosting at Santa Monica's 
Alligator Lounge for more than a year now. 
</P>
<P>
 And newness. Cline says what he puts on the Monday-night stage is about "a 
kind of skewed multiculturalism, the effects of people hearing a lot of stuff 
-- how it changed them, and how they didn't take the tried-and-true path and 
ended up with their own kind of music." It's a scene of individuals. At root, 
their music is what jazz always has been: change and challenge. It won't accept 
models, and it won't stand still. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 On the left side of the low stage, G. E. Stinson lets his fingers scratch out 
an almost funky guitar riff about three-quarters of the way to a standard 
realization before strangling it and beating it into a dissonant chord. He 
likes the effect, so he does it again. He's come up with a rhythm out of this, 
and on the other side of the stage, bassist Steuart Liebig has picked up on it 
and starts inserting precise slides, pops and echo-effect digital washes into 
the spaces.  
</P>
<P>
 In back, Joe Berardi performs the opposite of standard drummer chores: instead 
of reinforcing the newly established beat, he plays off it with lopsided rolls, 
tinkles and crashes.  
</P>
<P>
 In the middle, seated on a high stool, Japanese vocalist Kaoru moans a word, 
cuts in a phrase. Her microphone is plugged into an effects machine; she 
twiddles its controls to sample and repeat her vocals for rhythmic input, or to 
cathedralize them for godvoice authority. Or, since the sounds of the rest of 
the band are also leaking into her microphone, she can amplify her associates, 
turn them back on themselves, or mash them into a new paste.  
</P>
<P>
 The mass gets denser. The in tervals between beats gets smaller and smaller, 
until everything blends into a roar. Stinson's guitar starts feeding back; 
Liebig's bass follows suit. Berardi is pounding and thrashing now. It sounds as 
if the roof has been ripped off of hell. 
</P>
<P>
 This New Music Monday performance is by Unique Cheerful Events, a name Stinson 
settled upon after getting tired of changing the band's name for every gig. 
Typical? Here, there's no such thing. Next up could be a neoclassical 
improvisational chamber trio of violin, flute and bass clarinet, or a 
steel-grip '90s version of a free-jazz quintet. 
</P>
<P>
 Format, doormat. What matters is the level of commitment, invention and skill, 
and the Monday Alligator crowd knows about those. Look: people are listening. 
Teeth fluorescent under the purple influence of black light (plugged in so you 
can appreciate the primitive black-light paintings that glare from the 
blood-red walls), the audience, except for that occasional leather fetishist, 
skinhead or orange-mop, doesn't looks strange enough for the music.  
</P>
<P>
 Squinting at the stage, patrons tilt pint glasses of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale 
(on tap), dressed in jeans, tennis shoes, faded plaid shirts or T's, hair 
unfussed. Boho maybe, but more like post-hippie. Age range of 25 to 45. People 
who read books and listen to music. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunched on a bar stool, regular customer Andy Rotter says he used to be a 
business litigator, and came in contact with musical avanticians when his firm 
did some pro bono work for the Independent Composers Assn. in the early '80s. 
"People come here, and they can take some chances," he says. "Some things bomb, 
but that's one of the purposes of the series." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to bomb, but to take a chance of bombing. No matter what, though, says 
another visitor, San Gabriel resident Shiroshi Goto, "It makes you think 
differently." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene's so-what intelli gence rules out faddism, and indeed the history of 
experimental music is too unglamorous, intellectual and obscure to make it a 
decent gimmick or dilettante fixation. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth-century European composers like Schoenberg, Bartok and Berg, bored 
with classical harmony, rhythm and melody, got the bomb rolling in the early 
1900s. But they weren't improvisation-minded. It took later theorists like John 
Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen to reshuffle concepts of what composition was, 
and the influence of '60s explorers confused things more. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the '50s, Gunther Schuller and others merged classical and jazz 
elements into a "third stream." Pianist Cecil Taylor made a unified message 
from thousands of flying bits of condensed information. In the mid-'60s, 
saxists John Coltrane and Albert Ayler pushed sonic/rhythmic abstraction as far 
as it could go. Anthony Braxton created a complex, static world of theoretical 
alienation and refused to swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Los Angeles, Charles Mingus experimented with European neoclassical 
forms and harmonies in the mid-'50s. Later in the decade, Texan Ornette Coleman 
formed a band here to perform his free, non-chord-based conceptions. Coming out 
of the mold-breaking bands of Chico Hamilton and Mingus, L.A. windman Eric 
Dolphy superimposed atonality onto the rhythms of Charlie Parker and worked 
tough new meters and ensemble colors into his compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s and '90s, the local focus for experimental music slid down to Long 
Beach, where the California Outside Music Assn., organized by Titus Levi and 
currently helmed by Walter Zooi, lobbied Long Beach clubs for rare gigs for its 
members -- many of whom play the Alligator Mondays -- and hosted a yearly Day 
of Music that showcased the outest of the out. Until May, 1993, when Cline 
shoehorned his trio into the Alligator slot and took on responsibility for 
filling the rest of the bill each week, no L.A. venue regularly booked the 
weird stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cline doesn't think his own music is especially weird. "I don't think of 
myself as an avant-gardist," he says, "I think of myself as kind of a 
convoluter of tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 He and his twin brother, drummer Alex Cline, grew up listening to rock bands 
like the Allman Brothers, Jimi Hendrix and Quicksilver Messenger Service ("I 
liberally rob John Cipollina") and then '70s fusioneers such as Ralph Towner, 
Tony Williams and Miles Davis' electric groups ("We know every note on 
'Live/Evil' -- I bet we can sing every solo").  
</P>
<P>
 After a time spent playing "noisy, drony" rock, the brothers started taking 
themselves more seriously as musicians and improved their technical and 
theoretical chops. In the '80s, their atmospheric, inventive chamber band with 
violinist Jeff Gauthier and bassist Eric von Essen, Quartet Music, was one of 
the few projects that couldn't be dropped into an easy file of jazz, classical 
or fusion.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes concurrently, Cline worked in the critically loved pop/rock/funk 
band Bloc with guitarist Nick Kirgo, bassist Liebig, drummer Chris Mancinelli 
and vocalist Camille Henry. They made an album for A&M, but never caught fire 
commercially. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing each New Music Monday (unless Cline goes solo or duo), the Nels Cline 
Trio, Cline's current workshop with drummer Michael Preussner and bassist Bob 
Mair, shows all the guitarist's background. His playing can be delicate, 
melodic and meditative, the qualities that fit in best in Quartet Music. 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, his twisting modern-bop flair could stack him alongside John 
Scofield. But he's most entertaining at the extremes of rock noisemaking where 
Hendrix once ruled, using his guitar as a direct emotional vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have suggested that it's because of my frustration and bitterness 
that I've become a more interesting guitar player," says Cline. But he wants 
his feelings to translate into something more universal. "Beauty is what I want 
to do. Though my conception of beauty these days is something pretty raging." 
</P>
<P>
 At the other two corners, drummer Preussner and bassist Mair display the kind 
of instant communication that comes only from playing together a lot. They 
shift from one edge of the sonic scale to the other without seeming even to 
think about it. And that's especially remarkable considering they have no fixed 
repertoire. Cline is writing all the time, and he'll often declare a given 
Monday a "tribute" night, wherein the trio will perform the music of another 
artist he likes -- Wayne Shorter, Polly Jean Harvey, Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon 
-- or focus on the ineffable qualities that define some iconic personality such 
as Charlotte Rampling or Anjelica Huston. These tributes may also come with 
visual mood enhancers -- one night, supermodel posters. "That was pretty 
undignified. I had a great time," Cline says. 
</P>
<P>
 Cline has released a couple of fine CDs on the German Enja label as well as a 
pair of collectible chaos-intensive 45s that you'd probably be able to find 
only at Rhino Records, where Cline used to work. (These days he pays the bills 
by working at a bookstore.) Good as the records are, the sight of Cline 
onstage, davening over his strings, stomping his effects pedal or wiggling his 
whammy bar, is something to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 The experimental-music com munity is tight. Many of the same musicians 
reconfigure to form different entities with entirely different sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 One New Music Monday regular is Other Parts, a trio featuring flutist/vocalist 
Emily Hay (a member of U-Totem and one of three rotating hosts of the 
Wednesday-night experimental-classical KXLU radio show "Trilogy" along with NMM 
perennials vocalist Bonnie Barnett and saxist Kim Richmond). Along with the 
group's instrumental interplay, Hay improvises ministories and melodies 
vocally. Like many of the scene's most versatile artists, she's classically 
trained but not classically constrained. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it is imagery inside my head," says Hay, who works as a paralegal. 
"And now that I've been singing for a few years, imagery that comes out of 
words, experiences, or maybe a feeling I'm getting from the audience. It's also 
interacting with the other musicians sonically, and whatever their mood is. And 
it's being able to be on your feet and answer someone else's instrument or 
sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Going outside is a choice; it's not like these people can't do anything else. 
Unique Cheerful Events' Kaoru: "I was doing music business in Japan for five 
years -- that R&B, Top 40 kind of thing. I released, like, five albums, and I 
wanted to change direction, but all the record-company people hated it, because 
they wanted me to stay on the same kind of thing. So I just came here." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, she could break rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like the idea of the singer being in front of the band -- I always 
wanted to interfere with the other instruments, and I could get different kinds 
of tones using the effects box." 
</P>
<P>
 After his hitch with Bloc, Liebig also felt he had used up what interested him 
about popular music. He now plays with violinist Gauthier and trumpeter John 
Fumo (the excellent drummer Jeff McCutchen recently died) in Quartetto Stig, a 
composed/improvised project whose 9 Winds CD, Hommages Obliques, is one of the 
music's most fully realized artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this thing about moving forward and trying to find out what you find 
attractive," Liebig says. "I got into music-history classes at Northridge. I 
went nuts, hearing all this stuff that I'd never heard, and some of it I hated, 
and some of it I went, 'Wow, this is really great.' " 
</P>
<P>
 No discussion of L.A. edge music can omit Vinnie Golia. Like Kaoru, he started 
as a painter. One by one, he began to pick up woodwind instruments; he's now 
proficient on 20 or 30. Studies with Anthony Braxton and a careful ear to early 
Charles Mingus and a variety of modern classical music pushed him to become the 
scene's most prodigious composer and most traveled ambassador. He's also its 
greatest promoter, through his 9 Winds label, on which he has released 
recordings by many whose music is too extreme for the major labels and most of 
the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to point out someone in the club who might serve as an impartial 
observer untainted by his acquaintance, Golia looks around doubtfully. "I don't 
know," he says. "I've been around a long time. I'm a pretty big stain." 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, Golia is a regular New Music Mondays performer, often in ad hoc 
duos or trios.The Alligator is hardly big enough to display one of his 
acclaimed Large Ensembles of about 20 musicians, but any venue can be made to 
fit Golia, who, as one of his album titles says, is "worldwide and portable." 
Echoes of his jagged, intense compositional/improvisational style can be heard 
in the music of many Alligator habitues, many of whom he's employed in one 
context or another. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the L.A. army, Cline sometimes books outsiders of national 
stature. Mark Dresser awed the assembly with his compositions for solo bass -- 
no one expected to be nailed to the floor by one guy with a four-string. And 
maybe the most uncompromised performer was saxist Charles Gayle, who has made a 
media minisplash by getting his total-obliteration spiritual music heard 
despite being homeless on the streets of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Cline of Gayle, who stayed with him when he was in town, "His mind was 
exploded by Coltrane. He carries everything he needs on his person. Even the 
food he was planning on eating, he already had with him when he stayed here. He 
had a special way that he ate it. And we gave him a Diet Pepsi. He liked that 
Diet Pepsi -- he was very excited about it. He drank half of it one morning, 
and half of it the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 These are the rewards of being your own person. Small, but savorable. 
</P>
<P>
 So why do they do it? 
</P>
<P>
 Hay: "I think that it arises out of abstract reasoning and thought. I think 
that to be able to open yourself up to hear sound abstractly is an unusual 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Liebig: "Overamped, hyperthyroid curiosity. Sometimes the music is really 
annoying, and sometimes it's, like, godhead. And it's an eye-of-the beholder 
thing -- you and I can look at the same thing and it's totally different." 
</P>
<P>
 And who are they? 
</P>
<P>
 Cline: "Seekers -- people who want to be enlightened in some way, or 
challenged. The spirit of challenge in art is not something that one things of 
when one thinks of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebig: "People tend to think that L.A. is sort of the Motley Crue town, and 
they don't think that anything real is happening." 
</P>
<P>
 But who cares what they think? 
</P>
<P>
 Cline: "I still think that people are gonna find out about this music and dig 
it. I know that seems really dumb. I sense the interest in people 10, 15 years 
younger than me. I sense a lot of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 And what makes him keep doing these shows? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm astounded and humbled by hearing people who will confidently set things 
on their ear."

 It takes more than a presiden cy title to be a player in the record business. 
The key is making other executives worry about your next move. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are three executives who, to borrow an industry phrase, are "bubbling 
under" the Top 40 -- executives with the title and clout, but who have yet to 
cinch their place in the rock royalty in the eyes of other powerbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gary Gersh, 38, president and CEO of Capitol Records: After the brutal 
regime shift last year at Capitol, Gersh hit pay dirt with Radiohead, Blind 
Melon and Duran Duran -- all acts he inherited from predecessor Hale Milgrim. 
Everyone has respect for Gersh's instincts as talent scout, but it's too soon 
to tell what kind of an executive he will turn out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 * Al Cafaro, 45, president and CEO of A&M Records: Working in the shadow of 
industry legend Jerry Moss is no easy task, but Cafaro is moving into the 
spotlight himself, thanks to pushing Soundgarden to new levels and launching 
Gin Blossoms and Sheryl Crow. 
</P>
<P>
 * Phil Quartararo, 38, president and CEO Virgin Records America: The former 
promotion man has quietly and aggressively worked a string of hits over the 
past year including albums by Smashing Pumpkins, Janet Jackson and Enigma. He 
inherited those acts from his former bosses Jeff Ayeroff and Jordan Harris, so 
insiders are still trying to judge who deserves the credit. Robert Hilburn and 
Chuck Philips

THE TIMES POLL; MORE IN O.C. NOW RATE CRIME AS NO. 1 CONCERN; RESIDENTS FEEL 
MORE SECURE IN COMMUNITIES THAN IN 1992. BUT THEY WANT MORE POLICE, LAWS TO 
MAKE STREETS SAFER. 
</P>

 Local crime rates have been falling for almost a decade and people say they 
generally feel safe, but a new Los Angeles Times poll shows that more Orange 
County residents today than two years ago rank crime as the most important 
problem facing the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that a 56% majority now believe that crime, gangs, drugs, 
graffiti or inadequate police service are paramount issues for the county, and 
residents want more police, as well as tougher laws, to make the streets safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting a general pattern detected across the state and nation, crime has 
surged as an issue in Orange County since 1992, despite a relatively low level 
of crime compared to other metropolitan areas of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime was mentioned as the public's biggest worry more often in this year's 
poll than in two previous Orange County surveys by The Times in April, 1992, 
and August, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime topped the list of concerns even though the poll found that 83% of 
county residents generally feel secure in their communities, and 92% feel safe 
in their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't surprise me, based on what is happening: the growth of gangs, the 
growth in violent crime and the trends across the rest of the country," said 
Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters, president of the Orange County Chiefs 
and Sheriff's Assn. "Every police chief can tell you they are hearing about the 
same things in their communities." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll, under the supervision of John Brennan, interviewed 1,188 
Orange County adults by telephone on Aug. 6 and 7. The margin of sampling error 
for the full sample is plus or minus 3 percentage points. For certain 
subgroups, the margin of error might be somewhat higher. 
</P>
<P>
 In this year's survey, residents mentioned crime far more than two other 
well-publicized issues: the economy and illegal immigration. Only 10% picked an 
economic issue as a major concern, while 4% put immigration at the top of the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of crime in my neighborhood is definitely increasing," said Mark 
Gleason, 37, a computer software salesman from Santa Ana who participated in 
The Times poll. "There are more break-ins, more vandalism and more graffiti. 
The most disturbing thing is the unprecedented rise in gang activity. Juvenile 
crime is a real growth area here." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shows that concern about crime appears to be broad-based, but it 
tends to be higher in north Orange County and in neighborhoods where minorities 
predominate. Yet, even in mostly white communities, crime tops the list of 
concerns as it does among upper-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos and those living in nonwhite neighborhoods are particularly inclined 
to cite gangs as an issue, while lower-income households specifically cite 
gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Survey findings about the public's growing concern about crime contrasted 
against the overwhelming sense of safety suggest that local opinion follows a 
pattern also seen nationally: Concern about crime develops not so much from 
personal experience as from a media-driven sense that crime is on the rise 
virtually everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any doubt the media plays a role. The media highlight and play 
up criminal and violent activities," said Gerald C. Davison, interim dean of 
the Annenberg School for Communication at USC. "People doing good -- what you'd 
call human interest -- occupies second place." 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, the sensational murders, gang shootings and freeway chases 
served up to the viewing and reading public give the community a distorted 
picture of how widespread crime is, Davison said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI Crime Index, an indicator of criminal activity both locally and 
nationally, actually shows that reported crimes per 100,000 residents, has been 
dropping in Orange County since 1986, when the index peaked at 6,059. The 
latest FBI index is around 5,600. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI calculates the index from reported homicides, rapes, robberies, 
aggravated assaults, burglaries, auto thefts, larcenies and arsons -- crimes 
that members of the public are most likely to report to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 The disturbing thing is that over the last decade, homicides in the county 
have more than doubled, many of them blamed on burgeoning gang activity. 
Overall, the violent crime rate has increased more than 60% over the same 
period. A large portion of that upswing, however, is due to a change in state 
law in 1986 requiring that domestic assaults, which had not been viewed as 
felonies before that time, be added to the aggravated assault category of the 
FBI index. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime rates also vary widely across Orange County. Irvine has had the lowest 
crime rate locally, according to the FBI Crime Index, while rates in Fullerton, 
Santa Ana and Garden Grove have been among the highest. Of the five most 
populous counties in the state, Orange County's crime rate is the lowest, 
except for Santa Clara County's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get the local paper, and there are constantly police reports about some 
crime or something being stolen," said Mary Lou Johnson, 37, of San Clemente, 
who was questioned for the survey. "Maybe crime overall is not going up, but 
the viciousness and brutality of the crime certainly has." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shows that only 27% of county residents say crime is now worse in 
their own community than it was a year ago. Far more -- 45% -- think crime 
across Orange County has risen since last year. And while 83% feel safe in 
their own areas, a slimmer majority -- 64% -- think county recreational sites, 
such as parks and beaches, are generally safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, while concern about crime has risen, the 92% who say they feel safe in 
their own home represent a slight increase since 1992 when the number was 85%. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to feeling secure in their communities, the number of county 
residents who say they are generally satisfied with their communities is 
actually somewhat higher today -- 84% -- at least 5 percentage points higher 
than it was in the Times' 1992 and 1993 surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Perceptions of community safety, however, vary demographically. Latinos, 
lower-income people, those in nonwhite neighborhoods and North County residents 
express a higher level of anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 Community type is a stronger predictor of community satisfaction than race or 
income. For example, 81% of Latinos and 84% from low-income households report 
being satisfied with their communities. But only 59% of those living in mostly 
minority neighborhoods (regardless of their own race) voice the same view. 
</P>
<P>
 About nine in 10 of those in white-dominated areas feel safe from crime in 
their communities; just 64% in mostly minority neighborhoods feel as secure. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shows that Orange County residents agree with their counterparts in 
Los Angeles County that crime is a top community problem. But far fewer Los 
Angeles County residents -- only 67% -- say they feel safe in their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that 12% of residents have been the victim of a crime in the 
last 12 months, with another 5% saying that someone else in their household has 
been a crime victim. Nationwide in January, 10% were victims themselves and 
another 4% said that someone in their household had been a victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who said they were victims or had a victim in the household, 30% 
reported that their cars had been vandalized or broken into, 21% had their 
homes burglarized, 12% had cars stolen and 9% lost money in a theft. One in 10 
said they had been assaulted, and another 8% said they had been robbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those surveyed, the elderly were the least likely to say they had been 
victimized -- only 8%. Those under the age of 30 were the most likely to have 
been a crime victim, at 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that reported victimization is almost the same among whites, 
Latinos, men and women, upper and lower income people, North and South County 
residents, and in white and nonwhite neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce crime, a 35% plurality, which cut across racial, economic and 
political lines, said they thought more police were necessary, and 27% wanted 
criminal justice reforms such as tougher laws or longer sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 One in three called for social and economic solutions, such as youth programs, 
8%; better educational opportunities, 6%; more community involvement, 6%; 
increased parental responsibility, 5%; and more jobs for the poor, 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always been a believer in police visibility and would like to see an 
increase in foot patrols and community policing," said Stuart R. Essery, 47, of 
Fountain Valley, president of a real estate management company. "I have also 
been concerned about gun control. I think the proliferation of handguns has a 
lot to do with the violence. We can't turn a blind eye to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Cumar, a 46-year-old nurse from Anaheim, told The Times poll that the 
breakdown of the family was largely responsible for the proliferation of crime 
today. She doubted whether more police or jails would help the situation that 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to work on values and family life to prevent crime. Let's quit 
pouring money into prisons," Cumar said. "Improving education and communication 
can change our mind-set, but the disciplines, like education, we don't pay much 
attention to as a society." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the solutions desired by the public, such as more police, longer 
sentences, and social programs are contained in President Clinton's $30-billion 
crime package, which was passed by the Senate Thursday night. The embattled 
legislation, stalled by partisan sparing, is the first major crime bill to come 
out of Washington in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's congressional delegation unanimously opposed the measure. The 
congressmen say they want the same get-tough provisions their constituents do, 
except the Democrats attached too many strings to the measure as well as 
expensive pork barrel items unrelated to crime. Tougher, alternative measures 
were proposed by the Republicans, they say, but the Democrats gutted them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its a social-welfare spending and federal-controls bill," said Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). "First the President's figure for police was 
100,000 officers. It is really 20,000, and those are temporary. The Clinton 
approach is to control every cent that's sent back. You can hire more police, 
but only those approved by Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) said the measure contains about $7 
billion in expenditures unrelated to crime, including a resurrected 
$1.8-billion jobs program lifted out of the President's economic stimulus 
package. He also said that local cities probably will not be able to afford the 
matching funds for salaries and benefits needed to participate in the federal 
effort to hire more police. 
</P>
<P>
 "By far, it's the highest-cost way of achieving the objective," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the tougher laws favored in Orange County is the so-called "three 
strikes and you're out" law, which now requires offenders with two prior 
convictions for serious or violent felonies to receive 25-year-to-life prison 
sentences upon their third felony conviction. The measure is immensely popular 
in Orange County -- almost four out of five support the legislation, and among 
those 54% support it strongly. Fewer than one in five oppose the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Backing for "three strikes" crosses both racial and political lines, appealing 
to 78% of whites, 82% of Latinos, 77% of Democrats and 84% of Republicans. 
Support for the measure is slightly greater in Orange County than in the rest 
of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shows that 72% of Orange County residents favor a proposed "first 
strike and you're out" law requiring that those convicted of rape or child 
molestation for the first time be sent to prison for 25 years to life. The bill 
is pending in the state Legislature. Again the measure has wide appeal across 
racial, economic and political lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Pinkus, Times Poll assistant director, contributed to this report. Crime 
the No. 1 Concern in O.C. 
</P>
<P>
 While the vast majority of people in Orange County feel secure in their 
communities, they still consider crime to be the county's most important 
problem. The county's criminal justice system is sound, they say, but more 
police and tougher laws are needed to meet the crime problem head on. Orange 
County also strongly supports legislation to send repeat felons to prison for 
life and a proposed law to give life sentences to first-time rapists and child 
molesters. (For those responses grouped by neighborhood type, white means a 
mostly white neighborhood, minority means mostly minority, and mix an evenly 
mixed neighborhood.)

 As you may know, there is a new California crime law commonly known as the 
"three strikes and you're out" law. The law provides that anyone with two 
serious felony convictions on their record who is convicted of any third felony 
must be given a prison sentence of at least 25 years to life imprisonment. Do

 David Greenstein had reached the point that he didn't care if he died on the 
operating table. 
</P>
<P>
 Emphysema, the cruel wages of a 40-year, two-pack-a-day smoking habit, made 
him feel as though he were drowning -- very slowly. Tethered to an oxygen tank 
and wheelchair-bound, the 62-year-old West Palm Beach, Fla., resident couldn't 
perform life's most basic tasks. His wife had to shower him, shampoo his hair 
and rub him dry because he lacked the stamina. Even talking tired the former 
auctioneer. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Greenstein's doctor told him about physicians in California doing 
high-tech operations to ease breathing for patients like him, he was sold. And, 
true to his hopes, he says, the 90-minute procedure involving a laser, a video 
monitor and a cluster of small incisions on the side of his chest made him a 
new man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were gods," Greenstein said of his doctors at Chapman General 
Hospital in Orange, where more of these procedures have been done than anyplace 
else in the country and 300 people are on a waiting list. "I was wheeled in and 
I walked out." Now he bathes himself, goes for short walks, plays nine holes of 
golf and is hoping to get rid of that albatross oxygen tank altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tales of Greenstein and people like him are not, as even doctors who 
do the procedure point out, the stuff of good science. Science, they say, 
demands carefully designed studies of short- and long-term outcomes; it 
involves painstaking calculations and comparisons. It requires publication in 
journals rigorously reviewed by peers. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is the crux of the debate over laser bullectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure uses lasers to shrink the bullae, or swollen bubbles, on the 
surface of the diseased lung that otherwise gradually lead to suffocation in 
thousands of emphysema patients each year. Some doctors say so little is known 
about the procedure's risks and benefits that it is hasty and perhaps unethical 
to try it on large numbers of patients, many of them weak and desperate for any 
shred of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of exploding consumer demand, they say, it would be easy to make 
false promises and fuel false expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, say doctors who do the laser bullectomy, is that it works 
well most of the time, when patients are carefully selected. Clinical trials 
have started in a handful of places in the country, including at Chapman. 
Surgeons say what they know from anecdotes and personal experience will be 
proven in good time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If my results were not good, I couldn't do 900 cases," said Dr. Akio 
Wakabayashi, an Irvine Medical Center surgeon who takes credit for pioneering 
the procedure in 1989 while at UCI Medical Center in Orange. Wakabayashi, who 
recently moved from Chapman, said 90% of his patients show improved quality of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 No one doing the procedure touts the bullectomy as a cure or says that it is 
for everyone. Some patients are not sick enough; others' lungs are too far 
gone. Some have asthma and bronchitis that would not be helped by surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 There are risks of air leaks from punctures in the lungs and of pneumonia. 
Mortality is estimated by surgeons at Chapman to be from 5% to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, thoracic surgeon Dr. Robert McKenna Jr., who took Wakabayashi's place 
at Chapman, believes the surgery could improve thousands of lives. "I don't 
know numbers (but) the implications for this, I think, are enormous," he said. 
"It's possible there could be a huge boom in this type of surgery." Laser 
bullectomy could be "to the 1990s what cardiac bypass surgery was to the '70s," 
McKenna said. "There's a lot of interest in this. We just need to study it a 
little bit better to know the indications and contraindications." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake in the debate are the lives and the health of some of the country's 
most miserable individuals, people whose days and nights are spent struggling 
for air. They have end-stage cases of bullous emphysema in which bullae form in 
the lungs as a result of destruction of their tiny air sacs. The lungs become 
so swollen and breathing so inefficient that patients gradually suffocate. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a horrible way to go. "Unless you have it, you don't understand," 
Greenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 16,000 people die of emphysema each year, according to the National 
Center for Health Statistics. Most have some form of bullous emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these people are elderly, longtime smokers whose condition is not much 
relieved by standard medications, including steroids and inhalers. Unless they 
have one giant bullae -- as in a minority of cases -- they also are not good 
candidates for conventional open-chest surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Laser bullectomies, an outgrowth of advances in laser technology and so-called 
"keyhole" surgeries in the 1980s, involve inserting a laser through small 
incisions in the patient's side. "Bullectomy" actually is a misnomer, because 
the surgery does not actually excise the bullae. Surgeons move the laser tip 
over the bullae so that they heat up and visibly contract, ultimately reducing 
the swelling of the lung overall. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation is done on one lung at a time with a thoracoscope, a tube with 
optical lenses that allow the surgeon to peer inside the body via a video 
screen without opening up the patient's chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Many lung specialists and thoracic surgeons remain cautious, if not skeptical 
about the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin-based California Thoracic Society, which has fielded numerous 
inquiries from interested patients, in October issued a public advisory that 
the laser treatment for diffuse bullous emphysema was "investigational" only 
and had not been proved to be of overall benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 The society said its opinion would stand until "objective data on patient 
improvement have been demonstrated in appropriately designed experimental 
trials." 
</P>
<P>
 Surgery carries risks and complications, and the laser bullectomy, despite its 
less traumatizing keyhole approach, is no exception, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact remains that you are operating on people with significant lung 
disease. There are risks associated with anesthesia (and) they may have 
coexisting heart disease," said Dr. Paul Selecky, chairman of the society's 
clinical practice assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one researcher involved in the clinical trials has strong 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know with any certainty how helpful this procedure is in most 
patients with emphysema," said Dr. Matt Brenner, a UCI lung and critical care 
specialist who helped design a study protocol at Chapman that compares laser 
bullectomies to another experimental approach of removing diseased lung tissue, 
using surgical staples. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear, at least, that patients who have giant bullae can be helped by 
the laser bullectomy procedure, Brenner said, particularly if the bullae are 
causing crowding of the remaining lung. But few patients fit that description. 
Other subgroups of emphysema patients may benefit as well, but they have not 
been identified, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own feeling is it needs to be studied, it needs to be followed," Brenner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others point out that the laser bullectomy is not the only hope on the 
horizon: Dr. Joel Cooper of Washington University in St. Louis opens patients' 
chests and uses the staple technique to cut out diseased portions of the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman is comparing a variation on Cooper's procedure with laser 
bullectomies. The difference between Cooper's approach and Chapman's is that 
Chapman surgeons use keyhole surgery and operate on one lung at a time, while 
Cooper does a large incision and can operate on both lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenna said that in some cases, depending on what is best for the patient, 
both the staple and laser bullectomy techniques may be used in a single 
surgery. Wakabayashi and doctors at Western Medical Center-Anaheim often are 
using a combined approach as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're trying to combine all of the modern techniques we have 
available," said Dr. John Eugene, who has done 40 procedures in the series at 
Western Medical. "Eighty-five percent (of patients) say they feel better." 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene said he is working with doctors at the University of Nevada to assemble 
data. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is an operation we can do. . . . I have data to show in the 
short term it works. The problem is, we don't know what the results are in the 
long term." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, hundreds of debilitated emphysema patients from all over the 
country are flocking to Orange County in search of answers to their prayers. 
Other centers are seeing demand rise as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be selective," said Dr. Alex G. Little, chairman of surgery 
for the University of Nevada School of Medicine. "We're discouraging patients 
from seeing this as a major success with no risk. In fact, I think one of the 
problems with the whole process is that these patients are desperate for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll say to you, 'I'll do anything.' I say, 'That's not very encouraging 
to me.' I want you to know the risks." He tells them that 80% of patients are 
improved, about half of them dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 With this kind of consumer demand, there is money to be made. Medicare covers 
most of the surgeries, doctors and marketing specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag varies. But Chapman officials tell patients that, assuming they 
are in the hospital 10 days, the bill will come to about $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of former Chapman officials have created a corporation, U.S. Lung 
Centers Inc., in Yorba Linda that now has marketing contracts with Western 
Medical Center-Anaheim and the University of Nevada Medical Center, and is 
about to close negotiations with a medical center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just a money-making venture, said Vice President Linda Simons, former 
marketing director at Chapman and a former nurse, who has hooked up with former 
Chapman executive John Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're helping people with a terminal disease," Simons said. "I've seen what 
has happened to these patients. My concern is getting the word out there to get 
them some type of quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure we're making money, but I'm sure we're not going to be millionaires," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simons said most patient referrals come from doctors, but that the corporation 
does a limited amount of newspaper advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago, the firm ran a newspaper ad that read "Emphysema -- Now 
There's a Cure," which drew protests from the California Thoracic Society. 
Simons said that wording was immediately dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Cure or not, for some patients who have had the procedure, it's as close as 
they've been to magic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been a miracle," said Ethel Hone, 64, of Mesquite, Nev., who had 
her surgery at Chapman about three months ago. "I couldn't believe it. . . . I 
haven't had to wear my oxygen to bed. The only time I wear it is when I'm 
riding my bike. I keep trying to pinch myself, it's just so wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the wife and daughter of one 76-year-old patient waited nervously 
in Chapman's lounge. The patient, Clinton L. Hooten of Clermont, Fla., a 
40-year smoker who quit nine years ago, had just been wheeled into the recovery 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooten used to be what his wife, Sue, called "the life of the party," an avid 
golfer, traveler and bridge player. But lately "he just didn't have the energy 
to do a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
 "His doctor was not enthusiastic about his coming," she said. "Most doctors 
feel like it's a risky thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But to Hooten, who apparently came through the surgery well, the risk was 
worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right before we got the call he'd been accepted, he told my mother and aunt 
he didn't want to go on living," his daughter, Suzanne Walker, said. "It was 
too terrible a quality of life."

<P>
 Jack Hatch is 53 and mentally ill, but he no longer roams the streets, 
wild-haired and muttering. He has found a home in an old U.S. Army warehouse, 
40,000 square feet of concrete floors, dusty rafters and dim fluorescent tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 He shares it with more than 200 other boarders, nearly all of them drug 
addicts, drunks or felons. A few are deranged. Together, they constitute an odd 
society -- a teeming, noisy, loving, hostile, backbiting and hopeful band of 
men and women brought together only by failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Outcasts all, they flow into the Salvation Army's vast Bell Shelter every 
afternoon, well before dinner, and flow out again every morning after 
breakfast. They get beds, showers and hot meals, but the shelter is not just 
another flophouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Secluded in a gated industrial zone seven miles southeast of Los Angeles' Skid 
Row in the city of Bell, it is a startling and unlikely prototype: a sort of 
repair factory for broken souls. The machinery of deliverance clatters and 
lurches like a Rube Goldberg contraption, an unwieldy array of schedules, 
rules, obligations and incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone has a duty or a place on some unwritten flowchart. Hatch, for 
example, folds towels and barks commands in his booming baritone to keep order 
in the meal line. Regulars used to call him "Sgt. Hatch" before his diligence 
won him a promotion last year. That's when he proudly began sporting on his 
collar the gold bars of a lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 On any given evening, the roll call of Hatch's roommates is a Runyonesque 
sampling of unfortunate characters. There is Don Klatke, 46, a mentally ill 
chain-smoker known as the "can man." Once a night, he circulates among the 
trash receptacles bagging up aluminum cans. 
</P>
<P>
 There are people tortured by demons of every variety. Robert Torres, 24, is a 
onetime devil worshiper who bears a razor-etched scar on his arm -- "Satan." 
Rosie Cervantes, 36, rues the cocaine addiction that separated her from nine 
young children. Alan Grossman, 37, laughs about his pirate-like appearance -- 
tattoos, needle tracks from heroin, a patch over an eye that was gouged out in 
a gang fight. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, Bell Shelter is merely another stop in a game of leapfrog from one 
homeless center to another. But for many, the hard-edged program is a chance to 
start life over. In fact, some experts see the shelter as a model approach to 
combatting homelessness, one of Los Angeles' most staggering social problems. 
The warehouse runs on a system of small rewards and well-applied discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 To get in, boarders must be sober. To stay on, they must attend school or 
job-training classes. At 6:30 each weekday morning, a yellow school bus pulls 
up at the warehouse to trundle addicts and transients to occupational centers. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, boarders take part in drug recovery meetings and chapel services. 
They are required to write job resumes and monthly book reports. Those who 
demonstrate commitment -- and who look for work -- are permitted to stay two 
years or longer to improve their odds of finding a place in society. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't have no fun here -- no sex, no alcohol, nothing," complains Steve 
Jensen, 45, a self-described rebel who went through a divorce and was sleeping 
in a car before it was repossessed. He showed up at Bell Shelter just as so 
many do -- broke, with an attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't obey rules," Jensen declares. "I've already crossed the bridge as to 
whether I'd kill somebody." But then he shrugs and adds, "Hey, I probably need 
a structured environment." A Loose Camaraderie 
</P>
<P>
 To spend time at the shelter is to see hardship and hope, a crossroads strewn 
with regrets, yet brimming with dreams. People who have slept in parks and 
dirty alleys find a loose camaraderie. They nurse fragile plans for climbing 
off the bottom. Romances flourish. Jealousies and petty thefts chip away at the 
forces of control and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Boarders spend idle hours playing pool, table tennis and air hockey. They 
catch movies on a wide-screen TV. They study in the shelter library, or bulk up 
in the weight room. They get haircuts in a one-chair cubicle known as the Bell 
Shelter Barber Shoppe and Beauty Salon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to lift them up, like life is just beginning," says executive 
director Daryl Ogden, the only one among 20 paid staff members who is not a 
former addict or transient. "No place in the United States can offer what we 
offer. And we don't charge them a dime." 
</P>
<P>
 Cocaine addict Royal Williams, 35, sits one night sporting a black bandanna 
and playing video games. He tells of landing a forklift job and putting aside 
$4,000 toward a car and, soon, an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here is like a family," Williams says. "People know that if they go 
to (many) of these other shelters, you might as well still be on the streets. 
You can't help but love this place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 40-foot ceiling, nine-foot walls slice the vast enclosure into an 
assortment of rooms, all sharing the same light, the same echoes. The main 
meeting room has vending machines, game tables and rows of chairs facing the 
TV. Those seats are now filled, and people spill into the rear of the room, 
their backs against the steel doors of the loading docks. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Monday night, time for "Goolash." 
</P>
<P>
 The name signifies many ingredients, and, in fact, Goolash is not only an 
orientation for new arrivals but also a chance to discuss rules, programs, 
problems and gripes. Voices reverberate: The hot water isn't working. There's 
too much noise to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden says he will check on the water. He pleads for quiet at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Caseworker Patrick Mellon comes to the microphone. He is a recovering crack 
addict who orchestrates employment efforts. He tracks every boarder by computer 
through training programs designed to make them custodians, security guards, 
bank tellers, welders, office workers and more. In many cases, Mellon petitions 
the courts to seal criminal records, aiding a job hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 165 Bell Shelter boarders enrolled in training, according to 
Mellon's figures. Of those, 118 found jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've been here 45 days, you're supposed to be in school or working," 
Mellon tells everyone. "Keep my office busy and let's get you all into homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Ogden asks for volunteers. Six line up, only to learn they must sing -- 
and act out -- the verses of "Old MacDonald." Ogden demonstrates, thrusting his 
head back and forth, turkey-fashion. "If you're doing a turkey," he says, 
"you've got to do a turkey." 
</P>
<P>
 Laughter erupts. David Jones, the first in line, refuses and bolts to the back 
of the room. Everyone boos. Gwen Boddye, a member of the shelter choir, flaps 
her arms and does a chicken: "A cluck-cluck here, a cluck-cluck there. . . ." 
Someone does a dog, a cow. There is a loud chorus: "EE-aayyy-EEE-aaaayyy-OOO." 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the crowd are in hysterics. The lunacy is designed to capture 
attention. It sets a stage for Mike Mason, the staff's second-in-command, a 
tall, dynamic figure who takes the microphone and says: "Let's get serious a 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
 The room falls silent. Mason talks about hitting bottom. His own heroin lust 
once cost him $150 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody here has had it worse than I did -- living in a 
cardboard box on Skid Row," Mason says. "I don't know of any other program that 
offers what Bell Shelter does. You've got a prime opportunity to change your 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd seems almost desperate to hear it. A burst of applause interrupts 
him, then Mason goes on, admonishing them to keep the shelter clean, to be 
courteous. "You don't know who that person is sitting next to you," he warns. 
"He might be totally insane. He might be a mass murderer." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the boarders all stand and joins hands for the Lord's Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The line for dinner snakes 60 yards, through two doorways. Its slow progress 
causes Jack Hatch to shake his arms in agitation. "Oh, come on!" he hollers. 
"Let's go!" 
</P>
<P>
 A sign announces: "Joe's menu for Monday . . . chili beans, nachos, peaches, 
corn, tomatoes, ice tea." One by one, men and women load trays and fill long 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Cari Swenson, 32, sits with her fiance, Brian James, 28. A year ago, Swenson 
was a prostitute in Long Beach. James had been in prison for car theft before 
they met last fall at 5 one morning. James peeked through a partly open motel 
door and saw Swenson alone with a crack pipe. They talked. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Cari, my mission is to save your life,' " Swenson recalls him saying. "He 
wants to get me off the streets because I'm going to end up dying out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are here -- their first day. Swenson talks of getting a home, 
starting a family. But her eyes are wide, as if every clattering echo scares 
her. She took solace from Mason's speech. "We are somebody. We can change," she 
says. "And we need to hear that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Choir rehearsal fills the dining hall after dinner. A dozen bodies sway and 
clap. "Hold me, Jesus! Hold me, Jesus! I need you to hold my hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Lights-out is a few hours away. In the main room, TVs blare. Men play pool. 
Out on the loading docks, dozens of people smoke and chat. A boisterous group 
plays dominoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind a casual atmosphere lies a tough set of rules. Forbidden are gambling, 
profanity, drinking or fighting. If fisticuffs break out, combatants are put on 
the streets, no matter who starts it. Smokers must dispose of their butts 
properly or face losing the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 Provocative dress is taboo. So is physical contact, even between husband and 
wife. Not only do men and women sleep in separate quarters, but staff members 
-- several live here -- are forever vigilant in common areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a man and his wife are caressing," Mason says, "I'll talk to them and say, 
'There's a man in here, or a woman, who's watching that and getting aroused. 
Who knows what will happen from there?' " 'She Causes Me Problems Daily' 
</P>
<P>
 Men outnumber women by about seven to one. Much attention therefore falls to 
young women such as Irma Camacho, 23, a cocaine user who arrived only weeks 
ago. With her dark eyes, high cheeks and playful smile, Camacho is rarely 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 One counselor describes her as helpful, sweet, naive. But Mellon, the 
caseworker, says he had to have her change clothes four times in a single day 
to cover exposed skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "She causes me problems daily -- being young, sexy and knowing it," Mellon 
says. "The only thing that keeps her (safe) in here is people like me." 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho sits now in the main room, showing off pictures of her infant son, 
Jesse, who is with her mother. Jesse's father is in Mexico; Camacho says she 
threw him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Living with her three brothers, all gang members, Camacho feared for the 
baby's safety, she says. Now she wants to get off drugs and learn a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 A volunteer stops by to give her a pair of socks. Camacho is delighted; 
earlier, she got new shoes and a pretty pink sweater. She unfolds the socks. 
They appear long. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's OK," she says, giggling. "I like them long." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bedtime is announced via loudspeaker. Those working or in job training retire 
to semiprivate cubicles; some sleep only four to a room. But an overwhelming 
majority are relegated to the cavernous men's sleeping hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Narrow military cots fill more than half the space. At the far end, slightly 
elevated, are wider, padded beds, reserved for those with exemplary behavior. 
Staff members call the area Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more like South-Central," one addict quips. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights go out at 11. Men drift in. Nights are haunted by memories. Jerry 
DeHaan, 37, is just one of those who lie awake, thinking. DeHaan was once a 
rock singer -- even got a video on MTV, he says. And he still has that look: 
the blond hair halfway down his back, the 14-carat guitar pendant, which he 
hasn't removed in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the women, I had the drugs -- I had it all," DeHaan says. "Sex, drugs 
and rock 'n' roll -- that's what the problem was about." It has been reduced to 
slang shorthand: "SDR," the irresistible trio that cost him marriage, home and 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 DeHaan had a day job, too, in aerospace, but was laid off. At the end of the 
slide he pawned all his guitars and amplifiers. He has not seen his son or 
daughter in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss my son, man." DeHaan's eyes tear up. "It hurts, it really does." 'I 
Don't Have No Regrets' 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-luck stories fill every cot. Voices penetrate the darkness. A dishwasher 
booms and swishes. Some men snore, but for many, sleep comes hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 3 a.m., a night worker cleans the kitchen and prepares for 
breakfast -- dry cereal, oatmeal, beans. 
</P>
<P>
 A peacefulness settles in. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4, Patricia Clayton sits studying the Scriptures. She is 51, a former 
cocaine addict and the mother of eight grown children. Until 5:30, when she 
must awaken the women, Clayton is pursuing her attempt to read the Bible in a 
year -- a bit every night. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Shallie Clayton, 52, also works graveyard, supervising the 
kitchen and standing by for emergencies. For 37 years, on and off, he used 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I spent about enough to buy a Rolls-Royce," Clayton says, estimating 
that he has seen 15 or 20 friends die of overdoses. But Clayton cleaned up five 
years ago. He has a graying mustache and diamond earring and seems content here 
in the quiet of the shelter kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this was what was supposed to happen to me in my life," he says. "I 
don't have no regrets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn comes not with reveille, but with blaring announcements: "Let's get up, 
gentlemen. It's time to wake up." 
</P>
<P>
 Showers fill. People line up at sinks and mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast ends at 6:45, and by 8 the "Level 1" boarders -- those not yet in 
study programs -- must leave the shelter for the day unless they have prior 
permission to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Cari Swenson and Brian James are distressed to learn of the rule. Unsure where 
to go, they stare at the commotion and drift away. Two women stumble through 
the office area, mumbling about sleep deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
 By 9, when Hatch gets up, much of the place has cleared out. Hatch is 
effusive. "It's good to be alive," he declares to one addict. He lays out clean 
mats in the showers and moves to a bank of dryers to fold towels. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident for three years, Hatch is next to royalty. During last year's 
promotion, staff members marched holding pool cues and played the national 
anthem. Hatch's background is sketchy -- he doesn't much discuss it -- but 
Mason recalls that he once went home to family, then showed up at the shelter 
again, crying. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch concedes he is happier here. "You get to do things," he says gruffly. 
"When these darn dryers go out, I hit the switch -- that breaker switch -- and 
everything goes back on." 
</P>
<P>
 Far across the warehouse other chores are being handled by the executive 
staff. Mellon, a former electronics engineer, calculates the electrical demands 
of appliances that will fill a new kitchen. He must steal the time from a huge 
caseload of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Though proud that 25 boarders are working full time and saving money, Mellon 
often talks with exasperation. Addicts solicit him for money or bus tokens. He 
tells horror stories. One boarder -- a volunteer in the kitchen -- was here 
before and learned carpentry, only to move in with a drug-abusing woman. 
Instead of saving for a truck, he bought a color TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, when you move back (on the street)," Mellon says, "there's no 
place to plug it in." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every trainee goes away happy. Ron Coleman, 49, moved in a year ago and 
enrolled in a computer program. Later, he alleged -- among many charges -- that 
the program offered inadequate instruction. Administrators extended his course 
hours, but Coleman left this spring still jobless. 
</P>
<P>
 Don McWilliams, 32, who also left jobless after taking the same computer 
course, says boarders are pressured into filling open training spots and 
threatened with eviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "They decide when you wake up, when you go to bed, what your behavior will 
be," McWilliams says. "(They say) you're going to be thrown out for this, going 
to be thrown out for that. For you to put everything you have in a green 
plastic bag and walk out onto that street, with no idea where you're going to 
go, is a rough situation. And I've seen it happen many a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter managers deny the accusations. Ogden, the executive director, calls 
Coleman a troublemaker and adds: "When you're dealing with homeless people, 
you're dealing with one end of the spectrum to the other. There's a reason many 
of them are homeless -- they're dysfunctional." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The walls of Ogden's tiny office feature a portrait of Christ, a chalkboard 
filled with budget figures and a "needs list" running 13 items, including a 
freezer, washing machines and a VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 At 48, Ogden was a high-paid corporate manager with a month's vacation every 
year. He quit to find meaning and hired on here three years ago, when the 
shelter was $600,000 in debt and about to fold. Ogden dispensed with free 
commuter buses, bolstered fund raising and now operates in the black on a 
$500,000 budget of county, federal and private funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting corners is a way of life. A former addict, John Ivey, makes plumbing 
repairs and administers random drug tests to boarders and staff. Most of the 
furniture is federal surplus. Carpenter apprentices and union labor built the 
showers and sleeping cubicles for free. 
</P>
<P>
 The new kitchen is a steel cargo container with one end lopped off and windows 
cut with blowtorches. The donated hunk of metal juts from the west wall. 
Recently, the shelter also acquired 10 mobile homes. Soon they will provide 
temporary housing just beyond the loading docks, enabling about 30 former 
transients to save money a few extra months. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole place is the brainchild of federal appeals court Judge Harry 
Pregerson, who was distressed when an unusually cold winter began causing 
hypothermia deaths among transients. 
</P>
<P>
 Pregerson helped the Salvation Army arrange to rent the warehouse for $1 a 
year. When the shelter opened in January, 1988, with only a dozen cots and no 
showers, there was public alarm over the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very, very fearful that it would become . . . a metaphor for 
warehousing the homeless, and it was going to be a terrible place," says Gene 
Boutilier, executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, a 
new joint powers agency formed by the city and county to coordinate homeless 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the best shelter program in the entire county," says Godwin 
Nwufo, a senior analyst for the county's Community Services Department. "It's 
very comprehensive. I think they're really training people to become 
self-sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by its success, the Salvation Army plans to open a new domed 
structure in Santa Monica on Thursday to house 100 men and women a night, said 
agency spokesman Russell Prince. "It's modeled very much," he says, "on the 
Bell Shelter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And so, meanwhile, the Bell Shelter tumbles on, a kaleidoscope of dreams and 
failures, days and nights, and scenes that unfold far from the world that most 
people know. 
</P>
<P>
 In the main room at night, Mason convenes the entire throng and announces that 
there is a thief among them -- a wallet is missing. A search begins, locker by 
locker, bed by bed, until at last it is found out on the docks, minus $80 in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
 At a crowded drug recovery meeting, Alan Grossman recalls the day he climbed 
atop a freeway overpass, ready to leap into traffic and end it all. The shelter 
saved his life, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Late one night before a blank TV, Sergio Willis, 24, talks of his two-year 
odyssey, a gay youth fleeing a "homophobic" small town to try a career in 
creative arts. He shows off a comic strip -- "Detector Pig" -- that he has 
drawn for years. The character wears a protective suit to make him strong. 
"He's getting more violent," Willis says. 
</P>
<P>
 People come and go. Brian James talks of lining up construction work; a few 
days later, he and Cari Swenson are gone. Jerry DeHaan sits outside in the 
darkness of the docks and vows that someday -- someday -- he'll be playing the 
Forum. Not far away, Irma Camacho listens while Robert Torres talks of 
communing with Satan to learn evil. Torres says he once had a dream that if he 
left Satan he would become homeless -- and that's how he came to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 And on another morning, Jack Hatch tends to the laundry then goes to get a 
pill for his blood pressure. He rummages for a drinking cup. He stops, excited, 
whispering about the news: In only a few days Hatch will be promoted again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be Capt. Jack," he says, his eyes wide. "It has a beautiful ring 
to it, doesn't it?"

BLAME FOR HEALTH PLAN'S COLLAPSE FALLS EVERYWHERE; LEGISLATION: THE 
ADMINISTRATION TASK FORCE, INTEREST GROUPS, CONGRESS AND PUBLIC ALL HAD A HAND 
IN ITS FAILURE. 
</P>

<P>
 Through the squalls and storms of the past few months, no one has been more 
doggedly upbeat about President Clinton's ambitious plan for national health 
care reform than senior adviser Ira Magaziner and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Magaziner, chief architect of Clinton's health care plan, took great delight 
in calling attention to his office bookshelves. They were jammed with fat 
three-ring binders, nearly bursting with the multitude of options the 
Administration's health care task force had considered and rejected. The data 
they contained, he declared, would make believers out of anyone who doubted the 
wisdom of the President's reform formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to serve us very well as we go through this process," he would 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Magaziner's confidence remained intact through months of rancorous public 
debate over the Clinton plan. But it came crashing down a week or so ago, when 
he emerged briefly from the policy-making biosphere of Washington to visit his 
home in Rhode Island. There, according to one associate, he finally began to 
see -- and understand -- the true depth of the public rejection of the 
Administration approach to health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, Magaziner realized the battle was lost. "It's really sort 
of sent him into a blue funk," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton is also showing signs of the strain. The First Lady, who 
presided over lengthy task force deliberations and wowed five congressional 
committees with her mastery of health care minutiae, has been the 
Administration's most resolute advocate of a sweeping, government-orchestrated 
restructuring of health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she still expresses unflagging commitment to reform, "you can pretty 
much see the fatigue whenever you see her these days," a Capitol Hill source 
said. As congressional leaders work feverishly to salvage what they can of 
health care legislation, Hillary Clinton has assumed an uncharacteristically 
low profile, giving only occasional interviews and spending time with daughter 
Chelsea instead of stumping for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps as much as the President himself, Magaziner and Hillary Clinton have 
come to embody the Administration's effort to assemble and pass the largest 
package of social legislation in half a century, one that seemed to have 
everything going for it only 11 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The country was demanding big change; that was the message of the 1992 
election. And when Clinton stood before a joint session of Congress brandishing 
the pen with which he vowed to veto anything that fell short of universal 
coverage, the words rang with a sense of authority and determination that made 
health reform seem inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it appears that the very best the Administration can hope for is a far 
more modest measure that would alter insurance industry regulations but forgo 
any attempt to provide universal coverage. The debate now raging within the 
White House inner circle involves whether to call the effort off and start 
again from scratch next year, or to take whatever they can get from Congress 
this year and follow up with a broader bill in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter which course they choose, the President and his advisers will have 
to come to terms with the profound public ambivalence that Magaziner discovered 
too late to incorporate into the Administration's calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody cares. I don't think anybody in the country cares. 
That's the pathetic thing," said one disillusioned Democratic congressional 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamental questions are these: What went wrong with the Clinton health 
care plan? Why did a nation that enthusiastically endorsed the concept of 
reform reject the best plan that the Administration's experts could devise? And 
who deserves the bulk of the blame? 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, everyone involved in the battle seems to offer different 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to blame the White House reform team for failing to capitalize on 
what appeared to be a historic opportunity, and for disregarding potential 
pitfalls that might have been readily apparent to those with more Washington 
experience. Some of the fault also lies with a squeamish Congress and an array 
of aggressive interest groups. Inevitably, one must also look to a public that 
seemed to believe the impossible: that Americans could get more and better 
health care without having to pay more for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying it all was the enormous size and complexity of the endeavor itself. 
There is a reason, after all, that presidents from Harry S. Truman to Richard 
Nixon fell short in their efforts to accomplish the same goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the Clinton reform agenda will no doubt be debated for years. But 
even at this stage, it appears clear that several fundamental factors 
contributed to its collapse: The Process 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually everyone involved, including Clinton himself, now admits that the 
White House task force headed by the First Lady and Magaziner botched the job. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Clinton had made a campaign promise to deliver a comprehensive 
health care reform plan within the first 100 days of his presidency. "It was a 
stupid deadline that had no purpose," said one of Clinton's congressional 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, the transition team failed to develop an action plan by 
Inauguration Day. So it was with a far greater sense of urgency than he let on 
that Clinton, five days into his presidency, announced the formation of a 
Cabinet-level task force to be led by his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Clinton's allies still insist that putting the First Lady in charge 
was a good idea, noting that she has been the plan's most forceful and 
effective advocate, both on Capitol Hill and with the public at large. 
</P>
<P>
 But her appointment robbed Clinton of the ability to distance himself from the 
proposal, and turned it into more of a referendum on his own popularity. That 
weakness would become evident as a series of setbacks, from the Whitewater 
controversy to foreign policy, chipped away at Clinton's approval rating. In 
recent weeks, congressional leaders have gone to great lengths to distance 
their efforts from anything that might be characterized as "the Clinton bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Magaziner has become an even bigger target for criticism than the First Lady. 
Self-assured and dismissive of those who disagreed with him, he rapidly made 
enemies on Capitol Hill, alienating many members who had been working for years 
to enact health care reform. Though his intellect was universally admired, 
lawmakers had little confidence in his ability to make accurate political 
soundings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem started when the initial decisions were made to hand the process 
to one expert named Ira Magaziner, who knew, No. 1, nothing about politics, and 
No. 2, nothing about health care," said Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.), the 
leader of a movement in the House to adopt a so-called single-payer health care 
system -- in essence a government-financed system like Canada's. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force's role was greatly misunderstood, even by many of the 500-plus 
participants. Magaziner intended for the participants to merely test theories 
and do research. But most thought they were working virtually round the clock 
to make new policy. That misunderstanding would cause plenty of hurt feelings 
all around. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's work got off to a rocky start from which it never fully recovered, 
and even Magaziner now concedes that the overnight creation of a task force and 
the crash development of a health care reform plan became an exercise in 
"managed chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 Each morning, there were long lines of task force members trying to get 
clearance to enter the Old Executive Office Building, which is next to the 
White House. Once inside, many had no place but the floor to plant themselves 
and their overcoats. Desks, chairs, computers -- even telephones -- were scarce 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 A Draconian code of secrecy was imposed by Magaziner, shutting out the public, 
the press and even congressional leaders. Paperwork was to be kept to a 
minimum; even contact with task force members assigned to other work groups was 
discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of work had to be done without knowing what the context was," 
complained one work group leader. "It was like trying to design a new national 
transportation system without knowing whether there will be trains, cars, 
airplanes or bicycles." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the frenetic pace, Clinton did not meet his self-imposed early May 
deadline for delivering a plan. In the spring, Hillary Clinton was absent for 
several weeks, attending to her dying father in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole process froze," Magaziner recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the First Lady's return, health care remained on the back burner as 
the entire Administration focused on getting Clinton's budget passed. 
</P>
<P>
 When finally produced, the plan was so complicated that even its drafters had 
trouble explaining it, a problem compounded by the fact that the task force had 
been composed of policy specialists who had little feel for the political 
dimension of their work. The Interest Groups 
</P>
<P>
 In its complexity and its magnitude, the bill was an easy target, particularly 
in the highly charged atmosphere of modern interest-group politics. 
</P>
<P>
 That lesson was clearly weighing on Hillary Clinton's mind earlier this month, 
as she told reporters: "It is more difficult in many ways today to advance a 
complex public policy issue than it was in the past because, if you look at our 
society in general, there are so many splintered voices of authority, and there 
is so much skepticism, even cynicism, about the political process. . . . It's 
not like what it was even for Franklin Roosevelt, who had a tough time with 
Social Security." 
</P>
<P>
 House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) laments that on such complicated 
legislation, "people can just get away with saying anything about it, and it 
isn't obvious that the information being given out about it is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 As the weaknesses of Clinton's plan became apparent, virtually every big 
interest group backed away -- even those that had been among the prime movers 
in getting the drive for health care reform going. Doctors, hospitals and 
companies big and small all scrambled to protect their own interests, fighting 
it out over the details of the plan even if it meant losing their larger goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Big companies are a case in point. The White House thought it could gain the 
support of those employing 5,000 workers or more by allowing them to 
self-insure while requiring smaller firms to join regional health insurance 
purchasing alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, few large firms were enthusiastic about remaining 
self-insured because they feared they would be out-muscled by the gigantic 
purchasing cooperatives proposed by the Administration; in addition, they would 
have faced a 1%-of-payroll "assessment" for opting out of the alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Big companies also were put off by the tremendous flexibility that Clinton 
proposed giving the states. Multi-state firms feared having to operate under 50 
different sets of rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Another example was the Catholic Health Assn., which operates more than 1,200 
medical facilities and was one of the strongest advocates of universal 
coverage. But it also was one of the staunchest foes of including abortion 
coverage in a standard benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 Other groups that had much to gain from the plan remained silent, hanging back 
and hoping to gain greater bargaining leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable was the American Assn. of Retired Persons, whose members 
would have benefited greatly from coverage for long-term care and outpatient 
prescription drugs, both proposed by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But the AARP's leadership was so mindful of the firestorm that followed 
congressional approval of catastrophic insurance legislation several years ago, 
it resisted repeated personal overtures from Clinton to support his plan. By 
the time the organization finally signed on, the effort was already on the 
brink of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 In the words of one frustrated Democratic senator, many of the groups that 
were supposed to have supported the bill proved to be "a complete, miserable 
failure." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was not true of the opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health Insurance Assn. of America, many of whose members faced possible 
bankruptcy under a Clinton-type reform plan if alliances of business succeeded 
in squeezing them, launched a successful ad campaign that raised doubts about 
the President's agenda. "Harry" and "Louise," the characters in those ads, 
became the symbols of the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the HIAA shared many of Clinton's other goals, such as the 
employer mandate and universal coverage. Congress 
</P>
<P>
 Congress itself proved to be a moving target. Last year, more than 20 
Republican senators backed a bill that promised to achieve universal coverage 
by requiring people to buy it themselves if their employer did not. Among the 
co-sponsors was Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who now supports 
significantly scaled-back legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has repeatedly complained about Republican fickleness. And in an 
interview with reporters in August, Hillary Clinton fumed: "Every time this 
Administration and those members of Congress who really understand the health 
care reform debate have been willing to accept some modifications, the 
opposition has moved further away. . . . I think we're still dealing with smoke 
and mirrors." 
</P>
<P>
 But lawmakers also say the White House team had little feel for the 
intricacies of the congressional process, and a lousy sense of timing. Some 
second-guessers note, for instance, that Clinton might have had a deal with 
Dole if he had compromised earlier on his bottom-line demand of universal 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others say that by offering such a detailed plan, the White House gave 
Congress little option but to dismantle it. It would have been far better, they 
say, to have followed the strategy embraced by Ronald Reagan in 1986 to secure 
passage of his sweeping tax-overhaul plan: Spell out broad goals, and let 
Congress figure out how to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 All sides also admit that they underestimated the degree to which the federal 
budget deficit would drive the debate in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The survival of every proposal hinged on winning a favorable assessment from 
the understaffed Congressional Budget Office. Not only did it slow down the 
process -- indeed, both the House and Senate are still waiting on numbers -- 
but it added a constraint that Roosevelt never had to face on Social Security, 
or Lyndon B. Johnson on Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering how much more expensive those programs have become, compared to 
how they were first imagined, there is a sound argument to be made for a 
thorough economic analysis before embarking on another one. At the same time, 
however, it raises questions about the extent to which economics can strangle 
any ambitious policy in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the tail wagging the dog," grumbled one Democratic senator. The Country 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps none of these obstacles would have mattered had public support for a 
comprehensive overhaul of the health care system remained strong. But the more 
people learned about the cost of change, the less certain they were that they 
wanted to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Clinton discovered the issue, Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) had made health 
care reform the centerpiece of his own unsuccessful 1992 presidential campaign. 
But he acknowledged: "There's a price, and I think in part people are 
discovering that." 
</P>
<P>
 An improving economy, moreover, made middle-class workers less fearful of 
losing their job and being thrust onto the street without health coverage. So 
what once was seen as a means of addressing the fears of everyone is now 
largely viewed as a program that will benefit America's have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
 In that vein, Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton University professor of political 
economics, has a harsh assessment: "Universal coverage is not in the soul of 
the American people, or at least in those who represent them." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a hardhearted nation. That's what it is," he added. "We have all this 
money for you and me . . . but we can't help these low-income working stiffs. 
We're writing off the lower middle class. That's who we're writing off. We're 
basically telling them: 'Take a walk.' That's hardhearted."

70,000 RALLY IN MEXICO TO PROTEST VOTE FRAUD; LATIN AMERICA: OPPOSITION LEADER 
CALLS FOR CAMPAIGN TO PROVE ABUSES. 'THE STRUGGLE IS NOT OVER,' HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 70,000 angry Mexicans packed the capital's historic zocalo Saturday 
to back opposition presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' call for a 
national crusade to prove last Sunday's elections were fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest came as the official results were released, confirming that 
Ernesto Zedillo and his long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party won with 
less than half of the largest vote in Mexican history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The struggle is not over," Cardenas shouted before a sea of flags, banners 
and signs in the shadow of the presidential palace. "The Aug. 21 elections came 
and went, and we still don't know the results of the election. Today, we cannot 
declare victory, but neither can we recognize the victory of anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd roared, chanting, "The people are tired of compromise" and "Perfect 
dictatorship, perfect fraud." Others simply painted the words "No Fraud" on 
their cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as a barometer of popular dissent after federal elections that were to 
be a watershed of Mexican democracy and change, the rally was five times the 
size of a similar Cardenas protest in the same downtown plaza Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday's peaceful gathering was about half the size of Cardenas' 
protests in the aftermath of the 1988 elections, when many Mexicans felt that 
Cardenas clearly had been cheated out of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's official results from the Federal Electoral Institute confirmed 
that Zedillo was the first PRI candidate since the governing party came to 
power in 1929 to fail to win a majority of the vote. The 42-year-old 
Yale-educated economist drew 48.87% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Against that backdrop, the size of Saturday's protest that filled the zocalo 
-- and smaller demonstrations denouncing electoral fraud elsewhere in the 
country -- represented a potentially potent force to push Zedillo into carrying 
out promises of vast government and ruling party reform during a six-year term 
that will take Mexico into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The tallies announced by the quasi-independent electoral institute gave 
second-place Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party (PAN) 
26.09% of the vote. Cardenas and his Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) won 
16.42%, with six candidates from smaller parties splitting the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Nunez, director general of the electoral institute, said those 
"definitive results" were from 291 of the nation's 300 electoral districts and 
89,731 of the 96,394 precincts, or a total of 92.9% of Mexico's unprecedented 
77.5% voter turnout. The handful of remaining ballots, a commission source 
said, will be confirmed by the end of today but will not substantially change 
the result. 
</P>
<P>
 From the stage in the zocalo -- beneath a banner proclaiming "For dignity! For 
electoral cleansing!" -- Cardenas attempted to detail what he called extensive 
fraud that cast doubt on all the electoral commission's results. 
</P>
<P>
 In rural areas and impoverished neighborhoods of the capital, he said, entire 
precincts became ruling party "voter carousels" where local party officials 
used intimidation and threats to sway the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 One 40-year-old poll watcher in Saturday's crowd said she and other 
pro-Cardenas observers watched powerlessly as local political bosses 
manufactured votes and threatened them with violence if they protested. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some such abuses were confirmed by independent Mexican poll watchers 
and international visitors authorized to witness the election, most said they 
did not believe they affected an outcome in which Zedillo won nearly double the 
votes of his closest rival. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cardenas continued to attack the electoral process itself Saturday. In 
describing what Western experts on Mexican democracy have called "an uneven 
playing field," he attacked the ruling party bias of television and radio 
stations that depend upon the government for their broadcast concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas also asserted that, despite attempts by President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari to enact campaign financing reforms before the elections, one ruling 
party senatorial candidate from the capital spent in a single campaign the same 
amount Cardenas' PRD spent nationwide for all its campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great mobilization is necessary to gather documented proof, records, 
altered ballots, missing ballots and testimony from various districts of each 
electoral crime committed," Cardenas declared, indicating the opposition's 
frustration in documenting its week-old claim of massive fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are organizing truth committees in each city, town, neighborhood, barrio, 
collective farm and in each of our universities. Send your information and your 
protests to our campaign headquarters." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cardenas stressed that the post-election protest campaign must be 
peaceful. "We do not want violence," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Understand well," he shouted to deafening applause, "we are not looking for 
power at any price. We want a Mexico without lies, a Mexico without a party of 
the state, without corruption . . . (but) the illegality can be overcome only 
if we adhere to the rigor of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 In reflecting how he now views his post-election role, Cardenas added, "I have 
an obligation to defend, through all legal resources, the legality of the 
entire electoral process, as I would my candidacy and my own election." 
</P>
<P>
 That, perhaps more than any other statement during his hourlong address, 
expressed the frustration that drew many into the zocalo on Saturday. From 
peasants to business leaders, they viewed the rally as a final resort before 
accepting the ruling party's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the forgotten ones," shouted a weather-beaten peasant farmer in a 
stained straw hat who identified himself as Alfredo from the state of 
Michoacan. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell us we have to be calm. I say, 'No!' We can't bear any more of this 
calm. We, we are campesinos , and we're working to bring our products here to 
the markets, and all the middlemen prevent us from selling. . . . Where is the 
calm? We prefer to die sitting still rather than getting dragged on the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
 But few were under the illusion that Saturday's protest would have much 
immediate impact on the system that has governed their lives for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," economist Javier Angel answered flatly, cradling his 18-month-old 
daughter under an umbrella in the afternoon sun, when asked if he believed the 
demonstration would change the election result. "I think many people are here 
because they believe that. But there's really nothing that can be done at this 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did we come? To support Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. More than anything else, 
though, it was to learn what was missing from these elections."

'QUAKE KIDS' CAN'T SHAKE LOOSE FINAL WIN

 Rocked by an earthquake seven months ago, a group of Northridge youngsters 
were thwarted by Mother Nature again Saturday with a rain delay and then by 
sizzling fastballs as their team lost the Little League World Series to 
Venezuela, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The squad from Maracaibo outscored Northridge in a tense game before 35,000 
spectators and thousands of television viewers in Los Angeles who watched a 
live national broadcast that sent emotions reeling from anticipation to hope 
and, finally, disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel terrible," said Debra Gray, tears in her eyes as she sat in the 
Presidente Mexican restaurant in Northridge, where scores of residents -- 
including parents of other children in the league -- crowded together to watch 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they did great. They're the national champions. . . . There's not enough 
thanks we can give to the kids for what they did for our community." 
</P>
<P>
 At the 35er sports bar in Pasadena, downcast patrons filed out quickly after 
the defeat. "They were upset for the kids," a bartender said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame," said Paul Hendison, a Hollywood marketing consultant who 
watched the game at the Legends sports bar in Santa Monica. "It was terrific 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss capped a remarkable odyssey for the "Earthquake Kids" from 
Northridge, who have captured the imagination of baseball fans nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the players and their families were displaced by the Northridge 
earthquake. One of the boys has yet to move back into his home. But the young 
athletes remained committed to their sport, gathering steam and a passel of 
victories and admirers on the way to their field of dreams in Williamsport. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurels and roses have already been strewn in the paths of the players, 
described Saturday as "matinee idols" by one sports commentator. Southland 
media outlets and corporations have clamored for their attention, and the city 
of Los Angeles has a parade and rally planned for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game Saturday, as the Venezuelan players swarmed onto the field and 
cried for joy, Northridge catcher Matt Cunningham congratulated his opponents 
and looked for a silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
 "That team is a great team," he said. "They played their game; we played our 
game. They beat us. . . . We're U.S.A. champions. . . . We've gone as far as we 
wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss took the coveted world title away from the United States and Southern 
California, which won the series in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 With superior pitching and hitting, the South American team stopped a dream 
run for the Northridge crew. Until the defeat, the San Fernando Valley boys -- 
who signed up for the league just two weeks after the 6.8-magnitude January 
temblor -- had won 20 of 21 games in five tournaments across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Their victories culminated Thursday with a shutout win over a Virginia team 
for the U.S. title. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Maracaibo squad, also impressive in its earlier wins, was led by 
pitcher Cesar Hidalgo, whose fastball stymied many of the Northridge players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pitcher was good. . . . He was tough to hit," said Northridge manager 
Larry Baca. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides went scoreless for two innings before thunder, lightning and 
heavy rain -- more than three inches -- stopped play for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 When the game resumed, the Northridge team seemed to have lost some of its 
momentum. In the third and fourth innings, the boys gave up two runs as the 
South Americans came on strong. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a partisan crowd -- including members of the three American teams 
Northridge defeated on its way to the final -- chanting, "U.S.A., U.S.A.," the 
Earthquake Kids rumbled back, tying the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters' euphoria evaporated in the fifth inning, however, after Venezuela 
scored two more runs to make it 4-2. A glimmer of hope for the Northridge team 
shone in the bottom of the fifth when right fielder Spencer Gordon knocked out 
a solo home run. 
</P>
<P>
 But no runs were scored in the sixth and last inning by either side, leaving a 
4-3 final tally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge players, dejected in their sky-blue jerseys, sat silent for a 
few moments. They then shook hands with their Maracaibo opponents, who earned 
Latin America its first World Series title since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 At dawn Monday, radio station KRTH will send stretch limousines to the boys' 
homes to collect them for an on-the-air talk with Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda 
and Mayor Richard Riordan. Afterward, Disneyland will give them their own 
parade at the theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday afternoon, the city will stage its celebration: a parade and rally. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Sharmie Drake is concerned, it's recognition well-deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the U.S. champs," said Drake, the mother of reserve player Scott 
(Scooter) Drake Jr. "They are truly our boys of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids gave a championship to a city that has been through so much, and 
they've done it with so much enthusiasm." 
</P>

U.S., CUBA AGREE TO HOLD CRISIS TALKS; CARIBBEAN: MEETINGS PLANNED FOR N.Y., 
PROBABLY THIS WEEK. NATIONS STILL DISAGREE ON SCOPE, AS HAVANA PUSHES FOR A 
BIGGER AGENDA. WASHINGTON WILL LIMIT IT TO MIGRATION. 
</P>

<P>
 The governments of the United States and Cuba announced Saturday that they 
have agreed to hold talks in New York on the immigration crisis that has sent 
thousands of Cuban refugees onto makeshift rafts heading for Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. and Cuban officials disagreed on what the scope of the talks should 
be, with Washington insisting they will focus only on bringing immigration 
under control and Havana saying they should lead to normalizing relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings, which will probably be held this week, were requested last 
Wednesday by the Clinton Administration, and agreed to by Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro on Friday, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The talks will deal with issues related to the promotion of legal, orderly 
and safe migration," said State Department spokesman Michael McCurry. "This 
will not be a back door into a broader dialogue with Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team at the talks will be headed by a middle-level official, Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State Michael Skol, aides said. "He will be instructed 
not to engage on those (broader) issues," said one senior official. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and his aides have been adamant in insisting that they will 
not agree to Castro's requests for talks on lifting U.S. economic sanctions 
against Cuba or establishing normal relations with the communist regime, 
especially under the pressure of thousands of refugees taking flight. 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for Castro's government said Cuba still wants the broader 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Havana reported by the Reuters news agency, Cuban 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso said the two governments had found "a 
point of coincidence" over the immigration talks, but added that otherwise, 
relations with the United States are "tense." 
</P>
<P>
 He complained that new U.S. economic measures against Cuba were a "turning of 
the screw." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said that when the immigration talks begin, they intend to ask 
Castro's government to do more to control the number of refugees setting out to 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are interested in steps that the Cuban government can take to discourage 
their citizens from taking steps that put them at great risk," McCurry said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he noted that the Administration will not ask Castro to use his repressive 
police forces to stop the emigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, U.S. officials will encourage Cuba to continue warning its 
citizens that under the new refugee policy, Cubans who take to the sea will not 
be allowed into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro's government has already been cooperating in getting that message 
across -- to an extent that has surprised some U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Granma, the Communist Party newspaper, printed a notice from the U.S. 
government last week, explaining that Cubans picked up at sea would not be 
allowed into the United States and urging would-be refugees to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cuban authorities have made no apparent effort to jam U.S. government 
radio broadcasts that have been pushing the same message, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, one official said, Cuba has already agreed to U.S. requests to take 
back some refugees who decided to return home after they discovered that they 
would not be taken to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Havana agreed that 226 refugees being held at the Guantanamo Bay 
Naval Base could return to Cuba. "There will probably be a growing number in 
that category," one U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials do not want to claim success yet, but they hope their 
explanations of the new U.S. policy have gotten through to ordinary Cubans and 
will gradually choke off the supply of boat people -- just as a similar policy 
change did in the case of Haiti last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard reported that it had rescued only 130 Cubans on Saturday, a 
dramatic drop-off. But much of the decline was clearly attributable to bad 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to wait to see if it's more than that," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two leading U.S. senators, including a powerful Republican, said Clinton 
should agree to Castro's request for broader talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're opening the door to Vietnam and North Korea, what in the world are 
we doing not talking to this guy?" Senate Minority Whip Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) 
asked on CNN's "Newsmaker Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Administration makes a mistake in saying they are not willing to have 
some direct discussions with Castro," agreed Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.). 
"He's a reality."

NEWS ANALYSIS; AS SIMPSON TRIAL NEARS, STRATEGIES BECOME A GAMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With just over three weeks left before the scheduled start of O.J. Simpson's 
murder trial, a rapid-fire series of developments has brought the case into 
sharper focus, narrowing some of the options for defense attorneys and forcing 
both sides to gamble as they build their trial strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last week alone, several of the building blocks have been set in place 
in the case against Simpson, who has proclaimed his innocence in the face of 
charges that he murdered his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend 
Ronald Lyle Goldman. Each new development subtly alters the emerging strategies 
of the two sides, which are moving at breakneck speed to bring the case to 
trial Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy considerations are complex, in part because the case is moving to 
trial before all the evidence has been gathered and analyzed. Moreover, the 
high level of publicity creates an especially tricky situation for Simpson's 
attorneys, who are conducting the delicate dual task of trying to challenge 
every potential weakness in the government case without signaling to 
prospective jurors that they are in any way desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a very, very real concern to us," Robert L. Shapiro, Simpson's lead 
attorney, said in an interview Saturday. "As lawyers we have a legal obligation 
to raise all legal and factual issues as they are presented. There is a risk 
that members of the public who do not have a complete understanding of our 
obligation will think that this is some sort of diversionary tactic." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the recent developments shaping strategy for both sides are revelations 
that the latest round of DNA tests points to Simpson as the source of a blood 
drop at the scene of the killings and that hair samples from a knit cap 
discovered near the bodies resemble Simpson's. An eagerly awaited ruling from 
Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito on Friday also cleared the way for 
prosecutors to go ahead with their DNA testing, a setback for defense attorneys 
that some experts nevertheless believe may ultimately work in Simpson's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense has scored most of its points by relentlessly attacking the 
government case -- detectives have been accused of lying, prosecutors of 
deceiving, and analysts of performing slipshod work. That may be undermining 
the confidence that prospective jurors have in the evidence, legal analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts credit Simpson's defense team with vigorously contesting the 
government lawyers at every opportunity and with using the pretrial hearings to 
erode the sense that police and prosecutors have built an open-and-shut case 
against the former football star. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's their job," Barry Levin, a criminal defense lawyer and former Los 
Angeles police officer, said of the defense camp. "They have to watchdog the 
government case and to challenge it at every turn." 
</P>
<P>
 All that is true in every criminal case. But part of what makes the coming 
Simpson trial different is that the football Hall of Famer's legal team is 
conducting its work under the eyes of a nation seemingly unable to tear itself 
away from the legal drama unfolding in Ito's courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes the all-out attack strategy an especially risky one, some legal 
experts say, because observers may grow weary of the challenges to witnesses 
and come to conclude that Simpson's lawyers are prepared to vilify anyone who 
offers evidence against their client. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even to me, as a defense attorney, it seems that they look more and more like 
they're defending a guilty guy," lawyer Harland W. Braun said. "That's 
something they need to be careful about." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Levenson, a Loyola Law School professor and former federal prosecutor, 
agreed the defense approach could send inadvertent messages to potential 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's always the danger of the shotgun defense," she said. "It seems hard to 
believe that everyone associated with the case made a mistake or is out to get 
O.J. Simpson. It's contrary to your common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the most recent developments in the Simpson case have largely gone 
against him, courtroom victories often break two ways, and legal experts 
predicted some of the prosecution triumphs in recent days could work in 
Simpson's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 By winning the right to begin DNA testing at a Berkeley lab, prosecutors 
headed off a likely defense challenge to the test results. Simpson's DNA 
experts have previously challenged tests done by Cellmark Diagnostics in 
Maryland -- where most of the samples have been sent -- and have suggested that 
they are preparing to do the same in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's ruling makes that more difficult because a state Department of Justice 
lab will conduct its own tests. If those tests confirm the Cellmark findings, 
it will be much harder for Simpson's lawyers to contend that the findings are 
the result of laboratory errors. 
</P>
<P>
 But sending the samples out to two labs is, in one respect, a risky gambit by 
prosecutors. The two labs could produce inconsistent findings, and that would 
open a hole in the government case that Simpson's attorneys would be sure to 
exploit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a chance one takes when one submits evidence to two different 
experts," said Milton Grimes, an Orange County defense attorney who has handled 
numerous capital murder cases and who represented beating victim Rodney G. King 
in his lawsuit against Los Angeles. "They could get some inconsistency." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some experts believe that the Simpson defense team was lucky not to 
win its motion seeking access to half the blood samples, a point the attorneys 
aggressively contested for weeks. If the defense had won that motion, they 
would have received blood evidence that they could have subjected to their own 
DNA testing. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if the results had mirrored the prosecution findings? Defense 
attorneys would not have been obligated to present that evidence in court, but 
they would almost certainly have faced a barrage of questions from the media 
about failure to disclose the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the defense, faced with difficult-to-explain DNA results thus far, 
has subtly shifted its approach, de-emphasizing its attacks on the Cellmark lab 
and focusing instead on the Police Department employees who collected the 
evidence. The hearings last week gave defense attorneys a chance to question 
some of those workers and yielded a few nuggets that could help Simpson's case 
when it comes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the police employees admitted to mislabeling one sample, while another 
testified that the Simpson case was only the third time she had ever collected 
crime scene evidence in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're seeing is that the defense strategy appears to be to argue that 
at every stage of this case, there was either mishandling of the evidence or 
unfairness to O.J. Simpson," said Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC professor of 
criminal law. "That means they have to find as many opportunities as possible 
to make that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., Simpson's other lead counsel, agreed, adding that the 
hearings have allowed defense lawyers to learn of mistakes in the case that 
they otherwise might never have known about. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are skirmishes getting ready for the main attraction," he said 
Saturday. "We have to do everything we can to preserve our client's right to a 
fair trial, and we found out some interesting things at these hearings. We 
didn't win all our motions, but we learned some things. That helps us." 
</P>
<P>
 And whatever the risks, Cochran said, he and his colleagues intend to press 
ahead with their aggressive defense strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, they will be back in court to argue for access to police personnel 
records and other documents that they hope will undermine the credibility of 
the detectives at the center of the LAPD investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The coming weeks will see a string of issues debated that will set the final 
parameters for the Simpson trial, defining what evidence jurors will be allowed 
to hear and what weight they may attach to various clues. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular interest is a sure-to-be-contentious debate over the 
admissibility and significance of any DNA test results that the prosecution 
hopes to use as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 If the final results of those tests point to Simpson as the likely source of 
blood found at the crime scene, prosecutors would vigorously argue that the 
jury needs to hear that. Simpson's attorneys would almost certainly respond by 
suggesting that the evidence was so mishandled that it should not be allowed 
into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be up to Ito to decide how much DNA evidence is admissible and what 
statistical information the jury will get to hear about it. For instance, if 
the blood drops "match" Simpson's blood, what are the odds that the drops could 
have come from someone else? Are they 1 in 100, a relatively modest statistic 
that would leave tens of thousands of Southern Californians as possible 
sources? Or are they 1 in 1 million? Or even greater? 
</P>
<P>
 Although those questions could form the backbone of the case, other highly 
significant issues will be hammered out in the coming weeks. The prosecution 
may seek to introduce evidence about the sometimes stormy relationship between 
Simpson and his ex-wife. They may seek court permission to introduce a 911 tape 
in which Nicole Simpson called police to protect her from a man she identified 
as her angry ex-husband. And they may ask for permission to tell the jury about 
what Simpson said to police when he was questioned the day after the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Simpson's attorneys will attempt to have the evidence seized 
at Simpson's home excluded from the case. They allege that evidence was 
gathered illegally because, they say, police improperly searched the property 
without a warrant and lied in the affidavit later used to obtain a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys also will probe the histories of the officers and the other 
investigators, and they are expected to attack the reliability of the Los 
Angeles County coroner's examination of the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Those issues and others will define the limits of the coming trial, and many 
of them will be hotly contested. On Saturday, attorneys for both sides were at 
work, busily preparing for Monday's hearing and beyond.

CAMP LIMA: FASTEST GROWING AMERICAN CITY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two days ago, the city of sepia tents sloping toward the sea was a field of 
tall grass. Now, the soldiers call it Camp Lima. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday afternoon, U.S. troops occupying this 45-square-mile slice of 
American soil on communist-ruled Cuba had hoisted enough tents at Camp Lima to 
house 2,670 more rafters fleeing their country in an exodus to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 They were already at work converting the base's rifle range into another tent 
city. When that's done, they will start pitching tents on the camp golf course, 
a links once so plush that generals used to fly down from the Pentagon to play 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 So goes the U.S. military ground operation in the latest foreign crisis to 
confront the Clinton Administration: the tense stalemate with Cuban leader 
Fidel Castro that has touched off the biggest flight of refugees in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In just six days, roughly 14,000 Cubans have been fished from the sea and 
transported in Coast Guard cutters and Navy ships here. On Saturday alone, 
2,200 Cubans were processed into the instant detention camps, and were given 
cots, bedrolls and military rations. At least 1,000 more are still at sea and 
destined to arrive here, including 130 Cubans picked up from the Florida 
Straits on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it is over, as many as 45,000 Cubans will be housed at Guantanamo Bay 
Naval Base, perhaps indefinitely, according to Administration officials. They 
are the offspring of President Clinton's move to end a 28-year "open door" 
policy toward Cuban refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, this naval base, first leased from Cuba during the Franklin D. 
Roosevelt Administration, is being converted overnight from a training facility 
into a holding station for would-be refugees from two troubled Caribbean island 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two months before the Cuban crisis erupted, Guantanamo Bay housed 
nearly 18,000 Haitian refugees who fled their country's military junta. About 
14,300 Haitians remain in the tent cities here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the mayor of the fastest-growing city in America, with the biggest 
unemployment and the worst housing," said Gen. Michael Williams, commander of 
the joint task force charged with running the camps. "If I were a politician, 
I'd be out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate the remaking of Guantanamo Bay, the commander of the Atlantic 
Fleet issued an order late Friday to evacuate the base's 2,200 military family 
members and nonessential personnel to havens in the United States. The 
evacuation, which will begin Wednesday, will reduce the base's normal 
population of 5,500 by about 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 But every American who returns stateside to make room at Guantanamo Bay will 
be replaced by a dozen or more refugees, some of whom appear content to take up 
residence anywhere as long as it's not Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them arrived early Saturday aboard the guided-missile frigate Jack 
Williams, which unloaded its human cargo about 6:30 a.m. local time. Although 
all of the refugees were from Cuba, the faces that stared down from the ship's 
deck displayed expressions common to refugees anywhere -- exhaustion, hunger, 
fear, confusion, relief. 
</P>
<P>
 They had been aboard the Jack Williams for two days. No one knows how many 
days they had been at sea before that as they headed for Florida aboard rafts, 
inner tubes, dinghies and slabs of Styrofoam. There were babies, children and 
women among them, but the majority were young men. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jack Williams was the first of four ships that would bring refugees ashore 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three representatives of the U.S. Justice Department -- Tina Balin, Mike 
Carroll and Alex Gordon -- waited on shore to tell the 797 Cubans aboard the 
vessel that they would not be going to the United States -- at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is what we try to emphasize," Balin said. "But most of the time, the 
Cubans don't seem to understand that." Many believe that they will only be at 
Guantanamo Bay as long as it takes to be "processed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Balin has gone through this ritual every day since Monday, delivering the bad 
news to about 11,000 Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is looking for other countries that might offer them haven, 
Balin tells them. And anyone who wants to return to Cuba voluntarily can do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "No!" they shout back. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. troops here, many of them barely adults, are clearly moved by some of 
the stories they hear with the arrival of each new ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days ago, the Whidbey Island docked with 2,300 rafters aboard. Among them 
were five Cuban doctors and three nurses, including a heart surgeon, who 
quickly joined the ship's medical team to tend to the sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Whidbey Island turned out to sea again later that day, its captain 
asked the Cuban doctors and nurses if they would be willing to remain on board 
as part of the crew. All of them readily agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other Cubans on board the Whidbey Island was the island's top-ranked 
baseball catcher, a seven-time world champion wrestler and a science-fiction 
writer whose only possession was his latest manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised by the number of children, and even babies," Cmdr. William 
Hawn, captain of the Jack Williams, said as he got off the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Cuban tent cities, a remarkable number of residents are white-collar 
professionals, including lawyers, engineers and professors. In Alpha Camp, for 
example, there are 26 doctors. Many of them apparently set out before Clinton 
eliminated the open-door refugee policy that would have assured them safe 
passage to America. 
</P>
<P>
 Would they have come had they known they would be put in camps, perhaps for 
years? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, No!" said Angel Rodriguez Montalvan, a machine worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had known I would end up here, I would not have taken that trip," said 
Irma Morttiz, a 29-year-old English professor at the University of Havana. "I 
just hope President Clinton changes his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynoldo Valido, a high-school English teacher who was elected leader of Alpha 
Camp, left Cuba the day before Clinton's policy change was announced. But even 
if he had known about the change, he said, he is not sure it would have stopped 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Cubans in these camps seem to find it inconceivable they might 
have to stay here for years, sleeping on cots, 40 to a tent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years? That cannot be," said Dr. Jesus Nulet, an orthopedic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the camp has no post office to serve refugees, so they have no way to 
contact friends or family members in either the United States or Cuba to let 
them know they have landed at Guantanamo Bay instead of perishing in the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds hold out their hands to visiting journalists, waving letters they 
want someone to send for them or slips of paper with phone numbers of 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the U.S. soldiers who must cope with this human tide have two 
priorities: getting their own family members out of Guantanamo Bay and back to 
the United States, and erecting enough tents to accommodate each day's surge of 
new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Many soldiers volunteered to work on their day off Saturday to build the new 
tent city at the rifle range. "We're trying to stay one cot ahead of the 
Cubans," said Navy Cmdr. Alan Dooley. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the arriving Cubans are making the job somewhat easier. When soldiers 
asked if any refugees would help build encampments, many quickly volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
 And the work goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 This story has been filed as part of the Pentagon press pool in Guantanamo 
Bay.

SOUTH-CENTRAL PITFALLS WITH SCHOLARSHIP AND NAACP HONOR.

<P>
 Behind the double-locked doors of his family's South-Central Los Angeles home, 
Tim McDuffy spent hours pounding on a makeshift drum set of old buckets, phone 
books and couch cushions. 
</P>
<P>
 If he hit hard enough, he could drown out the drive-bys. He could numb the 
sorrow he felt over rarely seeing his father. He could shatter the isolation 
that engulfed him in a neighborhood where many teen-agers drifted into gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so full of hurt," McDuffy remembered. "There was so much confusion. . . 
. I was trying to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 He copied the rhythms of his mother's gospel albums, banging until his ears 
rang. Eventually, he scrounged together a well-used drum set and began to 
transform his unstructured pounding into music. 
</P>
<P>
 Always, in the back of his mind, there was the hope -- a million-to-one shot 
-- that somehow his drumming would lead him away from a place where drug 
addicts smoked crack in the alley outside his bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it has. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years after he began playing, the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People has named McDuffy, 18, one of the most talented minority youths 
in America. What's more, he has earned a full music scholarship to a small 
college in Nebraska, where he will attend class this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to always say to Timmy, 'Reach as high as you can. I don't think there 
is anything that is impossible for you, if you really set your sights on it,' " 
recalled his mother, Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 McDuffy's story is the kind that often gets lost amid the tide of crime and 
poverty in his South-Central neighborhood, less than a mile away from Florence 
and Normandie, one of the flash points of the 1992 riots. But it is more than a 
story of one boy's perseverance against the odds. It is also an example of how 
a life can be profoundly changed when people care enough to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McDuffy was never considered a prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
 In junior high school, his teachers believed his quiet demeanor was only a 
mask that hid a simmering temper. His drumming was dismissed, at first, as just 
the clangorous noise of an angry boy. But after McDuffy began playing in the 
school band, few could deny that the youngster was driven by desire, not anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd get up on stage and play a lot of fast stuff," McDuffy explained. "I made 
them notice me." 
</P>
<P>
 At the suggestion of his eighth-grade band teacher, he tried out for the 
Hamilton High School Academy of Music -- the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's prestigious "Fame" school for the arts. McDuffy's only other option 
was to attend his neighborhood school, Crenshaw High, where the band program 
was virtually nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hamilton officials notified McDuffy that he had been accepted to the 
highly competitive school, the teen-ager was both stunned and elated. At that 
moment, when he had expected so little, he had been handed the most important 
opportunity of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took full advantage of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Sears, a percussion teacher at Hamilton, still remembers McDuffy's 
determination. "He came ready to learn," Sears said. "As musicians would say, 
he has 'got a thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Before sunrise every school morning, McDuffy would catch an RTD bus to 
Hamilton High, about 15 miles from South-Central in a working-class 
neighborhood off Robertson Boulevard. He would get home late in the evening, 
after a day packed with hours of study and practice. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the gangly, soft-spoken youth learned to watch his back as he 
navigated the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In McDuffy's neighborhood there is little neutral territory for a young boy 
who resists the seductive pull of gangs. Those who venture out alone, without 
the protection of their homeboys, embark on a dangerous journey. 
</P>
<P>
 When McDuffy walked home from the bus, he never acted too smart or smug. If 
gang members asked what "set" he belonged to, he just replied: "I'm not with no 
set, man. I don't want no trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he tried to keep his mind on school, it was hard to shut out the 
darker realities of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Within four years, his family moved five times in a quest for someplace safe 
and affordable. In the midst of all this, his mother, a school bus driver, 
suffered a heart attack and then a stroke at age 48, making it impossible for 
her to work. With welfare as the family's sole support, they ate only rice and 
beans some weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 McDuffy, the youngest of six children, found little male guidance. He saw his 
father, a Gardena locksmith, maybe every six months, he said. To cope with his 
pain, he would lie about their relationship to the other students at school, 
making up stories about all the things he and his father would do together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never sure if he loved me or not," McDuffy said. "It's something that 
still hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 While his oldest brother turned to drugs, McDuffy fought the temptation, which 
was always close at hand. "I had a friend who sold drugs and stuff," McDuffy 
said. "He would say to me, 'Come on, you could make a lot of money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But McDuffy's conscience -- and the fear of what his mother would say if he 
stumbled -- would always prevail. "It was like a devil on one side and an angel 
on the other side," he said. "The angel told me it wasn't real cool (to get 
involved with drugs)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For refuge, he sought the safety of Hamilton's music lab, the one place where 
he could envelop himself in the sweet sounds of rhythm and blues and jazz. As 
McDuffy got better on the drums, he taught himself how to play the piano and 
started writing songs. 
</P>
<P>
 To make a few bucks, he would accompany an organist during Sunday services at 
a South-Central church. The gigs usually brought in $50 a day, enough to help 
out his mom and buy a few extras for himself. "Don't tell anyone, but that was 
a boring job," McDuffy confided. "But it was a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Most weekend evenings, McDuffy and his best friend from Hamilton would go to 
the World Stage Performance Gallery, a small storefront near Vernon Avenue and 
Crenshaw Boulevard where musicians from throughout the area gathered. 
</P>
<P>
 The dimly lit alcove, with a church-like atmosphere, was the perfect hangout 
for McDuffy and Marcus Coleman, a piano student who also came from 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 A piano and drums were already set up on the stage. All the boys had to do was 
show up and play. The two teen-agers would jam with half a dozen or more other 
musicians until the early hours of the morning and then return the next evening 
for more. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a brotherhood there," McDuffy said. "It was an almost spiritual 
type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, Ndugu Chancler, a prominent Los Angeles drummer who has played 
with music greats such as Miles Davis, Santana and Frank Sinatra, would stop by 
to check out the scene. He spotted McDuffy immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The shy teen-ager reminded Chancler a little of himself when he was young -- a 
kid who played with heart but who needed direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancler, 41, gave McDuffy a few tips on how to improve his technique and 
encouraged him to attend a percussion camp in Charleston, Ill., in the summer 
of 1992. When McDuffy said he could not afford the air fare, Chancler raised 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I thought he was just being nice by giving me a few tips," McDuffy 
said. "Then I started to realize what was going on. When we talked for a while, 
I found out we had similar backgrounds. We both grew up in the same 
neighborhood. We both had the same relationships with our parents. We had so 
much in common." 
</P>
<P>
 Chancler, who was touched by the teen-ager, knew what was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really rode him hard, I mean really hard," Chancler said. "Without music, 
Tim would probably be dead on the corner or he would be out talking cool, mad 
at the world with no direction. It's a cold reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Together with the boy's mother, Chancler screened McDuffy's friends and 
demanded that he keep up his grades. Meanwhile, Chancler spent hours teaching 
his protege new rhythms, making sure the youngster had good equipment so that 
nothing could stand in his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, McDuffy developed the kind of confidence that sometimes distinguishes 
the dreamers from the doers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hanging out with Ndugu, I realized that I could actually have a career as a 
musician, one who writes and produces also," McDuffy said, adding that he came 
to realize that the next step for him was college. 
</P>
<P>
 McDuffy wanted to go to USC, but his 2.8 grade point average was not good 
enough. So he applied to Chadron State College in Nebraska, where Chancler had 
a friend who ran the music program. McDuffy, one of only half a dozen people on 
his mother's side of the family to ever go to college, was offered a full 
scholarship to the 2,000-student school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was probably the proudest time for me when he got his full scholarship," 
Chancler said. "I've got a nickname for him. I call him 'Full Ride.' It's the 
name of a cymbal I play, and now it is also synonymous with his full ride to 
Chadron." 
</P>
<P>
 For one final challenge before leaving for college, McDuffy decided to enter 
the NAACP's 1994 Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics 
in Chicago in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't want to go at first," said his friend Coleman. "I said: 'Man, there 
are going to be girls there.' He said: 'OK, I'm going.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The two youths spent an evening at McDuffy's house writing their pieces for 
the music composition category of the competition. Using borrowed electronic 
equipment from Hamilton, they recorded their tunes onto cassette tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 McDuffy put together a light jazz song, called "Ebony Eyes," for a cheerleader 
he had a crush on. "I guess it was just a product of my emotions more than 
anything else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDuffy and Coleman each played their tapes for a panel of judges early in the 
weeklong competition, attended by hundreds of high school students from across 
the country. The rest of the time, they mingled and partied, never expecting to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 At the awards ceremony, the announcer had to say McDuffy's name twice before 
the teen-ager realized his composition had taken the grand prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called my name and I didn't believe it," McDuffy said. "When you are up 
against 200 other people from all over the country, you are going to be a 
little skeptical." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with being touted as one of the most talent minority youths in America, 
McDuffy also won a computer and $1,000. "Winning told me that I could really do 
this," he said. "It made me feel a whole lot better about things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McDuffy came back from the competition last month and started packing for 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 He crammed into a trunk an array of black tennis shoes and baggy shorts -- 
popular Los Angeles street clothes that, admittedly, might look a little out of 
place in the tiny college town. 
</P>
<P>
 He dug out a few sweaters from the back of his closet and promised his mother 
that he would buy a new coat once the weather turns cold in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, he left Los Angeles at sunrise for a place he had only seen in 
pictures. Once he arrived in Chadron, he called home to tell his mother how 
pretty it was there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's grass and fields of corn," he said. "It's so different than L.A. 
That's what I want, for a while anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, he hopes to return and work in the music industry, writing and 
producing songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had these big dreams, you know?" McDuffy said. "Now my dreams are 
finally taking me places. This is just the beginning."

A DREAM RUN ENDS FOR NORTHRIDGE ALL-STARS; LITTLE LEAGUE: THE U.S. CHAMPS LOSE 
THE WORLD TITLE TO VENEZUELA IN TENSE 4-3 GAME AFTER THREE-HOUR RAIN DELAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rocked by an earthquake seven months ago, a group of Northridge youngsters 
were thwarted by Mother Nature again Saturday with a rain delay and then by 
sizzling fastballs as their team lost the Little League World Series to 
Venezuela, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The squad from Maracaibo outscored Northridge in a tense, riveting game played 
before 35,000 spectators and thousands of television viewers in Los Angeles who 
watched a live national broadcast that sent emotions reeling from anticipation 
to hope and, finally, disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game here on Saturday, as the Venezuelan players swarmed onto the 
field and cried for joy, Northridge catcher Matt Cunningham congratulated his 
opponents and looked for a silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
 "That team is a great team," he said. "They played their game, we played our 
game, they beat us. I have to say, they won. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're U.S.A. champions. . . . We've gone as far as we wanted to go," said 
Matt, who wore his "lucky green underwear" for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Frost, father of center fielder Michael Frost, who struck out to end the 
game, said it was "time for us all to go back to our lives again. It was great 
fun for our kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss took the coveted world title away from the U.S. and Southern 
California, which won the series in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 With superior pitching and hitting, the South American team stopped a dream 
run by a crew of youngsters dubbed "The Earthquake Kids." Until their defeat 
Saturday, the San Fernando Valley boys -- who signed up for the league just two 
weeks after the 6.8-magnitude January temblor -- had won 20 of 21 games in five 
tournaments across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Los Angeles, spectators took the loss hard. "I feel terrible," said 
Debra Gray, tears in her eyes as she sat in the Presidente Mexican Restaurant 
in Northridge, where scores of residents -- including parents of other children 
in the league -- crammed together to watch the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they did great. They're the national champions. . . . There's not enough 
thanks we can give to the kids for what they did for our community." 
</P>
<P>
 At the 35er sports bar in Pasadena, downcast patrons filed out quickly after 
the defeat. "They were upset for the kids," a bartender said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame," added Paul Hendison, a Hollywood marketing consultant who 
watched the game at the Legends Sports Bar in Santa Monica. "It was terrific 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss capped a remarkable odyssey for the Northridge team that had captured 
the imagination of baseball fans nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the players -- whose average age is 12 -- and their families were 
displaced after the Northridge earthquake. One of the boys has yet to move back 
into his home. But the young athletes remained committed to their sport, 
gathering steam and a passel of victories and admirers on the way to their 
field of dreams in Williamsport. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurels and roses have already been strewn in the paths of the players, 
described Saturday as "matinee idols" by one sports commentator. Local media 
outlets and corporations have clamored for their attention, and the city has a 
parade and rally planned for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest was particularly high in Long Beach, which fielded Little League 
champions for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a good following for the games all week," said Dennis Gill, manager 
of Yankee Doodle's, a sports bar in Belmont Shores. "With Long Beach in it last 
year, we were rooting to keep it in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's victories culminated Thursday with a shutout win over a team from 
Virginia to capture the U.S. title. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Maracaibo team, also impressive in its earlier wins, was led by 
pitcher Cesar Hidalgo, whose fastball stymied many of the Northridge players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pitcher was good. He was throwing the ball hard. He was tough to hit," 
Northridge team manager Larry Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides went scoreless for two innings before thunder, lightning and 
heavy rain -- more than three inches -- stopped play for three hours. Officials 
at Howard J. Lamade Stadium in this humid city warned spectators to move away 
from trees, light poles and the electronic scoreboard to avoid lightning bolts. 
</P>
<P>
 When play resumed, the Northridge team seemed to have lost some of its 
momentum. In the third and fourth innings, the boys gave up two runs as the 
South American squad came out strong. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a partisan crowd chanting, "U.S.A.! U.S.A.!" -- including members of 
the three American teams Northridge defeated on its way to the final -- the 
Earthquake Kids rumbled back, tying up the game and ratcheting up the anxiety 
level to hand-wringing pitch for wide-eyed boosters gathered about television 
sets back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew they would come back. It's the power of Northridge," said 14-year-old 
Richard Waisberg, a past player in the Northridge Little League and a friend of 
many of the current young athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 His euphoria evaporated in the fifth inning, however, after Venezuela scored 
two more runs to go up 4-2. A glimmer of hope for the Northridge team shone in 
the bottom of the fifth when right fielder Spencer Gordon knocked out a solo 
home run, adding another to a collection including one that won the U.S. 
championship game Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But no runs were scored in the sixth and last inning by either side, leaving 
the decision at 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge players, dejected in their sky-blue jerseys, sat silent for a 
few moments. They then shook hands with their Maracaibo opponents, who earned 
Latin America its first World Series title since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, the Venezuelans were just a little better tonight," said 
Gregory Cassel, the father of first baseman Matt. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the continent, Cassel's wife, Barbara, who was unable to journey to 
Williamsport for the series, glowed in the remarkable achievements of her son's 
team. "It's just the most pride you can feel as a parent," she said at the 
Presidente restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, Fred Seibly, a member of the Granada Hills team that won the 
World Series in 1963, was disappointed for the new U.S. champs but 
congratulated them for their long string of successes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should be real proud. They have plenty of years to look back on this 
game and may all their memories of it be good ones," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What those kids are going through now is going to build a lot of character. 
They're going to be huge celebrities." 
</P>

ON CALIFORNIA: AND WHATEVER HAPPENED TO NORTHRIDGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the neighborhoods of Northridge, mounds of rubble are piled out front every 
fourth house or so -- cracked concrete, felled trees, shingles, shattered 
drywall, and the remains of fast-food lunches discarded by the demolition 
crews. Contractors and scavengers rumble about in pickups. Jackhammers pound 
away, tireless. A thin brown dust hangs overhead, filtering the August 
sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Some blocks are different. These are streets that contain the large apartment 
houses left uninhabitable by the Jan. 17 earthquake. Cyclone fences surround 
the sagging hulks of stucco. Spray-painted signs warn away transients and 
looters. "Did You Make Out Your Will?" taunts one such posting, sprayed across 
a tilted archway. People who live near these deserted apartments complain of 
bad smells and rodents and all too silent nights. The rats, they observe, have 
incited a secondary invasion of feral cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all very depressing," says a man whose house sits in the literal shadow 
of a crumpled apartment complex on Reseda Boulevard. "It's like living in a 
ghost town. The smell has been awful. Garbage. Human waste. There has been some 
looting. And two nights ago there was a shooting. We heard a couple of shots." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who got shot?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know," he says with a shrug. "We never did find out. We just stayed 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months beyond the quake, Northridge looks much as it did the first 
morning after. Buildings lean at terrible angles. Workers scramble about the 
wreckage, shoring up, pulling down. Apartment renters peer through the security 
fences with binoculars, looking for lost items. All that's missing from the 
scene are the firetrucks and television crews. The firetrucks have moved on to 
new disasters. The television crews have moved on to O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge remains -- no longer in the news every day, but very much in the 
middle of the quake. Only now, residents say, have most homeowners begun to 
settle insurance claims and hire contractors. Reconstruction talk rattles about 
the coffee shops. With the easy familiarity of experts, residents kick around 
the stress loads of sheer walls and payment schedules of SBA loans. They 
strain, though, when asked to describe life since the quake. Terms like Beirut 
and war zone are tried, but these don't quite hit the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like," one woman says, "when you look at hot ground and it shimmers. 
Like a mirage. That is how it is here now. Nothing is quite right. Nothing is 
quite as it's supposed to be. You go to a shop, and it is closed. You go to get 
on the freeway, the ramp is shut down. You drive down Reseda and there's the 
apartment where the people died. Why can't they take the damned thing down? The 
earthquake is everywhere. You can't get away from it." 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away, another resident gropes for the right words. He speaks of 
atmospherics, of science fiction films. "Something is in the air," he says. "I 
can't describe it, but something is in the air and it feels the same as when 
that train came through our living room." 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean the earthquake?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not all wreckage is as obvious as curbside rubble. Residents also tell of 
short tempers and headaches that last for months, of marital tension and 
intimate fears. One man says he cannot make love to his wife in their bed; they 
now must go out of town for that. A woman volunteers that nocturnal trips to 
the toilet have become tests of her courage; in the earthquake, a tree crushed 
the bathroom. "Now," she says, "I have to sit there and have this conversation 
with myself: 'It's going to be OK. It's going to be OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She lives on one of Northridge's nicer streets. Her repairs will be done maybe 
in six weeks, she explains over the roar of an industrial rug cleaner. Her 
neighbors now sleep in a trailer parked on the lawn. And a few doors down sits 
a house that, abandoned, was taken over by a street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one," she says, "has any idea what it's been like out here. They just 
don't have a clue. They have forgotten all about us." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not self-pity. This is simple fact. After the klieg lights flicker 
out, after the next sensation comes along, the people left behind must pick up 
the pieces themselves, alone. And picking up the pieces is never quite as easy 
as everyone likes to pretend. They know this in Koreatown and South-Central Los 
Angeles, where whole blocks remain burned out still, so long after the riots. 
They know this, too, on the barren slopes of the Oakland hills and in the 
canyons of Malibu and Laguna. And now they know it here, in the neighborhoods 
of Northridge.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; HAGGLING THREATENS CHANCES OF DEBATES; WILSON, 
BROWN CAMPS SQUABBLE OVER DETAILS. THEY CANNOT AGREE ON THE FORMAT FOR EVEN THE 
ONE ENCOUNTER ACTUALLY SCHEDULED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To debate or not to debate -- that is what representatives of Gov. Pete Wilson 
and state Treasurer Kathleen Brown have been arguing about lately. They do not 
put it that simply, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's negotiators say the incumbent Republican is eager to go head to head 
with Brown, but is put off by her insistence that political reporters be 
excluded from asking questions during a televised debate scheduled for Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Baloney, say Brown's representatives, who say the Democrat will happily answer 
questions from anyone, as long as reporters are not the only ones doing the 
asking. Wilson is stalling, they say, drawing out negotiations about the 
October debate to avoid discussing four other debates Brown wants before the 
Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to hold on to the ball and run the clock out," one Brown aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the perennial dance of the debate teams, an often graceless display 
of political choreography performed in the name of spirited intellectual 
discourse. To hear the current crop of candidates talk, they all want nothing 
more than to engage their opponents on live television. "You and I owe (it) to 
the voters," Brown wrote to Wilson last month. Wilson responded: "My desire to 
debate is genuine. I hope yours is too." 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, like every election year, relentless haggling over details 
threatens to prevent that desire from being quenched. Conventional wisdom says 
that front-runners avoid debates because they have more to lose. In the 
gubernatorial primary in June, Brown's opponents accused her of doing just 
that. But now the tables have turned. With recent polls showing Wilson and 
Brown locked in a close contest, Brown has challenged Wilson to five debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, six weeks of negotiations have failed to hammer out a format for 
even one debate: the Oct. 16 forum sponsored by the California Broadcasters 
Assn. Wilson's negotiators say they won't consider other debates until the 
first one is settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and her Republican challenger, Rep. Mike 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), cannot even agree on who should make debate 
arrangements. Feinstein has assigned a staff member to discuss formats, dates 
and times. Huffington insists that he must talk to Feinstein himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Such quibbling is a time-honored tradition. Campaign strategists, eager to 
gain the slightest advantage, have been known to go to the mat over even the 
most trivial details: the color of the backdrop, the height of the podium, the 
location of so-called spin rooms, where campaign operatives seek to persuade 
reporters to see things their way. It may sound like bickering, advisers say, 
but such attention to detail ensures a fair and informative exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the points of contention between Wilson and Brown: Wilson's negotiators 
say an audience is distracting. They want a panel of reporters to ask all the 
questions because reporters are "independent, provocative (and) tough on both 
candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's team says that if reporters ask all the questions it will reduce 
one-on-one interaction between the candidates. An audience ensures that 
candidates will hear "real" questions, they say. And each team suspects the 
other of negotiating in bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the incumbent and he thinks he's ahead. So from his campaign's 
perspective, why take the risk of debating Kathleen?" said Kim Wardlaw, a 
lawyer who is leading Brown's five-member negotiation team. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Thomas, senior counsel to Wilson's campaign, countered: "Pete Wilson has 
debated virtually every candidate that he's run against in his political 
career. The notion that he's running away or doesn't want to face her is just 
laughable." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Thomas, Wardlaw and her colleagues made it clear in a meeting 
Wednesday that they think "reporters just kind of get in the way, that they 
have these bombshell questions and can try to . . . overshadow the candidate." 
Or, as Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur phrased it in a statement faxed to 
the media, Brown's negotiators "argued that reporters tend to hog the 
spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
 Wardlaw countered that she has nothing against reporters, who "are generally 
very intelligent. (But) I also think other people who do other things are 
intelligent too." She said the Wilson team had "an arrogance" about Brown's 
desire for an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "On more than one occasion, their negotiators said: 'If you had real questions 
from real people you wouldn't have as intelligent questions,' " she recalled. 
"I said: 'What are you saying? That the voters don't know what's important to 
them?' . . . If I had Wilson's record I'd be afraid of real questions from the 
voters, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the California Broadcasters Assn. have made two proposals, 
suggesting that debate questions could be asked either by a moderator or by an 
audience. Brown's camp has agreed to either of those formats. But Wilson's team 
has balked. A moderator would result in a "Geraldo Rivera-type format," they 
say, while audiences are known for "wasting precious time better used by the 
candidates themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Can this debate negotiation be saved? Wardlaw admits that the process has 
become frustrating. The behavior of Wilson's representatives has created what 
Wardlaw called "an increasingly supported suspicion that what they really want 
is no debates at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said that characterization is unfair. "We have met with them every time 
they've wanted to meet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will not be available to debate during September, Thomas said, because 
he must sign or veto what may exceed 1,500 pieces of legislation. But between 
Oct. 1 and Nov. 7, he said, "I'm virtually certain there's going to be debates. 
Just like I think that ultimately there's going to be another baseball game. It 
just takes a little bit of time."

U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN L.A. TO HIRE 18 MORE PROSECUTORS; JUSTICE: STAFF 
SHORTAGES HAVE FORCED THE UNIT NOT TO PURSUE SOME MAJOR FRAUD AND DRUG CASES. 
RENO FORMS TASK FORCE TO PROVIDE MORE OBJECTIVE MODEL FOR ALLOCATING LAWYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles U.S. attorney's office, which routinely turns away many fraud 
and drug cases because of staffing shortages, has gotten a boost from 
Washington: the authority to hire 18 more prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The new hires, authorized by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, represent a 9% increase 
for the 208-lawyer office, which on a per-capita basis runs a far smaller shop 
than many of its counterparts. There is only one federal prosecutor for every 
91,000 people in its seven-county jurisdiction, which stretches from Riverside 
to San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, there is one federal prosecutor for every 25,000 people in 
Manhattan and Miami and one for every 31,000 in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Los Angeles office has had to decline prosecution of 
multimillion-dollar fraud cases that are too complex for local authorities, 
U.S. Atty. Nora M. Manella said. The problem is so severe that it has led to 
what she called "a prosecution-free zone for large numbers of sophisticated and 
violent criminals." Prosecutor shortages also have caused the office to refer 
major drug cases to local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno's decision follows strong criticism from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) 
and Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres), both of whom have said Justice Department 
resource allocations unfairly shortchange Los Angeles and the rest of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of such criticism, Reno has formed a Justice Department task 
force to develop a new model for allocating prosecutors based on more objective 
criteria, according to a department memo. 
</P>
<P>
 The staffing boost for Los Angeles, as well as smaller increases for 
Sacramento and San Diego, were announced in internal Justice Department memos 
sent out last month and disclosed by Manella in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in prosecutors will enable the Los Angeles office to pursue more 
health care fraud, financial scams, environmental crime and repeat violent 
offender cases, Manella said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the "long overdue relief" comes after years of complaints from her 
predecessors in Los Angeles. "The Central District should have equal 
enforcement of the law as the rest of the country and that requires more 
people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the shortages, the Los Angeles office is regarded as one of the 
premier U.S. attorney's offices in the country, winning high-profile 
convictions of swindler Charles H. Keating Jr. and two of the Los Angeles 
Police Department officers involved in the Rodney G. King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal prosecutors in Los Angeles say they could do more if they had more 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of such complaints, the issue began to take on momentum at a 
congressional hearing in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparities in staffing between Los Angeles and New York raise "very 
serious questions about the (Justice) Department's basic management skills 
while under the control of both Democratic and Republican administrations," 
Syracuse University researchers David Burnham and Susan Long told the House 
subcommittee on information, justice, transportation and agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The staffing patterns uncovered by our research indicate the Justice 
Department managers, going back for many, many years, have failed to follow a 
logical, consistent and understandable procedure when it came to divvying up 
federal prosecutors," said Burnham, a former New York Times reporter, and Long, 
a computer expert. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted that although the aggregate number of federal prosecutors 
skyrocketed in the Reagan-Bush era, the Los Angeles office was one of the five 
lowest in terms of growth during that period -- a time when massive drug 
operations and white-collar crime were escalating in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 During the October hearing, Anthony C. Moscato, director of the Executive 
Office of U.S. Attorneys in Washington, said the Los Angeles office had grown 
significantly from 1988 to 1992. He defended the Justice Department's 
allocation decisions as rational and said they were based on a host of factors, 
including workload -- the cases handled by each U.S. attorney in previous years 
-- the department's national priorities, the number of judges in an area, and 
the number of federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Condit countered that the Los Angeles office had not expanded fast enough to 
keep up with population growth and burgeoning crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the year 1991," he said, "the U.S. attorney in L.A. turned down 98% of 
the non-major and 46% of the major bank and thrift fraud cases referred by the 
FBI." 
</P>
<P>
 Condit, citing the Syracuse research, also criticized Justice Department 
officials for failing to take population into account. "For you to dismiss 
population the way you have is astounding to me." 
</P>
<P>
 When Manella assumed her post in January, she immediately started lobbying for 
more resources and Feinstein came to her aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator questioned Reno's chief assistant, Deputy Atty. Gen. Jamie 
Gorelick, about the disparities during Gorelick's March confirmation hearing 
and continued to press her on the issue, saying Manella had made "a compelling 
case for relief." 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, the Justice Department agreed to allot 24 additional slots to Los 
Angeles -- 18 attorneys and six support staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo sent out to all U.S. attorneys July 8, Reno said: "I am taking 
initial steps to address significant disparities in allocations on the basis of 
objective criteria." 
</P>
<P>
 She also called for a broad-gauged review to develop a "principled and 
equitable model to allocate resources based on external objective variables 
reflecting the number and magnitude of federal crimes in each district." She 
named Gorelick to head a task force, which includes several U.S. attorneys from 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "This process will ensure that scarce Department of Justice resources are 
available where they are most urgently needed," Reno said in the memo. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department observers said Reno's initiatives reflect recognition of a 
longstanding problem. They added that her short-term actions and long-term plan 
are signs of how important California is to the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. attorneys, including Manella, Charles Stevens in Sacramento and Alan D. 
Bersin in San Diego, all of whom have been pinched for resources, expect that 
they eventually will benefit from the change. But others, such as Mary Jo White 
in Manhattan, are concerned that they will not fare so well, according to 
Justice Department sources. White, through a representative, declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an overlay of 100 years of politics behind the allocation 
disparities, which are really hard to fathom," Syracuse researcher Burnham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department sources said New York had traditionally done better because 
it has historically had many high-profile cases and is close to Washington, 
making it easier for the U.S. attorney to go to the main Justice Department 
office to lobby. But Burnham said there is no simple explanation, political or 
otherwise, for some of the disparities. 
</P>
<P>
 The allocation question "is a difficult issue . . . from the perspective of 
individual U.S. attorneys who can almost always make a case for something 
additional or worthwhile he or she could do in his or her district if there 
were more people to do it," said Michael R. Stiles, the U.S. attorney in 
Philadelphia and a member of the Gorelick task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very difficult process. Some would simply argue population or uniform 
crime reports. Others would talk about the number of cases the office has 
brought, the number of judges in the district, the number of agents," Stiles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, Bersin said he was heartened by Reno's decision to examine the 
allocation question. Although the San Diego office -- which encompasses San 
Diego and Imperial counties -- has fared better per capita than Los Angeles, 
Bersin said his office also lacks sufficient staff. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in allocating prosecutors the department should take more account 
of the number of people in a district, and in his area should consider more 
than just the domestic population. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you count (nearby cities) Tijuana and Mexicali, there are another 6 
million people in the district. This is the largest binational metropolis in 
the world and there is now recognition at Justice that because of the border 
there are additional factors in the mix," Bersin said. "This district is the 
primary corridor in the nation for both illegal immigration and illicit 
drug-trafficking activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Manella said the Central District is the most populous -- 15.7 million people 
-- and the most crime-infested in the nation. She said that by virtually any 
measure the district is entitled to more prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to FBI statistics, 30% of all the bank robberies in the United 
States occur in this district, 25% of all the carjackings, 20% of all major 
financial institution fraud cases are under investigation in the district, and 
40% of all worldwide credit fraud originates here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our office has to decline prosecution of many potential cases that would be 
'career cases' in most other districts in the United States," said Steven E. 
Zipperstein, chief assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. He declined to 
provide specific cutoff guidelines, saying that information could aid criminals 
in structuring illegal acts. 
</P>
<P>
 But other sources supported his contention and amplified on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The $1-million to $5-million investor fraud case, where there were 50 to 
several hundred victims," frequently could not be pursued because of prosecutor 
shortages, said James R. Asperger, who was chief of the major frauds section of 
the Los Angeles U.S. attorney's office from August, 1990, to July, 1993, and is 
now in private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Adamski, who recently retired as chief of the Los Angeles FBI office's 
white-collar crime unit and previously investigated large financial scams in 
Washington and other cities, said he shared the frustration of Los Angeles 
prosecutors who had to decline cases because of inadequate staffing. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my perspective of being a financial fraud supervisor for 10 years, I've 
long been aware of the need for additional assistant United States attorneys in 
Los Angeles. They had by far the largest caseload of financial institution 
fraud cases, the most complex cases, the cases that had the most community 
impact," said Adamski, now vice president and director of worldwide anti-piracy 
efforts for the Motion Picture Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 These sentiments were echoed by a veteran Los Angeles agent of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration. The agent said that between 1990 and 1993, resource 
shortages compelled the U.S. attorney's office to significantly raise the 
threshold amount of cocaine powder needed for federal prosecution from 500 
grams to 5 kilograms, although cases involving 2 kilograms or more would be 
taken if the cocaine was being imported or exported through Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there also have been 
threshold increases for crack cocaine, LSD, marijuana and methamphetamine. A 
larger U.S. attorney staff might help reverse that trend. "It can only help if 
we get more bodies," the agent said. Legal Comparison

INTENSIVE CARE; HEART SURGEON LEADS PIONEERING OPERATION ON ENDANGERED 
ORANGUTAN 
</P>

 In the first open-heart surgery performed on an ape, a medical team led by an 
internationally known heart surgeon worked for seven hours Saturday to repair a 
life-threatening hole in the heart of a young orangutan at the San Diego Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists and medical technicians from the 
UC San Diego Medical Center, assisted by veterinarians and animal keepers from 
the zoo, worked to patch a gaping hole in the heart of a 2-year-old Sumatran 
orangutan named Karen, a member of an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Karen were human, I'd tell her parents that everything went fine, and her 
prognosis is excellent," lead surgeon Dr. Stuart Jamieson said after emerging 
from the operating room at the zoo hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgery is virtually identical to the procedure commonly performed on 
humans with the same heart defect. Even if successful, the veterinary surgery 
is unlikely to be repeated soon because heart problems are rarely detected 
among zoo animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Without surgery to correct the congenital defect, the 22-pound orangutan faced 
the risk of a fatal heart attack as her heart arteries hardened and her blood 
became depleted of oxygen. The longer doctors waited, the greater the chance 
that irreparable damage had already occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was either now or never for Karen," said Dr. Kurt Benirschke, professor of 
pathology at UCSD and founder of the zoo's Center for the Reproduction of 
Endangered Species. "It was only going to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, Karen was put on a breathing machine because of a buildup 
of fluid in her lungs, a common postoperative reaction. Veterinarians planned 
to stay with her around the clock until she is out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
 If Karen recovers completely, she could grow to 80 pounds and live to the age 
of 30 or more. Keepers hope to have her back with other orangutans within a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamieson said that although the team encountered differences between humans 
and apes in the skin and chest, "once we were in the heart, it was like what we 
do every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The hole was a particularly large one, destroying nearly the entire wall 
between two chambers of the heart, preventing blood from getting enough oxygen. 
Jamieson and fellow surgeon Dr. Jolene Kriett stretched a section of the heart 
sac across the hole and stitched it shut. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians from UCSD and other medical groups in San Diego have a long history 
of working pro bono with veterinarians at the zoo on tricky and challenging 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those cases have been an albino koala with cancer in the roof of its 
mouth, jaguars and elephants who needed root canal work, a gorilla with an ear 
infection, a giraffe that needed X-rays, a Komodo dragon with a broken leg and 
a rare owl with failing eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
 Although medical-veterinary cooperation is common, zoo officials said this was 
the first open-heart surgery ever done on a San Diego zoo animal. "This is 
cutting edge," said Douglas Myers, the zoo's executive director, one of a dozen 
people who watched nervously from an upstairs observation room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of a better way to spend a Saturday than helping an endangered 
species survive," Jamieson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamieson has performed more than 550 heart transplants and headed the 
heart-lung transplant programs at Stanford and the University of Minnesota 
before coming to UCSD. When he and key members of his team came to UCSD from 
Minnesota five years ago, it was considered a major medical coup. 
</P>
<P>
 For the surgery on Karen, the same equipment used on human patients was 
brought to the zoo hospital: a heart-lung machine, a machine for cleansing 
blood, and a pacemaker in case doctors had trouble restarting the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 During surgery, the orangutan's heart was stopped and she was attached to the 
heart-lung machine. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a strangeness to treating an ape with the same procedures and 
technology used on humans, it disappeared when Karen was draped in a sterile 
surgical sheet with only a portion of her gray-brown chest exposed, with all 
its reddish hair shaved away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the patient was under the cover, she looked just like a normal baby," 
said scrub nurse Maria Camilon. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jamieson and Kriett began, the operating room fell silent. Jamieson wore 
a head-mounted camera to provide a close-up view to observers via 
closed-circuit TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before her surgery, Karen, one of seven orangutans at the San Diego Zoo, 
had her share of travails. For openers, she was an unplanned and unwanted 
offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Karta, became pregnant despite being on birth control pills. For 
genetic reasons, it was not thought wise for Karta to reproduce with the 
dominant male, Otis, her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Keepers deduced that Karta was pretending to swallow her daily pill and 
spitting it out when no one was watching. Karta refused to nurse Karen, forcing 
keepers to take Karen from her mother and feed her from a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first year she suffered unusual bouts of diarrhea and lethargy. Her 
growth seemed stunted. 
</P>
<P>
 After veterinarians heard a heart murmur, a cardiac catheterization performed 
by Dr. Abraham Rothman, a pediatric cardiologist from UCSD, confirmed that 
Karen had been born with an atrial septal defect, a 3/4-inch hole between the 
two chambers of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition accounts for 10% of heart problems in children, and the surgery 
to repair it has become commonplace. In adults the human heart and the ape 
heart are nearly identical, and zoo veterinarians decided that Karen would be a 
good candidate for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 There were still risks. For one thing, the hole was near the heart's center 
for electrical activity and a slip of the scalpel could be deadly. Also, 
doctors were not sure if Karen's vascular system was the same as that of an 
adult orangutan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunting, poaching and destruction of the hardwood forests in their native 
Borneo and Sumatra have led the orangutans to be listed as endangered. The 
American Assn. of Zoological Parks and Aquariums has begun a breeding program 
for orangutans, and also is trying to raise awareness of their plight.

U.S. SENATE; ON HUFFINGTON'S TURF, REPUBLICANS HOLD FUND-RAISER FOR FEINSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was a night when politics took a lesson from an old proverb: The enemy of 
my enemy is my friend. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the disparate critics of GOP Senate candidate Mike Huffington gathered 
Friday night at the ocean bluff estate of prominent Republican Barney Klinger 
for one of the biggest fund-raisers that Reagan country has ever thrown for a 
Democrat like Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 By any measure, it was an odd political event. One guest quipped that the 
audience of more than 400 was one part American Civil Liberties Union, one part 
John Birch Society. Feinstein praised ex-GOP Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino as one 
of the best congressmen to serve in Washington. The Republican returned the 
compliment, saying Feinstein had character, know-how, experience and class. 
</P>
<P>
 Nary a nasty word could be heard as local liberals sipped Chardonnay and 
chatted in the same room where President Ronald Reagan had stood four times and 
President Richard Nixon had stood three times, marshaling their forces to 
defeat Democrats such as Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Except about Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican nominee for Feinstein's seat has an embarrassing weak spot in 
his hometown of Santa Barbara. It is one of the places where he is least 
popular in California, as demonstrated in last June's primary, when he lost his 
home county to GOP rival William E. Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Feinstein made her second trip of the campaign to Santa 
Barbara on Friday, hoping that all California voters will hear from her 
opponent's angry constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what it says is that where you are best known is at home," the 
senator said. "And I must say, I would be very distressed if I could not carry 
San Francisco or the Bay Area, because that's where people know me the best. I 
think it's an indication of a real weakness." 
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued by Huffington, who is vacationing in Hawaii, criticized the 
Feinstein Republicans for disloyalty to their party. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a time when Republicans are poised for major victories on a statewide and 
nationwide level, it's disappointing that certain individuals have chosen to 
put personal disputes before party loyalty," the statement said. "It is 
especially sad to see any Republicans seeming to endorse Dianne Feinstein's 
liberal agenda of higher taxes, bigger government and wishy-washiness on the 
issues of crime, immigration and defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's problems in Santa Barbara began shortly after he moved to the 
area from Texas in 1991. The next year he angered some local Republicans by 
entering the GOP primary against Lagomarsino, a seven-term congressman who had 
served the area in local, state and federal office for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spent $5.2 million -- more than any House candidate in history -- 
from the fortune he made at his family's Texas petroleum company to win a 
bitter race that ousted Lagomarsino. 
</P>
<P>
 About eight months later, some of the negative feelings grew stronger when 
Huffington announced that he would enter the U.S. Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a promise," Klinger said Friday night. "I said that if the son of a 
bitch runs for the U.S. Senate, I'll hold the biggest fund-raiser that Santa 
Barbara has ever had for a Democrat. And I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Klinger, an industrialist whose 33-acre Hope Ranch estate has hosted 
fund-raisers that produced more than $1 million for Republicans, said he 
respects Feinstein as a senator, but admits that he has little in common with 
her politically. Their differences are mild, however, he said, compared to his 
dislike for Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 "After he was only in office a few months, he said he was bored with his job," 
Klinger said. "Can you picture this? He just spent $5 million and he's bored, 
he wants a new toy. . . . We have to stop someplace. We have to say: 'Hey, 
(nobody) can buy a seat in the Senate, no matter how much money his daddy left 
him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lagomarsino confessed to the audience that some of his Republican friends 
think he has gone too far in helping a Democrat. His answer was that not all 
Republicans are good for the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I urge all voters, but especially talking to Republicans, to sit down and ask 
yourself which (Senate) candidate would be best for America, would be best for 
California and, indeed, would be best for their own party," he said. "Money can 
buy a lot of things -- it can buy advertising, it can buy a lot of name I.D. 
But it can't buy character, or experience, or know-how or class. And it sure as 
hell shouldn't be able to buy a U.S. Senate seat."

OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING BAN OKD BY SENATE; ENVIRONMENT: MEASURE AFFECTING ENTIRE 
STATE COAST IS NARROWLY APPROVED AND SENT TO ASSEMBLY. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE 
EXISTING LEASES OR WELLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The state Senate approved legislation Saturday that would permanently ban new 
offshore oil drilling along the entire 1,100-mile length of the California 
coast, replacing the current patchwork of long- and short-term restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The drilling ban bill (AB 2444), by Assemblyman Jack O'Connell 
(D-Carpinteria), was approved on a 22-13 vote, one more than the simple 
majority needed for passage. It was returned for a final vote in the Assembly, 
which approved it earlier with no votes to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has not taken a position on the bill, but intends to 
carefully review it, said spokesman Paul Kranhold. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would not affect current leases or existing pumping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate voted as it met in an unusual Saturday session to grapple with 
hundreds of bills and other unfinished business in preparation for adjournment 
of the two-year session Wednesday. The Assembly recessed Friday and will 
reconvene Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell, supported by conservationist groups, maintains that a permanent ban 
embodied in his Coastal Sanctuary Act of 1994 is necessary because offshore oil 
development poses a significant hazard to the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena), who represents the picturesque North Coast 
region, noted that virtually all of the state's coastline has been off limits 
to petroleum drilling because of a "confusing hodgepodge" of permanent and 
temporary restrictions, some of which will expire next year and others in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary restrictions, he said, must be replaced by a permanent, uniform 
ban that stretches from Mexico to the Oregon border. "The production of oil and 
gas must not come at the expense of our state's greatest asset, our coastline," 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) called the measure a landmark 
accomplishment of this legislative session. The vote broke generally along 
party lines with Democrats and independents favoring the bill and Republicans 
opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would take effect Jan. 1 and apply to new offshore drilling leases 
in state waters as well as to the expired leases. Among the regions whose 
temporary bans are scheduled to expire Jan. 1 are tidal and submerged lands off 
the coast of Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties and northern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the bill, which was opposed by the oil industry, warned that a ban 
on new drilling could deprive state government of potential new revenue at a 
time that budgets are shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Don Rogers (R-Tehachapi), whose district includes parts of oil-rich Kern 
County, warned that prohibiting offshore drilling would increase the risk of 
disastrous oil spills because of reliance on oil tankers. He said more oil 
tankers would be calling at California ports and this would heighten the 
possibility of collisions and spills.

DEFYING WEST, BOSNIAN MUSLIM WARLORD PUSHES FOLLOWERS TOWARD CROATIA; BALKANS: 
DEFEATED BY GOVERNMENT, FIKRET ABDIC CONTINUES TO FOMENT REVOLT. AID WORKERS 
FEAR HE MAY PROVOKE A DEADLY FACEOFF. 
</P>

<P>
 Defeated Muslim warlord Fikret Abdic herded thousands more of his followers 
into a dangerous no-man's-land between Serbian rebels and Croatian forces 
Saturday while Western mediators vainly sought to persuade him to tell his 
people to return to their Bosnian homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals of U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith and the U.N. 
civilian affairs chief for the Balkans, Sergio de Mello, appeared to fall on 
deaf ears as Abdic continued to pressure more than 30,000 displaced Muslims 
from the Bihac region to march on armed barricades. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian police in riot gear have been barring the throngs of Abdic supporters 
from crossing into government-held territory for a week, and humanitarian aid 
workers fear a deadly confrontation could break out. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 6,000 refugees who had been camped in a field just across the Bosnian 
border in this Serb-held region of Croatia were hustled onto buses provided by 
Abdic early Saturday and taken to the crossing point at Turanj, an abandoned 
village in the mined territory sandwiched between Serbian rebels and Croatian 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdic lieutenants said they were also planning to move thousands more refugees 
from a makeshift camp here to the Turanj crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior U.N. official said he feared Abdic was deliberately trying to 
provoke a violent confrontation at Turanj "to discredit both the Bosnian and 
Croatian governments." 
</P>
<P>
 Croatia, which already shelters 400,000 Bosnian refugees, has refused to grant 
asylum to the Abdic supporters. They began fleeing en masse two weeks ago as 
his yearlong effort to conquer the Bihac pocket for his personal fiefdom was 
being quashed by Bosnian government forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim rebels also have found no welcome among the Serbian gunmen who 
occupy all Croatian and Bosnian territory surrounding the Bihac pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the refugees with two choices: to remain packed on a narrow 
roadway at Turanj and in makeshift refugee camps without toilets or shelter, or 
to accept U.N. and Bosnian government assurances that they will not face 
retribution if they choose to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government has offered amnesty to all Abdic supporters, and U.N. 
forces in the Bihac pocket have promised to monitor their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said as clearly as possible that the best solution for these people is to 
return home, that there is no prospect of third countries taking them in," 
Galbraith said after he and De Mello took Abdic aside to inform him of his 
limited options. 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith described conditions at Turanj as "a mini-Auschwitz" and said he was 
sure the refugees would leave if Abdic told them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdic's power over the refugees was obvious when he addressed them in this 
Serb-held village, where at least 14,000 are crammed into the sheds of an 
abandoned chicken farm that was part of Abdic's prewar food-processing empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Babo! Babo! Babo!" cheered the mobs of Abdic supporters, calling him by an 
affectionate diminutive of father. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is going to take us to Western Europe, where there is peace," insisted 
Mehmet Delic, who worked for Abdic in his stronghold of Velika Kladusa for more 
than three decades. "We all would rather go home, but not without our Babo." 
</P>
<P>
 Some refugees, especially women with children, seemed eager to believe the 
diplomats' message that they could return home in safety. But they immediately 
switched to adulation of Abdic whenever one of his "community leaders" came 
within earshot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have starved without Babo. We are nothing without him," a young 
mother of three, Rasima Selimanovic, recited with practiced conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdic, vanquished by the Muslim-led Bosnian army after the insurgency, has 
refused to surrender or cease the propaganda barrage used to convince his 
followers that Bosnian troops will cut their throats if they return home. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Sarajevo government has promised amnesty to Abdic fighters and 
civilians, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic has vowed to put Abdic himself 
on trial for war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 With no hope of recovering his power base peacefully, Abdic has been trying to 
muster the displaced for another armed assault on the Bosnian forces who now 
control the entire Bihac pocket, U.N. officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Western diplomats succeed in convincing the refugees that they can 
return home safely may provide a litmus test for the future of other war-torn 
regions of the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 If they fail to reconcile Muslims loyal to Abdic with Muslims who support the 
Sarajevo government in one of the few regions where refugees are being 
officially encouraged to return home, aid workers and diplomats see little hope 
of convincing other divided peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia that they 
can learn to live together again. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be the easy part," one official commented privately, 
acknowledging that the prospects for immediate success were dim. REVOLTS

CHINA DETAINS DISSIDENT AS U.S. TRADE MISSION ARRIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown arrived Saturday for a visit hailed by 
China as an economic fresh start after President Clinton's decision not to link 
trade ties and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 But the detention of a leading dissident earlier in the day made it clear that 
human rights questions will continue to nag Washington as it pursues closer 
economic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Police detained Wang Dan, a student leader of the 1989 Tian An Men 
pro-democracy demonstrations, just hours before Brown and 24 American 
executives arrived in Beijing for an eight-day mission expected to produce 
billions of dollars in new contracts for U.S. businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is the first Cabinet official to visit Beijing since Clinton decided in 
May not to link China's performance on human rights with its trade status. That 
decision freed the Commerce Department to pursue a high-profile policy of 
business promotion in China -- one of the world's most promising markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seek to set the stage for a new era of cooperation, growth and progress," 
Brown said in a statement after his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 China has enthusiastically welcomed the trade mission, which also will stop in 
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong, as a fresh start for Sino-American trade. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton severed the linkage between China's rights progress and its 
trading privileges, he said he was convinced the Chinese would act to improve 
human rights if the issue were separated from the threat of trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 However, human rights activists have said that, since then, Beijing has ceased 
all progress on human rights issues, including the release of political 
prisoners, an accounting of political prisoners, the treatment of prisoners and 
the opening of prisons to inspections by the International Committee of the Red 
Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Wang Dan issued a public statement protesting what he said was 
three months of harassment by police who follow him wherever he goes. "They 
don't allow me, a citizen, to live the life of a normal person in China. And 
this is simply because I represent a different point of view," Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an article Saturday in the official China Daily, China boasted that it 
leads the United States in protecting human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a welter of statistics, Yu Quanyu, vice president of the China Society 
for Human Rights Studies, said China beat the United States on a number of 
indicators. Among the examples he cited were the death rate, the number of 
children living in one-parent homes and the murder and rape rate.

 North Korea has rejected a South Korean offer to provide it with a modern 
reactor, threatening efforts to resolve the Korean nuclear crisis, Seoul 
officials said.The South Korean offer is "an intolerable insult" with "a 
sinister political purpose," North Korea said in radio reports monitored in 
Seoul and Tokyo. Giving North Korea reactors is a key part of a U.S.-North 
Korean deal earlier this month aimed at resolving suspicion the North is 
developing nuclear weapons. American negotiators agreed to help North Korea get 
modern reactors and give it some form of diplomatic recognition in exchange for 
Pyongyang's promise to freeze its nuclear program.

fired one shot at the building, raising new security concerns for expatriate 
workers aiding Rwandan refugees, a U.N. spokesman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the workers was injured, said Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the Office 
of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.He said the attack Friday night was 
the first on the living quarters of any of about 800 foreign aid workers in the 
Goma area, and "the attack subsided before any harm was done." 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on the CARE home, a tin-roofed bungalow on the shore of Lake Kivu 
housing one Briton and nine Kenyans, occurred at 8:30 p.m. Friday, said chief 
CARE official Marc Gagnon. After several stones fell, CARE contacted the 
Zairian government, which sent a platoon of troops. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
 CARE officials said they did not know who the attackers were. In Goma, Zairian 
soldiers and civilians routinely attack and loot homes.

POLICE SWEEP SOUTH AFRICA IN CRIME FIGHT; SECURITY: CRITICS SAY NEW GOVERNMENT 
HAS FAILED TO STEM RISING VIOLENCE. RAIDS SEEK TO BUILD TRUST IN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 In a dramatic attempt to stem a fast-growing wave of crime and violence, armed 
South African police and soldiers clamped down across the country Friday night, 
searching thousands of homes and vehicles and arresting 1,742 people, 
authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 18,000 members of the once-infamous security forces took part in the 
overnight police sweep, the first since a democratic government led by Nelson 
Mandela was elected in April to replace an authoritarian regime that used the 
same police to brutally enforce racial segregation under apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's government has been stung by accusations that it has been unable to 
control violent crime. Last week, the holdover commissioner of the police 
service, Gen. Johan van der Mervwe, warned in Parliament that the nation could 
slide into "anarchy" if violent crime isn't checked. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's minister for safety and security, Sydney Mufamadi, hailed the police 
crackdown as a success Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many more such actions can be expected in the near future as efforts to 
combat crime are systematically intensified," Mufamadi said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the overnight operation, the police checked more than 35,000 vehicles 
at 2,500 roadblocks, and searched about 3,000 homes and shops, officials said. 
Three dozen people were arrested on murder charges, while hundreds were picked 
up for rape, robbery, drug-related offenses and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the effect on crime, the crackdown was aimed at bolstering public 
support for the police and the government. Officials fear that reports of 
violent crime have undermined their largely unsuccessful efforts so far to 
attract desperately needed foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela has pleaded for community cooperation with the police, but the 
officers' role remains extremely sensitive here. Working as a paramilitary 
force, the police used torture and extrajudicial deaths, as well as vicious 
anti-riot squads and a network of informants, to ruthlessly suppress dissent 
during the apartheid era. 
</P>
<P>
 Although official policy is now to protect the public, not oppress it, the 
police have yet to gain widespread respect or trust in many black communities. 
For one thing, scattered reports of police abuse, including electroshock 
torture and corruption, continue to surface and undermine law enforcement's 
claims of legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 And so far, at least in structure and staff, the 115,000-member national 
police force remains largely unchanged. Although the majority of constables and 
patrol officers are black, nearly every ranking officer is white. And although 
whites form only 15% of the country's population, four of five police stations 
remain in white areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Lue, coordinator of the Policing Research Project, an independent 
group, said the police force must shed its apartheid heritage and segregated 
structure, as well as change its culture of militarism, to be accepted by the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lack of understanding of human rights," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police ultimately will be combined with 10 separate police agencies that 
continue to operate in the former black homelands. Officials say they also 
intend to redeploy existing forces and stress greater community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although political violence has dropped sharply since the April elections, 
South Africa's rate of violent crime, especially murder, is considered among 
the world's highest. With 17,467 reported killings last year, for example, the 
per capita murder rate was nearly 10 times that of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The murders include the slayings of at least 165 police so far this year, 
compared to 270 last year. An officer was shot and killed Friday in his car 
near a hostel in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report issued last week, police said murders have increased by 48% and 
armed robberies by 97% in the last five years. Since the election, police say 
they also have seen a sharp growth in illegal immigration, gun smuggling and 
drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela has largely led the clamor for better police protection. Earlier this 
month, the man who endured 27 years in prison for leading the political 
struggle against apartheid even called for building more prisons.

 A referendum on compensating citizens for suffering caused by the switch to a 
market economy failed because the voter turnout was too low.International 
economists had said approval of the referendum, which was opposed by the 
reformed Communist government and backed by the opposition, would be 
catastrophic for the Baltic nation. The Central Elections Center reported that 
only 35% of voters had cast ballots just before polls closed. More than half of 
registered voters needed to take part for the referendum to be valid.

 Police in Palermo, Sicily, arrested a reputed Mafia boss accused in more than 
a hundred murders, including the bombing death of one of Italy's top anti-mob 
prosecutors.Lorenzo Tinnirello, 34, dubbed one of the "super fugitive" Mafia 
leaders, was surrounded as he left a fish market in Trabia, about 15 miles 
southeast of Palermo. He was not armed and did not resist, police said. 
Tinnirello, known as "Madonna," went into hiding in 1989 after being convicted 
in one of Sicily's first big mob trials. In July, he was charged with 
delivering the car bomb that killed anti-Mafia prosecutor Paolo Borsellino and 
five bodyguards in 1992 in Palermo.

CLINTON TAKES BREAK, SEEKS SECOND WIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For President Clinton, who began his overdue vacation Saturday with a golf 
outing, his second summer trip to the island of Martha's Vineyard has the air 
of a second try. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides say Clinton hopes to relax, of course -- the President 
recently joked that he would like to score 80 on the golf course before he 
turns 50 -- but that he also hopes a dozen days at the beach will allow him to 
refocus his presidency and figure out how better to communicate its purpose to 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Clinton, those laudable goals are precisely the ones his 
aides said he attempted to achieve -- and at the time claimed he had succeeded 
in achieving -- during last year's vacation on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Clinton has traveled something of a full circle since his last time 
here. He arrived a year ago battered nearly to the breaking point by the 
suicide of his friend and lawyer Vincent Foster, the bitterly partisan -- 
although ultimately successful -- battle over his budget plan, and a sickening 
drop in poll ratings that eliminated the cushion of good feeling he had enjoyed 
after first taking office. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week and a half of swimming, golfing and dining with the island's 
well-known, well-heeled, but heavily Democratic upper crust, he left 
rejuvenated and convinced that he finally understood much of what had caused 
his presidency to seemingly go off track. 
</P>
<P>
 In subsequent months, Clinton had his most successful season in office, 
winning a major congressional victory on the NAFTA trade pact, successfully 
handling an economic summit with Asian leaders, delivering several 
well-received speeches, and rising back up in poll-measured public esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the cycle started all over again: the Whitewater controversy, Paula 
Corbin Jones, health care, the crime bill -- the now-familiar litany of 
struggles dragged Clinton back down. So here he is once more, trying to figure 
out, as he put it in his weekly radio address Saturday, how to "get past the 
partisan static." 
</P>
<P>
 Aides and others who have spoken with Clinton say he is less bitter and 
depressed about the state of his presidency than he was last summer. None of 
Clinton's recent public speeches have matched the angry and sometimes 
self-pitying tone of the address he made to the nation's governors just before 
his vacation last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last few weeks, he's been in quite a reflective state of mind," said 
Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers. "He's thinking about what he can do" to reduce 
the level of partisanship that has endangered his legislative program, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's partisan battles remain "frustrating" to Clinton, Myers said, 
"but it doesn't come as a surprise anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who have spoken with Clinton recently describe him as at least 
outwardly upbeat and optimistic. They say he admits that he is tired and that 
he has burned out his staff during the last several months, but that he is 
still convinced he is slowly making progress toward his goals and that, in the 
end, the public will come to understand that. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the notion that the real problem is that the public does not really 
understand what he is trying to do, that his message has been blocked by 
partisan attacks from Republicans, overly critical reporting from the press and 
events he could not control, has become a recurring theme for Clinton and, even 
more, for his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the President and First Lady insist that Americans would support their 
goals if only they understood them better, and that their main problem is to 
figure out how better to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that notion is true, of course, remains debatable. Polls and voter 
interviews show that the public tends to have only a vague and somewhat 
suspicious notion of what officials in Washington are up to. But neither 
Clinton nor any other Democrat has yet figured out a way to convince Americans 
to lower their skepticism, and once again accept the sort of activist 
government that he preaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Clinton is not spending his entire vacation, or even the largest 
part of it, brooding over his future. After arriving here late Friday and 
greeting a friendly crowd at the airport, he was up early Saturday, taking a 
morning jog through the woods near the home where he, his wife and daughter, 
Chelsea, are staying. 
</P>
<P>
 The compound, next to beaches on Oyster Pond and the Atlantic, includes a 
converted 19th-Century farmhouse and guest house, flanked by a tennis court and 
a pasture for four horses. It is the home of Richard Friedman, a Boston 
developer and a prominent Democratic fund-raiser who has provided the house to 
the First Family for free. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and Hillary Clinton are staying in the guest house, while 
Chelsea Clinton and a friend from school stay in the main house with the 
resident staff, White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, it was off to the golf course Saturday, where Clinton made a good 
start toward his 80-stroke goal, shooting 39 over the first nine holes -- 
actually 40 counting a mulligan (free tee drive) on the first hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in black shorts and shirt and a bright white baseball cap, Clinton golfed 
in a foursome that included his friend, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., a Washington 
lawyer and lobbyist; producer-director George Stevens; and Warren Buffett, the 
investor and financier. Accompanying the party in a separate foursome were 
Microsoft founder Bill Gates Jr., his father and wife, and Jordan's wife, Ann. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good," Clinton told reporters at the 10th hole, "I'm not sure it's 
real yet." 
</P>
<P>

NEWS ANALYSIS; CASTRO MAY BE SEEKING DEAL TO END EXODUS; POLICY: THE CUBAN 
LEADER HAS SENT STRONG SIGNALS. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HINT THAT SOME 
ACCOMMODATION IS POSSIBLE TO RESOLVE REFUGEE CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three weeks after Fidel Castro ignited the Florida Straits refugee crisis by 
allowing emigration from his impoverished island, there is growing evidence 
that the Cuban leader is looking for a face-saving deal to call off the chaotic 
exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Castro's publicly stated demands go far beyond anything President 
Clinton is likely to consider, experts who study Cuba, both in and out of the 
U.S. government, say they believe that his real objectives are far more modest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuban dictator has sent strong signals that he is prepared to stop the 
flow of raft refugees if the United States will agree to prosecute Cubans who 
make it to Florida in stolen aircraft or boats, increase the pace of legal 
immigration and restore permission for Cuban Americans to send money to 
relatives on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Those would not be difficult conditions for Clinton to meet. Since the refugee 
crisis began, the U.S. government has already ended a three-decade-old policy 
of welcoming all Cuban defectors, which often allowed hijackers to escape 
punishment. Washington also has promised to facilitate legal immigration. And 
the ban on money transfers was imposed to punish Castro for permitting the 
unlimited exodus, so it would not be difficult for the Administration to lift 
the restriction if the refugee flow stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, decades of distrust and suspicion between Havana and Washington 
will make it difficult to hammer out a deal even if there seems to be little 
disagreement on matters of substance. For instance, Castro has made it clear 
that he wants the international recognition that would accompany direct 
high-level negotiations with the United States. But the Administration is 
unwilling to give it to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fidel Castro has shown absolutely no inclination to move toward democracy, 
and until he does, there is no need for dialogue," White House Press Secretary 
Dee Dee Myers said in reiterating the Administration's refusal to open broad 
talks with Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there may be more wiggle room in the positions of the two sides than 
appears in their public declarations. 
</P>
<P>
 With the two governments agreeing to mid-level talks on immigration, cover 
could be provided for wider discussions that might permit Washington and Havana 
to settle the refugee crisis. U.S. officials are hinting that the 
Administration might be a bit more flexible in its approach if Castro makes a 
show of goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Castro's going to have to do a lot before we get to that stage," said one 
official, acknowledging that some accommodation is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Castro could be driven toward a deal by their own political 
weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton clearly cannot tolerate a prolonged refugee crisis that would 
reinforce public skepticism about his performance on foreign policy. If the 
refugee flow continues unabated, it could easily overwhelm available internment 
facilities. In addition, it will sorely tax the resources of the Navy and Coast 
Guard, which have assigned 46 ships, 35 smaller boats and 12 aircraft to rescue 
rafters in the Florida Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro is trying to contend with a growing economic crisis that has clearly 
weakened his regime. The Cuban economy began shrinking in 1984. It has declined 
by almost 50% since 1989, when communism began to collapse in the former Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe, robbing Castro of his traditional patrons. No relief 
is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Cubans rioted in Havana on Aug. 5, the first such incident since the 
1960s. The disturbance was brought under control, but it showed that Castro's 
grip might be loosening. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, it almost certainly would be a mistake for either the United 
States or Cuba to try to wait for the other's internal problems to force 
concessions because both governments can hold out for quite a while. Castro can 
probably tolerate the refugee flow for months if he does not get the sort of 
deal he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugee flow has not caused any security problems for Castro's regime. 
Cuban police have been able to keep order on the beach, and many of the 
refugees would be potential troublemakers if they remained in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fidel can wait us out," one expert said. "Or at least we think he can." 
</P>
<P>
 "This regime is weaker, certainly, than it was in 1989," said Jorge I. 
Dominguez, a Harvard University professor of political science. But he said 
Castro's government has checked some erosion of its power by its "export of 
opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Another analyst said Cuba has at least 1 million "surplus" workers, enabling 
it to sustain the present refugee outflow almost indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the analyst said Castro would prefer an orderly departure of Cuban 
dissidents to the chaotic flotilla of rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1984 agreement between Castro and the Ronald Reagan Administration allows 
27,845 Cubans a year to travel to the United States as legal immigrants. But 
for most of the past decade, the departures have averaged about 3,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Washington has considered the 27,845 figure to be a ceiling. 
Under U.S. law, the only people who qualify are those with relatives who are 
legal residents of the United States, and those with needed skills and a firm 
job offer from an American employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro has said that the "spirit" of the agreement calls for an annual 
migration of 27,845. Experts think Castro might hold out for a promise to 
increase that level as part of a deal to stop the rafters.

25,000 MARCHERS MOURN RAFTER, URGE CUBA BLOCKADE; MIAMI: HEARSE CARRIES BODY OF 
RAFAEL GAMEZ, 34, TO THE LITTLE HAVANA CEMETERY. STEPS ASKED TO ALLOW 
PARAMILITARY GROUPS TO MOUNT AN INVASION. 
</P>

<P>
 More than 25,000 people, many urging the Clinton Administration with signs and 
chants to mount a total blockade of Cuba, marched Saturday in a funeral 
procession honoring a Cuban rafter who died at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearse carrying the body of Rafael Gamez, 34, led the two-mile procession 
down the main street of Little Havana to the cemetery, where several Cuban 
American elected officials spoke to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) called for lifting of the Neutrality Act so 
Cuban American paramilitary groups could mount an invasion of the island. 
"Cubans don't want a single GI to die in Cuba," he said. "We want to be able to 
fight for our own freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 The marchers, mostly Cuban Americans, urged President Clinton to rebuff 
increasing calls -- from some Democrats, from newspaper editorial boards and 
from Cuba's Roman Catholic bishops -- to begin talks with the government of 
Cuban President Fidel Castro to resolve the immigration crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton should talk with boaters and their families," read a banner towed by 
a small plane circling over the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the sea of flags and colorful signs carried by marchers was at least one 
full-sized effigy of Castro, dressed in fatigues and hanging from a gallows on 
wheels. "Fidel -- assassin," read an accompanying sign in Spanish. "Your time 
has come." 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators also carried mock coffins representing 40 people believed to 
have drowned in Havana harbor July 13 when a Cuban tugboat seized by people 
trying to flee the island was rammed and sunk by pursuing government vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite intermittent rain showers that drenched those without umbrellas, Miami 
police spokesman Angel Calzadilla said the three-hour rally was "very peaceful, 
very organized, went just as planned. There were no arrests." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Florida Straits, meanwhile, rescues of Cuban rafters continued to 
decline. On Saturday, 130 Cuban rafters were picked up, compared with more than 
300 picked up Friday, according to the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 Cubans were plucked from the sea on both Tuesday and 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in the number of Cubans attempting to make the dangerous crossing 
aboard small boats and flimsy rafts may be due to the weather, which has been 
occasionally stormy, or to the growing realization in Cuba that those 
intercepted at sea will be interned indefinitely at the U.S. Naval Base at 
Guantanamo Bay, on Cuba's eastern tip. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 13,500 Cubans are now being held in the Guantanamo tent city, and 
more than 1,000 are aboard Coast Guard ships in the Straits as they await 
transfer to the base, Chief Petty Officer Steve Sapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather in the Straits was improving Saturday. As a wave of low pressure 
moved westward into the Gulf of Mexico, National Hurricane Center forecaster 
Jim Lushine said waves in the waters between the United States and Cuba would 
diminish to two to four feet, which is normal. 
</P>
<P>
 However, another tropical wave, along with the potential for more 
thunderstorms and turbulence, was expected to arrive in the area late 
Wednesday, he said.

<P>
 An earthquake measuring magnitude 3.9 shook Hollister on Saturday night, but 
there were no reports of damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake hit at 6:22 p.m., said Pat Jorgenson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. 
Geological Survey in Menlo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake was centered on a "creeping" section of the San Andreas Fault, 
Jorgenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(This part of the fault) has never been known to have earthquakes larger than 
5 points in magnitude because it's been releasing stress at nice, regular 
intervals," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The epicenter was located about 12 miles east of Hollister. Police there 
reported no damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollister is about 85 miles southeast of San Francisco.

MIKE PENNER: SAVE RAMS? HOW ABOUT THE FANS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Save The Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about your loaded propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 How does a community even begin to set about saving a football team that can't 
save itself? 
</P>
<P>
 Take a look at this list of goodies one group of influential Ram die-hards -- 
there can be no other term for them -- dropped on top of John Shaw's desk last 
week: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sixty million dollars to turn Anaheim Stadium from a trailer 
park-in-waiting into a fully functional football-only amphitheater for the 
'90s, complete with 100-plus luxury suites and waiter service, a la Joe Robbie 
Stadium, in the club level. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fifty million dollars, in the form of a minority purchase of the team, to 
help Georgia Frontiere sustain the lifestyle to which she has become accustomed 
-- minus the headache and inconvenience of flying her social circle in for home 
games eight times a year in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A new team corporate headquarters and practice facility, including 2 1/2 
practice fields, weight room and 400 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An intensive plan to market the Rams in Orange County, which would be a 
15-year first, at no extra cost to the Rams -- in essence, doing the Rams' work 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw looked the list over for a couple minutes and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Too light, he assessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, of course, it is. The Save The Rams proposal fails to provide the Rams 
with what they need most -- pass rushers who actually rush the passer, 
cornerbacks who can cover, linebackers who can tackle, pass catchers who can 
catch, kick returners who don't fumble the ball out of bounds at the one-yard 
line, an offensive line and, finally, some coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, come on, Save The Rams. If you really want to help . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It would be laughable -- a scream, really -- if it weren't for that dull, 
sickening pain in the pit of every remaining Ram fan's stomach, all 68 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Orange County's best and brightest -- major domo politicos, 
high-powered sports agents, corporation presidents -- fall over themselves in 
an attempt to appease a football team that can't stop falling over itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Save The Rams. Not Save The 49ers, mind you, or Please Don't Take Our Dolphins 
Away -- some worthy cause such as that. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the "Save The 11-30 In Our Last 41 Games (Counting Exhibitions), 0-4 
In Our Next Four Games (Just You Wait And See), Bringing Up The Rear In the NFC 
West Because It's The Only Way We Know, Here Comes The Fifth Pick In The Draft 
And Watch Us Blow It Again Rams" we're talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 What next? 
</P>
<P>
 Save The Dry Rot Under Your Bathroom Floor? 
</P>
<P>
 Let us lay this out in lay terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose you owned a small business -- a doughnut shop, say -- and for four 
years you stocked your display shelves with the same old garbage. Deep-fried, 
sugar-crusted glop that should carry a cardiologist's warning. Brick-hard bear 
claws. Battery acid in a coffee cup. Crullers from hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Citywide, 27 other pastry shops were competing for your business. Some 
introduced lines of healthful olallieberry and oat bran muffins. Others 
purchased fancy brass espresso makers. All of them advertised on television. 
</P>
<P>
 You, meanwhile, kept short hours and your phone number unlisted. You did no 
promotion. Your dilapidated store had become a neighborhood eyesore. With sales 
down, you determined the only solution was to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, several wealthy community leaders are at your door, offering to buy 
you new ovens, new equipment, renovate the whole place. A multimillion-dollar 
marketing campaign is proposed. A rent reduction is discussed. The deal is 
this: You keep doing what you're doing -- nothing, in other words -- and 
they'll make you rich. 
</P>
<P>
 And you tell them, sorry, too light, thanks but no thanks, I have better 
offers elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Some business, pro football. Where else can a company run itself into the 
ground, alienate its entire potential customer base and then hold all the 
leverage -- or believe it has it -- in negotiations with the community about 
the future of the franchise? 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw would like to think he has Orange County over a barrel. Well, maybe he 
ought to check that barrel again for termite damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis option is drying up because the ownership group there is 
currently more confused than the Ram coaching staff. This is a cast of bunglers 
who lost a slam-dunk expansion bid to Jacksonville and has already annoyed the 
ever-surreptitious Shaw by leaking his list of demands to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore has been shaky from the start, due to the Washington Redskins' plans 
to build a new stadium in nearby Laurel, Md. -- the NFL not being keen on the 
idea on market saturation in Maryland. The death of Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner 
Hugh Culverhouse adds another potential crimp. Soon, presumably, there will be 
two franchises in play, and in the eyes of Baltimore's Peter Angelos, the 
Buccaneers have to look so much more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Angelos can purchase majority interest in the Buccaneers -- an option 
not available to him with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, compare the products. The Buccaneers have Trent Dilfer, the Rams 
have Wayne Gandy. Angelos is not a dumb man. 
</P>
<P>
 A month or two from now, that Save The Rams proposal could be the best friend 
Shaw has. Certainly, it is better than the Rams deserve. New headquarters, new 
practice facility, new promotional campaign, new inside of the stadium, new 
outside of the stadium . . . same old lousy football. 
</P>
<P>
 Save The Rams? It's amazing anyone still cares. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw should take that as a personal victory, cash it in now and get on with 
the program that truly deserves our attention and support: 
</P>
<P>
 Save The Ram Fans.

QUARTERBACK COUNTY; AREA'S ALUMNI SIGNAL-CALLERS EXCEL AT HITTING THEIR MARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Namath played second fiddle to this former Orange County star in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Joe Willie, Gale Sayers nor Dick Butkus could pry the Heisman Trophy 
away from him. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame quarterback John Huarte, the former Mater Dei standout who earned 
Southern Section Major Division player of the year honors in 1960, won college 
football's most coveted award that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years later, Stanford's Steve Stenstrom and USC's Rob Johnson -- both 
from El Toro High -- are two of the top candidates for the Heisman Trophy this 
season. At a recent photo shoot, the former teammates played a friendly 
tug-of-war with the prized trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Call them the dueling Chargers from Quarterback County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really exciting to see," said Johnson's father, Bob, who coached both 
players at El Toro. "I don't know how much better it can get." 
</P>
<P>
 And Stenstrom and Johnson aren't the only Orange County alumni who are 
enjoying success on the collegiate level. Former Mater Dei quarterback Danny 
O'Neil returns for Oregon after passing for 3,224 yards and 22 touchdowns 
</P>
<P>
 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 California's Pat Barnes, former Trabuco Hills quarterback, and Stanford's Tim 
Carey, of Los Alamitos, are waiting in the wings for their shots at stardom. In 
addition, four high school quarterbacks from the county's Class of 1994 earned 
football scholarships to Division I-A schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We develop more quarterbacks here," Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes said of 
the Southland. "I don't think anyone in the country does the stuff like we do 
here -- the year-round training, practicing and teaching the quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the county has always produced top quarterbacks, from Mater 
Dei's Huarte, who played for five professional teams from 1966-75, to San 
Clemente's Bill Kenney, who was with the Kansas City Chiefs from 1979-88, to 
current Arizona Cardinal quarterback Steve Beuerlein, who played at Servite. 
</P>
<P>
 And it doesn't appear many things have changed or will change over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Stanford Coach Bill Walsh: "We will always have a style of football on 
the West Coast that's conducive to the quarterback and his success." NATURE OR 
NURTURE? 
</P>
<P>
 So what's more important, a big quarterback who can throw the ball nine miles 
or a smart quarterback who knows how to exploit defenses? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes a 6-foot-4 quarterback can be too tall," Stanford assistant coach 
Terry Shea said. "I would just as soon find the 6-2 athletic quarterback. But 
you recruit for your system, and it's usually a two-to-three-year process 
before someone is ready to contribute." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Johnson, who guided El Toro to three Southern Section championships, said 
the bottom line is that the talent needs to be there first before coaches can 
begin to cultivate it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't take a kid with a football, go outside and throw and practice all 
the time and say, 'You're going to be good,' " Johnson said. "Although I think 
the high school level coaching in Orange County is the best I've seen, you 
better have the product there first." 
</P>
<P>
 Said John Barnes: "There's some coaches that really know how to throw the 
football in Southern California, and they're teaching the quarterbacks. I 
played quarterback in college (at Nevada) and the defense I was seeing wasn't 
half of what the kids see now." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the mild weather in California, quarterbacks can develop more 
quickly with year-round training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years ago, it used to be that you could be a great passer and throw 40 
interceptions," Barnes said. "Now, you could be a pretty good passer but make 
completion after completion because you know where the weaknesses in the 
defenses are." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Johnson said a perfect example was Mike Good, the Division II player of 
the year who led Los Alamitos to its third consecutive section title last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a kid who had a tremendous work ethic and benefited from the system 
he was in," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added John Barnes: "There were so many times when we would call a play and my 
assistant in the press box would phone down to me and say, 'Coach, what's Mike 
doing checking off like that?' I'd say, 'I don't know, but I'll bet he's doing 
the right thing.' 
</P>
<P>
 "A prime example of that is we're facing a fourth and 10 against Downey Warren 
in the playoffs, and Mike starts checking off. He throws for a touchdown and 
we're thinking, 'Man, the fans think we're smart now.' But we had no idea what 
he was going to do. All we know is that we taught him the right thing." HISTORY 
LESSON 
</P>
<P>
 The list of top quarterbacks who have played in the county is mind-boggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is just a sample, with some of their exploits: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Huarte led Notre Dame to a 9-1 record and passed for 2,062 yards his 
Heisman Trophy season. He was drafted by but never played a down for the New 
York Jets, who also selected Namath from Alabama the same year. He played 11 
seasons of pro ball, with stops in the AFL, NFL and World Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kenney, from Northern Colorado, played professionally for Kansas City, 
where he passed for 17,277 yards, second in club history to Len Dawson. In 
fact, Kenney trails only Dawson in most club passing categories, but he holds 
the Chiefs' records for single-season yardage (4,348) and completions (346). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frank Seurer, who played at Edison High and Kansas, also played for the 
Kansas City Chiefs and the L.A. Express of the USFL. In 1979, Seurer passed for 
2,063 yards and 23 touchdowns to help Edison win the Big Five championship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Beuerlein was a four-year starter at Notre Dame before moving up to the 
NFL. He played with the Raiders, then was traded to the Dallas Cowboys, where 
he earned a world championship ring in 1992 serving as Troy Aikman's backup. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bobby Acosta of Western was the 1972 Major Division player of the year and 
earned a scholarship to UCLA. Jim Karsatos of Sunny Hills played at Ohio State 
from 1982-1985 and briefly in the NFL with the Miami Dolphins. J.T. Snow, the 
California Angel first baseman, and Todd Gragnano were the trailblazers for 
Carey, Good and future quarterbacks at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The most recent heyday of county quarterbacks came in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the South Coast League, Rob Johnson's brother, Bret, earned 1987 Southern 
Conference player of the year honors before moving on to play for UCLA as a 
freshman. His rivals included Todd Marinovich of Capistrano Valley, who would 
play for USC and the Raiders, and Troy Kopp of Mission Viejo, who played at 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bret was the best playmaker of any high school quarterback I've seen," John 
Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson followed Bret at El Toro, but only after spending a season as 
Stenstrom's favorite receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "That time in the South Coast League, man, it almost got me fired," Irvine 
Coach Terry Henigan said. "I know we have some good coaches down here, but Bob 
Johnson wasn't that good. By golly, that was a fluke. Seeing Bret, Marinovich, 
Stenstrom, Kopp, and Rob among others, all in the same league in that brief 
period of time? Wow." THE FUTURE 
</P>
<P>
 While Stenstrom and Johnson are in the spotlight now, two of the Pacific 10's 
potential stars are patiently playing reserve roles in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Barnes passed for 6,182 yards during his career (1990-93) at Trabuco 
Hills, fourth-best in Orange County history. He is currently second on Cal's 
depth chart behind Dave Barr, who is considered an NFL prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey led the Griffins to a 14-14 tie with Esperanza in the 1992 Division II 
title game, his second championship in as many seasons. But after red-shirting 
last season at Stanford, Carey is battling for the second--string spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's handling it great," John Barnes said. "He's competing hard for the job, 
but he's not getting discouraged and he's going to stick it out at Stanford." 
</P>
<P>
 Other former county quarterbacks holding clipboards this fall include four 
players from the Class of '94 -- Scott Bertoni (Fountain Valley) at Nevada, 
Brandon Brennan (Western) at Fresno State, Mike Phelps (Irvine) at Oregon and 
Scott Covington (Dana Hills) at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dennis Erickson of Miami coveted Covington for his size (6-4, 180) and 
arm strength, despite Dana Hills' 1-9 record last season. Mike Phelps (6-5, 
210) didn't complete a varsity pass before his senior year, but led Irvine to a 
third consecutive section title last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Justin Vedder of Laguna Hills also earned a scholarship to Boston 
University, and Good earned one to Northern Arizona. Both schools are Division 
I-AA. 
</P>
<P>
 Good's statistics were comparable to Carey's, passing for 2,969 yards and 35 
touchdowns last season while Carey passed for 3,397 yards and 35 touchdowns in 
1992. Although Good and Vedder put up good numbers, they were lacking in one 
important number: height. 
</P>
<P>
 So while Stanford, UCLA, USC and every major school in the country recruited 
Carey (6-4), Good (6-0) and Vedder (6-1) received few offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike (Good) had an outstanding season and he's worked extremely hard to get 
where he's at," Bob Johnson said. "He couldn't be happier with his situation 
going to Northern Arizona, and I'm happy for him. But every quarterback has his 
own level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides the work ethic and being able to throw the ball year-round, you need 
to have the talent to reach the next level.  
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys who make it in college, you're talking about real athletes. There 
aren't many of them, and it runs in cycles. Because of the talent level, I 
don't think you'll see as many quarterbacks sign with Division I schools this 
season because there were so many last season." 
</P>
<P>
 While the talent pool may change, the coaching, which is among the best 
anywhere, remains a constant. Expect Quarterback County to continue to 
flourish.

WOODS REACHES AMATEUR FINAL; GOLF: CYPRESS 18-YEAR-OLD COULD BECOME YOUNGEST 
CHAMPION IN U.S. TOURNAMENT'S 94-YEAR HISTORY WITH VICTORY TODAY AGAINST 
KUEHNE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tiger Woods of Cypress is balancing on the edge of history in the U.S. 
Amateur, which has him overcome with indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential for becoming the youngest champion in the tournament's 94-year 
history, replacing 19-year-olds Louis James (1902), Robert Gardner (1909), Jack 
Nicklaus (1959), Bruce Fleisher (1968) and Nathaniel Crosby (1981)? 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly joining Bobby Smith and Carolyn Cudone as the only golfers to win 
U.S. Golf Assn. titles in four consecutive years? Didn't know. Probably doesn't 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 Records, say this well-seasoned 18-year-old, merely are the product of playing 
good golf. And playing good golf is all that consumes him going into today's 
36-hole final against Trip Kuehne of Oklahoma City at The Players Championship 
at Sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehne, of McKinney, Tex., beat his Oklahoma State teammate and close friend, 
Kris Cox, 1-up in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't the same as when I won the U.S. Junior Amateur the first time. . . 
It doesn't matter," said Woods, who won the first of three consecutive Junior 
Amateur titles at 15. "That's the product of playing good golf. The first thing 
you've got to do is take care of business. If the record falls, whatever. What 
matters is I've got to do what I need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is exactly what he has done through the week. Make that the entire year. 
His 5 and 3 victory over Kent State All-American Eric Frishette of Carroll, 
Ohio, was his 18th match play victory of the year against only one loss. 
</P>
<P>
 After a sluggish start, which saw him continue his ability to save pars from 
off the greens, Woods took control of the match with a run of four birdies over 
six holes. It started on the par-4 sixth. By the time he birdied the par-5 
11th, Woods was 4-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Frishette had early opportunities, but unlike Woods, his putting finally 
abandoned him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I had a chance to get up on him early, but I didn't make any putts," 
said Frishette, 22, who plans to try the PGA Tour qualifying this fall. "If 
you're not making any putts, it's hard to stay with him. He hit me with a 
birdie run there." 
</P>
<P>
 Frishette was particularly impressed by Woods' distance off the tee, saying he 
"just overpowered the golf course today." 
</P>
<P>
 Two examples came on the par 5s, the 582-yard 9th and the 529-yard 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 rarely has been reached by the touring pros at TPC; the last to do so 
was Steve Elkington when he won in 1991. Saturday, Woods had 283 yards to the 
hole and cut a three-wood just in front of the green, setting up an easy chip 
and putt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have gotten there by drawing the ball, but I didn't want to risk 
pulling the ball into the trees," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 His other Herculean feat was hitting a 3-iron from 235 yards pin high on No. 
11, 20 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I feel pretty confident about my game," Woods said. "I've learned 
how to manage my mistakes a little more. Basically, I've grown up." 
</P>
<P>
 But not to the point of worrying about records.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; YEARS TO CHEERS TO TEARS; A HUSKY 
THROUGH AND THROUGH, WASHINGTON'S LAMBRIGHT FINALLY HAS REACHED THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Finally, it all caught up to him.  
</P>
<P>
 Here was a 52-year-old man standing before his football team . . . and crying, 
unashamedly. When Jim Lambright became Washington's football coach a year ago, 
replacing Don James, who abruptly resigned after 17 years, Lambright was 
suddenly a head coach, after 29 years in coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 He went numb, and stayed numb for about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much time to think about it. The opener against Stanford was only 
12 days away when he became Washington's 22nd coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after his team had beaten Stanford, 31-14, Lambright was about to talk 
to his team when his players suddenly burst into a wall-knocking chant: 
</P>
<P>
 "Lambo! Lambo! Lambo! Lambo!" 
</P>
<P>
 That's when he lost it. In an instant, there was no more adrenaline. The 
nights of three hours' sleep caught up to him and he fully realized he was now 
a head coach. The decades of waiting were over.  
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, I couldn't catch my breath," he said the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd been through so much turmoil with the sanctions (Washington is in the 
second year of two-year, conference-imposed sanctions, which include a bowl 
ban), Don leaving, my getting the job . . . I'd gotten exhausted, I think, and 
didn't realize it. So I got emotional." 
</P>
<P>
 The chant was a tribute, from a team's heart, said team captain Andy Mason. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our way of saying, 'This is your team now. This is your first 
victory,' " he said. "We wanted him to know we appreciated all the time he'd 
put in, all the sleepless nights. We knew he'd been sleeping in his office." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Lambright is a Husky.  
</P>
<P>
 He was born and raised in Washington, played for Washington and was an 
assistant coach there for 24 years, until Aug. 22, 1993, when he became the 
head man.  
</P>
<P>
 Lambright's first team went 7-4 last year. His second is USC's first opponent, 
Saturday at 12:30 p.m., at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, Washington football is becoming Lambright football.  
</P>
<P>
 The most visible reminder last season of the program that was James' for 17 
years was his practice-field tower. It's gone, dispatched to a university 
equipment yard. James, the taciturn, aloof type, was a tower guy, like Bear 
Bryant.  
</P>
<P>
 "Don would stay up in the tower all season," Lambright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd come down maybe two, three times a season. But when he came down, there 
was hell to pay. Every assistant coach would know when his foot hit that first 
ladder rung, and we'd wonder, 'Is he coming in my direction?' When he came 
down, it meant a big problem was about to be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time we had an awful practice. There were six or eight fights. Don hated 
practice fights. He came down, and he was volcanic. He physically challenged 
every player on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a great view of (Lake Washington) from up there, but I'm just not a 
tower guy. If I'm not emotionally involved, or having direct contact with 
everything that's going on, I don't feel like I'm coaching. Don was 
introverted. He had a hard time getting to know people. I'm the opposite of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recruiting was hard for Don. When he made a home visit, he had a set speech 
that went 45 minutes, and he was out the door. With me, the parents wind up 
having to throw me out. I love to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don's strength as a head coach was his sense of efficiency, how he organized 
everything.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've never met anyone with a memory like Don James'. He can tell you exactly 
how many miles he put on his car in 1993, versus 1992. Or exactly how many 
practice golf balls he hit in 1992, compared to 1993. He has a fantastic memory 
for detail." 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset, Lambright showed no hesitation in making decisions.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, in the season's first month: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He ordered All-American tailback and current Heisman Trophy hopeful 
Napoleon Kaufman to stop end zone theatrics after touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He suspended the team's best receiver, Jason Shelley, for breaking a team 
rule.  
</P>
<P>
 And he immediately showed he liked go-for-broke offensive football. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 21-6 victory over Oregon, Lambright three times ordered his offense to go 
for it on fourth and short. The Huskies converted all three.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's made some gutsy calls that we haven't seen around here for a long time," 
said tackle D'Marco Farr. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, go-for-it calls on fourth and short come a little easier when 
you're on probation and not playing for the Rose Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 Although he was Washington's defensive coordinator for 16 seasons, Lambright 
isn't thought of as a conservative offensive thinker.  
</P>
<P>
 "When Keith Gilbertson (now Cal's head coach) was our offensive coordinator in 
1991 (a Washington national championship season), I developed a keen 
appreciation of what an offense can do, when it's given some latitude," 
Lambright told Theresa Smith of the Tacoma Morning News Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can do something that's relatively smart, maybe a little risky but 
exciting for the players and fans, it's worth doing. If nothing else, it's good 
to have trick plays on film -- it gives other teams one other thing to worry 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 For 24 years, Lambright quietly endured the heartbreak of not becoming a head 
coach. He was interviewed for several jobs but never got them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting the job after Don left wasn't a shock to anyone, I don't think," he 
said. "Don had given me every indication a couple of years ago that he intended 
to stay only two or three more years, that I was the logical successor.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I had it a lot easier than a lot of guys who never seem to get that head 
job. I never had to sell my house and move to another city. And I've always 
loved Seattle. I've always loved coaching here.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never lost hope. The success we've had here, that's kept me happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Washington coach Jim Owens, now 67 and living in Bigfork, Mont., still 
remembers Lambright the player as a feisty, undersized guy who never quit.  
</P>
<P>
 "We recruited Jim because we saw him as a guy who would give you everything he 
had," Owens said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't do much his first three years, but he kept plugging away and he 
made a huge improvement between his junior and senior years. He got our 
most-inspirational-player award his senior year.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was absolutely delighted when he got the job, because he'd been so loyal to 
the program for so many years, waiting for his chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Lambright fear Husky followers turning more quickly on a 50ish coach than 
on a 30ish head man? Would a couple of disappointing seasons fuel whispers of: 
"The guy was never a head coach -- and we're starting to see why." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm not worried about that," he said. "I've been here a long time, I know 
the caliber of our fans up here -- they're very loyal people." 
</P>
<P>
 As head coach, he said, he splits his time equally between offense and 
defense.  
</P>
<P>
 Another inevitable sign that Lambright has taken over: New faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambright brought in 19 recruits last spring and three new coaches: an 
offensive coordinator, Bill Diedrick; wide-receiver coach Scott Linehan, and 
promoted a graduate assistant, Rick Mallory, to tight-end coach. 
</P>
<P>
 And a year later, there are fewer phone calls between James and Lambright. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first 10 days or so, we talked every day," Lambright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was mostly about where stuff was. Now, I couldn't find him anyway, 
even if I needed him. He's on the golf course nearly every day." 
</P>
<P>
 He now thinks, he says, like a head coach when hiring assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The downfall of so many head coaches is that they tend to hire from within, 
or too many friends from the old days," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The trap you fall into there is that your program becomes in-bred -- too many 
guys who think like you do.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, you need to hire guys who think differently than you do, or who 
will disagree with you on some things. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I let my assistants coach. Or I try to. I'll take a step toward, say, the 
defense in practice, the assistant will glare at me, and I'll pull up, 
thinking, 'OK, OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Two more signs that a new guy is in charge: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The new hideaway couch-bed in the head coach's office. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The new wardrobe.  
</P>
<P>
 Lambright and his wife, Lynne, live on five acres -- with horses and chickens 
-- in Stanwood, Wash., an hour's drive north of Seattle. Lambright spent his 
first dozen or so nights as head coach on his office floor, in a sleeping bag 
-- or until Lynne had the hide-a-bed delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 They met in the late 1970s, when Lambright was recruiting her son, Brent 
Mackie. At the time, Lynne was a cake decorator in a supermarket.  
</P>
<P>
 After the couch, the new suits arrived. Before, Lambright dressed like . . . 
well, an assistant football coach.  
</P>
<P>
 "I admit it, I looked like a guy who'd just walked in off Route 40," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, the suits are new, the shoes shined and he even goes to the barber 
regularly. The price for all this has been some unmerciful ribbing by players 
and assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early last season, coach came walking into the offices in one of those suits 
and I had to look twice, because I didn't recognize him," Kaufman said. "I'd 
never seen him when he wasn't in a jogging suit, or shorts and a T-shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Until a year ago, Lambright had never been a head coach at any level.  
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Washington, he was an assistant high school coach in 
Seattle and then became an assistant at Shoreline Community College in Seattle, 
when he got the call to return to UW.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget it," he said. "I was teaching an ice skating class at 
Highland Ice Arena when the guy on the PA said: 'Jim Lambright, we have a call 
from Jim Owens for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That was 1969. He's been on Washington's football staff ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lambright, the Owens era (1957-74) was the best of times.  
</P>
<P>
 "The best part of those years were the parties at Owens' house on the lake, 
after winning big home games," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can still remember being in Owens' pool at 3 a.m. and seeing Jim's wife, 
Martha, serving everyone tequila sunrises, and telling everyone what she was 
going to serve for breakfast. Owens ran up great expense reports." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches aren't normally party animals, of course. If you hate long hours, it's 
a lousy profession. But Lambright's entire life has been long hours. In fact, 
he at times literally worked around the clock before getting into coaching.  
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was a commercial fisherman," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a 55-foot boat, a purse seiner, moored in Everett. In the salmon 
seasons of June and July when I was a kid, dad and I and four crewmen would 
fish all over Southeast Alaska, out of Ketchikan and Juneau.  
</P>
<P>
 "On a good summer, we'd go back to Everett with several thousand pounds of 
salmon. I did this in the summers when I played for Owens, and it really built 
up my hands and forearms, wrestling with all that equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never considered it work. Neither did my dad. We loved it. Whenever I had a 
chance, I'd drop a line overboard just to fish for fun."

NORTHRIDGE COMES UP SHORT; BASEBALL: VENEZUELA OVERCOMES THREE-HOUR RAIN DELAY 
TO WIN LITTLE LEAGUE TITLE, 4-3. 
</P>

<P>
 What is it with Northridge and Mother Nature? 
</P>
<P>
 An earthquake could be overcome. A thunderstorm could not. 
</P>
<P>
 Outplaying Maracaibo, Venezuela, until a three-hour rain delay, Northridge was 
at times as sloppy as the field conditions when play resumed, falling, 4-3, 
Saturday in the Little League World Series championship game at Howard J. 
Lamade Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "That rain really got us," Northridge shortstop Matt Fisher said. "We had the 
momentum, but after we stopped they scored right away and turned it around." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the game was scoreless when play was suspended in the third inning, 
Northridge batters were hitting the ball hard and a few of the Venezuelan 
players were beginning to lose their composure. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposite was true after the delay. Venezuela racked up seven of its eight 
hits and Northridge had only three. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Northridge (20-2, 3-2 in series play) stayed close. The 15,000 fans who 
remained from the crowd of 35,000 before the delay watched Venezuela score runs 
in the third and fourth innings. But Northridge answered with two in the bottom 
of the fourth to tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezuela responded with two runs in the fifth on four hits and two wild 
pitches, but Spencer Gordon homered in the bottom of the inning to keep 
Northridge within one run. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezuela right-hander Cesar Hidalgo retired the side in order in the sixth, 
however, giving Latin America its first Series championship since Monterrey, 
Mexico, won in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was so important to us and to our country because no Latin American team 
had done it in so long," Manager Ramon Diaz said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo, who turned 13 today, seemed to get stronger after the delay, striking 
out the side in the third and finishing with 10 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 No thunderstorm could compare to the devastating Jan. 17 earthquake, but to 
the Northridge players, the impact was jarring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rain and thunder caused us to lose, it totally disrupted our game," 
outfielder Michael Nesbit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Impacted the greatest was Northridge right-hander Justin Gentile. He was much 
sharper before the rain, retiring seven of eight batters. There were two out 
with no one on base in the top of the third when play was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 The thunderstorm, though short, dropped three inches of rain, and about 10 
inches of standing water in the left-field corner had to be drained. 
</P>
<P>
 Also drained was Northridge Manager Larry Baca, who fell asleep in his 
dormitory during the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking to (a Little League official), then the next thing I knew I was 
waking up," he said. "I felt the way I do after a game is over, worn out." 
</P>
<P>
 When the game resumed, Effinson Mora doubled down the right-field line. 
Gentile's next pitch sailed over catcher Matt Cunningham's head and Mora 
advanced to third. Esteban Avila singled sharply to right and Venezuela led, 
1-0. Erik Villalobos singled to put runners on first and second, but Avila 
strayed too far off second after a pitch to Guillermo Quiroz and Cunningham 
threw to second to start a rundown that ended the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezuela's baserunning bordered on reckless, but a gamble in the fifth scored 
the decisive run. After driving in the third run with a single and advancing to 
third on two more singles, Avila broke for home on a pitch in the dirt that 
slipped past Cunningham. The Northridge catcher picked up the ball in time to 
beat Avila to the plate, but Cunningham hesitated before breaking, and Avila 
beat the tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile threw five wild pitches, all after the delay. Nine of the first 14 
batters after play resumed reached base, seven on hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready in relief was Peter Tuber, who posted Northridge's first Series victory 
and won three decisions in the Western Regional. But Baca stuck with Gentile, 
who pitched a one-hit shutout in his other Series appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started again, Gentile had trouble getting his fastball down," Baca 
said. "I was one batter away from replacing him, but he did just well enough to 
stay in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Baca disputed a call during Venezuela's fifth-inning rally. Hidalgo singled 
with two out to load the bases, but Baca claimed the hitter had stepped out of 
the batter's box, a call the umpire had made on a different Venezuelan batter 
in the second inning. Avila scored on the wild pitch moments later. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo retired the side in order in the final inning to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't lose because the Venezuelan kids were over-age, or because somebody 
stepped out of the batter's box," said Greg Frost, father of Northridge second 
baseman Michael Frost, as the teams engaged in a postgame handshake. "We lost 
because we got beat by a team that played better than us today. Believe me, our 
kids will accept that." World Series Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge center fielder Nathaniel Dunlap left the game in top of the fifth 
inning. He was hit in the right hand swinging at a fastball in the third inning 
and was diagnosed by a team doctor as having a broken thumb. . . . First 
baseman Matt Cassel led Northridge in hitting during the Series, going 6 for 14 
for a .429 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar Hidalgo, the Venezuelan pitcher, has a brother, Jose, playing for the 
Baltimore Orioles' Class-A affiliate in Sarasota, Fla. . . . Venezuela has been 
to the World Series seven times, but this is its first championship. Only 
Canada has earned more trips to the Series, with eight.

TRIO LIFTS RAIDERS, CHANCES; PRO FOOTBALL: KORS, JORDAN AND HOBBS STAND OUT BUT 
NOW AWAIT THE WORD AFTER THRILLING 24-23 VICTORY OVER OILERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One last chance to make an impression. One last game to make an impact. One 
last day to change some minds. 
</P>
<P>
 For the secure veterans, Saturday's exhibition finale between the Raiders and 
Houston Oilers was a necessary evil, a hazard to be avoided, if at all 
possible, to stay injury free before the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 But not for R.J. Kors. 
</P>
<P>
 Or Charles Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Or Daryl Hobbs. 
</P>
<P>
 All three of those Raiders are either still trying to make the team or trying 
to secure a better spot on the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
 And, with today's final cuts, all three made their case Saturday by playing 
key roles in a thrilling 24-23 victory in the Astrodome before a crowd of 
40,635. 
</P>
<P>
 Most early predictions include the Raiders as Super Bowl contenders. And they 
did nothing to hurt that opinion by winning four of five exhibitions, the best 
they've done since compiling the same mark in 1990, the last year the Raiders 
reached the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the players expected to play key roles this season had little or 
nothing to do with Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell hated the thought of losing a valuable starter a week before 
the regular season, especially on the artificial turf of the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
 So he gave quarterback Jeff Hostetler the day off. And he didn't play 
banged-up veterans such as defensive lineman Chester McGlockton (bruised leg) 
and defensive back Lionel Washington (hamstring). 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Shell turned this game over to his younger players and he stuck with 
them when his team needed a late rally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' first-half offense had consisted of three field goals by Jeff 
Jaeger. Jaeger connected from 20, 42 and 38 yards, allowing him to finish the 
exhibition season with 10 field goals in 11 tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston (2-3) stayed even in the first 30 minutes. The Oilers scored a 
touchdown when defensive lineman Lamar Lathon hit quarterback Vince Evans, 
causing the ball to pop up in the air. It came down in the arms of Eddie 
Robinson. With a clear field in front of him, the Houston linebacker ran 40 
yards to the end zone. Al Del Greco's 43-yard field goal tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Kors. 
</P>
<P>
 For the former Long Beach State defensive back, merely playing was an 
accomplishment, considering he was cut from the squad four days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was signed to a Raider contract for the third time this summer on 
Wednesday night, back at practice Thursday and in the right spot Saturday when 
Houston quarterback Sean Salisbury overthrew intended receiver Spencer Tillman 
on the Oilers' first drive of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball sailed into the hands of Kors, usually a safety but playing 
cornerback on Saturday, and he sailed into the end zone 38 yards away 
untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Kors think that play helped him avoid today's cuts? 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't worry about that," he said. "If you worry about that, you'll get an 
ulcer. I'm just trying to create a future for myself by making plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Two field goals by Del Greco, from 46 and 40 yards, followed by a three-yard 
touchdown pass from Bucky Richardson to John Henry Mills and a two-point 
conversion run by Le'Shai Maston put Houston back on top, 23-16. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the Raiders' last possession, third-string quarterback Billy Joe 
Hobert, who played three quarters Saturday, drove his team 66 yards to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It came down to third and 10 at the Oiler 15-yard line with 38 seconds to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobert, who completed 10 of 24 passes for 191 yards, raced around in the 
backfield, spotted Jordan in the end zone and let the ball fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Too short. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. With defensive back Blaine Bishop in his way, Jordan, a product of 
Long Beach City College, leaped over Bishop's left shoulder, caught the ball, 
flipped head over heels and came down in the end zone, still clutching his 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Tying conversion kick? 
</P>
<P>
 Not for Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to keep playing," he said. "We were going to roll the dice and 
go home." 
</P>
<P>
 This time Hobert rolled right and found Hobbs, who dived and came up with the 
winning catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way to end," said Hobbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially if you're a young player trying to get started. Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Raider defensive backs Derrick Hoskins and James Trapp suffered knee injuries, 
but both left the field under their own power and neither is thought to be 
seriously hurt.

MIKE DOWNEY: THERE WAS ONLY ONE PLACE TO BE

<TEXT>
<P>
 I never miss a World Series. I wasn't about to miss this World Series. It 
didn't matter if it was a Little League World Series. It was a World Series, so 
I wanted to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 But where? I wanted to watch the World Series with others, the way I usually 
do. Not home alone in front of my TV. I wanted crowds around me, cheering and 
munching junk food and giving five. I wanted to be like Randle P. McMurphy in 
the cuckoo's nest, screaming up at the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 I needed a place to watch the game -- some place in Northridge. After all, 
this was Northridge's own World Series. I decided to watch it there, because 
Northridge had America's team. Saturday afternoon, Northridge was the place to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 But where? In a restaurant? In a gas station? I didn't know anybody in 
Northridge. ABC-TV had agreed to air the game live, but where could I watch it? 
</P>
<P>
 In a bar? No, not in a bar. You don't watch a Little League game in a bar. 
Although as I drove my car through Northridge, looking for a spot to stop, I 
did pass a cocktail lounge called the Classroom, at 8333 Tampa. Good name for a 
place to watch Little League baseball, I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Nahhh. I drove on. 
</P>
<P>
 Up ahead was the gigantic Northridge Fashion Center shopping mall. Hey, I 
hadn't been there for years. Good idea. I'll mosey over to Sears or one of the 
big stores, find a bank of big-screen TVs, maybe watch the Northridge team 
battle Venezuela on 50 screens at once! 
</P>
<P>
 Except when I got to the Fashion Center, it wasn't there. No signs of human 
life. You know, like Nevada. There were nothing but skeletal remains, empty 
buildings and girders. It looked like an erector set. 
</P>
<P>
 Here it was, a perfect summer Saturday afternoon, and the whole mall was a 
mess. Man, that crazy earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 I turned right at Devonshire and headed directly for the Northridge City 
Little League headquarters. Maybe everybody in town would be there, having a 
picnic, watching the game on itty-bitty Watchmans. I wondered what Little 
Leaguers looked like on little TVs. Then I remembered, most of Northridge's 
guys are larger than Brett Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Found the ballfields. Nope, nobody home. All I could see was a marquee, 
announcing that the "Fall Ball" sign-up for Northridge Little League would be 
coming up soon. Oh, and by the way: "Managers Needed." On the fence hung a 
banner wishing good luck to the Northridge All-Stars at the World Series, plus 
another one listing every player's name. 
</P>
<P>
 I drove away. Still needed a place to watch the biggest game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to go, where to go. 
</P>
<P>
 I turned right and pulled up by the Northridge Chamber of Commerce office, 
8801 Reseda. Maybe the entire C of C would be having a wild party inside their 
office, with funny hats on and champagne in a bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 CLOSED, the sign read. OPEN 9 A.M. TUESDAY. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm, I thought. They must have given everybody Monday off for the big parade. 
See, the city council authorized a parade to begin Monday at 4 p.m. at 
Northridge Park, on the corner of Reseda and Mayall. Win or lose Saturday, the 
team deserved a big welcome home. 
</P>
<P>
 Nice idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the game? It was nearly 12:30. The opening pitch at 
Williamsport, Pa., was only minutes away. I was running out of ideas. Where 
would fans congregate to watch a big Little League baseball game? Where would 
grown-ups and kids go to eat, drink and boo Venezuela? Where could a guy like 
me fit right in? 
</P>
<P>
 As I pulled into the parking lot of Chuck E. Cheese, I was surprised by a 
couple of things. The first was that they had valet parking. Oh, I love 
California so much. 
</P>
<P>
 The second surprise was that when I walked through the door, none of the TVs 
in the corners of the room were turned on. Inside the restaurant were 
approximately seven-eighths of all Northridge children between ages 3 and 6, 
riding make-believe rocket ships and having pizza wiped off their faces. Not 
one of them was watching baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, well. Too young anyway, I figured. These kids weren't interested in 
Northridge vs. Maracaibo. These kids were interested in Bugs Bunny vs. Elmer 
Fudd. 
</P>
<P>
 I gave up. I drove home. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, I said to myself, baseball is baseball. You don't need crowds. You can 
watch baseball anywhere. Well, you can watch it anywhere except when it's on 
strike. You don't even need a hot dog and a cold drink. You can watch baseball 
with a cold dog and a hot drink. 
</P>
<P>
 My TV came on. It warmed up. I warmed up. It was raining in Pennsylvania. With 
lightning. And thunder. Didn't matter. Neither rain nor quake could keep 
Northridge's young males from their appointed crown. 
</P>
<P>
 So they lost, so what. 
</P>
<P>
 Best ballclub I saw all year.

BOOMING AGAIN; GERMANY'S BORIS BECKER, WHO HASN'T WON A GRAND SLAM TOURNAMENT 
SINCE 1991, HAS HIS GAME IN ORDER AND IS A GENUINE THREAT TO WIN THE U.S. OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Boris Becker, the afternoon of Aug. 5 at the Los Angeles Tennis Center at 
UCLA began like just another summer day at the office. It was oppressively hot, 
there were a few thousand well-dressed fans on hand to watch this Friday 
quarterfinal and he was the player they had come to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker was in Los Angeles to play in the L.A. Open, but the site and event 
mattered little. It could have been the Dubuque Open or the Daktar Classic, 
just as long as it was played on hard courts similar to those used for the U.S. 
Open. Pro tennis players live for the Grand Slam events and use tournaments in 
between as sharpening tools for the mind and body. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, Becker was dull of both. 
</P>
<P>
 He was facing a little-known fellow German, Karsten Braasch. Becker is a 
household name all over the world, Braasch barely outside his own household. 
Becker has won three Wimbledon titles and two other Grand Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1991 poll in Germany, Becker had a 98.1% recognition rating. The only 
thing Germans might recognize about Braasch is that he has one of the strangest 
serve windups, the kind that would awe a contortionist. 
</P>
<P>
 So the only thing of note was that Becker was losing, although even that 
wasn't real headline fodder anymore, since Becker had been doing a lot of that 
since winning his last Grand Slam title, the Australian Open, in 1991. The last 
time Becker played in a Grand Slam final was his 1991 Wimbledon loss to Michael 
Stich. The last time he was No. 1 in the world was also 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he was No. 11 and trailing a 5-foot-11, 160-pound left-hander who not only 
served like a surfer wriggling out of a wetsuit, but also patted the ball 
around the court like a weak Brad Gilbert. Against this, Boris (Boom Boom) 
Becker was being rendered as ineffective as a pop gun. He trailed, 6-2, 3-0. 
And shortly, it was 6-2, 5-4, with Braasch serving at 40-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Two match points against Becker. The rustle in the crowd was noticeable. It 
was to be another disappointment for his fans, another reason to nod knowingly 
while heading for the exits. Was the young man who had won a Wimbledon title at 
17 years 7 months washed up at 26 years 8 months? 
</P>
<P>
 Braasch stepped to the service line, unwound and sent a dart down the middle. 
The ball hooked just wide of the center line, missing as a match-winning ace by 
perhaps half an inch. 
</P>
<P>
 Boris Becker's comeback had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Were it to culminate with a victory in the U.S. Open, which begins Monday in 
New York's Flushing Meadow and ends with the men's final Sept. 11, it will not 
be too great a stretch to point to the Braasch match -- and that half-inch miss 
-- as the turning point for Becker. 
</P>
<P>
 Braasch double faulted on his second serve, choked a passing shot into the net 
on the next match point and went on to lose the game, the ensuing tiebreaker, 
7-1, and the third set, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Braasch said, "When you are serving for the match at 5-4 and it is 
Boris Becker on the other side of the net, you can't help but be thinking that 
it is Boris Becker." 
</P>
<P>
 For Becker, it was another resurrection in a career of many. 
</P>
<P>
 When he won the 1989 U.S. Open, he survived two match points against Derrick 
Rostagno in the second round. Now, having survived by half an inch against 
Braasch, Becker went on to beat Jason Stoltenberg in the semifinals, 6-4, 6-4, 
and Mark Woodforde in the final, 6-2, 6-2. It was only his second title on the 
ATP Tour in 30 events. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week, he went a few rounds before losing to Amos Mansdorf in 
Cincinnati, then followed that up a week ago by going through a strong field at 
the Volvo International in New Haven, Conn., without losing a set. 
</P>
<P>
 After dispatching Switzerland's Marc Rosset in the Volvo final, Becker said, 
"It's the best I've played all year." 
</P>
<P>
 So now, on the eve of the U.S. Open, the boom is back in Boris. 
</P>
<P>
 But where had it gone? 
</P>
<P>
 The short answer is that Becker, after 10 years on the tour, decided he wanted 
a life. But he decided he would acquire one in a different manner than, say, 
Bjorn Borg, who just walked away from it all one day. Becker married girlfriend 
Barbara Feltus, had a son and kept on playing, although with diminished 
intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that I wasn't in the greatest frame of mind," he said. "But I was 
still around and I still had the atmosphere of tournaments and I was physically 
in pretty good shape. I knew that the risk of taking a long break and coming 
back was much greater than of playing along and of playing tournaments. I 
thought it was the better thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker said most people, especially the press, couldn't comprehend what he was 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, it didn't fit in the picture when a man took time out to fix 
his private life," he said. "It didn't make a good story that a guy would 
actually, not really take time off, but not concentrate so hard anymore because 
you had to deal with other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost from that day in 1985 that he hustled and belly-flopped his way to a 
Wimbledon title and into the hearts and psyche of tennis fans everywhere, 
Becker has been something of a tortured hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Richman, writing in Gentlemen's Quarterly in 1991, characterized Becker's 
life as Celebrity Hell. In a recent interview with The Times' Jim Murray, 
Becker responded to a question about always being favored to win matches by 
saying, "It is a burden I've carried for 10 years. I've just learned to cope." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for Becker's special celebrity is that, unlike some of his 
fellow touring pros, he has a highly operable muscle above his shoulders. He is 
Boris, the philosopher, the Socrates of sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after winning his first Wimbledon title, he told a reporter about 
going home for a few weeks to his native Leimen, resting for a while and then 
going out to practice one day. Turning out to watch him were thousands of 
Germans, which prompted the then 18-year old, suddenly feeling like a pied 
piper, to theorize that he now better understood how the "Hitler thing" 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been a spokesman for UNICEF but was asked to step down when he refused 
to sign a paper saying he would never play in South Africa. It wasn't that he 
approved of apartheid. It was just that he refused to sign away that sort of 
lifetime freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 He once drove a Porsche through the back roads of Germany at speeds 
approaching 200 m.p.h., then expressed his embarrassment and regret when 
stopped by the police. He told Richman that he would sell the Porsche because 
he was already endorsing Fords and, because they were paying him nicely to do 
so, it was only fair of them to be upset with his Porsche escapade and only 
fair of him to be fair with Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 When he started slowly in the L.A. Open against Chuck Adams, before going on 
to win, 7-6, 6-1, Becker was asked about it and said, "It is not that I am 
necessarily a slow starter. I am a big finisher. Let's put it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 And when asked recently what his approach was to getting through a tournament, 
he said, "I do all I can to get to the semifinal. Once you get there, if God 
wants you to go on, you will." 
</P>
<P>
 After God, perhaps those best able to measure Becker's possible advance to the 
U.S. Open title are the Las Vegas bookies, who have Becker as a second choice 
behind defending champion Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 An uninjured Sampras has been a notch above all the others for about a year 
and a half, but Sampras continues to nurse a sore ankle, making this tournament 
much harder to call than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sampras has been above everybody else for quite a while now," Becker said. 
"It has been like him up here and then a few of us playing to see who is No. 2 
and 3 and 4. So we just like to bother him a little once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as poor Karsten Braasch can verify, when it is Boris Becker on the 
other side of the net, you can't help but be thinking that it is Boris Becker. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe even if you are Pete Sampras.

MORNING BRIEFING: IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE, BUT THEY GOT ALONG QUITE 
WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Does it seem as if Buddy Ryan and Jimmy Johnson miss each other? 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who is back in the league, stirring up fan interest and occasional 
mischief, and Johnson, who is back out of the league but stirring up interest 
and mischief anyhow, got together recently on Johnson's television show. 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to Ryan, the men who feuded furiously when they coached against 
one another in the NFC East got along beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went good, I think," said Ryan, whose Arizona Cardinals open the regular 
season against the Rams next Sunday. "I told him, 'Gee, the Cowboys really seem 
to miss you. They only beat Denver 34-10 the other day.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he said something about how hard my first few years would be, how he was 
1-15 his first year. I told him if there was any coaching going on, he'd have 
been 9-7." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Ryan: Asked what he thought of the Rams' precipitous drop in season-ticket 
sales and talk about moving to another city, compared to the ticket explosion 
and raised expectations his hiring triggered in Arizona, Ryan did not need to 
point out that he was available when the Rams hired Chuck Knox two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't surprise me what happened in Phoenix, because that's what happened 
when I was hired in Philadelphia," Ryan said. "And I know it would have 
happened in Tampa or wherever else I might have gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What is Jimmy Johnson's record against Buddy Ryan-coached teams? 
</P>
<P>
 Elvis hasn't left the minors: Yes, Kirk Presley is a distant cousin of the 
King. And no, he really doesn't want to talk about Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson, 
thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-year-old New York Met minor league right-handed pitching prospect was a 
No. 1 pick out of high school in Tupelo, Miss., and is playing for Pittsfield 
in the Class-A New York-Penn League. 
</P>
<P>
 "My granddad and Elvis' granddad are brothers," Presley said on a conference 
call with reporters. "My dad met him and my grandmother knew him well, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's never been a big deal for myself or my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Signed, sealed, delivered: New York Giant rookie wide receiver Thomas Lewis 
had mixed emotions when he lined up against future Hall of Fame safety Ronnie 
Lott in a recent exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put a move on him and got by him pretty easy and I thought, 'Hey, I beat 
Ronnie Lott. That's something I can tell my friends,' " Lewis told George 
Willis of Newsday. "But it was weird because after the game I still wanted to 
get his autograph." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Johnson was 0-4 against Ryan when Johnson coached the Cowboys 
and Ryan coached the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Washington Post columnist Michael Wilbon on the lack of star power 
as the U.S. Open tennis tournament begins: "The U.S. Open is tennis on 
Broadway. I want stars because stars create drama, which gets the stadium court 
all loud and vulgar, which produces the best tennis in the world." TIM KAWAKAMI

COLLEGE FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; PAC-10 CONFERENCE PREVIEW; SPOTLIGHT 
SHINES ON QUARTERBACKS, BUT DEFENSE IS KEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of the preseason talk about Pacific 10 Conference football has been about 
the abundance of quarterbacks, and rightly so. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as half a dozen of them figure to be among the best in the country. 
Some are genuine Heisman Trophy candidates and a number are on the NFL's 
"most-wanted" list. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Rob Johnson, Steve Stenstrom, Danny O'Neil, Dave Barr, Wayne Cook and 
others figure to take over the spotlight, let us not forget that another reason 
for the Pac-10's return to national prominence in recent years has been 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 When Washington opened the '90s with its powerhouse teams, the Huskies were 
especially strong on defense. That prompted the rest of the teams to shore up 
their defenses, and it is becoming a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA violations have hurt the Huskies, but Arizona has taken up the slack. 
However, it was not until the Wildcats humiliated Miami in the Fiesta Bowl, 
29-0, that Pac-10 hitting received its proper recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 During the regular season, the Wildcats were No. 1 in the nation against the 
run -- giving up a mere 331 yards in 11 games -- and No. 2 in overall defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But it took the drubbing of Miami to put Arizona and Pac-10 defense into the 
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 "As badly as we wanted to go to the Rose Bowl, the performance against Miami 
gave us credibility we never would have gotten by going to the Rose Bowl," 
Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said. "Allowing Miami to cross midfield only once was 
an eye-catcher for the rest of the nation. Now we have to prove it was not a 
fluke." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fiesta Bowl victory, in which quarterback Dan White proved that Arizona 
also had an offense, gave Arizona a 10-2 record, the finest in its 90-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 With six regulars from the powerful defense returning, the Wildcats are 
favored to win the title this season and earn their first trip to the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Their key player may well be free safety Tony Bouie, a senior from New Orleans 
who readily accepts the challenge of facing an outstanding passer every week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great," he said. "If you can do your job against the likes of 
Rob Johnson, Dave Barr, Steve Stenstrom, Danny O'Neil and the rest of them, you 
will know you're something special. It will be like going up against an NFL 
quarterback every week." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Arizona is the choice, competition is deep, largely because so many 
teams have quarterbacks capable of taking a team all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is once again ineligible, Oregon State is still rebuilding and 
Washington State may have run out of outstanding passers. But all the other 
schools think they have an offensive leader who can take them to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in alphabetical order is the rundown on the Pac-10 teams, except USC and 
UCLA, with overall and conference records in 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 * ARIZONA 
</P>
<P>
 (10-2, 6-2, tied for first) 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats no longer are a one-dimensional team, but they still are 
impressive defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Bouie, an all-conference free safety, five other starters from the 
group that held highly rated Miami to 35 yards rushing are back: end Tedy 
Bruschi, a second-team All-American; linebacker Sean Harris, strong safety 
Brandon Sanders, tackle Jim Hoffman and cornerback Claudius Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman could be the best defensive lineman Arizona has had in his eight 
seasons at Arizona, Tomey says. Apparently, the Wildcats don't expect to miss 
Outland Trophy winner Rob Waldrop, the two-time consensus All-American nose 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats' only tough nonconference game figures to be the opener against 
Georgia Tech. In conference play, they don't meet Washington. The key to the 
Rose Bowl could be their Nov. 12 game against USC at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARIZONA STATE 
</P>
<P>
 (6-5, 4-4, tied for fourth) 
</P>
<P>
 The media tabbed the Sun Devils for seventh place in their third season under 
former Cal coach Bruce Snyder, but Snyder thinks quarterback Jake Plummer might 
lift the Sun Devils into contention. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman last season, Plummer became the starter in the Oregon game and 
took the Devils to a 4-2 finish, including a 41-0 rout of California and a 9-3 
victory over UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I got better, but I know I got smarter," said Plummer, who 
completed 102 of 199 passes for 1,650 yards and nine touchdowns. "I learned 
some things that I think helped a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 To improve on last season, however, the Sun Devils will have to find 
replacements for Mario Bates, who ran for 1,111 yards, and first-round draft 
choice Shante Carver, a premier pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
 * CALIFORNIA 
</P>
<P>
 (9-4, 4-4, tied for fourth) 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears have only two players back from the group that led the conference in 
offense last season and averaged 31 points a game. But one is Dave Barr, who 
has passed for 40 touchdowns the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 How important is Barr? Before he was hurt last season, the Bears were 5-0. But 
Barr sat out all or parts of the next four games and the Bears lost all of 
them. When he got back in to stay, the Bears finished 4-0, including a 37-3 
romp over Iowa in the Alamo Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Barr is in good shape, injuries struck other Bears before workouts 
started and the outlook is not getting better. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior linebacker Paul Joiner's career ended when he suffered serious injuries 
in an auto accident. Cornerback Charles Gillum broke his arm in the same 
accident and will be sidelined until October. Several freshman prospects, 
injured in high school all-star games, are sidelined for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 But All-American linebacker Jerrott Willard, who made 147 tackles last season 
to lead the Pac-10, is back and the Bears seem certain to be better defensively 
than last season, when they gave up almost 400 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 * OREGON 
</P>
<P>
 (5-6, 2-6, tied for seventh) 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Brooks, the dean of Pac-10 coaches, starts his 18th season with optimism. 
One name, Danny O'Neil, accounts for most of the excitement as the Ducks try to 
come back from their first losing season since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny, because he's not in a major population center, didn't get the 
recognition he deserved last season," Brooks said. "He put up the best marks in 
Duck history and we've had some pretty good quarterbacks (among them Norm Van 
Brocklin and Dan Fouts)." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil passed for more than 3,000 yards while setting six Oregon records. He 
had six games in which he passed for more than 300 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problem last year is that we lacked a winning attitude," O'Neil said. "We 
have regained it and will be a better team." 
</P>
<P>
 * OREGON STATE 
</P>
<P>
 (4-7, 2-6, tie for seventh) 
</P>
<P>
 As the only wishbone team in the conference, the Beavers are beginning to 
cause consternation. They almost upset UCLA last season and beat Arizona State 
and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a good feeling, going into games knowing we have a chance to win," 
Coach Jerry Pettibone said as he starts his fourth season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers rushed for almost 300 yards a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * STANFORD 
</P>
<P>
 (4-7, 2-6, tied for seventh) 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bill Walsh said his talented freshmen had a great experience last 
year, it was a disappointing season for Stanford. Ever the optimist, Walsh 
expects to turn things around, especially if he can get protection for his 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in Steve Stenstrom we have the best quarterback in college 
football," Walsh said. "We must improve our running game and I think we will. 
It will make it easier on Stenstrom." 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom set Pac-10 records for yards passing, 3,627; total offense, 3,398 
yards, and completions, 300. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford spent much of the spring trying to shore up a defense that gave up 
475 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 * WASHINGTON 
</P>
<P>
 (7-4, 5-3, ineligible) 
</P>
<P>
 Once again the Huskies are ineligible for the conference title or a bowl bid. 
But they did manage to talk Heisman Trophy candidate Napoleon Kaufman into 
returning for his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 The fleet running back rushed for 1,299 yards last season and averaged 25 
yards a kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jim Lambright is going to give the 185-pound, all-purpose runner plenty 
of work. He hopes to give Kaufman the ball 30 to 35 times a game as a runner 
and receiver. Kaufman also will return punts and kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself a winner," Kaufman said. "I'm willing to do anything I can 
to help the team win." 
</P>
<P>
 * WASHINGTON STATE 
</P>
<P>
 (5-6, 3-5, sixth) 
</P>
<P>
 Redshirt sophomore Chad Davis of San Diego, a transfer from Oklahoma, 
completed 87% of his passes last spring and the cocky young quarterback has won 
the confidence of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he fits in in a league of great passers," Coach Mike Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars may surprise. The defense, eighth in the country last season, has 
seven starters back, including end DeWayne Patterson, one of the best in the 
nation.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; SWARMING TO ITS TASK; ARIZONA'S DEFENSE 
AGAINST THE RUN MAKES THE WILDCATS FAVORITES TO WIN PAC-10 CONFERENCE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a hot night in Tucson in September of 1992, Phil Stone indulged in a bit of 
electronic hyperbole, telling Prime Ticket viewers that Arizona was using a 
swarm of running backs against Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 A little later, Stone's sidekick, Russ Francis, was watching eight Arizona 
defenders get up off a Cougar running back. Francis remembered he had seen a 
cactus or two around Tucson, and hadn't there been something in the paper about 
a skirmish in the desert? Desert Storm, wasn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a real, uh, Desert Swarm, " Francis said -- and a star -- the defense, 
not the announcer -- was born. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a unique lineup of athletes that works, not because of where they play, 
but because of how they play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players make it special," defensive end Tedy Bruschi said. "It's not a 
difficult scheme. We don't blitz a lot. There's no complex system to our 
defense. It's just the players. I look at (defensive back) Brandon Sanders and 
see that he's giving it all he's got on every single play, and it makes me want 
to. It's sort of a ripple effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the double-eagle flex defense. Coaches do, in part because there are 
elements of the old Dallas Cowboys' flex. Technically, it uses a five-man line 
with one of the linemen set back off the line of scrimmage, almost like a 
linebacker, the better to read the flow of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anybody here who could understand it," former Cowboy coach Tom 
Landry once told a Super Bowl gathering of more than 1,000 sportswriters, one 
of whom had asked about the flex. Many then went to Jethro Pugh and got an 
explanation: "Playing a zone up front, with everybody taking care of his own 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the five-man line is more like eight, everybody forward. The 
defensive backs play a lot of man-to-man, hoping the pass rush gets to the 
quarterback in time. 
</P>
<P>
 It frequently does. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona had 59 sacks in 11 games last season, 16 more than any other team in 
the Pacific 10 Conference, then had four in the Fiesta Bowl, a 29-0 victory 
over Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are a lot of different ways you can line up, but I don't think 
that's the secret to why they are so good," said Norm Anderson, who this year 
coaches UCLA's receivers but who last year was an assistant at Arizona. "They 
play hard, and the amazing thing to me when I was over there was the way they 
practiced. Those kids practice the way they play -- hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Start with the coaching. Defensive coordinator Larry Mac Duff grew up in 
Fullerton, met Coach Dick Tomey at Hawaii and went with him to Arizona. Both 
demand defensive, mistake-free football. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every Monday, we have a defensive-unit meeting and look at what each player 
does on film," said Tony Bouie, an all-conference safety. "It gives you an 
appreciation of what other people on your defense do. Coach Mac Duff will point 
out players. If they're not hustling to the ball, it sticks out like a sore 
thumb." 
</P>
<P>
 If the ball hasn't attracted 11 Wildcats, the goal hasn't been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no awards given, no Buckeyes or roses or stars for helmets for big 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never tell them things like, 'Our goal this week is to hold the other team 
under 50 yards rushing,' " Mac Duff said. "We just tell them to play hard." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Wildcats frequently do hold teams under 50 yards rushing. Last season, 
only one 
</P>
<P>
 team rushed for more than 100 yards against the Desert Swarm. Rival Arizona 
State hit exactly 100, taking 44 carries to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Three teams -- Texas El Paso, Pacific and Illinois -- finished with minus 
yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams ran for 331 yards all season on Arizona -- an average of 30.1. The old 
Pac-10 records were 655 yards by Washington in 1964 and 61.5 a game by USC in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the much-maligned Arizona offense gets into the act. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats were ninth in the Pac-10 in passing and total offense last 
season, but second in rushing and first in time of possession. On hot nights in 
Tucson, keeping your defense off the field helps it play better when it gets on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their philosophy is a defensive-minded philosophy: Hold onto the ball, make 
the game a little shorter, don't let bad plays happen on offense," Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad plays didn't happen often last season, when Arizona had its first 
10-victory season. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one publication has picked the Wildcats No. 1 in the country, and the 
Pac-10 coaches and media had no trouble making them the Rose Bowl favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic, but from a national respect standpoint, I think it's true" that 
the Wildcats got more out of beating Miami than Florida State got out of 
beating Nebraska for the national title in the Orange Bowl, Tomey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just kicked the living tar out of us," Miami Coach Dennis Erickson said. 
"They dominated the line of scrimmage, and their defense proved that it was 
everything they said." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time Miami had been shut out in 15 years, three national 
championships and a Jimmy Johnson or two ago. The pace was set early, when 
Bruschi, the game's defensive most valuable player, sacked Ryan Collins for a 
16-yard loss. Miami started the series at its 37 and punted on fourth and 41 
from its six. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the Wildcats were concerned, it should have been the second victory 
over Miami in three seasons. Arizona lost, 8-7, in 1992 at Miami when Steve 
McLaughlin's 51-yard field goal try in the last second sailed a few feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we should have beaten them down there, and they knew it," Bouie said. 
"You should have seen their faces. They were so relieved. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "When they got to the Fiesta Bowl, we came out and they were rah-rah, just 
like they usually are. Typical Miami. But after the first series they never 
said a word. They never said a word.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think they gave up after the second quarter. . . . It was something to see, 
to have the Miami Hurricanes humbled." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no magic to it, Bruschi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just played our butts off," he said. "We played hard, the way we wanted to 
play, and everything was working." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything usually does with the Desert Swarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take it seriously," Bouie said. "It's become kind of a standard at the 
University of Arizona as to how to play defense. When we first started being 
called the Desert Swarm, it was just a topic. It was just there. But it grew 
into an identity, and we accept it. It's easier to play for an identity." 
</P>
<P>
 It has become a legacy of sorts for those who replace Rob Waldrop and others 
who established the image. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year, new players have to come in and establish their own identity," Mac 
Duff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's easier if the reputation is already there. The challenge is to 
measure up 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year, it's new and we have to prove that we deserve the identity as a 
team," Bouie said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, it's a little different. There are five new starters on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 There are eight returning starters among Pac-10 quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of the quarterbacks in the Pac-10 are Heisman Trophy candidates, and 
you look forward to that," Bouie said. "It's something that doesn't happen 
often, so you relish it. It's a challenge, and a good athlete accepts a 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Familiarity helps. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see a few heads go up and down when they look at film of a 
quarterback they know," Mac Duff said. "It can help in preparation." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruschi, who had at least one sack in every game last season, a Pac-10-leading 
19 1/2 in all, doesn't care about quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worry more about the offensive line," he said. "I don't care what 
quarterback is back there. All I want to know about the quarterback is if he is 
mobile or not. If he's mobile, it will affect our pass rush. If he's a pocket 
passer, we'll be a little more reckless." 
</P>
<P>
 And Bruschi likes to be reckless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, it's really simple," he said. "Each of us has a technique to perform, a 
key to read, and if you can't do that, you can't play in our defense. You take 
care of your job and 10 others take care of their jobs, and you have a good 
defense." 
</P>

GOLF ROUNDUP; LOWERY SHOOTS 66 AGAIN AND LEADS WORLD SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Lowery shot a second consecutive four-under-par 66 to take the lead 
Saturday in the third round of the NEC World Series of Golf at Akron, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, 33, who gained entry to the event with the first victory of his career 
last week in the International, completed 54 holes over the North course at 
Firestone in 199. 
</P>
<P>
 He held a one-shot lead over Scott Hoch and was two strokes in front of John 
Huston. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery used a late rush, sparked by an improbable birdie on the 14th hole. 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting his tee shot into a difficult position in a fairway bunker, he 
played an eight-iron to the green, then holed a 65-foot putt up and over a 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a no-brainer," he said. "I was just grinding not to three-putt." 
</P>
<P>
 He followed with birdies on 16 and 17 that continued the hot streak he began 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch had a run of his own, a burst of five consecutive birdies on the back, 
which he rode to a 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston shot a second consecutive 64, and Greg Norman, Masters champion Jose 
Maria Olazabal of Spain, Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe and Brad Faxon were three 
shots off the lead at 202. Faxon and McNulty each shot 65, Olazabal 69 and 
Norman 68. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stockton shot a six-under-par 66 and held a one-stroke lead over Tom 
Weiskopf at the Franklin Quest Championship, a 54-hole senior PGA event in Park 
City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiskopf had a 67 and was at 135 for the 36 holes, tied with Bob Murphy, who 
had a second-round 66. Three shots behind the leaders were Bob Brue, Jack 
Kiefer and George Archer. Archer had a 66, Brue and Kiefer 67s. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton is the defending champion over the 7,026-yard mountain course, 
setting a tournament record with a 199 total. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Ann Mills shot a two-under-par 70 to join Liselotte Neumann, Michelle 
McGann and Martha Nause atop the leader board after three rounds of the LPGA du 
Maurier Classic in Ottawa, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Neumann, winner of the women's British Open and Swedish Open titles the last 
two weeks, and McGann each shot 71 and Nause a 72 as the four leaders completed 
54 holes at six-under 208 over the 6,400-yard Ottawa Hunt and Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the top 10, only U.S. Open champion Patty Sheehan and Meg Mallon, with 
68s, and Jennifer Wyatt of Canada, with a 69, managed to break 70.

GOLF / U.S. AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIPS; WOODS HAS TO TAKE TRIP TO EARN TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tiger Woods moved one step closer to golf history Saturday when he beat 
three-time Kent All-American Eric Frishette, 5 and 3, in the semifinals of the 
U.S. Amateur championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford-bound Woods, 18, of Cypress, will become the youngest champion in the 
94 years of the national amateur championship if he beats Trip Kuehne of 
Oklahoma State in today's 36-hole final. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehne, of McKinney, Tex., beat his Oklahoma State teammate and close friend 
Kris Cox, 1-up, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Woods prevail on the TPC Sawgrass course, he would move past five 
19-year-old amateur champions in the record book -- including Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Records are a product of good golf," said Woods, who at 15 became the 
youngest USGA national junior champion and started an unprecedented run of 
three consecutive titles. "What matters is that I take care of business, do 
what I need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods and Kuehne have both locked up invitations to next year's Masters and 
the winner will play in both the U.S. and British Opens. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since his second-round scare -- a 1-up victory over 1986 amateur champion 
Buddy Alexander -- Woods has easily marched to the title match with his 
distance, finesse and all-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one made a run at me the whole tournament like Tiger did," Frishette, of 
Carroll, Ohio, said, alluding to Woods' five birdies over the last 10 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 582-yard ninth hole, Woods' 283-yard second shot stopped five yards 
short of the green. He also birdied the 529-yard 11th, rifling a 235-yard 
three-iron pin high for a routine two-putt that put him 4-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehne will also be seeking to make golf history today. Five weeks ago, his 
sister Kelli won the USGA junior national title, meaning two golfers from the 
same family could win USGA titles in the same year. "It's hard to comprehend 
that my sister and I have this opportunity," Kuehne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox lost his shot to beat Kuehne when he bogeyed the 497-yard 16th, and then 
missed a relatively short birdie putt on 17, a 132-yard island hole.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; JORDAN WORKS OUT AS TWO-WAY PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, that was Kevin Jordan catching a pass from Ryan Fien on the first series 
of Saturday's scrimmage in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that was Jordan, wearing a Tennessee-yellow vest over his No. 4, making a 
hit on tight end Josh Eby. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Jordan, two-way player? Could happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving freshman Shaun Williams from the defensive backfield to tailback has 
created a problem on defense, and the Bruins are considering having Jordan, who 
caught 45 passes last season as a sophomore, play defensive back in five- and 
six-back alignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a big safety short," said Coach Terry Donahue. "We've looked at Glenn 
Thompkins and Javelin Guidry (both freshmen) back there, and they've played 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 But both are short, and Jordan is 6 feet 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave him about a 20-minute lesson before practice and just played him six 
plays to get a look at him on film." 
</P>
<P>
 It's fine with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played defensive back in high school," he said. "They just had me covering 
the tight end, jamming him, to see if I could do it. It was something I think I 
could enjoy. Just put me out there. I just want to help out." 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Tod McBride is getting the first look, which, if he measures up, 
would make him a full-time defensive back. But, if McBride is so-so, Jordan is 
next in line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really think that it's going to work with Kevin," said Donahue. 
"That's my gut feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, he wouldn't hesitate to play an upperclassman two ways if it he 
felt it was necessary to win. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The scrimmage was 94 plays, 79 of which were at a hit-but-don't-hurt tempo, 
called "thud" at UCLA. The 15 live plays involved the freshmen and scout teams. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sharmon Shah excused to rest his knee, Daron Washington started at 
tailback, with James Milliner at fullback. What goes around has come around for 
the Bruins, who have looked at various combinations of backs, gone through 
various injuries and might well line up against Tennessee in the season opener 
Saturday night with Washington and Milliner, which was their starting backfield 
in last season's opener against California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thinking they, with (freshmen) Greg Ford and Shaun Williams will be the 
four backs," said Donahue. "We're thinking that if we get anything from Shah 
and (Derek) Ayers, it will be a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the attendees was the Whittier High football team, which gathered to 
greet Ford after the scrimmage. He is a walk-on freshman who has practiced his 
way onto the depth chart and will probably get playing time against Tennessee. 
. . . Donahue is also leaning toward using freshman Jim McElroy to return 
kickoffs and said he may have to use other freshmen for depth. They include 
linebacker Danjuan Magee, defensive lineman Vae Tata and defensive backs 
Thompkins, Guidry and perhaps DuVal Hicks and McBride. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman linebacker Larry Atkins didn't practice. The NCAA Initial Clearing 
House has yet to certify his eligibility because it can't find work he did as a 
freshman at Santa Monica High, before transferring to Venice High. As is policy 
at UCLA, his uniform and pads were taken away until he is cleared, which should 
come on Monday. Officials said the problem was merely a paperwork snafu at NCAA 
offices. JIM HODGES

 Nebraska, ranked No. 4 in the preseason Associated Press poll and one of the 
national championship favorites this season, takes on No. 24 West Virginia 
today in the Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Haunted by a history of big-game flops, the undefeated Cornhuskers entered the 
last Orange Bowl as 17-point underdogs to top-ranked Florida State, then 
outplayed the Seminoles before losing, 18-16, when a last-second field-goal 
attempt sailed wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Orange Bowl changed the public perception of Nebraska," said 
offensive tackle Rob Zatechka. "It didn't change us, but it changed what people 
thought about us."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; LAMBRIGHT DID LITTLE TO STOP GARRETT'S 
RUN FOR HEISMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In USC's Heritage Hall, Mike Garrett's Heisman Trophy rests in a display case, 
along with those won by Charles White and Marcus Allen.  
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson's was on display, until it was stolen July 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington football Coach Jim Lambright, who played for Washington in the 
mid-1960s, says he deserves to have a small piece of Garrett's Heisman, after a 
contribution he made in the 1965 USC-Washington game at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a 180-pound outside linebacker then, and Garrett came right for me, 
made a great move to the outside -- and he just froze me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sort of crumpled forward, and fell on my face. Garrett went for about 70 
yards. I looked pretty comical in the films on Monday, and everyone had their 
laughs." 
</P>
<P>
 USC won the game, 34-0.  
</P>
<P>
 Garrett is now USC's athletic director. EARL GUSTKEY

BEACH VOLLEYBALL; NO. 3 STOKLOS, JOHNSON ARE UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The biggest story at the $250,000 Miller Lite Championships at Hermosa Beach 
on Saturday was Randy Stoklos' early exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoklos, the second-winningest player in pro beach volleyball history, has won 
the season-ending tournament three times. Last year, he and partner Ricci 
Luyties lost in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Stoklos and partner Adam Johnson placed fifth after losing twice on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-seeded team first was defeated by sixth-seeded Brent Frohoff and 
Scott Ayakatubby, 15-9, then eliminated by ninth-seeded Leif Hanson and Tim 
Hovland, 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Frohoff and Ayakatubby went on to upset second-seeded Mike Dodd and Mike 
Whitmarsh, 15-9, in the winners' bracket semifinal on center court. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hit all the right shots, got all the breaks and made all the plays," 
Dodd said. "They were also serving very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd and Whitmarsh won a late-afternoon consolation match and will face 
fourth-seeded Eduardo Bacil and Jose Loiola in today's consolation bracket 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded team of Karch Kiraly and Kent Steffes struggled before 
defeating eighth-seeded Troy Tanner and Wes Welch, 15-11, in a morning 
quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
 By the semifinal, however, the defending champions had picked up their game 
and easily defeated Brazilians Loiola and Bacil, 15-5, on center court. They 
took a 10-4 lead and never let up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was feeling a little tired this morning for some strange reason," Steffes 
said. "I saw the doctor and took some vitamins. It worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiraly, who sat out four tournaments this year because of a bruised kidney, 
was in top form. He made several spectacular plays, including one in which he 
dived through a courtside banner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great and I think we're playing real well," Kiraly said. "I think what 
happened in that first match is that Troy and Wes have been in a little slump 
lately so we thought that game might come a little easier than it did." 
</P>
<P>
 Steffes and Kiraly will meet Frohoff and Ayakatubby in today's winners' 
bracket final at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament final is scheduled for 1:30 p.m.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; HOWEVER ARGUMENTS ARE SERVED, FANS LEFT TO STEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's say no one is really cooking the books. Let's say both sides are simply 
using their own recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no surprise, for example, that Stanford economist Roger Noll, a 
longtime advocate and witness for sports unions who was commissioned again by 
the Major League Baseball Players Assn., prepared a financial report debunking 
the owners' portrait of despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Noll, in his report released last week, reworked and rewrote the confidential 
financial statements that the clubs had provided a skeptical union. 
</P>
<P>
 Those reports, acting commissioner Bud Selig has said more than once, were 
prepared by some of the largest accounting firms in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you saying, he has said, that they cooked the books and were part of a 
conspiracy? 
</P>
<P>
 No one has said either, but what can be said is that a chef can only work with 
the ingredients that are provided. 
</P>
<P>
 An accountant, for example, can't change the fact that Ted Turner takes less 
than $10 million out of the pocket of his broadcasting system to put in the 
pocket of his Atlanta Braves for television rights. 
</P>
<P>
 An accountant, for example, can't change the fact that the St. Louis 
Cardinals, for several years, failed to report parking and concessions as part 
of their income. 
</P>
<P>
 Or that George Steinbrenner, according to the New York Times, diversifies the 
$40 million he receives for the New York Yankees' cable rights from Madison 
Square Garden network so that he diminishes the amount reported as TV income 
and reduces the percentage he is required to share with the other teams under 
baseball law. 
</P>
<P>
 An accountant, of course, can make suggestions, shrewdly recommend what goes 
where, but the owner represents the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners contend the current system is a recipe for disaster. They projected 
19 clubs would lose money this year, then adjusted that to 12 to 14 after The 
Los Angeles Times reported they were including lucrative franchises such as the 
Dodgers and Chicago White Sox among those 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Noll, in his report, said baseball underestimated its pre-strike 1994 revenue 
by anywhere from $50 million to $140 million and disputed management's 
contention that salaries are rising faster than revenues. He said every current 
market is capable of sustaining a viable franchise provided there is good 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Where does the truth rest? 
</P>
<P>
 What does it matter, suggested owners negotiator Richard Ravitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can argue numbers until you're blue in the face," he said the other day. 
"That's not the issue (in the stalemated bargaining talks). The owners should 
not have to plead poverty to have the right to know what their labor costs are, 
to establish a system of cost certainty. What does it cost to play? That's all 
they're trying to determine." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but it does matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners' salary-cap proposal is based on 50% of total revenue going to the 
players for compensation, pension, etc. The owners are flexible on the 
percentage, but who would determine what the total revenue is? Whose recipe 
would be used? 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell us what percentage you want and we'll cut a deal," White Sox owner Jerry 
Reinsdorf asked the players more than once in Thursday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell us how much profit you want, Jerry," finally responded Donald Fehr, the 
union's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, of course, will never accept a cap, but the revenue question 
could become a major issue if the owners unilaterally implement their system. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, despite Noll's salaried bias, it is worth recalling that an 
analysis he did for the union amid the 1985 negotiations, criticized by owners 
then as his 1994 report has been, proved to be more accurate than the owners' 
pessimistic projections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the 1985 prophecy of doom was not fulfilled," Noll writes in his 
new report. "The prophecy of impending doom is far more implausible in 1994 
than it was nine years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball, he writes, "is financially healthy -- healthier than it was in the 
mid-1980s." AL, NL, and . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 Here it comes. Talk of player defections and a new league. Inevitable in any 
sports stoppage, but highly implausible. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Noll, in an interview with the San Francisco Examiner: 
</P>
<P>
 "If a new major league forms, I would bet you money the Dodgers and Yankees 
are in it. Believe me, the guys with the mobility threat are the big-city 
teams. If Donald Trump, who tried once before, decides it's time for the 
Federal League to be reformed, and calls up (Peter) O'Malley, Steinbrenner, 
WGN, WTBS and some others and says, 'Let's do it,' they might say, 'To hell 
with Bud Selig. We don't need Milwaukee.' The governing body of baseball could 
find itself a small-market force with no players. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I think they'll settle by Labor Day. My suspicion is, not 
necessarily O'Malley, because he's too nice a guy, but Steinbrenner and 
Reinsdorf, if it looks like they're going to blow away the rest of the season, 
and instead of making $30 million they're going to lose $10 (million), will 
say, 'Let's give this up.' I think they'll say this before Labor Day, and 
they'll carry the day." 
</P>
<P>
 There is definitely an attempt by some high-revenue clubs to seek a compromise 
by Labor Day, but they remain frustrated and stymied by the rule requiring 21 
of 28 clubs to approve a settlement, with Reinsdorf still tied to Selig and 
still holding a consensus together in the pursuit of a new system. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the three-fourths rule be changed back to a majority? Unlikely. A change 
would require approval by three fourths of the clubs in each league. FREE AT 
LAST 
</P>
<P>
 There is lingering speculation that the union is waiting to play a trump card 
in response to the owners' withholding of the $7.8-million pension payment from 
All-Star game receipts. It has been suggested that the union could declare a 
default and ask that all players become free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a complicated issue that we're pursuing," Fehr said of the pension 
matter in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I don't know what good it would be for everyone to be a free agent 
under a salary cap." 
</P>
<P>
 The union contends that the owners' proposal, if implemented, would destroy 
free agency, long one of their primary objectives, Fehr said. TIME TO KILL 
</P>
<P>
 What does an idled baseball writer do during a strike? Danny Knobler, who 
covers the Detroit Tigers for the Booth newspaper chain, wins the "It Can't End 
Soon Enough" award. Knobler, in the context of the Tigers' poor results with 
draft choices, took advantage of the recess to figure out which clubs seem to 
have had the best luck with first-round selections since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 He determined that the Tigers were 25th, or next to last, with their No. 1 
selections having played only 51 major league games since 1980, which is 51 
more than the Yankees, who were last at zero. The White Sox were first, with 
their No. 1s having played 2,928 games. The Angels were eighth at 1,641, and 
the Dodgers 10th at 1,590. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft, of course, is more than the first round. Toronto and Atlanta, with 
two of baseball's most productive farm systems, are 23rd and 24th on the 
Knobler list. And the Dodgers have had six rookies of the year since 1979, with 
only Steve Howe a No. 1. HOMER HAVEN 
</P>
<P>
 In this aborted season of the allegedly juiced baseball, Mile High Stadium in 
Denver did not yield the most homers. There were 125 hit there, putting it only 
12th among the 28 stadiums. The most: Anaheim Stadium had 167, a major league 
high 93 hit by the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasn't Buck Rodgers saying something about trying to win with released 
pitchers before he was rudely interrupted? COMIC RELIEF 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Mason wandered through the media horde in the lobby of the Manhattan 
hotel where owners and players were meeting Thursday and was asked what he 
thought about salary caps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like caps," he said, "but I prefer yarmulkes."

TENNIS / JERRY CROWE; CAPRIATI FAMILY MOVING TO CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, teen-age tennis sensation Jennifer Capriati, only a year after 
winning the Olympic gold medal and still a major force on the Women's Tennis 
Assn. Tour, bowed out of the U.S. Open in the first round at the hands of 
unheralded Lela Meshki. 
</P>
<P>
 That was to be Capriati's last match to date, and the time since then has been 
spent in turmoil for the 18-year-old, who was apprehended in February on a 
shoplifting charge and in May on a charge of marijuana possession, a 
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Capriati's life will undergo a major change starting this week, when she 
and her family -- father Stefano, mother Denise and 15-year-old brother Steven 
-- will move from the Tampa, Fla., area of Saddlebrook to Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Capriati said Friday that no coaching changes have been made for 
Jennifer, nor has there been any schedule set for her return to the tour. She 
said her daughter has been practicing and working out on a regular basis, but 
the return to the tour is "up to Jennifer." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a family move," Denise Capriati said. "Steven will go to Palm Desert 
High School and everything else will be quite normal. It's just a change of 
environment and we felt our family needed that."  
</P>

 More than five years have passed since Michael Chang won the French Open in 
1989, becoming the youngest male winner of a Grand Slam tournament at 17 years 
3 months. 
</P>
<P>
 And although he has won 16 tournaments since, Chang has not seriously 
challenged for a second Grand Slam title, advancing as far as the semifinals 
only once. 
</P>
<P>
 His career has continued to flourish -- this year alone he has won five 
tournaments and earned more than $800,000 in prize money -- but Chang said that 
he will not consider it a complete success if he never again wins one of the 
sport's four major events. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason being is that, I feel that at this particular time, I'm a much 
better player than I was when I was 17 years old," said Chang, who is seeded 
sixth at the U.S. Open, which starts Monday in New York. "Although the game has 
gotten better, I think that I'm still able to go out and compete against the 
big boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's been difficult as far as Grand Slam events, I'm able to get through 
the early rounds and win a couple of big matches, but I haven't been able to 
put together a string of them. And that's what it takes to win a Grand Slam 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be able to beat the best, and you've got to be able to beat 
three of them in a row, in many cases. And that's what's been sort of 
frustrating. I haven't been able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chang hasn't abandoned his quest. Still six months shy of his 23rd 
birthday, he is the youngest of the five U.S. players ranked among the top 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give myself a little more time than say, Pete (Sampras) and Jim (Courier), 
partly because of my size and partly because I'm younger," Chang said. "I think 
people forget that I'm the youngest one of that little bunch (that also 
includes Todd Martin and Andre Agassi). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating getting to a certain point in an event and losing to Pete in 
the quarterfinals of the (U.S.) Open last year, then running into him again at 
Wimbledon (this year). But, then again, to win those events, you've got to beat 
the best players in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 He knows. He did it once. 
</P>

 Music Men: In an effort to "improve the presentation and add more fun and 
entertainment to men's professional tennis," the ATP Tour introduced several 
innovations this month at a tournament in New Haven, Conn., among them playing 
music selected by the players during their introductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Lendl, the tour's all-time money leader, chose "Penny Lane," by the 
Beatles. Agassi, in a wink at his former No. 1 fan, picked "The Way We Were," 
by Barbra Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
 A partial list of songs that probably won't ever be heard: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I'm a Loser," by the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Poor Poor Pitiful Me," Warren Zevon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Born to Lose," Ray Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sour Note: Agassi strongly objected to playing music during changeovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To add to the sport, you need to add to it, not take people out of the game," 
said the originator of "rock 'n' roll" tennis. "Playing music on the

 "Rock 'n' roll tennis is not playing rock 'n' roll music during the match. 
Rock 'n' roll tennis is an attitude. Rock 'n' roll tennis is a way of playing 
and a way of being out there. It's saying, 'Come on, get alive, get into this.' 
Bringing the fans into it is what I try to do on any level. Tennis as a sport 
deserves to maintain its entertainment value -- as a sport."

 Still more music news: John McEnroe recently took his band to Italy, kicking 
off a two-week tour with a concert in Santa Margherita that was described by a 
local newspaper as "the musical equivalent of a double fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Before what was described as an unenthusiastic crowd of 400, McEnroe led his 
group, McBand, in covers of Rolling Stones and Nirvana tunes and songs about 
New York life. 
</P>
<P>
 McEnroe was not discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "In sports, you can win or lose," he told an Italian newspaper. "On stage, 
it's different because you can get results somewhere in the middle. I'm not 
afraid. This time, I know I'm not the best."

 Opposing view: Contrary to conventional wisdom, Anne Person Worcester of the 
Women's Tennis Council said that Steffi Graf's dominance of the WTA Tour and 
negative publicity surrounding the sport in the year after Monica Seles' 
departure was actually good for women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steffi set a new standard and other players have strived to reach that level 
and have really succeeded in stepping up the level of their own tennis," 
Worcester told Elliott Almond of The Times. "Losing Monica and Jennifer 
(Capriati) for a while, some of the negative stories that have been coming out 
of women's tennis have almost been a blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a tremendous stepping up of the players just in the first six 
months of this year. Because they said, 'OK, we're minus two marquee names, 
we've got negative news stories, the economy is tough, we're looking for a 
sponsor. We've got to convey how terrific women's tennis is.' And they have 
done that. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a little bit of pain comes a lot of gain." Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 More than 350 players from 25 countries will play in the 15th U.S. Open 
Wheelchair Championships Oct. 8-16 at the Racquet Club of Irvine. . . . The 
16th Tracy Austin Pro-Celebrity Tennis Tournament is scheduled Oct. 22 at the 
West End Racquet Club in Torrance.

PREPS '94; QUEST FOR TIMES ORANGE COUNTY ALL-SPORTS TROPHY SET TO BEGIN; AWARD: 
LOS ALAMITOS, CORONA DEL MAR WERE THE WINNERS LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ROHWER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Alamitos and Corona del Mar will attempt to defend their titles this 
school year as The Times Orange County will again crown All-Sports Award 
winners in the large- and small-school divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins edged league-rival Esperanza by 1.4 points, 367.5-366.1, to win 
last year's championship in the large-school division (1,200 or more students). 
Edison finished third with 359.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings ran away with the small-school division (fewer than 1,200 
students), outdistancing runner-up Laguna Hills, 375.4-337. Brea-Olinda was 
third with 327.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times ranks the county's 75 high school programs using a formula developed 
by the paper's editors and prep sports staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring is based on winning percentage, league finishes and section 
championship play for boys' and girls' team sports sanctioned by the California 
Interscholastic Federation's Southern Section. Individual championships will 
not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, there are no points or consideration for placement in county, state or 
national polls or rankings or state playoff appearances.  
</P>
<P>
 Division champions are awarded a traveling trophy, a trophy to keep and a 
banner to display in their gym. Second- and third-place teams in each division 
receive trophies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' competition is the county's first comprehensive all-sports 
championship, rewarding not only playoff success but league finish and winning 
percentage as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ten sports will be scored on winning percentages from overall season records 
-- football, water polo, boys' and girls' volleyball, boys' and girls' 
basketball, boys' and girls' soccer, baseball and softball. In these sports, 
records will count for the entire regular season and section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eleven sports will be scored on winning percentages in league contests only 
-- boys' and girls' cross-country, boys' and girls' tennis, wrestling, 
badminton, golf, boys' and girls' swimming/diving and boys' and girls' track 
and field. 
</P>
<P>
 * To determine a team's winning percentage, take the record -- including 
overall where appropriate -- and convert it on a scale of 10. Example: A team 
is 20-10, .667 winning percentage, which is worth 6.7 points. A perfect score 
is 10 for an undefeated season. 
</P>
<P>
 * League performance: The top three league teams and at-large playoff teams 
earn extra points. A league champion gets 10, runner-up seven, third-place 
five, and at-large teams three. Ties are broken by each league's tie-breaking 
criteria for playoffs (coin flips, head-to-head competition, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
 * Section performance: A section champion earns 20 points, 16 for section 
runner-up, 12 for semifinal losers, and eight for quarterfinal losers. In 
non-bracket playoffs (swimming, track and cross-country), 20 points for first, 
16 for second, 12 for third and fourth, eight for fifth, sixth, seventh and 
eighth. Wrestling points will be awarded from dual-meet playoffs, not the 
section finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams forfeiting victories under Southern Section rulings will concede points 
earned from those victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite, an all-boys school, and Rosary, an all-girls school, will compete 
jointly. 
</P>
<P>
 Records reported to and published by the Southern Section will be used for the 
following sports: baseball, boys' and girls' basketball, football, boys' and 
girls' soccer, softball, boys' and girls' tennis, boys' and girls' volleyball 
and water polo. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic directors must provide The Times with regular-season-ending results 
and standings in the following sports: badminton, boys' and girls' 
cross-country, golf, boys' and girls' swimming, boys' and girls' track and 
wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 The information can be provided by calling (714) 966-5904, by faxing (714) 
966-5663, or by mailing to The Times Orange County Sports Department, 1375 
Sunflower Ave., Costa Mesa, 92626. Please send them to the attention of Prep 
Sports Editor Bob Rohwer. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to report a team's record will result in zero points for the school in 
that sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times will publish all-sports standings after the fall and winter seasons 
as well as the final standings next spring.

MADDOX NOT PLANNING TO REMAIN NO. 3; RAMS: FORMER UCLA QUARTERBACK ACQUIRED 
FROM BRONCOS VIEWS HIMSELF AS A POTENTIAL STARTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Tommy Maddox became a Ram Saturday, and although he is third 
string behind Chris Miller and Chris Chandler, he indicated that he doesn't 
want to be holding a clipboard on the sideline for long. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams traded a 1995 fourth-round draft choice to the Denver Broncos 
Saturday to acquire Maddox, the former UCLA standout whom Denver took in the 
first round of the 1992 draft as the heir-apparent to John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the NFL's new $34.6-million salary cap, the Broncos couldn't 
justify spending $875,000 on a backup quarterback. But Maddox views himself as 
a potential starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready," he said. "This is my third year in the league and I've been 
around. I'm excited about the way I played in the preseason this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm to the point now where everything I can improve on is on the field. I 
don't think I can stand on the sideline and learn anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will assume the final two years of Maddox's four-year, $4.4-million 
contract with the Broncos. He will earn $875,000 this season, including a 
$25,000 roster bonus, and will make $1.05 million next season. The Broncos are 
responsible for the remaining $700,000 of his $1.4 million signing bonus this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Steinberg, Maddox's agent, said he is "open to restructuring" Maddox's 
contract, but has yet to discuss it with Ram officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll talk about it," said Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president. "The first 
thing we wanted to do was get him in here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox said trading the fourth-round pick, obtained in a trade 
with Dallas during this year's draft, was a small price to pay for a potential 
star quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox, 6 feet 4 and 205 pounds, gives the Rams the young, talented 
quarterback they bypassed last April when they didn't take Fresno State's Trent 
Dilfer with the fifth-overall pick. Maddox will be 23 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the value (of Maddox) is too great to pass up," Knox said. "We've 
been criticized for not taking a young quarterback in the draft. Now we take a 
young quarterback and people want to know is it going to be this, or is it 
going to be that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy will start out as our No. 3 guy. But he represents an opportunity as 
our quarterback of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler remains the backup, and Maddox takes over the third-string position 
from Jamie Martin, who was cut Saturday to make room for Maddox on the roster. 
T.J. Rubley, who started seven games last season, is out for the year after the 
team put him on the injured reserve list Tuesday because of tendinitis in his 
right throwing elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox, who entered the NFL draft after his sophomore year at UCLA, started 
four games his rookie year when Elway was sidelined because of a bruised tendon 
in his shoulder. In two seasons, Maddox completed 67 of 122 passes (54.9%) for 
758 yards with six touchdowns and nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams wanted Maddox for his youth, athleticism and anticipated value next 
season with expansion teams in Charlotte and Jacksonville seeking quarterbacks. 
But Maddox sees his long-term future in Anaheim -- or wherever the team plays 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at being there for a long time," he said. "You can't go into any 
situation thinking I'll just be here for a while, then move on."

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; HENLEY, GARY PROBABLY WILL BE CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cornerback Darryl Henley, running back Cleveland Gary and defensive lineman 
Marc Boutte are leading candidates to top the Rams' cut list today. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's bail restrictions, which include a judge's order that a probation 
officer be by his side on the road, have been deemed too large of a distraction 
by team officials.The team did not release Henley on Saturday because it was 
checking to see if his situation would still allow the Rams to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
 Running backs Howard Griffith and rookie James Bostic would be prime 
candidates to be released based on performance, but Gary's salary -- $500,000 
as a backup player to starter Jerome Bettis -- puts him on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutte has started 31 consecutive games at defensive tackle, but he was 
unimpressive last year and has done nothing in training camp to change the 
team's opinion of him. Boutte was competing with David Rocker for a roster 
spot, but Rocker's 1994 salary is guaranteed and Boutte's is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Other players who appear in jeopardy of being released today include starting 
guard Bill Schultz, tight end Rickey Brady and starting strong safety Deral 
Boykin. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz and Boykin might very well have played themselves off the team in 
Thursday's disastrous exhibition loss to the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie linebacker Ernest Jones is a candidate to be put on injured reserve 
because of a knee injury. T.J. SIMERS

AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE; GIVING UP NORMAL TEEN LIFE GOT TU TO NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Meilen Tu's eyes were gleaming, her voice was frolicking and her rare energy 
was flowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jet black hair pulled back into a ponytail, an ice pack wrapped around her 
right shoulder after one of her strenuous workouts, Tu was laughing and poking 
fun at herself. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though she is delightfully humorous about her lot in life as one of 
the world's top junior tennis players, Tu attacked some of the questions posed 
to her as she would an opponent on the court: with deadly seriousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sacrificing the normal teen-age life," she said. "But it doesn't bother 
me that I can't go out every Friday and Saturday night till, like, 2 o'clock in 
the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Tu withdrew from Granada Hills High and entered the Los Angeles 
Unified School District independent study program. The switch separated Tu from 
her classmates but allowed her to continue school while she toured the world 
with a U.S. Junior team. 
</P>
<P>
 The move paid off. Tu has earned a wild-card entry into her first Grand Slam 
tournament: the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 At 16, Tu is the youngest player and the only junior in the 128-player draw. 
She qualified last month by winning the United States Tennis Assn. girls' 
18-and-under national tournament in San Jose. In last week's International 
Tennis Federation world junior rankings, Tu was tied for fifth with Siobhan 
Drake-Brockman of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Tu's first-round opponent at Flushing Meadow, N.Y., Monday is Silvia Farina of 
Milan, Italy, who was ranked 85th last year on the Virginia Slims Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill McClain, Tu's coach, says Tu could win as many as three matches and that 
she could be good enough to crack the world's top 20 by the time she's 20. But 
Tu, beset by injuries and bad fundamentals a year ago, is concerned about being 
overwhelmed by her surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The professionals, they walk around with a strut," said Tu, 5 feet 5 and 105 
pounds. "They're the best and you are just nothing. They're thinking, 'You're 
just a wild card. You're 16 years old. What are you doing here? I own this 
turf.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope not to get nervous and freak out. I have to believe in myself. My 
coaches believe I'm just as good as anyone out there. They tell me don't look 
around at the crowd. Because that's really intimidating, all those eyes just on 
you. Don't think that I'm at the Open. Pretend that I'm playing here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here" is the Warner Center Club in Woodland Hills, a quiet domain located 
atop a seven-story parking garage where Tu practices and trains four hours a 
day. At Warner Center, McClain and the staff treat Tu like their own Steffi 
Graf. 
</P>
<P>
 Tu lifts weights with a personal trainer and has a massage therapist to go 
with the daily tutoring of McClain, 56, who coached for 19 seasons at South 
Carolina, Alabama and Southern Methodist before meeting Tu 14 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the routine of a normal teen-ager, but McClain doesn't think that Tu 
has suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got as good a head on her shoulders as anybody I've seen at this point 
in life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tu: "I think a lot of people that don't know me think I'm going to burn 
out. They watch me play. I grind, I grind. I yell, I yell. And they probably 
think, 'Gosh. She has no social life.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't -- up to a point. I don't need to go out every night. I don't need to 
be on the phone for an hour and a half. I don't need a boyfriend right now." 
</P>
<P>
 She laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "God. Who would want me as a girlfriend?" she said. "I'd be such a pain in the 
butt. I'd complain half the time. After a long day, I just want to kick off my 
shoes and relax." 
</P>
<P>
 Tu said she has only one close friend and that she spends most of her free 
time with her family: older sister Helen, a former UCLA player now studying art 
at New York University, father Ching, a retired engineer, and mother Mei. Her 
parents, both born in China, are part-time real estate brokers and full-time 
tennis parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they want it more than me," Tu said. "My mother seems really intense 
and a lot of people think she's hard on me. She really isn't. I'm the hardest 
person. She takes care of everything for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Tu said she would have continued attending Granada Hills -- where she would 
have been a senior this fall -- if her teachers were more willing to work with 
her. But they could not accept her commitment to travel with the junior 
national team for months at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Her school counselor finally recommended the independent program, in which she 
reports to a Van Nuys center to take tests. She studies in hotel rooms, between 
matches, in airports. The only thing she misses about campus life is gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I actually still hear it," she said, "because my friend, Jeannie, tells 
me everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Tu's best friend, Jeannie Kulwin, believes she made the right decision by 
leaving school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look where she's at," Kulwin said. "She's going to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Kulwin said Tu's former classmates always ask about her and want to see her. 
Tu, smiling weakly, says she doesn't have time to see them, but she hopes she's 
not perceived as a prima donna. She hopes her former classmates can understand 
what it takes to be an international success and a rising star. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Tu met McClain 14 months ago, her tennis game was going nowhere 
because of bad fundamentals and a troublesome back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her serve was awful," McClain said. "She just pushed the ball over the net 
with her deltoid muscle. She used nothing but her arm on her ground strokes and 
she hit the ball perfectly flat. No spins. No slices. But she had a lot of foot 
speed and quickness. She was so fast, it was almost impossible to hit a ball 
past her." 
</P>
<P>
 But McClain also detected her love for the game and a fierce desire to 
improve, along with perhaps the most important intangible trait of a champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's about the most mentally tough kid I've seen in my life. She absolutely 
refuses to give up anything." 
</P>
<P>
 "She used to hit a lot of moon balls," said Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks, 
a friend and rival who lost to Tu, 6-1, 6-2, in the semifinals of the recent 
girls' 18 nationals. "But she's gotten much stronger. (Now) she can wipe you 
off the court." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Tu wondered if she would have any success this year, coming off 
the injury and having to relearn the fundamentals. She quickly got the answer 
in February when she scored a first-round victory in a small professional 
satellite event in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to win two ITF Junior tournaments: the Banana Bowl on clay in Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, in April, and the Surbiton (England) International Junior 
Championship on grass in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say (at the beginning of the year) my goal was to play the U.S. 
Open," Tu said. "I just worked to improve my game. But I'm playing with a lot 
more confidence. I'm ready. Who's ever out there, they better watch out. 
Because if I play well. . . . I'm playing well enough to beat any player, and 
I've got nothing to lose."

LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES; NORTHRIDGE PLAYERS RESILIENT IN DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Little League World Series championship had been lost in agonizing fashion, 
and a group of mothers wanted to give their sons great big hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But they weren't allowed to do so by Little League officials, who whisked the 
Northridge team from the field to a cafeteria where dinner was served to all 
eight teams who participated in the Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is when you remember they are 12 years old," said Vicki Fisher, mother 
of shortstop Matt Fisher. "Their little hearts are broken." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet their hearts mend more quickly than many adults realize. 
</P>
<P>
 The players ate together at a long table, and within minutes they were horsing 
around and sharing laughs. Having as much fun as anyone was Justin Gentile, the 
losing pitcher in the 4-3 defeat at the hands of Maracaibo, Venezuela, on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile tugged on his cap, laughed, and shoveled food into his mouth. Losing 
did not curb appetites. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Northridge was champion of the United States. This loss did not take 
that away, and everyone reminded one another of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "One run separated the best two teams in the world," said Eric Gordon, father 
of Spencer Gordon. "These teams came from different continents, almost parallel 
universes, and playing the same game, they were so evenly matched it was 
incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents thought of the boost the team had given their embattled 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 "These boys gave a championship to a city that has been through an 
earthquake," said Bobbe Nesbit, mother of outfielder Michael Nesbit. "It was a 
great game, and we should all say it together, they are the United States 
champions." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was delayed three hours when a storm complete with booming thunder 
and bolts of lightning passed over the field. The consensus among Northridge 
supporters was that the delay took away momentum from their team. 
</P>
<P>
 The players agreed, but handled the defeat with class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Venezuela played a real good game and we have to congratulate them," said 
Matt Fisher between spoonfuls of ice cream. "They played better than we did 
after the delay." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher wished he could have spent time with his parents, and added that his 
teammates shared his feelings. "I wanted to talk to my mom but I couldn't 
because we had to do this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the parents drove rental cars to Philadelphia late Saturday night 
because they were flying home from there early today. They reluctantly left, 
having spent no more than a minute with their sons after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed, but this is typical of the way (parents) have been treated 
all week, so I am not surprised," said Lynn Wallis, mother of third baseman 
Gregg Wallis. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, the parents get their sons back for good. There will be plenty 
of activity for the team for a couple of weeks, and everyone is braced for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be very exciting," said Sharmie Drake, mother of Scott Drake 
Jr., "These boys have given us so much."

LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES NOTEBOOK; TICKET FLAP MEDIATED WITH CREATIVE 
BARTERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The ticket problem that had a few Northridge parents threatening to keep their 
sons from taking the field Saturday was resolved by diligent effort on the part 
of Pat Cunningham and Paula Mort. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham, mother of catcher Matt Cunningham, and Mort, a Northridge League 
official, went to Little League officials Saturday morning and explained that 
because of Little League's ticket distribution policy, grandmothers and 
siblings of players would be required to sit apart from the Northridge parents, 
who congregate directly above the first-base dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no admission charge, tickets that stipulate certain areas of 
the stadium are required. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham and Mort made a point of mentioning that Pat Reiser, widow of 
former Brooklyn Dodger Pete Reiser and the grandmother of Northridge player 
Peter Tuber, would be denied a ticket with the team's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 They added that television crews would be informed of where Pat Reiser was 
seated. 
</P>
<P>
 Voila! Little League produced more tickets for the preferred area, but still 
not enough to enable all 104 Northridge supporters to sit together. 
</P>
<P>
 Mort and several Northridge parents kept at it, trading pins and Earthquake 
T-shirts to ushers and fans in exchange for tickets. A few ushers simply began 
to look the other way when Northridge fans streamed to the seats. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the game began, all Northridge supporters were sitting above the 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a shame we had to stress out and spend all this time doing what 
Little League should have taken care of all along," Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Game for the ages: Whispers all over Williamsport suggest that the Venezuelan 
players are older than 12. But according to the World Series media guide, 
Northridge actually had the oldest players of the eight teams. 
</P>
<P>
 A player's "Little League age" is his age on July 31. Players born in August 
and September are the oldest legal Little Leaguers. Peter Tuber of Northridge 
turned 13 on Aug. 6 and teammate David Teraoka turned 13 on Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Northridge's 14 players, 11 were born between Aug. 1 and Dec. 31, 1981, 
including seven players born in August or September. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest 12-year-old player is Matt Cassel, who won't be 13 until April 
20. Gregg Wallis and John-Michael Baca are 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar Hidalgo, the starting pitcher for Venezuela Saturday, turned 13 today, 
according to the media guide. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A special trip: Jonathan Higashi, the Northridge player disqualified after the 
Southern California tournament for living outside the Northridge boundaries, 
has spent all week with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Higashi and his parents spent Friday in Cooperstown, N.Y., at the baseball 
Hall of Fame, which is a four-hour drive from Williamsport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to be out there playing, but the team is doing so great," Higashi 
said. "It's just great being here." 
</P>
<P>
 Higashi's father, Curtis, is pleased with the way Jonathan has been treated by 
the Northridge contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is so supportive," he said. "Jonathan's been able to make the 
transition real well. When we get back, he'll take part in all the activities 
the team has planned." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kids again: Most fathers of Northridge players did more than stand around and 
watch during practices. 
</P>
<P>
 They put on gloves and shagged fly balls. During scrimmages, they took 
positions and didn't mind looking silly dropping throws and tumbling on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 With television cameras chronicling practices the past few days however, some 
dads stayed on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to look like a fool on ESPN," chuckled Phil Wallis, father of 
third baseman Gregg.

PREPS '94; DATING GAME; SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS HAVING AN INCREASINGLY HARD TIME 
FILLING UP THEIR SCHEDULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most coaches wouldn't mind their dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 While Los Alamitos and Esperanza have experienced great success recently -- 
winning or sharing a Southern Section football championship the past four 
seasons -- they also have endured losses, even before they reach the playing 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 They're losing quality nonleague opponents, as the number of teams willing to 
take on the two titans has been dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our phone doesn't ring off the hook with teams trying to schedule us," 
Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia, which has won two section championships in the past three seasons, 
has similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of our success," Tiger Coach Mike Marrujo said, "some teams have 
dropped us from their schedules." 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza, Irvine, Los Alamitos, Mater Dei and Valencia have combined to win 
10 section championships and 81% of their games in the past five seasons. Nine 
of those 10 championships have come in the past three seasons, when the schools 
have won nearly 90% of their games. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's no wonder many teams shy away from these powerhouse programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's a nice problem to have," Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes said 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 But if strong teams have problems finding opponents, why don't they play each 
other? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how it works sometimes," Meek said. "Last season, we couldn't find a 
first game. Irvine had the same problem where they were stuck in a situation 
with no one to play." 
</P>
<P>
 In last season's opener, Irvine upset Esperanza, then-ranked fourth in the 
county, 35-14. It was an indication of things to come for Irvine as the 
Vaqueros won 12 of their next 13 games to win its third consecutive section 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Esperanza won't be playing Irvine this season, the Aztecs will play 
Mater Dei on Sept. 16. The Aztecs upset Mater Dei, then-ranked No. 1 in the 
county, 33-7, in a nonleague game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs also will play Irvine on Sept. 29. But that's the only other 
meeting between any of the five county powers in a nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos, which enters the season with a 35-game unbeaten streak, faces 
only one Orange County opponent on its nonleague schedule: Kennedy, the Garden 
Grove League champion last season, on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins will get stern out-of-county tests from Carson, the defending 
City Section 4-A champion, on Sept. 22 and Pasadena Muir, which is ranked in 
the Top 25 of one national high school preseason poll, on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I don't think the top teams in the county play each other 
enough," Irvine Coach Terry Henigan said. "But one of the big reasons they 
don't is that no team wants to get beat up before the stuff that counts, the 
league games." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barnes: "As a football fan, I'd love to see more of those games, too. But 
if your team is any good, you'll be playing those top teams in the playoffs 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried to set up what we thought would be attractive matchups, but we've 
been turned down a number of times. However, I feel every coach has the right 
to set up his schedule in whatever manner he feels is right for his program and 
his school, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes remembers what it was like when he took over at Los Alamitos in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're starting with a program that's been losing, to help turn it around 
you have to find opponents you feel that you can beat," he said. "Nothing can 
replace winning." 
</P>
<P>
 That is something on every coach's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every coach wants to win," Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson said. "Sure you 
want to have one or two games to really test your kids, but you don't want to 
destroy their morale by going 0-4 heading into league. That's an awful tough 
hill to climb." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Esperanza, Irvine, Los Alamitos, Mater Dei and Valencia have enjoyed 
tremendous success during the past five seasons, they have different approaches 
to building their nonleague schedules because of various factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some programs know they're going to be good, so one or two losses in 
nonleague play won't hurt them," Henigan said. "But there have been times when 
getting as many wins as possible in the preseason was very important for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to play a variety of teams, a good mix of running and passing teams. 
You like to play well-coached teams, but you don't want to get in over your 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 No coach wants his team to sustain injuries in nonleague play. But for Henigan 
and Marrujo, who coached in divisions IV and VI last season, health is a bigger 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to play competitive teams every week and you want to improve, but 
you can't get beat up," Marrujo said. "Especially for schools with lower 
enrollments. When you only have 35 to 40 players, lose three or four key 
players early and your season is affected drastically. Division I or II schools 
might have a little more depth in that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of injury keeps many opponents away from Division I schools such as 
Esperanza, Los Alamitos and Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know if you do beat us, it's a major feather in your cap," Rollinson 
said. "But you'll be playing against a team that plays a physical brand of 
football. Some schools will look at that and say they don't have anything to 
gain by playing us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure they might beat us, but a couple of players could get hurt. But then you 
could say those injuries could happen if you play Sisters of the Poor. It's a 
tough call." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Meek: "We've played the Mater Deis, Capistrano Valleys and Long Beach 
Polys, but you don't want to play five great teams in nonleague play." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Barnes: "You're dealing with high school kids, and they can't get 
emotionally up for every single game. I think there's a misperception of Los Al 
that we're a real physical team that can beat teams up. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're a finesse team. We have to find other ways to win. Honestly, I go 
into every game thinking how in the world are we going to beat these guys?" 
</P>
<P>
 But for these five schools, the answer appears to be a lot easier to come by.

 Coach Chuck Knox bristled when asked if Maddox's $875,000 contract money might 
have been better spent on acquiring offensive linemen, a troubled spot for the 
Rams in the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made an offer sheet on Kevin Donnalley (of Houston) this spring," Knox 
said."We make some mistakes like everybody else, but if there was a bona fide 
offensive lineman out there, the money would not be a concern." 
</P>

 New Ram quarterback Tommy Maddox got a chuckle Friday night when he saw Tampa 
Bay quarterback Trent Dilfer, bypassed by the Rams in last April's draft, 
lining up behind the right guard to take a snap. 
</P>
<P>
 "That shouldn't be too hard to learn," said Maddox, who saw Dilfer's gaffe on 
a TV highlights show. "I hope he has been lining up behind center for most of 
his career. That shouldn't be too hard." MIKE REILLEY

 Steve Walsh, starting for the injured Erik Kramer, passed for two first-half 
touchdowns and the Bears held off the New York Giants, 27-21, in Chicago to 
complete their first unbeaten exhibition season since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Butler kicked two fourth-quarter field goals, including a 53-yarder with 
4:16 left, for the Bears, who had a 24-7 lead in the final quarter before the 
Giants rallied behind backup quarterback Kent Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Elias scored on a one-yard run for New York with 10:24 remaining and, 
seconds later, Thomas Randolph recovered a fumble by Bear receiver Tyrone 
Williams. That set up a 20-yard touchdown pass from Graham to Chris Calloway 
with 9:16 left, cutting the lead to three, before Butler connected again to 
make it 27-21. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants finished exhibition play with a 1-4 record, the first time since 
1982 they have won only one preseason game.

 Atlanta Falcon Coach June Jones said free-agent All-Pro cornerback Deion 
Sanders has told him he will give his former club the opportunity to match any 
offer he receives from another NFL club. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, Deion has promised us that he'll bring us any offer he gets and 
see if we can match the thing," said Jones. "We're kind of operating under that 
assumption." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, a two-sport star who played the outfield for the Atlanta Braves 
before being traded to Cincinnati earlier this year, was Atlanta's No. 1 draft 
pick in 1989 and played with the Falcons for five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He is believed to have received at least two contract offers, but neither team 
was identified. Sanders recently visited San Francisco, Kansas City, New 
Orleans, Miami and Atlanta.

DEL MAR; GOLD SPLASH GETS BACK IN TUNE, SURGES TO WIN OSUNITAS STAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Gold Splash hurt all over. Bad backs will do that, to horses as well as 
humans. Trainer Dick Mandella did for his horse what he might have done for a 
human. 
</P>
<P>
 He called a chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandella's 4-year-old filly was a poster girl for chiropractic care Saturday, 
winning the $75,000 Osunitas Stakes in her first start since the unusual equine 
treatment. She beat Queens Court Queen by three-quarters of a length and Re 
Toss by another length in the 1 1/16th-mile race for older fillies and mares. 
</P>
<P>
 The trainer discovered Gold Splash's problem after a third-place finish in an 
ungraded stakes at Hollywood Park in late May. His filly had come to the United 
States highly touted after successfully campaigning in England and France. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a problem with a vertebra in her neck," said Chris Baker, Mandella's 
assistant trainer. "It was affecting the long muscles all down her back, and it 
was throwing her completely off." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandella, who was in Chicago Saturday for the Beverly D at Arlington, called a 
chiropractor, Don Crenshaw. Baker could not recall a chiropractor previously 
working on a Mandella horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a lot of stretching and pulling and a series of exercise movements," 
Baker said. "She probably had four or five treatments and he got her all 
aligned and into working order." 
</P>
<P>
 The Osunitas set up with Angi Go, the front-runner among the six entrants, on 
the pace and setting decent fractions. Gold Splash figured to lay off the 
leader with Re Toss coming from far back. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened was that Angi Go set slow fractions of 25 seconds for the first 
quarter-mile and 50 seconds for the half. Form was out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing," jockey Corey Nakatani said, "was to get her to relax. But 
the pace was so slow she was almost clipping heels. When you're going that 
slow, you don't spread out and the leaders aren't going to stop. Hopefully, 
you're in good position when it's time to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Gold Splash settled into last place through the first three-quarters of a 
mile, trailing even stretch-running Re Toss. However, Nakatani was able to get 
running room and Re Toss was boxed on the inside. The leaders were not coming 
back, so he had to go and get them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got a little tight there on the turn," Nakatani said, "but she got it 
done." 
</P>
<P>

 With only five horses entered in today's Grade II Chula Vista Handicap, and 
Paseana and Exchange running as an entry, there will be no show betting. The 
entry is listed at 3-5 on the morning line and could go lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Paseana, ridden by Chris McCarron and trained by Ron McAnally, has made only 
one start this year, a victory in the Santa Margarita Handicap at Santa Anita 
in March. Exchange, ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr. and trained by Bill Spawr, has 
also been lightly raced this year, making only three starts, one of them a 
victory here in the Bayakoa Handicap on Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The second morning-line choice, behind the entry, is English-bred Golden 
Klair, trained by Darrell Vienna and ridden by Corey Black. She earned a couple 
of Grade II victories in the spring at Hollywood Park and finished a close 
third to Potridee and Exchange in the Vanity Handicap on July 24, beaten by a 
length. 
</P>
<P>
 Magical Maiden, the defending champion, has only one race this year, a second 
in the Rancho Bernardo Breeders' Cup Handicap here Aug. 13. That was strictly a 
prep race for her at 6 1/2 furlongs. Today's race is at 1 1/16ths. 
</P>
<P>
 The final entrant, Glass Ceiling, is coming off a second-place finish to 
Exchange in the Bayakoa, beaten by only a length. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Read Handicap winner Approach The Bench will make his next start in the 
Del Mar Handicap next Sunday, according to trainer Richard Cross. The trainer 
will also have Pollock's Luck ready for the Del Mar Derby on Labor Day. . . . 
Jockey Polo Sanchez has been suspended for five days beginning Monday, joining 
Chris Antley and Nate Hubbard on the sidelines for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Ron McAnally, whose Potridee finished third Saturday in the Beverly D 
at Arlington, will watch Johann Quatz run in the Arlington Million on 
television and then saddle Paseana for the Chula Vista. . . . Concept Win, who 
ran the fastest six furlongs at Del Mar in two years Friday, might run in the 
Breeders' Cup Sprint. . . . A week after her match race victory over Mamselle 
Bebette, Soviet Problem is back at Bay Meadows. Owner John Harris has not found 
an appropriate race for his 4-year-old sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal Red, unbeaten in three starts, will try to become the second 
consecutive colt to sweep Saratoga's three 2-year-old stakes in today's 
seven-furlong Hopeful. Dehere did it last year.

 Paradise Creek heads a field of 14 grass-course runners in today's Arlington 
Million at Arlington International Racecourse. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise Creek won six consecutive stakes this year until being narrowly 
beaten by Lure in the Bernard Baruch Handicap at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
 His competition will include three horses from Europe, Muhtarram and Spartan 
Shareef from England and Petit Loup from France. 
</P>
<P>
 The others entered in the 1 1/4-mile race are Alex The Great, Blues Traveller, 
Fanmore, Fastness, Johann Quatz, Marastani, Mr. Cowboy, Semillon, Split Run and 
Star Of Cozzene. 
</P>
<P>
 Star Of Cozzene won the Million last year, leading Johannn Quatz to the wire, 
after finishing ninth to Dear Doctor the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 No horse has ever won the Million in successive years. Star Of Cozzene is 
winless in three starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise Creek, owned by Masayuki Nishiyama, is the 8-5 early favorite, 
followed by Muhtarram at 7-2.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hatoof, a 5-year-old French mare, surged from seventh place to defeat 
defending champion Flawlessly by a half-length and win the $500,000 Beverly D 
at Arlington International Racecourse on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was very special," said Walter Swinburn, Hatoof's jockey. "I wasn't 
worried when we were sitting back behind the leaders. She's a special mare. I 
let her run the race herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Christiane Head, who became the first female trainer to win the Beverly D, 
said, "Hatoof is a mare that likes to go her own way." Head is the eldest of 
three daughters of French trainer and breeder Alec Head. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatoof paid $7.80, $4.40 and $3.40 and was timed in 1:55 2/5 for the 1 3/16 
miles on turf. She earned $300,000 to increase her earnings to nearly $1.5 
million for owner Maktoum Al Maktoum of Dubai.

 Colonial Affair held off Devil His Due by a head to win the Whitney Handicap 
at Saratoga, only his second victory since the 1993 Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored Thunder Rumble, winner of the Jim Dandy and Travers in 1992 and this 
year's Saratoga Cup in his only previous starts at Saratoga, never contended 
and finished a distant fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Colonial Affair, ridden by Jose Santos, covered the 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 3/5 
and paid $19.60, $7.60 and $5.20. Devil His Due, top-weighted at 125 pounds and 
ridden by Mike Smith, returned $4 and $2.80. West By West, ridden by Pat Day, 
paid $3.80.

 Julie Krone rode Copper Mount to a record-setting two-length victory over 
Kristen's Baby in the $125,000 New York Derby at the Finger Lakes Race Track.

 Copper Mount set a track record of 1:48 4/5 in the 1 1/8-mile race for New 
York-bred 3-year-olds. It was his fourth victory in eight starts.

 The Cal State Northridge football team has added an NCAA Division I transfer 
who is expected to contribute at defensive end, Matador Coach Bob Burt said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Freitas, who played at Claremont High, Citrus College and Utah State, was 
given his release by Utah State on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He is expected to play immediately for the Matadors, Burt said. Freitas, a 
senior, is 6-feet-5, 235 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very good player," Burt said. "He'll fit in somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, who conducted their annual intrasquad scrimmage Saturday, open 
the season Sept. 10 at Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of freshmen walk-on players left the team this week. Defensive back 
Tyrone Francis, a Reseda High graduate, was declared ineligible and linebacker

FOUDY SHOWS WOMEN'S SOCCER IS ALIVE, KICKING; FUTURE: FORMER MISSION VIEJO STAR 
HOPES HER GAME GROWS THANKS TO THE POPULARITY OF THE RECENT WORLD CUP 
TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a Julie Foudy trading card now, and there are times after games when 
Foudy and her U.S. national soccer teammates sign autographs for 30 minutes 
while little girls go crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 There are clinics and speaking engagements, and there are meet-and-greets like 
the one last year when a 17-year-old from Tarzana met Foudy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like, 'Oh my gosh. I can't believe it's Julie Foudy,' the girl gushed. 
"She's my total idol." 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer boosters have spent decades predicting when the youth soccer boom would 
lead to American competitiveness in international soccer. Now they wait for the 
results of the World Cup to see if the enthusiasm of the new fans lasts, and 
how the present and planned pro leagues will fare. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have almost always talked about the men's game, and it is the women's 
game that has been the quiet success story -- too quiet. When the first World 
Championship was held in China in 1991 -- the equivalent of the World Cup -- 
the U.S. team won. This month, the U.S. team swept through the CONCACAF 
qualifying tournament for the 1995 FIFA World Championship, outscoring 
opponents, 36-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognition grows, slowly. The little girls, though, they know. 
</P>
<P>
 If the World Cup was a splash, the women are feeling the ripples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it going to help us? Definitely," said Foudy, 23, who starred at Stanford 
after a remarkable career at Mission Viejo High. "Right after the World Cup was 
probably the first time we've had our games on live TV. Prime Ticket did our 
games in the Chiquita Cup. I thought that was great. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you could get anything negative out of the World Cup. There was 
just so much enthusiasm. I had a blast. It was great to see so many people who 
had no idea about the game getting into it." 
</P>
<P>
 But there were the men, still a fledgling team by international standards, 
suddenly famous, suddenly being covered in news reports like the NFL, with 
injury reports and intrigue about who would play when and where. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'Are you mad? Are you upset?' " Foudy said. "You are sometimes, 
but (the men) have gotten some negative criticism, too. And they say, 'Yeah, 
(we're being noticed) but you guys are the world champions. You guys are the 
best.' It's mixed emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as many of the U.S. men do, the best players on the women's team play 
overseas -- not that they have an option in this country after college. Foudy 
is taking a rest in Menlo Park for a few weeks before returning to Sweden next 
month to finish the season with Tyreso Football Club, where U.S. players Mary 
Harvey and Kristine Lilly are teammates. Is this where the hard work pays off 
in the pocketbook? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not making millions of dollars or anything," Foudy said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they make expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The lure is not money. If it were, Foudy could play in Japan, where players 
including former Laguna Hills star Heather McIntyre make around $35,000, plus 
expenses. If it were about money, Foudy would probably have taken her 1993 
Stanford biology degree and gone straight to medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she plans to play in the 1995 World Championships and then in the 
1996 Olympics, where the U.S. women will have an opportunity to win the first 
gold medals in women's soccer. Then, she hopes, she'll begin medical school 
(Foudy took the MCAT on April 23, left for Sweden on April 25, then returned 
home to compete with the national team and wrap up the med school applications 
and is soon headed back across the Atlantic.) 
</P>
<P>
 Foudy plays in Sweden because she needs to play to keep improving. And she 
needs to be at her best for the U.S. team to reach its goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Myself, I had to go overseas," she said. "It's a really good 10-team league. 
It's pretty competitive. I'd say it's better than (NCAA) Division I." 
</P>
<P>
 Her fiance is in Northern California, but the soccer there for Foudy consists 
mostly of pick-up games with the guys or training with the college teams until 
their season starts. In Japan, she could make a little money for those tuition 
bills. But the Swedish league is more competitive, so that is where the best 
players go. 
</P>
<P>
 Foudy naturally wants to see a women's pro league flourish in this country, 
though she isn't from the same mold as the untold numbers of athletes in 
little-publicized or financially unrewarding sports -- women's or men's -- who 
resent not being able to make a living at what they do well. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if there is a women's pro soccer league in this country in, say, 
1996, don't expect Foudy to be in it. She hopes to be hanging around cadavers 
at Stanford or UC San Francisco. But she sees the need for a league -- and 
wishes those proposing to start one would seek her advice that it be a small, 
competitive, well thought-out league of maybe 10 strong teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Her desire to see a viable league isn't just so other women will have 
opportunities she didn't have. It's because for the United States to remain 
dominant in international play, she believes, there has to be an easier 
opportunity for women to compete after college. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at our team from the last World Championship, and a lot of us were 
still playing in college," she said. "Now a lot of us have moved on. The 
transition is from training every day and getting in a game or two every week 
to training on your own. Now you're getting in 10 games a year outside the 
national team. That's why I went to Sweden." 
</P>
<P>
 Foudy doesn't say it, but at a time when there are indoor and outdoor men's 
soccer leagues, a roller hockey league, an arena football league, and a tennis 
league in this country, why not women's soccer? 
</P>
<P>
 The youth enthusiasm already is there, making it perfect for the budget-minded 
families who are flocking to less expensive pro sports outings. 
</P>
<P>
 And its appeal is broad because the women's game is more similar to the men's 
game than in other sports. Soccer lacks the problems that face women's 
basketball, for instance, which many fans are slow to accept because without 
the above-the-rim play and the dunking it differs so much from the men's game. 
</P>
<P>
 And the best argument is simply that women soccer players in the United States 
are among the best in the world, there are already stars, and they might 
actually win the world title next year -- not just delight at being in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Foudy intends to win, and she hopes the United States will be able to keep 
winning after she's done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking to (recent U.S. and University of North Carolina Coach Anson 
Dorrance) and I told him I was worried about it," she said. "We're trying to 
play pick-up games with guys just to have competition. I just worry that some 
day it will catch up."

SALSA STREAK IS PUT OUT BY SOUNDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Salsa saw its three-game winning streak stopped Saturday in a 2-1 loss to 
the Seattle Sounders before 5,160 in an American Professional Soccer League 
game at the Tacoma Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Tacoma (10-4) remained in first place with the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa (7-6) dropped to third. 
</P>
<P>
 Tacoma has 79 points, Montreal has 65 and Los Angeles has 63. Montreal beat 
Ft. Lauderdale, 2-1, in a shootout Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tacoma built a 2-0 lead with goals late in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa, playing on artificial turf for the first time this season, scored 
its only goal with about 30 seconds remaining, when Brad Smith scored off an 
assist from Paulinho. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulinho had scored two goals each in the Salsa's last two games, including a 
2-0 victory over host Vancouver Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, the Sounders took a 1-0 lead with about 15 minutes left in the game 
on a goal by Chance Fry. Fry added another goal with about three minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa returns home to Titan Stadium on Wednesday to play host to Ft. 
Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know our players are anxious to return home and try to avenge the loss to 
Seattle," Salsa Coach Rick Davis said.

 Rusty Wallace ended a two-month victory drought in the Goody's 500 at Bristol 
(Tenn.) International Raceway on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace took the lead 45 laps from the finish when a piston in Geoff Bodine's 
engine burned, then held off a late challenge from Mark Martin to earn his 
sixth victory of the season and 37th of his NASCAR Winston Cup career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see the smoke from Geoff's car and I could smell it too," Wallace 
said. "When that thing went, I really needed that because he was double tough 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Bodine led 168 of the 500 laps on the .533-mile oval; Wallace led 105. Wallace 
averaged 91.363 m.p.h. and earned $53,015. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Earnhardt finished third and lost virtually no ground to either Martin or 
Wallace, the two drivers chasing him for the Winston Cup championship. He still 
leads Martin by 201 points and Wallace by 203 with nine races remaining.

FEW WORKERS USING FAMILY LEAVE LAW; ONLY 1% OF PERSONNEL AT MOST CALIFORNIA 
FIRMS ARE TAKING THE 12 WEEKS. BUSINESS WONDERS WHAT THE FUSS WAS ABOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Linda Kopps, personnel manager at Fireplace Manufacturers Inc. in Santa Ana, 
remembers worrying last August when the national family leave law took effect. 
"I thought a slew of workers would use it," she says. "It seemed so perfect for 
abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past 12 months, Kopps says, not a single one of her company's 202 
workers has asked for the federal leave. What does Kopps think about the law 
now? "It's not that big of a deal," she concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 While not universal, Kopps' opinion reflects a broad sentiment among employers 
in the state and nation. The Family and Medical Leave Act -- which allows up to 
12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for childbirth, adoption or serious 
illness of an employee or family member -- hasn't been as burdensome as 
employers feared. 
</P>
<P>
 For California employers, the worst has been some confusion between the 
federal law and a similar state-leave rule, which has been in place since 1992. 
But last October, California's law was changed to closely conform with the 
federal act. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it looks like is a lot of business leaders made a big stink about 
nothing," says Ron Seide, marketing manager at Kingston Technology Corp. in 
Fountain Valley, adding that he can not recall anyone at his 300-employee firm 
who has used the federal leave law. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Callahan, executive vice president of personnel at San 
Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank, isn't sure how many of the company's 19,000 
workers have taken the federal leave. Tracking workers on family leave hasn't 
been easy, she says, and the law has led Wells Fargo to hire more contract 
workers and to revise its leave policy. Still, Callahan said, "I don't know if 
we have denied it. The company has learned to survive it quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 For some workers, the federal leave has been a godsend. Dawn Gaskill, a sales 
coordinator at the Costa Mesa Marriott Suites, took almost four months off work 
for the birth of her second child by combining the state's pregnancy disability 
leave time and the amount of time granted under the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very big relief to know I would have a job when I got back," said 
the 29-year-old Anaheim resident. By contrast, when Gaskill had her first child 
four years ago, she says she quit her data-entry job because she could not get 
such an extended leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking leave to bond with a newborn, as Gaskill did, probably accounts for 
most of the people taking the federal leave. But experts say increasingly, 
workers are using the year-old law to care for an elderly parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Aguil, a lab technician at North American Chemical Co. in Trona, 
northeast of Bakersfield, had only two vacation days and no sick leave left for 
this year when her 71-year-old father became critically ill. Aguil says she 
considered calling in sick, but then her supervisor reminded her of the federal 
leave. "I had read about (the law) last year, but you don't think you're going 
to need it." 
</P>
<P>
 She did, and the federal law allowed her to care for her father during his 
last two weeks of life. "It meant the world to me," Aguil said. "I talked to 
him, I held his hand, I knew he knew I was there." 
</P>
<P>
 On average, it appears that only 1% or fewer of employees at most California 
companies are using the family leave, according to a private survey and other 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts believe that many more people would ask for the federal leave if 
companies got the word out about the year-old law. "The bottom line is 
employers haven't actively been communicating the law," says Janice Stanger, an 
associate at the consulting firm of William M. Mercer Inc., whose survey in 
January found that fewer than 50% of the California employers questioned had 
provided information about the federal leave law to their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In one such dispute in Southern California, Paul Worthman, research director 
at the Service Employees International Union Local 399 in Los Angeles, accuses 
Kaiser Permanente of failing to post notices about the leave law in various 
Kaiser centers, as the law requires. "Kaiser never notified employees of the 
act's existence," said Worthman, whose union represents 12,000 workers at eight 
Kaiser centers. Kathy Logan, a nurse at a Kaiser Permanente clinic in Anaheim, 
adds that she was written up by her supervisor for taking a leave that Logan 
believes qualifies under the federal law. "They need to learn about this," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser spokeswoman Kathleen Barco, while declining to comment on Logan's case, 
says that the health maintenance organization has posted notices and provided 
information about the federal law through employee newsletters. "I think we've 
met the letter of the law," Barco says, adding: "In fact, I think we've gone 
beyond it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Service Employee union's accusation against Kaiser, which has yet to be 
resolved, is one of 965 complaints lodged nationwide through June 30 with the 
Labor Department. About 11% of those were filed on the West Coast. Nationwide, 
labor officials say that six in 10 of the complaints against employers were 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the Santa Ana office of the Labor Department says it has 
received just four complaints, but information about those cases was not made 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if employers were to do a better job of promoting the federal leave 
law, it's not clear there would be a surge of requests. The main reason is that 
the federal act provides for unpaid leave, and most people simply can't afford 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Others don't want to jeopardize their careers by taking extra time off, which 
may explain why relatively few people are using the family leave law. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's probably a fear that their co-worker will take the occasion to rise 
and shine," says Tom Gardner, the Orange County regional manager of the 
Employers Group, a statewide association with 5,000 member businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Many workers also cannot use the federally sanctioned leave because the law 
does not cover businesses with fewer than 50 employees or workers who have been 
at their jobs less than a year. And some companies, especially big employers, 
have long had sick leave and personal leave policies that are as generous as 
the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had the ability to take leave," said Angela Keefe, president of 
the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union Local 681 in Santa Ana, 
which represents workers at Disneyland and the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because of the federal leave law, more employers now are also allowing 
employees to use company sick leave to care for a family member and allowing 
people to have flexible work schedules, says Renee Christensen, president of 
Employee Support Systems Co., an Orange-based firm that provides employee 
assistance and counseling for companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the whole, were it not for the federal regulations, workers would not 
be able to take extended leaves, as Steven Meade of Irvine is about to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Meade and his wife, Susan, have been saving for a year so he can spend three 
months with their first child, expected in late September. Meade, an engineer 
at the Marriott Suites Costa Mesa, has already received approval for the leave 
from his employer. "Without the law," Meade says, "I don't think I would have 
taken a lot of time, probably not even the full month." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Lockwood, the human resources director for three Marriott hotels in 
Orange County, including the one at which Meade works, said that in the past 
Marriott employees had no job guarantee if they took a personal leave of more 
than 30 days. Lockwood says that at her three hotels, which collectively employ 
700 people, about 10 workers have taken the federal leave so far. 
</P>
<P>
 To cover for those on leave, Lockwood says she has hired temporary help and 
juggled employee schedules. But it has not been burdensome, she says, and it 
has helped build employee loyalty to the company. "It's extra paperwork, but 
that's about it." Family-Leave Provisions 
</P>
<P>

Medical Leave Act to provide 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to 
eligible employees. Details on the year-old federal law:

NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS GET PROGRAMMED TO SUCCEED; EDUCATION: THE EIGHT-WEEK 
AMERICAN INDIAN SUMMER INSTITUTE AT UC IRVINE PROVIDES INTERNSHIPS AND COMPUTER 
MENTORING FROM MAINSTREAM FIRMS FOR 39 YOUNG PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 His long black hair tied back in a ponytail, Carl Lufkins jokes that he's 
aiming for a more corporate look. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that his mentors at Toshiba America Electronic Components Inc. seemed 
concerned about the appearance of the summer intern. Instead, for a visitor's 
benefit, Toshiba employees grill Lufkins, 27, and his colleague Dawn Old Elk, 
22, on their four-week jobs at the components manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Native American college students spent most of August learning about the 
flow of data within Toshiba's management systems -- from customer orders to 
accounts receivable -- and studied the computer programming used to move those 
thousands of pages worth of information through the company's ordering process. 
</P>
<P>
 Toshiba's systems, built around an 8-year-old IBM mid-range computer, have 
been updated several times to keep up with the company's demands. But the older 
machine did not diminish what Lufkins and Old Elk had to say about their 
internships, which they described as far superior to alternatives they had back 
home -- in Sisseton, S.D., and Billings, Mont., respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were among 39 Native American students from community colleges in the 
western United States who recently completed the American Indian Summer 
Institute in Computer Science at UC Irvine. The class was composed of people 
from 25 different tribes and nations, including Cree, Navajo, Apache and 
Washoe, said program officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The students spent the first half of the eight-week program in UCI classrooms 
and computer labs, taking classes in computer science, programming, and 
research skills. 
</P>
<P>
 They then worked as interns at 16 Southern California companies, mainly in 
Orange County. Altogether, 21 businesses have contributed a total of $200,000 
to the program over the last two years. The program has also received National 
Science Foundation grants totaling about $430,000 over the last two years, said 
program administrator Essie Lev. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer science institute is aimed at students from rural areas and 
smaller cities, who otherwise would have more difficulty learning about 
technical fields.  
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member faculty also hopes the program will encourage students to 
transfer from the junior colleges they now attend to four-year undergraduate 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ada Shane, a 30-year-old student at Little Bighorn Community College in Crow 
Agency, Mont., said the UCI classes and her internship at Unisys Corp. will 
help her pursue an accounting career, a field increasingly dependent on 
knowledge of computers and programming. 
</P>
<P>
 At Unisys, Shane worked with company accountants on a cost-allocating project, 
and assisted customers calling the company's help line. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane said she had already learned how to use a few basic software programs, 
such as spreadsheets, while working as a secretary. But, as a mother, it was 
not easy to balance her full-time job with community college classes and child 
rearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "At home, people are so family-oriented . . . it's hard to get the focus on 
school," said Shane, a member of the Crow tribe. She originally had been 
admitted to the UCI program last year, but decided that her daughter -- then 2 
-- was too young to leave for most of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said their student interns helped managers rethink how they 
operate their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got some sharp students," said Darrell Lynn, a Toshiba spokesman. "They 
ask the kinds of questions that an insider tends to forget to ask." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Quayle, who works in development services at Unisys Corp.'s Mission 
Viejo facility, praised Navajo intern Christine Ann Smith, 23, for writing a 
database program within a week of her arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 The interns probably "come in with an idea of what a corporation must be like, 
that it's kind of stuffy," he said. "I hope this is an eye-opening experience 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the obvious enthusiasm of the companies and students, the program does 
not ensure all its graduates will seek higher scientific or technical degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 60 students who completed the program during its first two years, fewer 
than a third have transferred or are in the process of transferring from 
two-year to four-year colleges, said program officials. One reason for the low 
number is that some of last year's class returned for additional training this 
summer, while others are working to save money to help finance four-year degree 
programs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lev, the UCI program administrator, said the transfer rate is a reminder of 
the difficulties facing Native Americans, the least visible of minorities in 
the technical fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 24,557 bachelor's degrees awarded in computer sciences in the United States 
during the 1991-92 academic year, the most recent year for which figures are 
available, only 81 were given to students who identified themselves as Native 
Americans or Alaskan Natives, according to the Commission on Professionals in 
Science and Technology in Washington. In contrast, African Americans earned 
2,147 of those degrees and Latinos earned 901. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the gap is because of the smaller proportion of Native Americans in 
the overall population. For the 1990 U.S. Census, 1.9 million people identified 
themselves as American Indian, compared with 30 million who identified 
themselves as black and 22.4 million who identified themselves as Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the number of science and engineering degrees awarded to Native 
Americans has slowly climbed in the last decade, it hasn't kept pace with the 
increase in number of Native Americans overall -- up nearly 38% from 1.4 
million in the 1980 U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Boham, director of the Indian Natural Resource, Science and 
Engineering Program at Humboldt State University in Northern California, said 
he thinks that another reason for the low representation rate is a conflict 
between the quantitative approach of the physical sciences and the more 
holistic perspectives of Indian cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cultural paradigm difference," said Boham, who is a member of the 
Little Shell tribe of the Chippewa nation in Montana. "Science isolates and 
dissects. The Native American worldview is more of a holistic one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there is a support system, many students will feel like science is 
asking them not to be Indian anymore, to change the way they view the world," 
Boham said. "Sometimes it's to the point where it feels like science is asking 
for the soul. Either they find the support that they can do this and still be 
Indian, or they drop out." 
</P>
<P>
 Institute founder Lubomir Bic originally thought he would focus on the low 
number of African American, Latino and Native American students in computer 
classes when he began a five-year stint as associate chairman for undergraduate 
studies in the computer science department in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Bic decided to narrow his focus to Native Americans because he said he did not 
want to duplicate other UCI programs designed to aid minorities, chiefly the 
Women and Minority Engineering Program and the California Alliance for Minority 
Participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Targeting Native Americans also fit with an interest in the American West that 
Bic said he has developed since coming to UCI in 1976 to begin work on his 
Ph.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in what was Czechoslovakia, Bic said, his sense of the U.S. 
frontier came from reading the pulp novels of German writer Karl May. But after 
he arrived, Bic said, he was struck by the contrast between the socioeconomic 
status of Native Americans and the romantic view he had been given by May, who 
died in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
 "May got everything mixed up -- he'd have an Apache chief canoeing with a 
French trapper on the Hudson," Bic said. "But he had everybody on an equal 
footing. I liked it, that the Indians had as much to do as the Europeans in his 
plots." 
</P>
<P>
 Motivated to reconcile the split between the reality and those pulp novel 
images, Bic began to develop contacts with Native American and community 
college officials as he traveled in western states on vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 Those contacts paid off in 1992, when his computer institute accepted its 
first class of 11 students, mainly from Navajo Community College in Tsaile, 
Ariz. Funding for that first year came from the community college, UCI and four 
local companies, Bic said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first year worked well enough to earn the institute funding from the 
National Science Foundation, which permitted it to expand to 49 students in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Pierce, director of special projects for the American Indian Science 
and Engineering Society, based in Boulder, Colo., said more universities ought 
to consider creating similar computer institutes, because it focuses on keeping 
the interests of students who have already begun scientific programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear of a lot of schools bragging about their recruiting" of Native 
Americans, Pierce said. "The part that counts is how well they keep those 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 The internships may be the key of the UCI program's success, said Rick Tewa, a 
member of the Hopi tribe who is president of Hopi Technologies Inc., a circuit 
board manufacturing company based in Winslow, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools cannot teach all the skills needed to function in business 
environments, he said. And among minority students, Native Americans tend to 
have the least access to internships and development programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot (of students) come out of community college programs and it's like, 
'Here I am, now put me to work.' It doesn't work that way," Tewa said. Few 
students on reservation have access to the technical internships they need to 
start careers, he said. "It's a bad cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 As the students left for their homes last week, Bic was back in his office 
drafting a grant application to the National Science Foundation to extend the 
program for another few years. The grants also make it easier to raise money 
from local companies, said Bic, adding that he is "always looking" for new 
companies to take on interns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new grant proposal, Bic said, he will stress the institute's blending 
of internships and course work. "We don't want our students just to get some 
clerical tasks," he said. "We're proud of what these companies have them 
doing." Computer Degrees and Race 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the computer science degrees awarded in recent years to black, Latino 
or Native American students were earned by blacks. Just 0.3% of both the 
baccalaureate and master's degrees earned in 1991-92, the most recent year for 
which information is available, went to Native Americans:

IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY, STUDY AND BUSINESS EXPERIENCE ABROAD ARE CRITICAL. YET 
AMERICANS STAY HOME WHILE 400,000 FOREIGN STUDENTS COME HERE TO LEARN. CALL IT 
...; THE STUDENT GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shadowing the $100-billion U.S. merchandise trade deficit with the ascendant 
economies of Asia is an equally astounding "student gap" -- a strategic lapse 
that experts warn is laying a groundwork of ignorance and incompetence for the 
United States as a player in the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 At last count, there were 63 times as many foreign students from Asia on U.S. 
campuses as there were Americans studying in Asia, according to the Institute 
of International Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistic means American businesses will remain at a distinct disadvantage 
as they negotiate with their counterparts in Asia across language barriers and 
cultural chasms, analysts contend. Opportunities are bound to be lost, they 
say, because of limited access to basic information in the markets of America's 
most important economic rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The imbalance implies a huge problem," said Eric J. Gangloff, director of the 
Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission, an agency created by Congress to foster 
cultural exchange. "To be able to work effectively with Japan or other Asian 
countries, we need a large number of young Americans coming up through the 
ranks who are competent. But this can only be accomplished through in-country 
learning." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the lopsided relationship is due largely to a laudable American 
tradition of opening its educational system to the world. The IIE says 438,618 
foreign students were enrolled at U.S. campuses in 1993, more than half from 
Asia. The assumption is that some will end up working for American industry and 
that many others will return home with a profound appreciation of democratic 
values -- an intangible asset for U.S. influence on the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to training its own students, the United States suffers from 
world-class myopia, despite the wealth of international diversity on its 
campuses. Perhaps out of cultural arrogance, perhaps out of apathy or the fear 
of the unknown, relatively few young Americans venture outside of the comfort 
of Western Europe for international learning experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the approximately 13.5 million American university students, only 8% are 
enrolled in language courses and a mere 0.5% go overseas to study, surveys 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a small number of exchange students and graduate fellows are gaining 
experience in Asia, the Middle East, Africa or Eastern Europe. Instead, nearly 
three quarters of them go to Western Europe; one in four goes to Britain for 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 In a competitive world, that kind of student deployment no longer makes sense 
to a growing number of educators and policy-makers. The new thinking on global 
education is moving away from the time-honored fantasy of reading poetry in 
Parisian cafes during a junior year abroad and instead refocusing on such 
practical matters as training engineering students to read patents in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real shortage of people with technical expertise who know Japan 
well," said Norbert Hootsmans, who interned in a Hitachi engineering research 
lab in Japan after getting his Ph.D in engineering from the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology two years ago. "I see a strong need out there, but 
there are very few people who can bridge the gap." 
</P>
<P>
 Hootsmans now works as a scientist specializing in manufacturing technology 
development at United Technologies in East Hartford, Conn. For him, going to 
Japan for experience was the logical thing to do. "In my field," he said, "you 
go to where the technology is the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Hootsmans is a success story, but he's the exception. 
</P>
<P>
 To redirect the Eurocentric orientation of overseas study, Sen. David Boren 
(D-Okla.) pushed a bill through Congress in 1991 establishing the National 
Security Education program. The program's aim is to finance overseas study 
outside Western Europe and build academic infrastructure at U.S. institutions 
for study of neglected areas of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was originally authorized for a $150-million "peace dividend" 
endowment from the intelligence budget, but lawmakers ultimately wrangled the 
money from the B-2 bomber program. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, however, the program is under pressure. In June, about a month after 
its first 485 awards were announced, the House defense subcommittee on 
appropriations rejected authorization to spend interest from the endowment fund 
to finance next year's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents hope they'll have better luck in the Senate, where the 
Appropriations Committee is considering a bill that would restore authorization 
to spend $8.5 million on the program. It was funded at $10 million this year 
and had requested $14.3 million for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a lot of misunderstanding of what the program is doing," said 
Charlene King, director of the lean staff of volunteers administering the 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
 King rejects criticism from some members of Congress that the program is 
frivolous, noting that a third of the undergraduate fellowships awarded this 
year are sending students to East Asia, a critical and challenging study 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The return on investment comes when these students take their skills into the 
work force," King said. "Heaven knows we need it." 
</P>
<P>
 But budget cutters in Congress are also snipping away at another peace 
dividend program for higher education, this one aimed primarily at preparing 
American engineering and science students for the real-life challenges of 
competing with Japan in the global high-technology arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Administered by the Air Force, the U.S.-Japan Industry and Technology 
Management Training Program subsidizes student internships in Japanese 
companies. (It is this program that helped Hootsmans land his berth at 
Hitachi.) 
</P>
<P>
 Its model is a program, run by MIT since 1981, that has trained about 300 
engineering and business students in Japanese-language and regional studies and 
placed them in internships with Japanese corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force adopted the MIT design and over the past three years has 
expanded the number of institutions offering such training and internships to 
10, including Stanford and UC Berkeley. It has sponsored an additional 415 
students to date. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year's authorized funding of $10 million was chopped in half, 
according to a spokeswoman for the Office of Air Force Scientific Research, 
which administers the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work very hard with Congress and government people to help them understand 
this program," said Patricia Gercik, director of the prototype Japan Program at 
MIT. "But I think America has become very insular. We didn't used to be this 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 The consequences come down to dollars and cents. Norman Peterson of the 
Alliance for International Education and Cultural Exchange, a Washington group 
that monitors student exchange issues, asserts that there is a direct 
correlation between foreign study and economic competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Across the board, we have a major gap, and it costs us," Peterson said. "We 
continue to be perplexed at how the Japanese do business. We don't have an 
experience of any size that helps us to understand and work with Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, government-funded efforts at sending American students abroad 
have been broadly aimed at academia. The venerable Fulbright Fellowship 
program, for instance, has emphasized exchanges of scholars bound for teaching 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the focus is slowly shifting to technical and professional career 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 An example is the Japan scholarship at Columbia University's Graduate School 
of Journalism, one of the programs supported by Gangloff's federally funded 
Friendship Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia prepares two Japanese-speaking American students each year for 
long-term internships with news organizations in Japan. Over the past decade, 
graduates have gone on to take positions in the Tokyo press corps, raising the 
standards of Japanese-language proficiency among foreign reporters there. 
</P>
<P>
 But acquiring a solid foundation in difficult languages such as Chinese, 
Japanese or Russian requires a major investment of time, educators point out. 
Study should begin in high school and continue in college, they say, ideally 
galvanized by an in-country living experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent studies say college enrollment in Chinese-language courses 
rose about 15% between 1986 and 1990, while study of the Japanese language 
doubled. But the numbers are still small. In 1990, more than a quarter of a 
million students enrolled in French, but only 19,490 enrolled in Chinese and 
45,719 took Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in Japanese is spreading significantly in American high schools, 
where about 26,000 studied the language in 1990. But that's a far cry from 
English study in Japan, where the subject is required in grades seven through 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 David Maxwell, director of the National Foreign Language Assn. in Washington, 
worries that university study of Russian has recently taken a "dramatic dive" 
as students find it hard to imagine visiting the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception is that the former republics of the Soviet Union continue to 
be one of the most dangerous places on Earth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell is encouraged by indications that Japanese study is continuing to rise 
dramatically, although he has misgivings about the naive expectations of easy 
wealth that apparently motivate some students. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of students are saying they are going to study Japanese, get an MBA at 
Harvard or Stanford and then get rich," Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while interest in Japanese studies has soared with the recognition of that 
country's economic prowess, the number of Americans studying in Japan appears 
to be declining. The cause appears to be the appreciating Japanese yen, which 
makes the cost of living untenable for many and exacerbates the difficulties of 
adjusting to life in a relatively closed society. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by the Laurasian Institution, a Washington think tank, notes that the 
count of U.S. students in Japan peaked at 1,769 in the 1991-92 academic year, 
declining 20% by this year. In comparison, the number of Japanese students in 
U.S. universities has risen dramatically since the value of the yen began to 
soar in 1986, approaching 43,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Study in China has also suffered a setback, but for different reasons. 
Following the Tian An Men massacre in 1989, when Chinese troops crushed 
pro-democracy student demonstrators, estimated American enrollment in Chinese 
universities and language schools dropped by more than 50% to about 700 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students being shot is not the best marketing" for a host country, said 
Philip Palin, director of the Laurasian Institution. "But the problem in China 
is also very similar to Japan. There's a lack of infrastructure to receive 
foreign students. There's no English-language curriculum and a lot of problems 
with housing." 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese students, meanwhile, topped the charts of foreigners attending U.S. 
schools, numbering more than 45,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the favored destinations for Asian students is the University of 
Southern California, which ranks among the top three American institutions in 
foreign student enrollment. Two-thirds of USC's 4,189 foreign students in the 
1993-94 year were from Asia: 995 from Taiwan, 432 from South Korea, 426 from 
China, 266 from Hong Kong, 264 from India, 218 from Japan and 204 from 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other direction, USC sent 112 students abroad, most of them to Western 
Europe. Fifteen students went to Japan -- the same number that went to 
Australia. New programs are in the works to send students to universities in 
China, Taiwan and South Korea, according to the Office of Overseas Studies, but 
no students have participated in them yet. 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster the number of undergraduates studying in Japan, the Friendship 
Commission's Gangloff is working with other institutions to establish a 
clearinghouse to provide aspiring students with information on available 
programs. Meanwhile, a Washington nonprofit organization called Gateway Japan 
is offering the services of a database it is assembling on Japan study 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Vice President Walter Mondale, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, has taken 
a personal interest in the issue. After long negotiations, Tokyo's Ministry of 
Education is relenting to American demands that the national university system 
be made more accessible to foreign students. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo University is planning to open an international division with an 
English-language curriculum. Nobel laureate Leon Esaki, president of state-run 
Tsukuba University, chairs a commission examining the question of how to get 
more American students into university programs in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gangloff and other educators agree that one of the biggest obstacles is at 
this end: the lack of an academic infrastructure to prepare students for the 
trials of studying in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real nut to crack is how do we get more numbers," said Jackson Bailey, a 
historian from Earlham College in Indiana and a pioneer in taking American 
undergraduates to Japan. "But we need to get more undergraduates interested and 
prepared if we're going to try to open new opportunities in Japan. There's the 
danger that we may throw a party and nobody comes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the very mentality of the U.S. job market may be the biggest 
barrier of all to developing young Americans with badly needed expertise in 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators lament that American corporations -- even multinationals with years 
of experience battling for business in Asian markets -- typically ignore 
language skills and overseas study experience when evaluating the credentials 
of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. employers prefer to hire candidates with business degrees, they say, and 
are reluctant to invest the time to train someone who might have significant 
experience studying in Asia. That takes away the incentive to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "If students don't get the word that you'll get a better-paying job if you 
graduate with joint degrees in Japanese and business, for example, they aren't 
going to be motivated. There's no incentive in their brain," said Richard 
Drobnick, a USC business professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be a general awareness of this at the senior levels of the 
companies," he said. "The CEOs are sympathetic, but not at the recruiting 
level." Study in Contrasts 
</P>
<P>
 More than six times as many foreigners come to the United States for higher 
education as Americans go abroad to study. The gap -- which has broad 
implications for business competitiveness -- is especially wide vis a vis Asia. 
There are 63 times as many Asian students on U.S. campuses as Americans 
studying in Asia. Where Americans study...

JAMES FLANIGAN: SOCIAL CHANGE CHEAPER THAN $30-BILLION CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How much safety will a $30-billion anti-crime bill buy Americans? 
</P>
<P>
 It will buy some reduction in crime and give a boost to a growing crime 
prevention and control industry. But to bring about the law-abiding society 
that Americans long for these days will take social changes we may be unwilling 
-- or unable -- to make. There are contradictions in crime and challenging 
questions for American society. 
</P>
<P>
 First, and surprisingly, we should be aware that crime statistics issued by 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation show burglaries and other crimes against 
property declining. Homicides, rapes and robberies against adults are also 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 However, juvenile crime is up -- the gang violence and drive-by shootings that 
punctuate urban America. In any case, recent overall declines are only a 
respite from almost three decades in which U.S. crime rates zoomed to a high 
level and stayed there. 
</P>
<P>
 Public anxiety is intense. One result is that the Senate, after a furious 
battle, voted Thursday night to spend $30 billion to build prisons, hire police 
and invest in crime prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Another consequence is the growing crime control industry -- from auto alarms 
to armed guards -- that research firm Arthur D. Little Inc. estimates at $60 
billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 America now has a small army of private police, in addition to public police 
forces. Roughly 12,000 companies nationwide provide guards for neighborhoods, 
factories, stores and office buildings. Most are small and local, paying little 
more than minimum wage to pensioned police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But three companies with publicly traded stock -- Borg-Warner Security Corp., 
Pinkerton's Inc. of Encino and Wackenhut Corp. -- are growing by acquiring 
smaller outfits and working for big firms such as General Motors that no longer 
use their own employees to guard the plant. "It's in these firms, particularly 
Pinkerton's, that technology will transform this 'night watchman' business," 
says Stephen Weinress of L.H. Friend, Weinress & Frankson, an Irvine investment 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Prisons are a growing business too, with about 1 million inmates in federal 
and state institutions and a trend to use private prisons run by such firms as 
Corrections Corp. of America and Wackenhut Corrections, an affiliate of the 
security firm. The crime bill contains nearly $10 billion for new prisons, 
enough to build 450 jails of 1,000 beds each. 
</P>
<P>
 That may seem like a sad public works program, but criminologist James Q. 
Wilson, author of "Thinking About Crime" and "Crime and Human Nature," says 
prisons do reduce the crime rate. "It's hard to measure, but the prospect that 
you will go to prison has a discouraging effect on crime," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For that matter, neighborhood security services, burglar alarms and other 
paraphernalia of a fearful America are probably responsible for the decline in 
burglaries -- at least in the neighborhoods where people can afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 But while prisons and alarms are useful, most Americans know they won't make 
society law-abiding. A good dose of job creation and something more intangible 
-- even spiritual -- is needed. Our longings for a renewed sense of community 
are reflected in writings from across the political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative Republican William Bennett's "Book of Virtues," which holds up 
such examples of civic virtue as Martin Luther King Jr., is a bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lerner, liberal editor of the journal Tikkun, influences the White 
House with writings on "the politics of meaning," in which he rebukes 
"selfishness and cynicism" and calls for greater unity and responsibility for 
each other in U.S. society.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, whose new book, "The Moral Sense," is also a summons to our better 
nature, says nations everywhere are paying for the passing of an older sense of 
community. Crime is up in every industrialized country except Japan, he notes, 
and a main reason is the dramatic expansion of personal freedom and mobility in 
the last half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people faced with greater freedom from family, law, village and clan 
have used it for good purposes -- artistic expression, economic 
entrepreneurship, self-expression," he says. "But a small fraction have used it 
for bad purposes" -- criminal behavior, drug use and drug peddling, which 
account for a lot of crime. Only about 6% of young people commit more than half 
the serious juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to society of a single individual lost to drugs or crime runs to 
millions of dollars, if lost productive labor and taxes over a lifetime are 
combined with the costs of treatment or incarceration. That's why the idea of 
midnight basketball is appealing; through it, communities might save lives and 
a few million bucks in the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 What else can be done? Jobs can be created, attention can be paid. Again, 
Wilson looks to history. "London, a very dangerous place at the end of the 
1800s, improved over the span of the 19th Century through a severe but 
voluntary program called Victorian morality -- preaching, schooling, the 
Salvation Army, strict rules and etiquette." 
</P>
<P>
 Those were all restraints on impulsive behavior and stresses on community 
rules. Japan, almost alone among industrial nations, does much the same today 
-- not to mention Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 It should not be overlooked that economic growth has a lot to do with the 
success of rules: 19th-Century imperial Britain was prosperous, as is 
contemporary Japan; prewar Japan was poorer and lawless. 
</P>
<P>
 Can we -- will we -- emulate the Victorians? Wilson is dubious. There is a 
longing for restraint, he agrees, but we value maximum freedom, and the two are 
in conflict. "I don't notice us voting money for at-risk babies or really 
funding police forces," despite some money for police in the crime bill. Nor 
are we pushing the economy to provide opportunity for the rural and inner-city 
jobless. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we do have a chance to change, because the next few years will see 
crime rates continue to decline as the population ages. (Crime waves 
historically coincide with waves of youth.) But toward the end of the decade, 
the numbers of young people -- the echo of the baby boom -- will grow 
dramatically again. 
</P>
<P>
 So we have time to "change our society," as Michael Lerner puts it, or to beef 
up those security services and complete that prison construction program. 
Change would be cheaper.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / STEWART ALSOP: ISDN: AN 'IRRELEVANT' TECHNOLOGY ABOUT 
TO OPEN UP THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEWART ALSOP, STEWART ALSOP, a long-time observer of the personal computer 
industry, is editor-in-chief of San Mateo-based Info World magazine and the 
founder and publisher of P.C. Letter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm driving up the on-ramp to the information highway. Next week, I'm having 
ISDN installed at my house, and I thought I'd share the experience with you as 
a historical anecdote. It just may be like it was for our grandparents when 
they got their first telephone or for our parents when they got a color 
television. You know: "Hey, Martha! Want to come over and see my ISDN?" 
</P>
<P>
 ISDN is one of those old new technologies. It was introduced 10 years ago as a 
way for telephone companies to give us a relatively high-speed connection 
between our computers -- really more for business than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's taken so long to get anywhere with ISDN that most people have decided 
it is irrelevant. Indeed, techno-people like to joke about what ISDN stands 
for. It means Integrated Services Digital Network , but wisecrackers label it I 
Still Don't kNow or It Still Does Nothing . It's been around that long. 
</P>
<P>
 ISDN is rarely mentioned in the popular press when the information highway is 
being discussed. Instead, most people focus on cable-related technologies or 
the Bell Atlantic technology developed for sending full-screen video across 
telephone wires, or even the new ATM (Adaptive Transfer Mode) as the foundation 
of the information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 But the truth is that ISDN is the first thing that's going to come along that 
begins to give people a taste of what the future will be like. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in California, several factors have come together suddenly to make ISDN a 
hot new technology, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the state Public Utilities Commission has approved a new pricing scheme 
for ISDN that means you can get it for as little at $22.95 a month (if you 
don't use it for business and only use it nights and weekends). 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Pacific Bell has embraced this price structure in a program called 
ISDN Everywhere. So now when you call your local PacBell office and say you 
want ISDN, they'll reply, "Yes! When do you want the line installed?" 
Previously, the response ranged from "Shut your mouth!" to "Huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Third, both PacBell and GTE have steadily been adding the equipment to their 
telephone networks, and that allows people to get ISDN connections pretty 
easily. Today, ISDN is directly available on about 60% of PacBell's network, 
and the company can offer it on the other 40% with a little extra work. GTE 
says 77% of its network will be ISDN-capable by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, corporations have begun to adopt the concept of remote-access 
technology, which makes it easier for people to use their computers whether 
they are in the office, at home or traveling. And ISDN is the best way to make 
those remote connections from home. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these developments together mean that ISDN is becoming affordable, 
available and useful -- all prerequisites for turning a technology from theory 
into reality. 
</P>
<P>
 At least in Silicon Valley, where I live, ISDN at home is now way cool for 
leading nerds and executives, something like what it was to be one of the first 
people to have a cellular car phone about five years ago. If you go to a party 
in the valley and talk about your ISDN connection, it's hard to fight off the 
admirers. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior technical and management executives at companies such as Sun 
Microsystems and Silicon Graphics are now being supplied with ISDN lines so 
they can work at home at the kind of speed they are used to having at work. 
</P>
<P>
 The last thing I want is to be left behind. And it turns out that the company 
I work for has already installed ISDN in the office, to allow us to send files 
to our printer in Illinois. So we've ordered an ISDN line for my house. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's installed, I'll be able to connect with my office network at about 
10 times the speed that would be possible by dialing in through a standard 
modem. So what, you ask? That means I get the immediate benefit of responding 
instantaneously to my e-mail and that I can do from home the collaborative work 
that usually waits until I arrive at the office. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is just the beginning, which is why I say I'm driving up the on-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 There are already several products for holding a video conference using ISDN. 
When I have my line installed and my computer set up, I'm going to get the 
software to do video conferencing. Then I'll be able to call up my favorite 
technology executives and interview them from my home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next, I'll get my mother to buy the same stuff (total cost -- including the PC 
and extra hardware: about $5,000 and declining rapidly) and I'll be able to 
chat with her regularly while actually seeing how she looks. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometime next year, I'll be able to put what's called a cable modem in my 
other PC and plug my television cable into the computer. With that hookup, I'll 
be able to watch TV on my PC, record shows and capture images of famous or 
important people. 
</P>
<P>
 More significantly, when my local cable company has the service -- probably in 
1996 -- I'll be able to use that connection to get to the Internet -- gaining 
access to video services, electronic shopping and other applications that 
require high-speed interactivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a year later, for about $500, I'll be able to put a small satellite 
dish on the balcony outside my den; that will let me order movies interactively 
through my television. 
</P>
<P>
 The tough decision will come sometime in the year 2000. Will I want to wire 
together my PCs, my television and my telephones -- all digital by then -- on a 
local network so that I can order those satellite movies from my original PC, 
or should I hold the ISDN video conference on my television? 
</P>
<P>
 But let's not get too far ahead of ourselves. Today I'm still driving onto the 
on-ramp. By then I'll be accelerating past the speed limit into the fast lane.

POLLUTION OFTEN PART OF PACKAGE DEAL WITH EASTERN BLOC FIRMS; ENVIRONMENT: 
WESTERN INVESTORS BUYING INTERESTS IN STATE-OWNED COMPANIES MAY FIND THEMSELVES 
LIABLE FOR CLEANUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM LOEWENBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since privatization in the former Eastern Bloc first began five years ago, 
Western investors have spent billions of dollars to purchase interests in 
thousands of state-owned companies.  
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, they are also buying into a legacy of 40 years of environmental 
degradation that is some of the worst on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 But a lack of clear legislation to determine liability means that investors 
have plenty of reason to be concerned that they will get stuck picking up the 
bill for forty years of communist hubris. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current fining and enforcement system is unclear, and what the future 
laws and enforcement system will be is unclear," says Theodore Boone, head 
lawyer at Arnold & Porter's Budapest office and former president of the 
American Chamber of Commerce there. 
</P>
<P>
 While environmental laws went virtually unenforced under communism, investors 
fear that will change with private ownership. Many also fear they will be the 
target of lawsuits by citizens aggrieved by past damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once a company is in private hands, all of a sudden there's a deep-pocket 
private company and somebody might start thinking 'Let's go after them,' " 
Boone says. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a command economy driven by production targets, polluting technologies 
were the norm. The virtual absence of environmental regulation meant many 
industries simply dumped their waste out the back door or in neighboring 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 According to studies sponsored by the European Union, the pollution has 
already taken a high human toll, particularly on children. 
</P>
<P>
 The high concentrations of dust and sulfur dioxide in the mining districts of 
the northern Czech Republic have increased the number of infants dying from 
respiratory problems five- to eightfold. Nearly 60% of the children in the 
center of Budapest have dangerous levels of lead in their blood. In the 
Romanian town of Copsa Mica, high lead levels have left as many as 70% of the 
children with mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmental problems were a low priority for agencies under a mandate to 
privatize state-owned land and industries as fast as possible to get money for 
their cash-strapped countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials responsible for environmental enforcement usually have little input 
into the privatization process. In Poland, for instance, the Department of 
Environmental Protection reported that it found out about the sale of big 
polluters only through the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The privatization agencies frequently don't know the extent or nature of 
pollution on a property, because under communism environmental damage didn't 
officially exist, and in many countries it was even illegal to publish 
information about environmental problems. The attitude of privatization 
agencies tends to be, "I don't know what's there; take it as is." 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought our task was selling," Janos Kerekes, a director at the Hungarian 
State Property Agency, says in explaining why his agency brought on an 
environmental expert only last month, after five years of operation. The SPA, 
like most privatization agencies, doesn't routinely perform environmental 
audits before a sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, investors bear the burden of looking for past damage, such as ground 
water or soil contamination. But even when the problems have been determined, 
vague and contradictory laws mean that potential buyers don't know who's going 
to be responsible for cleaning up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes there are inconsistencies between the law and the practice, 
sometimes there are inconsistencies between environmental laws and other laws, 
and sometimes the laws are simply vague," says Stephen Stec, regional 
environmental specialist for the American Bar Assn.'s Central and East European 
Law Initiative. "These are all pitfalls for investors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that Western multinationals, which have spent billions of dollars 
purchasing state-owned companies, are generally aware of the problem. 
Environmental liability ranks above political instability and a lack of 
supporting infrastructure as primary concerns of Western firms investing in 
Central and Eastern Europe, according to a 1992 study by World Bank and the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
</P>
<P>
 That's particularly true of American companies, because of their experience 
with the U.S. government's Superfund program, which has assigned liability to 
polluters retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you negotiate something (with the privatization agency) up-front, you 
have to assume you will be responsible for on-site liabilities," says 
Annemargaret Connolly, a lawyer specializing in environmental issues for the 
law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of who will be responsible for pollution on sites neighboring an 
industry -- which isn't revealed in environmental audits -- is particularly 
sticky. Last year, the Czech Republic tried to implement rules specifically 
defining liability issues such as off-site pollution and past damages. But a 
number of the rules were successfully challenged as unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of formal guidelines for dealing with environmental liability in 
privatization means it is negotiated on a case-by-case basis. The most common 
solution is a purchase price reduction based on the cost of cleanup. 
Alternately, a privatization agency might agree to set aside part of the 
purchase in an escrow account to be used for cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Privatization agencies occasionally agree to indemnify buyers against 
lawsuits, but these arrangements are fraught with complications. In Hungary, 
indemnities are usually limited to legal challenges within a year of purchase 
and for liabilities equal to less than 20% of the purchase price, compared to 
indemnities of up to 100% in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also unclear how easy it will be to enforce indemnity agreements. 
Hungary has a special fund set aside to cover liabilities it assumes under the 
agreements, but Kerekes says he is worried there is not enough money to cover 
all of the indemnities the SPA has granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Privatization agencies, unaware of the extent of environmental damage at a 
site and having no guidelines on how to deal with it, were often caught 
off-guard when investors first came to them with the results of their 
environmental audits. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case when Swedish company Electrolux purchased the Hungarian 
Lehel Refrigerator factory in 1991. The SPA knew the site contained buried 
"Gorjanc bombs" -- boxes of improperly packed toxic waste, named for the 
Communist Party leader who formerly controlled Lehel.  
</P>
<P>
 But the surprise came when Electrolux announced it would cost about $27 
million -- half what it paid for Lehel -- to clean up the oil, solvents and 
heavy metals in the soil and ground water on the factory site. While the 
transaction was under way, even more dump sites were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of Lehel is a "successful story, but a painful one," Kerekes says. In 
his opinion, Electrolux used an excessive cleanup standard, and the SPA is 
fighting the company's petition for a bigger discount on its acquisition cost. 
Rather than actually having the purchase price reduced, Electrolux is asking 
that more of its payments to the government be set aside for cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungary, like the other countries in the region, doesn't have its own cleanup 
standards. Instead, they are determined on an ad-hoc basis. Multinational 
companies often use European Union standards as a measure, but Kerekes thinks 
those are too strict for Hungary's struggling economy. Hungary is vying for EU 
membership, however, and will eventually have to meet those standards. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the environmental problems on a site are so bad that if they 
were figured into the selling price, governments would have to pay "buyers" to 
take sites off their hands, says Boone of Arnold & Porter. 
</P>
<P>
 When companies have particularly bad on-site pollution problems, privatization 
agencies sometimes carve them up and sell off the pollution-free parts. In one 
case, an investor who wanted to purchase a factory with soil contamination got 
around the problem by purchasing only the machinery, which he then moved to a 
new site. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental experts criticize the practice, because it means the pollution 
probably won't get cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as investors clean up old sites and put in less-polluting 
technologies, danger still lurks. New, more efficient industries mean greater 
production, says Janos Zlinszky, legislative director for the Regional 
Environmental Center. While the technologies may be cleaner, he says, the 
increased productivity will create more waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly, "production was causing the main pollution in this part of the 
world," Zlinszky says. "We are now forced and lured into a lifestyle where our 
consumption will cause the bulk of the pollution."

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO GET INTO FOREIGN BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American mutual fund investors, most of whom have few if any foreign bond 
holdings, now have a good opportunity to get into or add to those positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Global money managers say the sharp rise in interest rates -- a surge 
precipitated by rising U.S. interest rates as much as anything -- have made 
European bonds attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 European yields have risen more than U.S. yields, "a scenario not justified by 
the economic fundamentals," says Philip Saunders, London-based portfolio 
manager of the new Guinness Flight Global Government Bond Fund, whose marketing 
arm is headquartered in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 He cites 10-year German government bonds, whose yields were 5.5% on Jan. 1 but 
now pay about 7.3%. French government bonds with similar maturities have risen 
from 5.7% to 7.9%, and comparable British debt has increased from 6.3% to 8.9%. 
Yields on U.S. Treasury bonds with 10-year maturities have risen less 
drastically, from about 5.9% at the start of the year to about 7.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the increase in yields, the average world bond mutual fund tracked 
by Morningstar Inc. of Chicago was off about 5.5% for the year to date through 
July. That's on pace for the worst showing for the category since 1982, one 
year after the first international bond fund made its debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors who want to move into the market can now use efficient and 
convenient foreign bond mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp price declines in Europe this year are partly explained by the five 
interest rate increases engineered by the Federal Reserve Board since February. 
The Fed's actions snapped a multiyear global bull market in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor that has worried investors is the likelihood of stronger 
economic growth in Europe this year, which could translate into an inflationary 
burst. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to the inflationary scare is the fact that most European 
governments are running budget deficits. Sweden's and Italy's are particularly 
high, dwarfing even Washington's in percentage terms, says Jeff Tyler, 
portfolio manager of the Benham European Government Bond Fund in Mountain View, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saunders notes that Europe also has higher unemployment than the United 
States and is operating at lower industrial capacity. Those factors would tend 
to argue against an inflationary spike. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the higher European interest rates will in themselves tend to act as 
a brake on economic growth and inflation, notes Larry Teitelbaum, lead 
portfolio manager of the Scudder International Bond Fund in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scudder fund now has 70% of its assets invested in European bonds, up from 
a normal weighting of 55% to 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do feel European bonds are attractive," Teitelbaum says. 
</P>
<P>
 However, investing in European bond markets does involve the considerable risk 
posed by currency fluctuations or the cost of hedging against them. Any 
weakening of European currencies against the dollar would eat into the returns 
American investors earn on international bond funds. Conversely, a weaker 
greenback would increase returns in dollar terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Teitelbaum and Saunders fear that, after the dollar's long slide against key 
European currencies, the next move will be up. Consequently, both have hedged 
their funds against the danger of a stronger dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler, however, is not convinced that the dollar will rise, and he has the 
Benham fund completely unhedged at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 An interesting perspective on currency risk comes from Derek Sasveld, a 
consultant at Ibbotson Associates in Chicago, who argues that investors should 
favor unhedged foreign mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign bond investments can actually enhance overall returns and reduce risk 
when combined with a purely U.S. bond portfolio, Sasveld says. That's because 
these investments tend not to move closely in sync with U.S. bonds over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large portion of the diversification benefit comes from the currency play," 
Sasveld says. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, it costs money to hedge a foreign bond portfolio, and this extra 
outlay will add to a fund's expense ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a limit to the diversification benefit a foreign bond fund can 
add to a portfolio. Sasveld suggests placing no more than 25% to 30% of your 
overall holdings in international investments. Of that, foreign stock funds 
should account for roughly 17% to 20%, foreign bond funds the remaining 8% to 
10%. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't a particularly high stake to risk in overseas bond markets, 
particularly with European yields now much richer than they were at the start 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "European bonds aren't a screaming buy, but I think they will hold their 
values better than U.S. bonds," Tyler says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Balanced portfolios -- mutual funds that hold both stocks and bonds -- are 
flirting with their worst year since the 1970s. On average, they were down 2.2% 
from January through July of 1994, Morningstar Inc. reports. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But investors shouldn't give up on the balanced approach, says Douglas D. 
Ramos, co-manager of the Boston-based New England Balanced Fund, which has held 
up better than most. An unusually bad bond market earlier in the year explains 
the category's poor showing, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos, who works in Pasadena, doesn't think the declines will persist. He sees 
stable bond prices and flat to higher stock prices by early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long-term, balanced funds should return 8% to 9% a year," he says. That 
assumes a typical 60-40 stock-bond split. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their greater diversification, balanced funds offer more upside 
potential without much additional volatility compared to a pure bond portfolio 
for investors willing to hold at least three years, Ramos points out. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Retail securities brokers earned median pay of $90,000 last year, an amount 
that easily eclipsed the previous record of $78,200 set in 1992, reports the 
Securities Industry Assn. of New York. It was the fifth consecutive year of 
higher compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers who cater to institutional clients generated median 1993 earnings of 
$183,200, also a record and also the fifth consecutive yearly increase. That 
was up from 1992 pay of $156,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual funds have been a growing compensation source for many brokers in 
recent years, but the SIA report doesn't disclose their effect on yearly pay.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: WELFARE OR NO, TEEN PREGNANCY SPELLS 
POVERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheila Monique Anderson last March became a statistic -- one of a growing 
number of teen-age girls who have children before marriage and before high 
school graduation. Now on welfare and working to get a high school degree, the 
17-year-old Los Angeles resident and girls like her are the focus of the 
Clinton Administration's proposed overhaul of the nation's welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
 A key part of the plan is a concerted effort to stop teen-agers from getting 
pregnant. Social workers say this effort is pivotal because, welfare or no 
welfare, eight out of 10 teen-agers who have kids end up poor for the rest of 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The negative consequences of having a child when you are 15 or 16 years old 
seem so clear that it is hard to imagine why anyone would do it," says William 
P. O'Hare, Kids Count coordinator at the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a 
Baltimore-based nonprofit agency dedicated to the well-being of children. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the homes that many of these girls live in are so crummy that having a 
child and getting (welfare) is a way of getting out -- an escape of sorts," 
O'Hare says. "Also, $500 or $600 a month seems like a lot of money to a kid. 
They just don't understand what it takes to maintain a family." 
</P>
<P>
 The high cost of starting a household, combined with the diminished income 
potential of someone without a high school degree, make having a child a 
financial hurdle for young unmarried mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the best case scenario -- assuming that the mother and infant can find 
subsidized housing (or a roommate to split the rent) and can get child care at 
an unusually low cost -- they will need $9,700 a year just for life's 
essentials. 
</P>
<P>
 How do these expenses compare to a single teen-age mother's income? 
</P>
<P>
 If she works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year at a minimum-wage job, she'll 
earn $8,840 -- or $860 less than she needs each year to cover expenses. On 
average, the income of a never-married mother is actually a bit higher -- 
$9,820 a year -- because some find better-paying jobs or are able to collect 
some child support from their babies' fathers, according to a study of 60,000 
single-parent households. 
</P>
<P>
 With that annual income of $9,820, a mother will have $120 a year for 
entertainment or emergencies. That's just about enough for mother and child to 
go out to a movie once a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how the money works out: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rent: The average cost of a one-bedroom apartment is $589 a month, or $7,068 
a year, according to the National Multi-Family Housing Council in Washington. 
In major metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, the average 
is considerably higher -- $729 and $940, respectively. Subsidized housing is 
less -- about $350 a month, or $4,200 a year, the group says. However, the 
stock of subsidized housing has been diminishing over the last decade, making 
it increasingly difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
 * Food: Food expenses range between $830 and $1,420 per person per year. The 
older the person, the higher the average food expense, according to the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. For a mother and an infant, annual food expenses 
would run about $2,250. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transportation: Lower-income households -- those earning less than $32,000 
on average -- spend between $690 and $820 per person on transportation each 
year. People who earn more generally spend more on transportation, presumably 
because they abandon public transit for their own cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clothing: A baby costs $450 a year to clothe; a 16-year-old costs roughly 
$1,010. These figures assume some hand-me-downs, so a mother with one child 
would spend a bit more, says Mark Lino, economist with the Family Economics 
Research Group, a division of the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health care: Many medical expenses for poor families are covered by 
Medicaid. The average single-parent family spends between $190 and $530 per 
child per year on medical expenses. The younger the child, the smaller the 
average expense. A teen-age mother and infant would spend roughly $720 each 
year, according to Family Economics Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
 * Child care: Some teen-agers are able to find friends and relatives to 
baby-sit, which means their child care expenses are relatively minimal -- 
between $380 and $530 a year for a child from birth through age 8, Lino says. 
However, if relatives and friends aren't available, parents must grapple with 
the often stunning cost of hiring a baby-sitter or day care provider so the 
single parent can work. The average cost of day care is $3,100 a year, says 
Melissa Skofield, spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: TREASURY BILLS ARE EASILY REDEEMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: You wrote recently about how to purchase Treasury bills. But how does one 
redeem or sell them? I'm told it's extremely hard. -- P.V.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Actually, it can be rather easy to redeem a Treasury bill; you just have to 
know how to go about it. For starters, anyone who purchases Treasury securities 
should open a Treasury Direct account. In some cases, these accounts are 
mandatory; in nearly all cases, they are wise. 
</P>
<P>
 If you hold your bill to its scheduled maturity, its proceeds will be 
deposited to the bank account you designate on your Treasury Direct application 
form. If you like, the proceeds can be used to purchase new Treasury 
securities, but you must notify the Federal Reserve Bank of your intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to sell your securities prior to maturity, the process is a bit 
more involved. The Treasury Department prefers that all such sales be handled 
through the secondary market -- the banks and brokers whose business it is to 
buy and sell investment securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if you don't have a specific buyer or recipient of your security in 
mind, that is what you must do. Your broker or bank can provide you with the 
necessary security transfer application form. Complete it. Your securities will 
then be transferred to the account of the broker or bank you have designated, 
and you will be paid by that institution according to the security's 
then-current market value, minus any commission charged by the broker. This 
value is not set by the government but rather by the marketplace itself. 
Interest rates are the key determinant. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if you have a specific buyer in mind or simply want to make a gift of 
your security, you may bypass the bank or broker and handle the transfer 
yourself. The buyer or recipient must have his or her own Treasury Direct 
account for the transfer to work. Get a security transfer application directly 
from a Federal Reserve Bank branch. The Fed handles the rest, moving the 
security from your Treasury Direct account to the account of the person you 
designate. If you are selling the security, the buyer must pay you directly; 
the Fed does not handle any transfer of money. Don't be fooled by a scam artist 
who suggests otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 To open a Treasury Direct account or get a security transfer form, you can go 
to the Federal Reserve Bank branch at 950 S. Grand Ave. in Los Angeles or write 
to P.O. Box 2077, Los Angeles, CA 90051. Brokerage's Foul-Up Clearly Its to 
Swallow 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I recently sold 100 shares of stock through the local branch office of a 
large national brokerage. The broker said the shares were worth $112 and that I 
would get a check for $98 after his commission was deducted. The check arrived 
promptly, and I cashed it. Three weeks later, the broker called back and said 
he had made an error; the stock had gone through a reverse split years ago and 
he failed to detect it. He said I was due only $7 and that I must refund the 
brokerage $91. Can I be held liable for this mistake? -- N.B.F.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Even the brokers we brought your question to were amazed at your tale, 
especially given the rather small amount of money it involves. One would think 
that the public relations value -- not to mention the value of brokerage 
employees' time -- would dictate that a brokerage swallow the mistake and write 
off the $91. 
</P>
<P>
 What should you do? A National Assn. of Securities Dealers spokesman said you 
are probably under no legal obligation to refund the $91. The broker clearly 
made a mistake and should own up to it. If you want, you could complain to the 
brokerage's branch manager about how shabbily you were treated. But if you 
simply do nothing more, you are not breaking any laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there is still the question of your moral responsibility. If the 
mistake had been in the other direction and you were owed the $91, would you 
expect the brokerage to pay? Probably you would -- if you ever discovered the 
error. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, readers with complaints about their brokers should know that the 
NASD handles complaints regarding unethical and illegal practices by its 
members. Complaints must be filed in writing and should include as many 
specific facts and copies of documents supporting the allegations as possible. 
Letters should be sent to the NASD, 300 S. Grand Ave., Suite 1600, Los Angeles, 
CA 90071. The NASD's authority is limited to disciplining its members for rule 
infractions; it cannot recover money on behalf of investors. 
</P>
<P>
 For restitution, investors may want to turn to one of several arbitration 
agencies. The American Arbitration Assn., a nonprofit group, is among the 
best-known. For more information about pursuing a restitution claim against a 
broker, request the pamphlet "Securities Arbitration Rules" from Karen Holt, 
c/o American Arbitration Assn., 140 W. 51st St., New York, NY 10020. Enclose a 
self-addressed, stamped, business-size envelope. Importance of Timing in Sale 
of Residence 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have a rental home that I want to convert into my principal residence. My 
plan is to sell the home in a few years and roll over the profits into a 
retirement house in another state. How long must I live in this house to make 
it qualify as my principal residence and not a rental? -- C.S.  
</P>
<P>
 A: There are no hard and fast rules surrounding such transactions. Many 
experts recommend that you live in the converted home for at least one year 
before selling it and rolling over the profits into another residence. 
(However, if you intend to invoke your one-time, $125,000 profit exclusion at 
the same time, you must have lived in the house for three of the five years 
preceding the sale. You also must be over age 55.) Finally, remember that any 
depreciation you have taken on the rental reduces your tax basis in it and will 
affect the tax basis of your new residence.

TUPPERWARE TAKES OVER MORE KITCHEN DUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Potato peelers, ice trays and cookbooks may not seem a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the venerable company that throws all those Tupperware parties sees a new 
product line as a major step in a campaign to redefine its image and marketing 
niche. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly designed everyday kitchen tools are the first big departure from the 
$1.2 billion in plastic bowls and storage canisters that the 50-year-old 
Florida-based company sells in 56 countries every year. 
</P>
<P>
 A new magazine and new cookbooks are also part of the modernized marketing 
techniques now emerging from company headquarters in Kissimmee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty much moving in a natural progression from food storage and 
extending it to the broader area of the kitchen," said Michael P. Hagerty, 
president of Tupperware North America. "We're also expanding our presence to a 
larger market." 
</P>
<P>
 From the kitchen, Hagerty said, Tupperware will move into closets, children's 
bedrooms and the average household's biggest storage area of all -- the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge market, and we'll get there eventually. Making people's lives 
easier is part of our heritage," Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
 The line of six newly designed kitchen tools partly resulted from a consumer 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The company asked its senior sales consultants what their busy, modern-day 
homemakers wanted in their kitchens. The major finding from a recent random 
sample of 500 Tupperware party-goers in California and Florida was that a lack 
of kitchen organization was their No. 1 problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Cluttered refrigerators, dirty dishes, disorderly cupboards, too little 
counter space, and too much dicing, peeling and chopping were the time-takers 
most frequently mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Tupperware has gone into partnership with Hachette Filipacchi Magazines Inc. 
to produce a slick magazine providing information on how to make life simpler 
and easier in the kitchen and, not coincidentally, to pitch the new product 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 About two years ago, it began putting out special cookbooks. The latest is "30 
Minute Meals." Other titles include "Luscious Lowfat Cookbook," "Savory Salads" 
and "Chocolate Lovers Cookbook." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that won't change is the consumer parties that have kept Tupperware 
near the top of the list of direct-sale marketers. It is not interested in 
retailing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our big advantage is our direct selling force," Hagerty said. "Many of our 
products need demonstration."

THE NEXT CANCUN?; MORE HOTELS HAVE SPROUTED AT THE PACIFIC RESORT OF HUATULCO, 
BUT ITS BEACHES REMAIN QUIET -- FOR NOW 
</P>

 What could ever happen here? Not much, it seems from the sands of Chachacual 
Bay. The tide comes in, the tide goes out. Mangrove trees bend in the breeze. 
Maybe someone puts up a palapa of woven palm fronds, maybe not. In the summer 
rainy season, the foliage grows thick and green. Then it fades as the dry 
80-degree days parade through fall, winter and spring. And then the cycle 
circles again. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other cycles at work at Huatulco, and change is the way of 
things. Decorative palms rise among the mangroves. Kayaks repose in the sand. 
And luxury suites climb the hillsides. This 22-mile stretch of coastline, about 
240 miles southeast of Acapulco, is the focus of one of the most ambitious 
tourism-development projects in North America, and the Mexican government, 
hoping to repeat past successes in Cancun, Ixtapa and Los Cabos, is its 
principal sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven years ago, when the building began, most of this 52,000-acre area was 
one scene after another of paddling fishermen, cornstalk rows and houses with 
dirt floors. The permanent population was somewhere around 1,000, and the 
government was just starting to buy families out of their waterfront lots and 
relocate them inland. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four years from now, if FONATUR, the Mexican government's 
tourism-development agency, sticks to its long-term plan, Huatulco will be a 
resort with 2 million tourists a year, nearly 30,000 hotel rooms, a permanent 
population of 345,000 and all the accouterments of full-service, 
we-speak-English tourism. (It's likely that the resort will run a few years 
behind schedule; not-yet-completed facilities at Chahue and Cacaluta bays were 
originally to be done by this year.) 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, Huatulco is suspended between extremes. Visit and you find 
warm weather, uncrowded beaches, a profusion of water sports, grateful 
entrepreneurs, several high-end hotels and a few advantages that are almost 
certain to vanish as the government's plans draw nearer to completion. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance: Eight years after the opening of the airport, paved roads have 
only reached three of the nine bays -- Tangolunda, Santa Cruz and Chahue. As a 
result, the remaining six bays are the domain of dirt-road adventurers and boat 
passengers who arrive on day trips from the marina at Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years after the opening of the first hotel, a Club Med, there are 17 in 
business, from rustic to post-modern, with a combined capacity of roughly 1,800 
rooms. The fancy, pricey places far outnumber the budget lodgings, but the 
overall occupancy rate is only about 50%, perhaps because most Americans 
probably can't pronounce Huatulco ( wah-TOOL-co ), let alone find it on a map.  
</P>
<P>
 Government figures show that fewer than 32,000 of the 181,000 visitors who 
came last year were from the United States, a figure far surpassed by U.S 
visitors to Cancun, Ixtapa and Los Cabos. Not much English is spoken, and most 
of the tourists I met here were from Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in Huatulco for three days in May -- the off-season, when room prices 
are lower, and temperatures a little higher, than in winter. After the 
hour-long flight from Mexico City, I stepped into 90-degree heat, boarded a 
shuttle for the 12-mile ride to the Sheraton ($7) and watched as brittle, gray 
foliage flashed past and finally yielded to the turquoise Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Cruz, busiest of the bays and the center of village life before the 
resort-makers came, includes a handful of smallish hotels, several modest but 
inviting waterfront restaurants, a souvenir market and a post-FONATUR marina 
with about 200 slips. At its edges, fishermen mend nets, sort their catches and 
lay out severed dorsal fins to dry in the sun. Nearby, chartered motorboats 
await customers, and tourist-ferrying cabin cruisers collect passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 You can hire a boatman at the marina for about $20 and have him drop you off 
on an empty beach and return a few hours later. For those less inclined to 
trust strangers to keep such appointments, there are day trips in cabin 
cruisers. I paid $27 for one of those, climbed aboard a 30-foot 
fiberglass-shelled vessel with three crew members and seven other tourists (all 
Mexican) and set to practicing my Spanish and trying to keep straight the names 
of the bays. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejos, a collection of three empty beaches (targeted for a large hotel 
soon), is the easternmost along the east-to-west coastline. La Entrega is not a 
bay but a popular beach within Santa Cruz Bay. Chahue Bay is to be the site of 
a second marina, now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Up the coast we puttered, pausing to swim ashore or snorkel here and there, 
applauding when a stationary fishing pole jerked and crew member Roberto 
Carreno pulled aboard a gleaming green and yellow dorado that seemed nearly a 
yard long. 
</P>
<P>
 At Organo Bay, where FONATUR hopes foreign investors will soon put up an 
all-inclusive resort, I saw one palapa and several tons of creamy sand. 
</P>
<P>
 At Maguey Bay, palm-frond-shaded entrepreneurs sold seafood lunches for $8 and 
rented out jet skis. I paid $10 for daylong use of a mask, a snorkel and fins, 
and found perhaps half a dozen varieties of small fish -- interesting but not 
overwhelming. (Still, locals say the best snorkeling areas are at Maguey, La 
Entrega beach and San Agustin Bay.) 
</P>
<P>
 At Cacaluta Bay, a heart-shaped inlet with an island in its middle, FONATUR 
envisions a 200-boat marina, an 18-hole golf course (to complement the existing 
18-hole course at Tangolunda Bay), 1,500 hotel rooms, 1,000 condominium rooms 
and 805 houses. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw sand, foliage and no people. 
</P>
<P>
 Chachacual Bay was much the same -- but, unlike the others, it's likely to 
stay that way: Federal tourism officials have set this bay aside as a nature 
reserve. (FONATUR officials are quick to point out that more than 40,000 of the 
resort zone's 52,000 acres will be left undisturbed or "regenerated" in an 
effort to sustain ecological balance.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the northernmost of the nine bays, San Agustin, we steered around rocky 
outcroppings and put ashore for a late lunch of very fresh ceviche (our crew's 
dorado was the featured ingredient) at Restaurante Bahia San Agustin. 
Afterward, I strolled up to a tiny wooden chapel on a hill and back down past 
half a dozen restaurants, a few of them festooned with hammocks, in which young 
people relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 The hammock people were from Mexico City, about a dozen of them, and most 
looked to be about 17. They brought the hammocks. They paid the restaurateur 
about $8 a night and agreed to eat meals at his establishment. He let them 
sleep there, on the bay, under the stars, and they felt entirely safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Huatulco is growing and changing, it's hard to imagine that happening 
for much longer. Those who suspect that Mexico won't follow through on all 
these grand plans should consider Cancun. Cancun, which had an estimated 
population of 117 before FONATUR made it a development priority in the late 
1960s, drew nearly 2 million visitors last year, more than any other Mexican 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is more to the Huatulco area than new buildings. The Sierra Madre del 
Sur mountain range rises near the coast, and the old inland towns of Santa 
Maria Huatulco (north) and Pochutla (northwest) are each about 20 miles away. 
Along the coast, quiet Puerto Angel lies about 30 miles west and Puerto 
Escondido, less quiet and famed for its surfing, lies another 50 miles beyond 
Puerto Angel. Oaxaca City, the state capital known for its folk art and 
traditional observances such as Day of the Dead, is a 170-mile drive north of 
Huatulco. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most travelers, local civilization is dominated by the cluster of 
resort hotels and five beaches at Tangolunda Bay, and that's where I did most 
of my exploring. 
</P>
<P>
 I stayed at the Sheraton, a large property on a long beach with a shaded 
poolside restaurant and prices I came to believe were too high. (Standard rates 
run $90-$160 nightly for a double room, depending on the season.) I arrived to 
find an unfinished bottle of club soda in my room. My shower nozzle greeted me 
each day with a burst of rusty brown water. The main bar was closed for 
repairs. And one evening, a maid entered my room without a word and turned down 
my bed -- which would have been fine, had I not been in the room, showering. 
</P>
<P>
 North of the Sheraton sits the first major tourist development to open in 
Huatulco, the 7-year-old Club Med. Like most of its Huatulco brethren, it sits 
above a beach, but it covers more ground, with about 1,000 beds in 554 rooms, 
and all sorts of sports facilities, from the usual aquatic equipment to a 
trapeze. Adult guests pay from $1,129 to $2,200 each for a week, depending on 
season, which includes air fare from LAX, all meals and beer and wine with 
lunch and dinner.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if a traveler has no intention of staying at Club Med, the place can be a 
resource: For $30, an outsider can buy 9 a.m.-5 p.m. admission to the property 
and full use of its resources. For me, that meant an hourlong solo ocean kayak 
ride and a filling lunch -- not a great bargain. But a shrewd traveler with 
more time could show up for breakfast, spend an hour or two in a kayak, return 
for lunch, head back out for a wind-surfing lesson, then pass the rest of the 
afternoon poolside.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican version of Club Med is the Royal Maeva, just south of the 
Sheraton. It charges $105-$135 nightly per person, double occupancy for 
lodgings, all meals and all the wine and beer you care to drink from 11 a.m. to 
1 a.m. daily. (Rates vary by season and do not include air fare.) The Royal 
Maeva shared the Sheraton's stretch of beach, but was busier. During my stay, 
staff members were urging merry guests (all Mexican or European) through 
volleyball games, theme nights and various other entertainments. In the winter, 
staff members said, many guests are from the U.S. and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, the bright pink Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza Resort climbs the 
hillside, its balconies dotted with yellow flowers. A funicular carries guests 
downtown from the lobby, up to their rooms or all the way up to the pool and 
the Cielito Lindo restaurant and its broad views. The beach, however, is an 
awkward distance away for a guest on foot. Rates at the hotel, which opened in 
1992, run $115-$141 nightly for a double room, depending on the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Huatulco's most striking hotel is the Omni Zaashila, an architectural 
collection of angles, curves, burnt sienna archways and cobalt blue walls that 
stands just south of the Royal Maeva. The Omni opened last summer with 130 
rooms, 32 of which feature four-foot-deep private splash pools. Rates run 
$210-$250 nightly for a double room, depending on the season. There's a common 
pool too, if you can call a 400-foot-long beachfront expanse common. After I 
saw the lushly landscaped grounds, the pool and a few rooms, I came for dinner 
at Chez Binni, the hotel's fancy restaurant. The food was excellent, but the 
place has a notable flaw: On a hot, breezeless night, the restaurant's setting 
in open air beneath arched ceilings made both air conditioning and ceiling fans 
impossible. It's a frustrating thing to sweat over a $30 meal when you're not 
the cook.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers who want to spend less on their lodgings are likely to land in the 
towns of La Crucecita or Santa Cruz, where there are several smaller and more 
modest hotels. One in La Crucecita is the Hotel Flamboyant, with 67 rooms in 
the middle of downtown La Crucecita. Near Santa Cruz is the Hotel Binniguenda, 
a pleasant, tile-roofed 100-room property. Double rooms at both hotels run 
roughly $55-$85 nightly, depending on the season. 
</P>
<P>
 La Crucecita has the closest thing to traditional culture in Huatulco, and 
lies a short drive from the major hotels. Now a town of roughly 10,000, the 
place was built in the 1980s to house the workers who run Huatulco's hotels, 
restaurants and other tourist operations. 
</P>
<P>
 La Crucecita looks like a hundred other Mexican small towns: a grid of one- 
and two-story buildings, tree-lined streets, creeping bougainvillea, laundry 
flapping in the breeze, a handful of open-air cafes and a central square where 
birds chirp, children scamper and sleeping dogs lie. I walked around the plaza 
three times before I realized what was odd about the place. 
</P>
<P>
 No church. Or rather, there was a church, but the building was still in its 
middle stages of construction. In all of Catholic Mexico, there may not be 
another town where the principal church looks so much like an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty of commerce in Crucecita, however, much of it aimed at 
visitors. The spot that attracted my attention most was the modest marketplace 
just off the central square on Avenida Guamachil the shops on the square 
displaying brightly painted wooden animal carvings (a Oaxacan specialty) and a 
silver shop on Calle Bugambilias. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember the craft shops because I spent $22 in one on a Oaxacan painted 
wooden porcupine with radiating toothpick spines of red, blue, green, yellow 
and pink, and am happy with the transaction. I remember the silver shop 
because, as I strolled past, its proprietor, Gabriel Vasquez Alonzo, flagged me 
down, handed me a card that said MANTIHOLL and dragged me in to see his goods. 
He told me he came from Acapulco two years ago, to get in on the early stages 
of this burgeoning thing called Huatulco. I asked him where the name MANTIHOLL 
came from. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got it from TV," he explained. "You know -- 'Let's Make a Deal'? Manti 
Holl? It's a name to bring Americans to see our jewels." GUIDEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Huatulco Bay Watch 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Huatulco lies on the Pacific coast of the Mexican state of 
Oaxaca, about 242 miles southeast of Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
 Most visitors arrive by plane via Mexico City. Mexicana Airlines offers a 
daily direct flight from LAX to Huatulco with heavily restricted round-trip 
fares beginning at $384.  
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: Most hotels set their rates highest in the winter season 
(typically December-April), when demand is strongest, and lower them in the hot 
summer months. Huatulco Sheraton Resort (Paseo Benito Juarez bS/N, Bahias de 
Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, C.P. 70989; telephone 800-325-3535 or 
011-52-9-581-0055) has a big pool, 348 rooms, a beachfront site, spotty 
service. Double rooms run $90-$160 nightly, depending on the season. Omni 
Zaashila Resort (Bahia de Tangolunda Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, C.P. 70989; tel. 
800-843-6664 or 011-52-9-581-0460) has striking architecture, a big pool, lush 
landscaping, a beachfront site and 130 units. Double rooms are advertised at 
$210-$250 nightly, but a special promotion that ends Sept. 11th offers doubles 
for $149, based on availability. Hotel Binniguenda (Blvd. Benito Juarez No. 5, 
Bahia de Santa Cruz, Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, C.P. 70900; tel. 800-262-2656 or 
011-52-9-587-0077) features lots of Spanish tile, a pool and 100 rooms. Double 
rooms run $70-$80 nightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: Restaurant Avalos Dona Celia (local tel. 587-0128) and 
Restaurant Ve El Mar (tel. 587-0364) on Santa Cruz Bay. Dona Celia's dinner 
entrees run $6-$33; Ve El Mar's, $6.75-$20. 
</P>
<P>
 In La Crucecita, Don Wilo (tel. 587-0623) is a pleasant sidewalk cafe; dinner 
entrees $6-$15. At the Omni Zaashila, the stylish Chez Binni offers dinner 
entrees for $8-$24. 
</P>
<P>
 Exploring the bays: Several companies offer cabin-cruiser trips to the bays, 
advertised in hotel lobbies and at the Santa Cruz marina. I used Bahias Plus, 
No. 5, Blvd. Benito Juarez, Bahia de Santa Cruz, Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico; tel. 
587-0932.

TRAVEL INSIDER: MEXICO'S TOURISM DILEMMA: IS BIGGER ALWAYS BEST?; DEVELOPMENT: 
FONATUR'S RESORTS ARE FINANCIALLY SUCCESSFUL, BUT SOME SAY THEY TRADE CULTURAL 
AUTHENTICITY FOR FLASHY HOTELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

the newspaper's expense, accepting no special discounts or subsidized trips.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In favored locations along the most fetching beaches of Mexico stand roughly 
200 hotels. Altogether, their approximately 28,000 rooms accommodated about 2.8 
million foreign tourists last year, most of them Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 This seems fairly logical, since there are so many Americans who love the 
beach and so many attractive beaches along Mexico's 6,000 miles of Atlantic and 
Pacific coastline. But few American visitors realize that there's much more 
than simple supply and demand behind these resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the products of a sweeping government program that was created to 
build and shape tourism in Mexico. Operating since 1974 under the acronym 
FONATUR (Fondo Nacional de Fomento al Turismo) , Mexican officials have 
targeted areas for development, acquired land, relocated rural populations, 
provided financing for international development firms and lured in global 
names such as Sheraton and Club Med. Government officials have been selling off 
some of these properties gradually since the Mexican government began its 
privatization campaign a decade ago -- but as an instigator, FONATUR remains 
the prime force in Mexican tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials say that creating jobs in needy areas is a key element in 
their mission. But there's a downside: FONATUR's five big resorts operate 
something like stationary cruise ships, their occupants largely insulated from 
Mexican culture, while exacting a heavy environmental toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican officials, wary of this election year's political uncertainties, 
haven't been making predictions about the agency's future lately. But in June, 
the Mexican government decided to place much more restrictive development 
limits on the coastal strip immediately south of Cancun, perhaps signaling a 
more environmentally sensitive approach to tourism projects nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the ins and outs of FONATUR probably won't help you get a discount on 
your next vacation, but it might well figure in your choice of destinations: If 
you're a traveler who likes manicured beaches and swim-up bars, FONATUR 
destinations have been laid out with you in mind. If you're a traveler who 
speaks Spanish, admires original colonial architecture and seeks 
unself-conscious Mexico, you're better off steering far clear of FONATUR's work 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
 FONATUR's top-priority site, Huatulco, is the subject of this week's cover 
story. Here's a quick look at the organization's four other principal resorts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cancun. A sandy crooked finger of an island, in the state of Quintana Roo on 
the Yucatan Peninsula, Cancun is the 800-pound gorilla of Mexican tourism. It 
was mostly raw land until the late 1960s, when the government forerunner of 
FONATUR singled it out for development. Now the crooked finger is connected to 
the mainland by causeways at either end and occupied by more than 100 hotels. 
Tourists come for the surf, the pale blue seas, the lagoons, the jungle, nearby 
Mayan ruins, world-class snorkeling and busy night life. Almost 2 million 
tourists visited last year (three-fourths of them from outside Mexico), and in 
25 years the permanent population has grown from less than 1,000 to about 
250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo. This resort, which runs second in revenue to Cancun, 
lies in the state of Guerrero, 145 miles north of Acapulco on the Pacific 
coast, and is popular with Mexicans, who make up two-thirds of the visitors 
there. Ixtapa is a formerly empty coastal strip where all the fancy new hotels 
and restaurants are; Zihuatanejo is the old town three miles away, with calmer 
waters, more character and cheaper hotels and restaurants. The resort has 31 
hotels and drew about 340,000 visitors last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loreto. A seaside town of about 7,000, Loreto lies about two-thirds of the 
way down the sheltered eastern coast of the Baja peninsula. It is known for 
good fishing, nearby white-sand beaches, and a handsome bay and recently built 
marina at Puerto Escondido (also known as Puerto Loreto), 15 miles south of 
town. The town is 297 years old; Junipero Serra began his California missionary 
campaigns here, and a handful of modest hotels endure in the dusty downtown. 
But FONATUR's resort site, the Nopolo area, is five miles south of town, 
strange and largely empty. The only lodging there is the 280-room Hotel Loreto 
Inn (formerly a Stouffer Presidente). Last year, Loreto hotels drew only about 
32,000 visitors, an occupancy rate of less than 35%. "We've been slow" in 
Loreto, concedes Wenceslao Salas, FONATUR's representative in Washington. But 
he points to a new strategy: FONATUR marketers are now looking to court the 
American senior market -- not only to lure older vacationers, but to establish 
the area as a retirement community. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Cabos. This destination lies at the southern tip of Baja California and 
is storied as a sportfishing Mecca and partying place for boisterous young 
Americans. (Four of five visitors there are foreigners, and there are about 
three dozen hotels.) Development is rapidly merging two towns -- the former 
fishing village of Cabo San Lucas and the larger, but quieter, capital city of 
San Jose del Cabo -- into a 20-mile-long corridor of opportunities to shop, 
fish, eat, drink, golf and lounge by the pool. Before the peninsular Highway 1 
was completed in 1974, the towns' combined population wasn't much more than 
2,000. Now it's 20 times that, with about 315,000 visitors annually.

<P>
 If the '96 Olympics are in your future, now's the time to call a new hot line 
established by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG). 
</P>
<P>
 Callers contacting the ticket information line at (404) 224-1996 will have 
their names added to a mailing list. Sometime in early 1995, will receive 
information on how to order tickets. Ticket sales will begin next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 About 11 million tickets -- ranging from $6 to $250 for athletic events and 
from $200 to $600 for opening and closing ceremonies -- will be available. "You 
will be able to see 95% of all sessions for $75 or less, including many 
finals," said Lauri Olsen, an ACOG communications director. "Track and field 
finals will start at $45, diving finals at $60 and artistic gymnastics and 
tennis finals at $75." 
</P>
<P>
 ACOG, working with a ticket vendor, will be the ticket agent for the Games. It 
will also be the primary booking service for hotel accommodations through its 
Olympic Host Hotel Network. Many accommodations and tickets will be packaged in 
some way. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to forestall hotel price gouging, the Atlanta Legislature has 
passed a law that caps room rates throughout the state for the Games, Olsen 
said. A lodging cannot charge more than its published 1994 room rate (also 
known as a rack rate), plus two times the average annual increase in the 
Consumer Price Index. So, if a hotel charged $100 per night in 1994, it could 
charge $105.60 during the Olympics, based on an inflation rate of 2.8%. Any 
hotel that violates that law can be fined up to $1,000 per room per night, 
Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, however, applies only to hotels that will charge $100 or more a 
night during the Games. A hotel that charges, say, $35 for a room can demand up 
to $99 without breaking the law.  
</P>
<P>
 As the organizing committee, ACOG is required to provide "reasonably priced" 
housing for the press, national and international Olympics officials, team 
administators and staff and sponsors, among others. So of an estimated 55,000 
rooms, how many will be left for spectators? The committee doesn't know yet, 
Olsen said. "The numbers change daily." Latino Cruise Line Scuttles Operations 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in three weeks, a specialty cruise line has announced that 
it is scuttling operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnival Cruise Line's FiestaMarina, the first to cater exclusively to the 
Latino market, will embark on its last sailing on Sept. 4. Like American Family 
Cruises, which announced early this month that it would close down with its 
last sailing on Sept. 3, the FiestaMarina was unable to generate enough 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame," said Bob Dickinson, president of Carnival Cruise Lines. 
"People who sailed aboard the FiestaMarina had a terrific time . . . . There 
just weren't enough of them." Dickinson said the company still believes it is a 
viable concept for a smaller vessel. The FiestaMarina carried 950 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers booked aboard the FiestaMarina beyond the last voyage date will be 
offered cruises on other Carnival vessels. Ticketless Travel on Southwest 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines will begin testing its new ticketless travel system on 
Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline began taking reservations last Monday for some of the flights 
between Dallas, Tex., and Little Rock, Ark.; and between Houston and Corpus 
Christi, Tex. If all goes as planned, the test will be extended on Sept. 12 to 
all flights among the four cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the system, instead of a ticket travelers get a confirmation number when 
they make their reservations. They then exchange that confirmation number for a 
boarding pass at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 If they wish, travelers also may continue to opt for regular tickets. One-Stop 
Booking in West Marin Here's another name to add to the growing list of 
accommodations reservation services. Inns of Marin (70 2nd St., P.O. Box 547, 
Point Reyes Station 94956; tel. 800-887-2880) represents 23 lodgings, including 
B&Bs, inns, cottages and motels in the West Marin region of Northern 
California, including Point Reyes, Inverness, Olema, Tomales and Bolinas. The 
service can also provide information on restaurants, day trips, outdoor 
activities and baby-sitters. In Vienna, Curtain's Not Going Up 
</P>
<P>
 The Vienna State Opera, which normally begins its fall season on Sept. 1, will 
not open until Dec. 14 because of renovation work at the opera house. Opening 
night performance will be Richard Strauss' "Elektra." The season will run 
through June 30, 1995. For schedule information, call 011-43-1-51444, Ext. 2960 
or Ext. 2959.

the tundra each day and observe the bears up close. Participants stay at the 
Northern Studies Centre to learn more about the bears and assist Dr. Malcolm 
Ramsay with research activities. Cost: $2,695 per person, double occupancy, 
including round-trip air fare between Winnipeg and Churchill, accommodations, 
most meals, tour of Churchill area, tundra buggy excursions and services of 
scientists and guides. Not included: air fare to Winnipeg. Contact: Natural

WEEKEND ESCAPE: MAMMOTH; A TWO-FAMILY GETAWAY INVOLVING A RENTED VAN, A CONDO, 
AND THE MELLOWER PLEASURES OF SUMMER IN A WELL-KNOWN HOTDOGGER'S PARADISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN RODERICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Roderick is a Times Assistant Metro 
Editor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our family has a new tradition for escaping the hottest days of summer. We 
line up a cat sitter, stock the Subaru and drive north into the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we keep going, through the railroad and fast-food junction of Mojave, and 
up the Owens Valley. About 5 1/2 hours from home, we put down the windows, turn 
off the air conditioner and savor the cool mountain air. Our refuge of choice 
is the town of Mammoth Lakes, the winter destination for caravans of Southern 
California skiers, but to us a more pleasing spot when the elements are milder 
and the clientele mellower. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent visit was an experiment in co-op vacationing. We split 
expenses with a friend and rented a van big enough for two mommies, a daddy and 
a high-energy trio of girls age 9 and under. The Dodge Grand Caravan from 
Thrifty Car Rental came well-equipped but barely held the two families plus the 
food, luggage and diversions conducive to a long weekend in a mountain condo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our route from Los Angeles -- north on California 14 and U.S. 395 -- tops my 
personal list of scenic California drives (inland division). In a few hours you 
climb through a red rock canyon, skirt numerous volcanic deposits and pass 
beside an enormous dust bowl that defies explanation without some knowledge of 
local history. The vast alkali flat used to be Owens Lake, across which in the 
1880s steamboats ferried silver ore mined in the Inyo Mountains. The shallow 
salt lake was a welcome splash of blue to desert travelers until early this 
century, when Los Angeles bought up its source, the Owens River. 
</P>
<P>
 Just past the dry lake bed we stopped for gas in Lone Pine and even the kids 
began to enjoy the scenery. Snowy High Sierra peaks towered over the desert 
floor, and the attendant at the Unocal station kindly pointed out Mt. Whitney, 
the highest in the land outside Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two hours later we glided into Mammoth Lakes. Our plan was to abuse 
the health club and pool privileges that come free with a condo rental at the 
Snowcreek Resort just outside of town on Old Mammoth Road and to explore the 
area's lakes and high country. Most meals would be eaten in to save money or 
would become picnics. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife, Judy, and our 4-year-old, Sean, had stayed before in older, more 
wooded sections of Snowcreek. This time we booked a newer unit closer to the 
pools -- to everyone's disappointment. The rich lawns, copious pavement and 
careful landscaping could have been in the Los Angeles suburbs. "This looks 
like Westlake Village," wailed our friend Victoria. But at least the 
accommodations were as promised. We had two bedrooms and baths, a living room 
with sofa beds for the girls, a fireplace, cable TV, VCR, stereo and 
washer-dryer. Towels were too skimpy -- par for Snowcreek -- and we had to 
rewash the kitchen utensils to get rid of a funky odor. Outside, the view of 
11,053-foot-high Mammoth Mountain and parking-lot gossip about marauding bears 
helped us forget the city. The girls were soon chasing each other and herding 
the ducks and geese that patrol the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a stocked refrigerator and a beckoning bottle of Cabernet, no one 
could face kitchen work after a day in the van. We grabbed a low-key supper of 
salads, pasta and minestrone at O'Kelly and Dunn, a favorite stop where Judy 
adores the chicken noodle soup. The restaurant is next to the Booky Joint, the 
best-stocked book and video store we've found in Mammoth. The selection of 
children's books is impressive, and we returned to the condo well-supplied with 
magazines and new books for the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday morning we fashioned a breakfast feast of pancakes and fruit. 
Determined to stay out of the van, we hung by the heated outdoor pool most of 
the day. It felt great to climb out of an 85-degree pool, spread a towel on the 
grass and bake in the alpine sun while the Sierra breezes rustled the quaking 
aspens. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first time in Mammoth for Victoria and her daughters, 9-year-old 
Alexa and 6-year-old Katie, so after dinner we all piled into the van in search 
of some nature. We found a gorgeous view of dusk a few minutes later at Twin 
Lakes, the closest in the chain of fishing lakes located in the mountains above 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer weather at this elevation is usually pleasant, but don't depend on it. 
On Saturday a chilly front blew through, postponing plans for a gondola ride to 
the summit of the mountain. Clouds swirled around the peak and the weather 
report at the top promised fog and winter-ish winds. Instead we shivered 
through a lakeside picnic of fruit, sandwiches and cheese. The girls enjoyed 
watching the chipmunks and blue jays, but were just as happy as the adults to 
retreat to Tamarack Lodge to sip hot chocolate beside the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamarack, erected beside Twin Lakes in 1924, rents rooms and lake-view cabins 
and operates one of the few elegant restaurants in Mammoth. The inn is popular 
with cross-country skiers, but on this August Sunday the lobby held just us, 
two women waiting for their fishermen-husbands and a family of French tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Once everyone got warm and toasty we remapped our day. Judy and Sean decided 
to spend the afternoon at the Snowcreek health club. I offered to give the rest 
of the group their first Mono Lake experience, a kindness that drew only a 
lukewarm response from Alexa and Katie. They slept on the 30-mile drive north, 
which outran the blustery weather, but even they appreciated the dramatic views 
from the Mono Lake National Scenic Area visitor center, which opened recently 
on a promontory outside the town of Lee Vining. We all gazed across the lake to 
the island rookeries for migrating birds and pondered the exhibits, which 
explained that the lake water is so salty it is habitable only by brine shrimp 
and flies. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls were jazzed when we drove down to Navy Beach so they could touch the 
lake water and explore the tufa formations -- towers of calcium carbonate -- 
made famous in photographs of Mono Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reunited back in the condo before sundown, we played backgammon, listened to 
tapes, pulled together a stir-fry dinner and agreed our last full day would 
begin early. Nature cooperated with a cloudless morning, but it was 10 a.m. by 
the time we trundled into the Mammoth Mountain Inn, the area's sole hotel, for 
our only breakfast out. 
</P>
<P>
 Seating was slow -- the hostess chatted on the phone, then mysteriously went 
to "check our table" in the deserted room -- and Judy and I had to laugh that 
after many complaints through the years, the tea water still arrives lukewarm. 
At least the pancakes and oatmeal were satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 After breakfast we walked to the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area and plunked down 
$28 for gondola tickets. We fit snugly in one car for the ascent, which became 
the highlight of the entire weekend. The girls gasped as we soared 3,000 feet 
up the mountain, at times almost vertically. 
</P>
<P>
 Up top we found a postcard setting -- zero wind, no clouds, incredible views 
of the Sierra Nevada. Judy chatted up two bikers who had just ridden up the 
mountain, while the girls added their names to a guest book.  
</P>
<P>
 We had one more adventure in us: an afternoon side trip to Tuolumne Meadows in 
the Yosemite high country to look for deer, loll in the sun and skip stones on 
the Tuolumne River. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning we took off across the desert for home -- where the 
temperature was pushing 100 -- the experiment a success. Budget for Six

 Israel's diplomatic missions were put on alert following terrorist bombings of 
Israeli and/or Jewish targets in Buenos Aires and London that left nearly 100 
people dead, according to the Reuters news service. A car bomb outside Buenos 
Aires' main Jewish community center killed 96 people in mid-July, and late in 
the month twin car bombs struck the Israeli Consulate in London and the offices 
of a Jewish fund-raising organization outside London, injuring 14 people. A 
British police official promised round-the-clock protection of prominent 
Israeli and Jewish sites. Israel's foreign minister blamed Iran for "all the 
troubles," a charge denied by Iran, while a State Department analyst attributed 
the London bombings to Islamic revolutionaries. Europe

 Greece: Scores of anti-terrorist police combed the Aegean island of Rhodes 
after three bombs injured seven tourists and a taxi driver. The bombs, placed 
in garbage bins, exploded near a beachfront discotheque, a hotel and a crowded 
restaurant. No one publicly claimed responsibility for the bombings, but 
Reuters quoted a Rhodes official as suggesting that Turkey might be behind 
them. There were also reports that Greek diplomats in Turkey had received 
anonymous threats against tourism in the Greek islands because of purported 
Greek support for Kurdish insurgents in Turkey. Kurdish terrorist bombings of 
popular Turkish sites are believed to have put a dent in Turkey's tourism 
industry. Africa

 Algeria: Following the slayings of five French citizens in Algiers early this 
month, the U.S. Embassy there warned Americans that "the security situation for 
the foreign community has deteriorated further." The State Department has 
warned Americans not to travel to Algeria but pointedly stopped short of 
recommending "an unconditional departure of Americans." Fifty-six foreigners 
have been killed in Algeria since last September, when Muslim insurgents began 
targeting foreigners in an attempt to destroy confidence in the military-backed 
government. In response to the terrorism, the Netherlands said it will close 
its embassy in Algiers, and Belgium strongly urged its citizens to leave the 
North African country.

<P>
 Nigeria: The 7-week-old oil workers' strike has disrupted airline schedules 
and public transportation, and bank closings are causing currency shortages, 
according to the U.S. Embassy in Lagos. The embassy, noting reports of unrest 
in the capital, has advised Americans to avoid unnecessary travel within the 
West African country and be alert to personal security. Briefly

 Poland: Businesses in Warsaw's Old Town asked the government's help in 
resisting extortion demands by organized gangsters, Reuters reported. 
Restaurant owners have been threatened with violence and hit up for protection 
fees of $500 to $7,000 a month, and officials fear that the gangs will impact 
tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Guatemala: Sixteen tourists, most of them Americans, were robbed at gunpoint 
at a popular tourist site, and a young woman in the group was also raped, 
according to a U.S. Embassy report quoted by Reuters. The tourists were 
confronted by a small band of armed men as they climbed the slopes of the 
Pacaya volcano. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenya: A gang of bandits bludgeoned a British woman to death and beat her 
husband during a house robbery in an affluent suburb of Nairobi, Reuters said. 
Kenya's president ordered police to step up security in the cities, saying that 
tourists and expatriates are under constant threat. British diplomats warned 
visitors that muggings and carjackings are regular risks in Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamaica: Tourist arrivals in the second quarter dropped 8.5% from the same 
period last year, a decrease blamed on crimes against tourists, Reuters 
reported. Among this year's incidents: A tourist from Orlando, Fla., was 
murdered on the North Coast, two Pennsylvania visitors were shot and robbed 
while rafting, and two British women were raped by security guards at a hotel.

 Hot Spots: The State Department has dropped Yemen, East Jerusalem, the Gaza 
Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank from its list of places where 
Americans are advised not to travel. Remaining on the list are Afghanistan, 
Algeria, Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burundi, Colombia, Guatemala, Haiti, Iran, 
Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, North Korea, Peru, Rwanda, Serbia and 
Montenegro, Somalia, Sudan and Tajikistan.

 'Are you sure this is the right place?" my son Matt asked dubiously, snorkel 
in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't anyone around. There weren't any signs. We were standing at the 
edge of a crystal-clear cove up a hill at the end of a road on the outskirts of 
this tiny town south of Cancun. We couldn't possibly have such a well-known 
snorkeling spot as Yalku lagoon all to ourselves, we thought. Maybe we were at 
the wrong place. Maybe we were trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
 We jumped in the water. No one came to chase us away. Snorkel gear firmly in 
place, Matt, his sister Reggie and I were instantly mesmerized by the fish all 
around us. There were so many of them, big and little, striped and solid, 
brilliant hues of red and yellow and purple swimming alone and in schools. I'd 
never seen anything like it, not even in an aquarium. We had the place 
completely to ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stick a piece of bread in your hand and the fish will come up and take it," 
Laura Bush Wolfe told me later. Wolfe runs the small Club Akumal Caribe resort 
owned by her family here along the Yucatan Peninsula. We had indeed stumbled on 
Yalku, she said. "There are all kinds of small little coves like that where you 
won't run into any crowds." 
</P>
<P>
 The less-touristed 100-mile stretch between mobbed Cancun and the 15th-Century 
ruins of Tulum, the only Mayan city built on the coast, offers a treasure trove 
of possibilities for families willing to trek a bit off the major tourist 
track. We enjoyed it as an eco-adventure, with a Mayan history lesson or two 
thrown in. For information about Mexico, call Mexico Tourism for free brochures 
on tourist sites and activities, 800-44-MEXICO (446-3942), or the Mexican 
Government Tourism Office, (310) 203-8191. 
</P>
<P>
 Visit the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve, about 100 miles from Cancun, where the 
Gama Reef is part of the second-longest such reef in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 At Xel-Ha National Park, just outside Tulum, there are 10 acres of lagoons, 
coves and inlets that are teeming with fish. The snorkeling is great, although 
the waters are often crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 We explored Xcacel, a small out-of-the way sanctuary for turtles a short drive 
from Akumal, and Punta Lagunas, a preserve for monkeys that was about an hour's 
drive away and so deep in a jungle it made me nervous. A small Mayan boy who 
spoke no English led us to the monkeys in a cave. "Spooky," Matt and Reggie 
agreed. We beat a hasty retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 For a less nerve-racking adventure, we headed 35 miles south of Cancun to 
Xcaret, which means "little inlet" and is Mexico's idea of a water park. But 
there weren't any giant water slides here. The Mayans took sacred baths here 
before heading to the island of Cozumel to worship Ixchel, the goddess of 
fertility. For more than 10 centuries, Xcaret was one of the most important 
Mayan ceremonial centers and seaports. Today it's possible to see the excavated 
ruins. There's also an aviary of exotic birds, an aquarium, a botanical garden 
and even a museum with ancient as well as modern art. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt and Reggie, of course, were far more interested in swimming the length of 
an underwater river through huge limestone formations and snorkeling through an 
inlet. And the children had a chance to play with the dolphins. Along with a 
group of other children, they stood in the water and petted the dolphins. "They 
felt soft and squishy," Reggie reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Others lined up for a real swim with a dozen of the "soft, squishy" creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Another afternoon, we tried our hand at bargaining at the outdoor markets 
lined up in front of the ruins of Tulum. The kids enjoyed the back-and-forth 
banter for everything from silver earrings to baby clothes, though we all knew 
the young merchants had a price in mind from the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the other crowds at this, one of Mexico's most popular tourist 
attractions, we inspected the ruins of Tulum, where there are remains of about 
60 Mayan buildings. But as soon as the kids discovered a beach, our exploration 
was over for that day, at least.

BOOKS TO GO: CHINESE POETRY IN MOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 INSCRIBED LANDSCAPES; TRAVEL WRITING FROM IMPERIAL CHINA, translated with 
annotations and introduction by Richard E. Strassberg (University of California 
Press, $60 hardcover; $20 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 "On the twelfth, the night was spent at Feng-kao. On this day, a Court 
Gentleman Brave as a Tiger was dispatched to ascend the mountain in advance to 
inspect conditions. He returned and another thousand penal workers were added 
to repair the road." 
</P>
<P>
 This is travel writing, 1st-Century Chinese style -- as found in "A Record of 
the Feng and Shan Sacrifices; The Supreme Mountain," written in AD 56 by Ma 
Ti-po. This is the first selection in this extraordinary volume of Chinese 
travel-related excerpts and journal entries and apercus, assembled by a 
professor of Chinese at UCLA. It is material that, for the most part, has 
simply never been seen before in English -- a treasury of description and 
observation, reaching from Ma Ti-po's time through the 19th Century. It's great 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Color and poetry abound. ("We ascended the Peak That Toys With the Pearl 
Moon"; ". . . I viewed Wang Hsi-chih's Pond for Washing Away Ink.") 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers prove inquisitive, intrepid, fearless, tireless. ("Barefooted, I 
bounded through the grass, swung around trees and followed along cliffs.") A 
concern for nature and its spirituality permeates the prose. And there is 
philosophy ("It is human nature to be incapable of lingering for long where the 
eyes experience pleasure but the body feels discomfort"), and there is wry 
humor. As much as we may have read about China, in both fact and fiction by 
Western authors, those of us who don't speak Chinese have never before 
encountered the country in these terms.

 BLUE GUIDE; ALBANIA by James Pettifer (W.W. Norton / A. & C. Black, $17.95 
paper).  
</P>
<P>
 There are no luxury hotels in Albania, or fancy restaurants. The language is 
impenetrable ("hello" is tungjatjeta; "thank you" is faleminderit), street 
signs are confusing or nonexistent, inflation is rampant -- and, warns author 
James Pettifer, "In the countryside savage dogs belonging to shepherds are 
common hazards." Why on earth, then, would anybody want to visit this, the 
poorest country in Europe by far? For the magnificent Greek, Roman and Turkish 
ruins. For the unspoiled landscapes, rich with flora and fauna -- some of which 
has disappeared from the rest of the continent. (The tiny country has six 
national parks.) For the friendly people. Pettifer's guide is extremely 
detailed, full of history, generous with practical advice and skillfully 
evocative. I can't imagine anyone going to Albania without it. Quick trips: 
</P>
<P>
 DINOSAUR SAFARI GUIDE; TRACKING NORTH AMERICA'S PREHISTORIC PAST by Vincenzo 
Costa (Voyageur Press, $14.95 paper). Mermaids and Lion Kings and such may come 
and go, but dinosaurs perpetually fascinate the young -- and intrigue the 
older. In something of a stripped-down, just-the-facts format, this guidebook 
lists more than 160 fossil sites, dinosaur exhibits and the like, all over the 
United States and Canada -- enough to inspire several years' worth of trips and 
detours.

DESTINATION: MEXICO CITY; CENTRAL PARK SOUTH; REJUVENATED CHAPULTEPEC, THE SOUL 
OF THE CAPITAL, MAY NOW BE ONE OF THE WORLD'S FINEST URBAN PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT REINHOLD, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Reinhold is an editorial writer for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the capital and heart of Mexico. But to find the core and soul of 
Mexico City, one must visit Chapultepec Park on a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city of magnificent public spaces and public art, Chapultepec is the 
ultimate open space, green and egalitarian, open to all for free. Nearly twice 
the size of New York's Central Park, the 1,561-acre Chapultepec is probably the 
world's busiest and, arguably, finest urban park. 
</P>
<P>
 To Chilangos , as Mexico City residents call themselves, it serves as a prime 
source of recreation and surcease from urban chaos and pollution, a verdant 
refuge in what is now the world's most populous metropolis with nearly 20 
million people, and growing rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 They visit the park at a rate of more than a million and a half a week, mainly 
on weekends and holidays, when the crush nearly rivals the Mexico City subway 
in rush hour. They picnic, cycle, stroll, boat, and drink in Mexican history, 
art and culture in the park's eight superb museums. 
</P>
<P>
 Though I am a regular visitor to Mexico, I had not been to the capital for 
more than 10 years. I recall the park then as run-down and scarred by litter, 
with many of its trees dying from pollution. On a return visit this August, I 
found the park still very crowded, but transformed and vastly more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years the Mexico City government has poured more than $70 million 
into renovating and updating the park, or the bosque (forest), as it is called 
locally. They planted thousands of new trees, intensified the long-standing war 
on rats, shut down and remodeled run-down restaurants and cafes, and built a 
dazzling new museum for children, Museo del Nino el Papalote, which opened nine 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They also brought in a private company to remodel a decrepit, 30-year-old 
amusement park, La Feria. After an $18-million, three-month face-lift, it 
reopened last December with 49 new rides and has quickly become a major 
national attraction. Little wonder: For only $6 total, a family of four can 
spend the whole day, with 30 free rides per person. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing has energized Chapultepec quite so much as the reopening of its 
60-year-old Zoologico (zoo) on Aug. 1 after a two-year, $71-million renovation. 
The zoo was designed by the renowned Mexican architect Ricardo Legoretta, who 
also redesigned Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles. It reflects his stark 
planar style, with bright yellows and purples, and drew such crushing crowds -- 
150,000 people -- on its first day that the authorities had to shut it down for 
a few days to revamp security arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 The reincarnation is part of Mexico City's attempt to redefine itself and make 
itself more attractive to visitors, both foreign and Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
 I was impressed with the changes: The once-clogged streets in the historic 
city center near the cathedral and national palace have been cleared of street 
vendors in a complex political arrangement whereby thousands of them were 
relocated to small stalls in newly built malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle-drawn taxis have been introduced downtown to reduce air pollution and 
congestion. And efforts are being made to upgrade the traditional tourist 
center in the Zona Rosa, which has become somewhat seedy in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapultepec is steeped in Mexican history. It was an Aztec ceremonial site 
more than 700 years ago, and later an aqueduct was built to carry water from 
its spring to Tenochtitlan, the great pyramid city 25 miles northeast of 
downtown Mexico City. Legend has it that the profligate Montezuma II kept an 
aviary in Chapultepec and maintained a human-relay system of 900 people to 
bring fresh fish to feed the birds every day from Veracruz 240 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Spanish invasion by Hernando Cortes, the forest became a site for 
bloody battles in 1521, and the Spanish built a castle on Chapultepec Hill in 
the 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 With Mexico's declaration of independence from Spain in 1810, Chapultepec was 
declared public property and served an important role in the century-long 
interim between liberty and democracy. The castle was the home for Emperor 
Maximilian and, later, for Mexican presidents. It is now a museum of Mexican 
history; the current president still lives in the park, in a mansion just 
behind the Russian Mountain roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I stayed at the Hotel Nikko on the northern edge of the park, adjoining the 
fashionable Polanco residential area. That area is becoming a new tourist 
destination, with luxury hotels and restaurants. In addition to the Nikko, 
there is the Presidente Inter-Continental Mexico City and, to open later this 
year, the 300-room Mandarin Oriental Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 From these hotels, it is an easy walk to the famed Museo Nacional de 
Antropologia (National Museum of Anthropology), the zoo and botanical gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapultepec, open every day of the year, is divided into three sections. The 
most crowded is Section 1, which includes the zoo, the castle, the Museo de 
Arte Moderno (Museum of Modern Art), a children's section, the botanical 
garden, a garden reserved for the elderly and a Korean garden, among many other 
attractions. Section 2 has the amusement park, a lake with the famed Lago del 
Chapultepec restaurant, the 10,000-seat national auditorium, a museum of 
technology, the new children's museum and murals by Diego Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 Section 3 is more pastoral, with jogging trails, stables and a rodeo arena. 
</P>
<P>
 For most foreign visitors, the chief attraction is the anthropology museum, 
just north of Section 1 across the Paseo de la Reforma. Reserve the better part 
of a day for this museum, an institution that ranks with the Louvre and the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art as one of the world's premiere cultural assets. (The 
inscriptions on the exhibits are extremely informative, but all in Spanish; it 
is probably worth buying an English guide for 45 pesos, or about $14.) 
</P>
<P>
 The museum traces the pre-Columbian origins of human habitation in 
Mesoamerica, through Olmec, Toltec, Aztec, Maya and other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 The most arresting section is Room VII, devoted to the Aztecs, with the famed 
round Aztec calendar stone and a realistic diorama of Tenochtitlan life. But I 
focused on Room X, which houses the stelae -- carved-stone religious statuary 
-- and other highly refined artifacts of Mexico's most advanced pre-Hispanic 
civilization, the Maya Indians of the Yucatan Peninsula. An auditorium off the 
lobby features regular dance and music presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But one doesn't have to go to a museum to get an anthropological experience in 
Chapultepec. As I discovered on a recent Sunday, the park is a colorful circus 
of activity, conducted amid a maze of paths lined with elegant wrought-iron 
benches, artificial lagoons and carefully tended gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 The most prominent trees are the more than 1,000 ahuehuetes , sequoia-like 
trees planted by the Aztecs more than 10 centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors with small carts sell a dazzling array of snacks, such as chicharrones 
, which look like huge potato chips but are made of flour and pork and covered 
with chile sauce, or mueganos , a candy covered with caramel and pieces of 
lemon and coconut. For four pesos you can have your fortune told by a green 
sparrow-like bird, a gorrion , which comes out of its cage and picks a 
folded-paper fortune out of a box. 
</P>
<P>
 Most visitors would find the park more agreeable on a weekday, when the crowds 
are thinner. But, determined to have the most authentic experience, I ventured 
in on a cloudy, drizzly Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 With a smattering of Spanish, it is not hard to meet the locals, who usually 
come in large family groups to picnic, walk and talk, often traveling hours by 
bus from remote parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Near the lake, I chatted with Antonio Soto and his wife, Claudia, who were 
strolling hand-in-hand with their 3-year-old son, Carlos Jiovani, clad in a 
Milwaukee Brewers baseball jacket. Soto told me he labors weekdays as a 
production worker in the huge Bimbo bread factory and his wife sells 
Tupperware. But about once a month the Soto family takes the one-hour bus ride 
from their remote suburb to Chapultepec. The boy loves the carnival games, Soto 
said, and wants to see the zoo. "We want to go to the zoo, but we are waiting 
for the crowds to die down," Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the lines at the amusement park and the zoo are often long on 
weekends. Still, for visitors with children, both are worth the visit. 
Fifteen-acre La Feria is small by American amusement-park standards, but 
well-organized, clean and distinctly Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrance to the roller coaster sits under a huge painted Aztec calendar 
and the fronts of the coaster cars have elaborate carved images of the Aztec 
fire snake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My last Chapultepec stop was the zoo. The 44-acre zoo, with 1,294 animals, is 
by no means the world's largest, but it is very possibly the most elegant. 
</P>
<P>
 I entered through a broad, tiled esplanade leading into winding paths that 
flow into several major ecosystems: tropical rain forest, woodlands, savannah, 
tundra. There is also a fine six-acre aviary that has two golden eagles, the 
symbol of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The paths are lined with bamboo and other vegetation and rise up and down 
through banks of false rocks and waterfalls, all part of Legoretta's purpose of 
trying to make visitors think they are truly away from the city, in a strange 
land. But the familiar is close at hand: Among the zoo's food concessions are a 
McDonald's and Domino's Pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo is best known for its collection of four pandas, the largest outside 
China. It also has several species seen almost nowhere else, including several 
escuincles , a now-rare black hairless dog kept by the Aztecs, and volcano 
rabbits, an endangered species that lives on the slopes of volcanoes that 
surround Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 After three days of wandering around Chapultepec, I left with an exhilarating 
feeling. Having seen some of the worst of Mexico City on previous visits -- the 
fabled smog, the notorious traffic jams, the poverty-stricken barrios and 
political turmoil, I thought this was certainly the best of Mexico. GUIDEBOOK

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: AVOIDING EAR PROBLEMS ALOFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flying can be miserable for travelers with ear problems, colds or allergies. 
When air pressure within the cabin changes, intense ear pain can follow. 
Takeoffs and landings are often the worst times. 
</P>
<P>
 Ear problems are, in fact, the most common medical complaint of airplane 
travelers, according to medical experts at the American Academy of 
Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery. How and why do they occur? 
</P>
<P>
 When air pressure changes, the Eustachian tube -- which links the middle ear 
with the back of the nose -- must function properly or ear pain results. If 
working efficiently, the tube opens frequently and widely enough to equalize 
pressure changes. When it doesn't work properly, there is ear pain because 
pressure on one side of the eardrum, in the middle ear, is greater than the 
pressure on the other side. When the pressure is unequal, the ear feels blocked 
or stuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "At sea level, your ear may feel a little stuffy if the Eustachian tube is not 
working," said Dr. Ronald Roth, an otolaryngologist with Santa Monica Hospital 
Medical Center and USC associate professor of surgery. "But in an airplane, 
with rapid pressure changes, that rapid change (often) cannot be compensated 
for, and the eardrum gets deformed one way or the other." When the drum is 
sucked inward or stretched, it becomes painful. 
</P>
<P>
 Children are particularly prone to ear problems aloft because their Eustachian 
tubes are narrower than an adult's and not as efficient, Roth said. Travelers 
who fly with sinus infections, allergies or colds -- something generally 
discouraged by physicians -- are also more likely to suffer blocked tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease or prevent the discomfort, do-it-yourself remedies abound, all aimed 
at activating the muscle that opens the Eustachian tube. 
</P>
<P>
 Swallowing vigorously can help, as can chewing gum. Yawning widely is another 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying awake during descent can also help since sleeping travelers may not 
swallow often enough to keep up with airplane pressure changes. 
</P>
<P>
 During takeoffs and landings, babies should be kept awake too. Feed them a 
bottle or give them a pacifier to promote swallowing, pediatricians recommend. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an over-the-counter decongestant pill or nasal spray about an hour 
before descent can also help. Roth tells patients to take the over-the-counter 
decongestant as prescribed on the package the day before, as well as the day of 
the flight. Using a non-prescription nasal spray during descent might help too, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 And now there are special earplugs designed to minimize ear pain aloft. Called 
EarPlanes, the plugs were developed at the respected House Ear Institute in Los 
Angeles. Made of silicon, the plugs are about an inch long and a half-inch in 
diameter. They look like standard ear plugs used to muffle noise, but inside 
each plug's silicon tube is a tunnel-like channel that contains a tiny filter 
made of a special porous material. 
</P>
<P>
 "The filter functions as a slow leak," explained J. Phil Mobley, director of 
engineering for the House Ear Institute. "It allows the Eustachian tube more 
time to equalize pressure between the middle ear and the air pressure in the 
cabin." 
</P>
<P>
 EarPlanes ($3.99 a pair) will be available this fall in selected drugstores in 
the East.By Thanksgiving they will be sold in major airport terminals; by 
year's end they are expected in drugstores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 If ears still become painful despite preventive measures, there are other 
approaches. Consider the inflation technique recommended by the American 
Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery: Pinch nostrils shut and 
take a mouthful of air. Use cheek and throat muscles only to force air into the 
back of the nose, pretending to blow thumb and fingers off the nostrils. A pop 
in the ears signals unblocking. 
</P>
<P>
 If ear pain persists for 12 to 24 hours after flying, see a doctor. 
</P>

HIKING: LOS ANGELES: NATIVE WOODLANDS THRIVE IN CITY NICHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the flatlands surrounding it, Mt. Washington near Downtown Los Angeles 
was used for sheep and cattle-raising in the 19th Century. And, as they do now, 
city residents enjoyed hiking and picnicking on its slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three miles from City Hall, on the southwest slopes of Mt. Washington, is 
L.A.'s newest nature preserve, a living example of the Los Angeles of 200 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The protection of wild land is always satisfying, but preserving a place like 
Elyria Canyon in the heart of the city is deeply gratifying," says Clare 
Marter-Kenyon, president of the Mt. Washington Assn. and one of the many 
determined conservationists who, aided by the funds and tactical skills of the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, saved the canyon land from a 180-unit 
condo. 
</P>
<P>
 Elyria Canyon Park is an impressive black walnut woodland. The height and 
girth of the walnut trees, along with the tree-sized stature of toyon and blue 
elderberry bushes, suggest the canyon has not burned in several decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Botanists in particular are thrilled by the canyon's remnant communities of 
native flora -- walnut woodland, coastal sage scrub, chaparral and grassland. 
Native plant lovers are especially delighted by patches of purple needlegrass 
(once bountiful in Southern California). A red barn in the canyon bottom has 
been restored and is now being transformed into a nature center. Elyria Canyon 
will soon host weekday visits by schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 About two miles of trail meander to and through Elyria Canyon Park, which is 
administered by the Mountains Conservancy Foundation, the operations arm of the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. The paths visit the black walnut woodland 
and offer a bird's-eye view of the Los Angeles River and Griffith Park 
Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
 To get to the Elyria Canyon Park: From California 2 (near its junction with 
Interstate 5) exit on San Fernando Road and drive south a few blocks to Cazador 
Street. Turn left, then make an immediate right onto Cypress Avenue and a left 
onto Division Street, which you follow to Wollam Street. Turn right and drive 
to road's end at the new parking lot for Elyria Canyon Park. Elyria Canyon 
Trails Where: Elyria Canyon Park, Mt. Washington area of Los Angeles. Distance: 
A mile or so around Elyria Canyon. Terrain: Rare black walnut woodland, native 
grassland. Highlights: New nature preserve (Elyria Canyon). City views. Degree 
of difficulty: Easy.Precautions: Some poison oak near trail. For more 
information: Mountain Parks Information; tel. 1-800-533-PARK.

DESTINATION: TEXCO; TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE; PROSPECTING FOR SILVER, AND 
MORE, IN AN 18TH-CENTURY HILL TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURTIS RIST, Curtis Rist is a reporter for New York Newsday. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In this country's fabled "Silver City," every moment of the day centers on the 
precious metal -- beginning at 6 a.m., when a fire siren blares a wake-up call 
to miners across the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-five minutes later, a second siren sounds, one that reminds the workers 
it is time to be out the door. And a third blast -- persistent enough to wake 
the most resolutely restful tourist -- marks the start of the shift at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The miners don't have much of a commute: The tunnels containing the dull ore, 
which produce about a quarter of the nation's silver, are located directly 
beneath this city of nearly 200,000 nestled in the Sierra Madre mountains about 
110 miles south of Mexico City. The results of the miners' labors are 
celebrated everywhere -- from the rosy towers of the Santa Prisca cathedral, a 
baroque masterpiece built 200 years ago with the silver earnings of a colonial 
adventurist, to more than 200 shops where the refined metal is hammered into 
everything from trinkets to works of art. 
</P>
<P>
 It was silver that drew me and my family to Taxco (TAHS-ko) last November. 
Ready for a break from my Spanish language studies in nearby Cuernavaca, I 
figured we'd spend three or four days shopping for bracelets and brooches 
before moving on to Oaxaca. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, three days stretched into three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each Sunday evening, we headed to a cinder-block arena on the outskirts of 
town where the weekly rodeo ended with a two-stepping free-for-all once the 
bulls had been rounded up. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Monday in November, we watched the entire town turn out for the 
annual Jumil festival, a regional picnic at which the main course is a squat, 
black insect that looks like a stinkbug. My two young children took a pass, but 
my wife and I were game: Ground live into salsa and served with tacos and 
copious quantities of cerveza, the bugs turned out to have a bitter but 
not-unpleasant tang. 
</P>
<P>
 And every moment of every day, we reveled in Taxco itself -- a city that seems 
almost to defy gravity as its narrow streets and alleys twist and rise up a 
mountainside to ludicrous heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether bathed in the first light of sunrise or the gaudy dazzle of spotlights 
that seem to glow throughout the night, the city's panorama is stunning -- a 
cobblestone-and-whitewashed stucco look that has been carefully primped ever 
since the city was designated a national monument in 1928 as a relic of the 
18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taxco owes its fortunes to the rise and fall -- and rise once again -- of 
silver. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after conquering the Aztecs in what is now Mexico City, Hernando Cortes 
pushed into the mountains of the Sierra Madre in search of riches. His Spanish 
explorers struck a huge silver vein, and the city was founded in 1522 -- a 
settlement that evaporated only two decades later when the silver "ran out." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next two centuries, Taxco lay dormant, until the Frenchman Jose de la 
Borda found another silver lode and tapped the deposit with a zeal bordering on 
fury. 
</P>
<P>
 Borda's newfound wealth triggered a boom of construction -- convents, judicial 
palaces and colonial mansions -- and culminated with construction of the city's 
extravagantly gilded cathedral, for which Borda made a huge bequest with the 
now-famous words, "God gives to Borda; Borda gives to God." But by the 1780s, 
the silver era went bust, and Taxco became all but frozen in time. 
</P>
<P>
 It remained unchanged and impoverished until the 1930s, when a New Yorker 
named William Spratling set up shop as a silversmith -- and triggered a boom 
among craftsmen that continues to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife, Lynn, had visited Taxco about 20 years ago and remembered a jumble of 
shops selling jewelry of varying workmanship and authenticity. We still saw 
plenty of tourist traps, outfitted with grotto interiors and hung with plastic 
stalactites dipped in glitter. And we knew before we arrived that Taxco silver 
prices weren't any lower than what we'd be able to find elsewhere in Mexico. 
Still, Lynn was sufficiently impressed to snap up more than $1,000 worth of 
silver items during our stay. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a look at some of the best silver craftsmanship Taxco has to offer, we 
headed six miles south of town to the Spratling Ranch, where silversmiths 
create replicas of Spratling's distinctive designs. One of his more famous 
signature pieces, an eight-inch-long, fish-shaped box with an elaborate set of 
silver scales, costs about $600. 
</P>
<P>
 We also enjoyed browsing at Los Castillo, a store located just off the Plaza 
Borda, the pretty town square lined with Indian laurel trees. Prices here 
ranged from the astronomical ($3,600 for a two-foot high, toucan-shaped pitcher 
of silver inlaid with semi-precious stones) to the quite-reasonable (about $25 
and $50 for a pair of simple earrings or beaded silver necklace, respectively). 
</P>
<P>
 Early on during our stay, we met one of the hundreds of silver buyers who 
converge on Taxco to snap up jewelry that will be shipped to stores throughout 
the world. His advice: Check to make sure that sterling silver objects are 
stamped .925 (a sign of authenticity) and don't be afraid to bargain. He also 
told us to ask for a "price by the gram" rate on large purchases, which we 
found worked out to be at least a third less than the showroom price. 
</P>
<P>
 When we weren't bargaining for handsome belt buckles or picture frames (which 
we found in the shops along Pasaje Santa Prisca for about $13-$40 each), we 
wandered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our home base, about a 15-minute walk east of the Plaza Borda on a hill 
overlooking the city, was the funky but delightful Hotel de La Borda. For $50 a 
night, we got a vintage-1950s room trimmed with slate and mahogany and 
decorated with midnight-blue walls and star-shaped lights twinkling from the 
vaulted ceiling. In the afternoon, professional silver buyers -- many of them 
friends of the American hotel owner -- gathered by the palm-bordered pool for 
drinks and to keep tabs on their competition. And our two boys, ages 1 and 5, 
splashed away to their hearts' content. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its size, Taxco has the feel of a small town. The 5,850-foot altitude 
helps create a spring-like climate year round. All paths lead to the Plaza 
Borda, past balconies dripping with bougainvillea and songbirds in ornately 
carved wooden cages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We woke early each morning, watching the miners walk to work as we stood in 
line for the fresh-squeezed orange juice sold on almost every corner. And after 
several days of wondering what those silver-laden tunnels were like, we visited 
what we figured would be a close relative: a stellar cave, known as Las Grutas 
de Cacahuamilpa, located about 20 miles north of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Although devoid of silver deposits, the natural cave offers gems of another 
sort: a spectacular and well-lit series of gigantic chambers, some with domed 
ceilings that rise more than 80 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The cave has been a hide-out for everyone from Aztec chieftains to bandits and 
counts among its most famous visitors Mexico's onetime empress, Carlota, who 
marked the occasion in the 1860s with some graffiti that is still visible 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 We enjoyed our underground foray, but were glad to trade the humid cave for 
the crisp air of the Sierra Madre -- and the indelible stamp of silver. 
GUIDEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 For Silver Seekers 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: The easiest way to reach Taxco is via Mexico City. Aeromexico, 
Mexicana and Delta fly nonstop from LAX to Mexico City. Round-trip fares start 
at $326. 
</P>
<P>
 From Mexico City, it's about a three-hour drive to Taxco via the new, 
four-lane toll road that connects Mexico City and Acapulco. Several bus lines 
run first-class buses daily to Taxco from Mexico City; fares are about $10 per 
person one way. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: We stayed at the Hotel de la Borda, Cerro del Pedregal 2, about 
$50 per night double; telephone 011-52-762-2-0225. Another moderately priced 
choice, popular with families, is the Hotel Agua Escondida, Plaza Borda 4, 
about $45 per night double; tel. 011-52-762-2-0726. The Hotel Montetaxco 
(Fracc. Lomas de Taxco; tel. 011-52-762-2-1300, toll-free within Mexico 
9-1-800-98-000) is about $109 per night, double; a special three-night package 
is about $150 double. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: We enjoyed several Italian meals at La Taverna (Juarez 8; local 
tel. 2-5226). Less than $30 for two, including wine. Another favorite was the 
restaurant at the Hotel Agua Escondida, where our family of four spent about 
$20 for a dinner of typical Mexican specialties, including wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping and other diversions: The Spratling Ranch Workshop is six miles south 
of Taxco, off the old highway, about an $8 taxi ride from town. Open 
Monday-Saturday, no admission. The Castillo workshop, five miles south of town, 
is open to the public Monday through Friday. But sales are limited to the 
retail outlet, Los Castillo, located off the Plaza Borda at Plaza Bernal 10; 
tel. 2-0652. The Cacahuamilpa caves are located about 20 miles north of Taxco; 
Admission is about $1 per person.

PACKING: IS YOUR LUGGAGE A MESS? WELCOME TO THE FOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. YENCKEL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Samsonite, the luggage manufacturer, held a contest recently offering prizes 
to travelers who sent in the best tip for packing. The first-place winner was a 
Fulton, N.Y., woman who suggested mixing family clothing in each suitcase 
carried on the trip. The idea is that if one suitcase gets lost on a flight, 
everyone will still have something clean to wear. 
</P>
<P>
 At its worst, packing for a trip is no more than a petty annoyance. But who 
wants to start a vacation hassled, upset and grumbling? 
</P>
<P>
 Entire books have been written on the subject, the latest called "The Packing 
Book" by Judith Gilford (Ten Speed Press, $ 7.95). She teaches packing courses 
at a Berkeley, Calif., bookstore and insists you can pack everything you need 
for a two-week trip in a suitcase small enough to stow in an airplane overhead 
compartment. Just plan to do a little hand laundry every night before climbing 
into bed. 
</P>
<P>
 You might think business travelers would have it comparatively easy, because 
they only have to pack office wear. Far from it. A summer trip to chilly San 
Francisco demands heavier clothing than a meeting in sweltering New Orleans. 
For San Francisco, you probably will want to take along a light rain coat for 
foggy nights. Will it fit in your suitcase? For New Orleans, where the sweat 
drips profusely, consider packing a shirt or blouse for daytime wear -- for 
every day you are gone -- and a fresh one for dinner at the city's superb 
restaurants. How many shirts is that? Decisions, decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Every traveler faces many variables, which must be taken into account when 
choosing what to pack: 
</P>
<P>
 * How long will you be gone? A short trip, of course, is easier to pack for. 
You can toss everything you need into a suitcase and not worry it will be too 
heavy. But when you plan to be gone more than a week or two, you have to start 
thinking about items of clothing that wear well over several days. Silk is 
light, and it seems to hold up much better in repeated wearings than cotton. 
I've invested in several silk shirts at my wife's suggestion. Jeans are heavy, 
but I wore a pair for a week of sightseeing in Italy recently without feeling 
too shabby. 
</P>
<P>
 * Are you bound for a single destination -- where you can empty your suitcase 
into a closet or dresser until it's time to return home? Or will you keep on 
the move and never really unpack? If you expect to live out of your suitcase, 
you probably don't want to use such space-saving packing techniques as stuffing 
belts, socks and underwear into your shoes. Unstuffing and restuffing becomes 
too much of a hassle on a daily basis. Think in terms of easy access. I stack 
shirts on one side of the suitcase, pants on the other and line the bag with 
underwear and socks. I know where to reach for what I want. 
</P>
<P>
 * What kind of trip are you taking? A cruise to Alaska, a hiking holiday in 
the mountains, a motor-coach tour of Europe, a romp at the beach, a visit with 
old friends or family? Each getaway requires a different wardrobe, and you may 
want to check ahead to determine what to take to avoid problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, dress has become increasingly casual in the United States, 
Europe and elsewhere -- a trend that is making packing easier. I seldom pack a 
tie anymore unless I know I'll need one for a spiffy event such as an 
anniversary dinner with my wife. The other day I phoned a restaurant to ask if 
a jacket and tie were required. "No," came the reply. "We are in the food 
business, not the clothing business." 
</P>
<P>
 * How are you getting there? If you are driving, you can stuff the trunk with 
as much paraphernalia as you think you will need. If you are flying, you have 
to trim back to one or two bags per person. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do you enjoy doing hand laundry? In her book, Gilford notes that people who 
travel light can expect to be washing out their clothing often. Yuck! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once you have answered these questions, you are ready to pack for your 
vacation. Here are some suggestions that may make it easier: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't wait until the last minute. I'm sure this sounds like compulsive 
behavior, but I generally am finished packing two or three days before my trip 
-- the longer the trip, the sooner I've packed. Any time you leave home for 
several days, lots of things have to be done at the last minute (such as 
watering the house plants), but packing isn't one of them. I go out of town on 
an average of twice a month, and I've found there's much less stress to the 
departure when I'm not folding shirts and trousers while a taxi waits outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I'm less likely to forget something. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pack a smaller, soft-sided carry-on bag inside your larger suitcase. This is 
the second-place winning tip in the Samsonite contest. My wife and I pack an 
extra bag all the time. We fill it -- as the contestant suggested -- with 
vacation souvenirs. We tend to buy handmade folk-art objects, which can be 
wrapped and stuffed in the bag for safe carrying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take old clothes. When I'm about to leave on a long trip, I sometimes search 
my wardrobe for worn-out items or things I haven't put on for a year or two. As 
long as they are in decent shape, I'll pack them, wear them along the way and 
then discard them. Each day my suitcase gets lighter. In Italy, I deposited old 
pairs of undershorts and socks in the wastebasket of my hotel room each day. I 
wonder what the housekeeper thought? 
</P>
<P>
 * Wrap clothing in tissue paper as you pack it to ward off wrinkles. This is 
another Samsonite hint, which I've not tried. I fold my shirts and place them 
in plastic sweater bags. They always emerge less wrinkled than dress shirts 
pressed and packaged by a commercial laundry. Also, I usually pack cotton khaki 
pants rather than slacks for dress-up occasions, because khakis fold without 
much wrinkling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use travel-size versions of toiletry items to save space in your suitcase. 
Anything that cuts down on the weight of your suitcase is worth considering. 
Because I travel so much, I keep a toiletries case always packed with a small 
version of everything I need on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 * Choose a color scheme for your clothing and stick to it. Gilford lists this 
among her 10 top tips for travelers. When clothing and accessories are 
coordinated, she says, you can "mix and match items freely to create different 
looks." 
</P>
<P>
 * Before your trip, pack your bag and walk a quarter-mile with it. "If you 
can't manage," says Gilford, "take out the extras." Her advice is exaggerated, 
but Gilford has the right idea for anyone traveling by plane, train or bus. 
Don't pack more than you can readily carry. Even a suitcase with wheels has to 
be hoisted sometimes. If you need more space, pack two smaller suitcases rather 
than one large one. They will be easier to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put children's outfits (shirt, shorts, socks, underwear) in sealable bags, 
one for each day. "The children's outfits will match, and there will not be any 
arguments about what to wear," Samsonite says. "Dirty clothing can go back into 
the same bag to keep it away from other clothing." And you can save space "by 
putting a child's shoes in Mom's and Mom's shoes in Dad's." 
</P>
<P>
 * If you are flying, hand carry essentials. Gilford advocates carrying 
everything aboard the plane. But I'm convinced that in most cases checking my 
baggage is much less of a hassle because I don't have to haul it between 
connecting flights -- which sometimes can be a distance of a quarter of a mile. 
However, I make exceptions. If I will need a suit or tux at my destination, I 
pack it and any necessary accessories in a hanging bag, and I keep it with me 
on the plane. Everything else I check. 
</P>
<P>
 I always carry a small bag on board with basic mini-toiletries, a change of 
underwear and socks, a swimming suit and a small first-aid kit (aspirin, cold 
remedies) on the chance that my luggage is lost or delayed. Never put 
prescription medicines, valuables or house or car keys in checked luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't fret. On at least two trips, one to Vancouver, B.C., and another to 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, my baggage was lost and didn't catch up with me until 
I was back at home. I learned a valuable lesson; in a pinch, I can cope with a 
lot less clothing than I usually pack. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vancouver, I bought only a tie and a shirt to supplement the clothing I 
wore on the plane. On the plane, I had worn dress khakis and carried a sport 
jacket, which were suitable for a business meeting. In the Virgin Islands, I 
needed to buy only a pull-over shirt. Much of the time there, I wore only the 
bathing suit I had packed in my carry-on bag.

SHE'S BIG ON THE ART OF RECYCLING; THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS JUNK TO NANCY 
RUBINS, WHOSE ENORMOUSLY AMBITIOUS SCULPTURES DEFY GRAVITY AS THEY TURN THE 
WORLD ON END. 
</P>

<P>
 Nancy Rubins is such a petite woman, the art she makes seems as though it 
couldn't possibly come from her. Using the larger chunks of trash from modern 
life -- scrapped airplane parts, discarded trailers, mattresses, hot water 
heaters -- she creates hulking bouquets of metal junk on a scale so grand they 
simultaneously read as frightening, impossible and absolutely wonderful. The 
"gee whiz" factor in her art is very high. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting the 41-year-old artist at her studio in Topanga Canyon where she 
lives with her husband, artist Chris Burden, one gets some idea of how this 
insanely ambitious work comes to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Her modestly sized studio is in a state of barely organized chaos. Her 
drawings -- large sheets of paper obsessively covered with graphite until they 
take on the sheen and weight of metal -- are casually tacked to the walls and 
cover the floor, and many are irreparably torn and smudged. To get from one 
point to another, Rubins simply kicks them out of the way. She drags furniture 
over them. She hardly seems to notice they're there. It's a messy room, but 
there's something grand about the sheer volume of material it contains, and 
there's an exhilarating freedom in the rambunctious way she lives with the raw 
material of her art. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubins herself is a whirlwind of activity who always seems to be doing three 
things at once. Listening to her tell the story of her life and art in animated 
bursts, one deduces three facts: She has a wildly unfettered imagination and a 
child's sense of play; she had extensive schooling that gave her a solid 
grounding in the art of the 20th Century, and she has an indomitable, can-do 
approach to life. These things have led her to ask herself such questions as: 
"Why can't I make a sculpture out of 100 old mattresses smeared with 300 stale 
cakes?" 
</P>
<P>
 Included in MOCA's 1992 exhibition "Helter Skelter," a controversial 
exploration of the dark side of art in Los Angeles, Rubins contributed one of 
the show's most critically acclaimed works, and this is the Rubins piece 
Angelenos are most likely to have seen. A gigantic tumble of trailers and hot 
water heaters that loomed over the show like a menacing industrial cloud, the 
piece was a knockout and made clear why her work is so popular in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California will get another look at her work when she unveils an 
installation at the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego on Sept. 23. By 
necessity, her site-specific pieces rarely live longer than the duration of the 
average gallery show and don't come to Los Angeles too often, so a drive south 
definitely seems in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubins is remarkably precise in charting the development of her work -- many 
artists balk at such a task, but she seems to remember everything. Born in 
Naples, Tex., the youngest in a family of three children, Rubins and her family 
relocated periodically throughout her childhood, following her father's career 
as a research engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lived in Cincinnati for a few years, then we moved to Tennessee, and I 
mostly grew up in a tiny town there called Tullahoma. My mother took us to 
museums and I loved drawing, but I wasn't one of those kids who could draw a 
face -- I guess I couldn't calm down enough to do a neat drawing," she says 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an extreme sensibility from the time I was young, and always played 
intensely and had a little too much energy. I made candles, for instance, and 
the candles always got out of hand. You know how kids melt their crayons and 
make candles -- I'd keep melting until what I was making turned into something 
that had nothing to do with a candle." 
</P>
<P>
 Graduating from high school at the age of 16, Rubins enrolled at Peabody 
College in Nashville planning to become a high school art teacher, but all it 
took was one day of classes for her to realize she was in the wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were training people to be exactly the kind of teacher I always hated, 
so I left that program and became an art major and started making paintings -- 
these strange, organic, Eva Hesse-looking things. Scale has always been an 
issue in my work and even those early paintings were big -- they were more like 
objects that hung over ropes," says Rubins who, surprisingly enough, has never 
taken a sculpture class. "I spent a lot of time in the ceramics lab too, and at 
the time was influenced by funk, a kind of low Pop, and Minimalism." 
</P>
<P>
 After two years at Peabody, Rubins transferred to the Maryland Institute 
College of Art in Baltimore, where she says she began making "crude, unfired 
ceramic pieces. At the time I was interested in work by Peter Voulkos, and a 
few years later the work of Robert Arneson became important for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was only 18 when I went to Baltimore and was lucky in that I stumbled into 
a good school," she adds. "Lots of people came down from New York and lectured, 
and I took the train up there a lot, so I got a taste of what New York was 
about. I realized I wanted to be an artist when I was in Baltimore, but I still 
felt very young and was nervous about going out into the big world, so I 
decided to go to graduate school. I wanted to see what the West Coast was 
about, so I enrolled at UC Davis, where I studied with Arneson." 
</P>
<P>
 For obvious reasons, some observers mention sculptor John Chamberlain, as well 
as the California Assemblage tradition, in discussing influences on Rubins' 
work. However, she says that "while it was important to know Chamberlain was 
there, he wasn't a direct influence -- I was more interested in the Minimal 
people like Robert Ryman and Agnes Martin, and also liked Robert Smithson, 
Claes Oldenburg and Gordon Matta-Clark. As for assemblage, I love George Herms' 
and Bruce Conner's work, but my work strikes out in a different direction."  
</P>
<P>
 Graduating from Davis in 1976, Rubins moved to San Francisco, rented a loft, 
worked as a waitress by day and taught painting at night at the San Francisco 
Art Institute. The roots of her mature style began to appear in the work she 
made at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always gone to Goodwills," she recalls, "and one day I was in a thrift 
store and saw a pile of television sets selling for 25 cents each. I was 
fascinated by the idea that I too could own a mountain of TVs, so I loaded up 
my station wagon with them -- I bought 286 -- planning to use them in a 
sculpture, which didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking about Grandma Prisbrey's Bottle Village at the time, and I 
painted all the TVs with fluorescent paint, stacked them up and held them in 
place by packing them in concrete. But somehow the TVs never transcended their 
TV-ness, so I thought enough with the TVs -- I don't know what I'm doing here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not long after that, in 1977, there was an earthquake in San Francisco and 
the building I lived in rippled like a wave," adds Rubins, charting the 
evolution of her approach to scale and materials. "I was amazed that something 
so heavy and hard had the capacity to be fluid, and that led me to make a 
series of concrete walls that moved. They were a quarter of an inch thick and 
12 feet high, and if you pushed them they rippled." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that same year, Rubins went to Richmond, Va., to teach for a year at 
Virginia Commonwealth University, and while she was there her work took another 
decisive turn when she became hip to the beauty of used appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially I noticed the appliances in thrift stores because they're small 
enough that you can manipulate them, but then I became struck by how infinitely 
varied they were. Hair dryers, shavers, toasters and hot dog cookers come in a 
million shapes and colors, and I loved the fact that each one had belonged to 
somebody who had an intimate connection with it -- the presence of the user was 
definitely in the object for me, and I had no interest in unused appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyhow, I started going to thrift stores and filling my car with them, and 
every day I'd mix buckets of concrete, pack it around rows of appliances, then 
let it all set up -- I was building walls out of them," she adds. "All those 
pieces were destroyed, and I loved their impermanence -- if I had to worry 
about storing my work I'd never be able to give myself the freedom to make it. 
A little pile of appliances just didn't do it, and those pieces had to be huge 
in order to work -- there's a hilarious absurdity to them because of their 
size." 
</P>
<P>
 Completing two appliance pieces in Richmond in 1978, Rubins went to New York 
and landed a show at the O. K. Harris Gallery, scheduled for two years later. 
In the meantime, she went to teach in Tallahassee at Florida State University, 
where she collected 3,000 pounds of appliances, which she shipped to New York. 
Returning in 1980 to New York, where she was to live for a few years, Rubins 
had her show at O. K. Harris. The show was well received, but for obvious 
reasons, she didn't sell anything and made her living teaching and running a 
house-painting company. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1980-82, Rubins completed a handful of monumental works in New York, a 
few done through the arts program Creative Time. She then did a controversial 
permanent commission for a shopping center in Chicago that led Al Nodal, then 
the director of the Washington, D.C.-based alternative space WPA, to commission 
a piece for a plot of land near the Watergate building. Titled "Worlds Apart" 
-- a gargantuan, 40-foot-high orb of appliances perched on a thick stem -- the 
piece took three months to build and proved to be less than popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "The town went crazy when I built that piece," says Rubins, who was 28 at the 
time. "Ostensibly they objected to it on the grounds that it was a waste of 
taxpayers' money, but it was built almost for free with donated materials. The 
truth was they just thought it was ugly. We'd hoped to leave it up after the 
three-month permit expired, but the minute the permit was up they made us take 
it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was in Washington, (Los Angeles artist) Charlie Ray called and 
invited me to teach at UCLA," she continues. "I'd never had much interest in 
L.A. but needed a break from New York so I came in the fall of '82 and lived 
downtown at 6th and San Pedro. I didn't have a car so I had to catch a bus at 
5:45 in the morning to get to UCLA in time to teach -- I felt really alien 
here," she says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That changed a bit when I met Chris (Burden) at the end of 1982, and after 
returning to New York I found myself thinking, 'Gee, that's a pretty nice guy 
back there.' 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point I was rethinking my work," she adds. "I felt I'd gone as far as 
I could with the appliances and I started noticing bigger things, like 
trailers. In 1983, I made a piece in San Francisco using trailers that I cut up 
into parts, but that was unsatisfying -- when you cut them up they lost their 
trailerness. That same year I made friends with this junk dealer in San Pedro 
named J. W. who told me where I could get trailers in bulk, and five years 
later I made a piece in Pittsburgh (Pa., for the Three Rivers Arts Festival) 
leaving the trailers intact -- that seemed like the beginning of something." 
</P>
<P>
 R ubins maintained a long- distance romance with Burden until 1984, when she 
returned to L.A. permanently and moved in with him on a piece of land in 
Topanga Canyon where they lived outdoors for four years. "At first we camped," 
she recalls, "then we built a really elaborate tent." Burden and Rubins were 
both teaching at UCLA at the time, and Rubins spent much of her free time 
trying to find someone who'd sell her used airplane parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1984 I became friends with a man in the Mojave Desert named Mr. (Bill) 
Huffman who helped me find airplane parts, but it took forever to find somebody 
willing to sell them," she recalls. "The stuff usually belonged to the 
government and there were contracts forbidding its sale, but when I finally did 
find a seller who had some declassified parts he could legally sell, the stuff 
was amazingly cheap -- it sold for whatever the cost of scrap aluminum was at 
the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working with the airplane parts, I realized there's a human element in 
everything we create," she adds. "Plane seats, for instance, are structured 
like the human back. We talk about electricity in terms of male and female, hot 
water heaters are approximately the size of people and liquids go in and out -- 
everything is a metaphor for humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubins completed her first piece using airplane parts in 1985, using wire to 
affix the chunks of metal to a tree on the land where she and Burden live (the 
piece is still there). She used those materials again the same year for an 
installation at the Alexandria Hotel in downtown L.A. titled "Four Thousand 
Pounds of Smashed and Filleted Airplanes," and the following year she and 
Burden collaborated on a mechanized airplane parts installation at Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions. "That was the only mechanized piece I've ever done -- 
the mechanization was Chris' contribution to the piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she's ever considered working with organic materials, she says, "No, 
because the organic element is already in my work -- it's there in the way the 
piece dictates itself as it grows, like moss or a fungus. The impermanence of 
the work is also organic." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Rubins is working with an organic material; she's been making 
sculpture out of cakes and old mattresses for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This work took root in 1987 when I visited Baltimore and noticed all the old 
mattresses in the alleys there," she says. "Then I discovered this device used 
in packing that straps things really tight, and realized I could use it to 
sculpt with mattresses. I made my first piece using the device in Baltimore, 
but it didn't work because I needed more mattresses -- I had 150 of them, but 
somehow it needed more density. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the time I was thinking about the mattresses, I went to do a show in 
Vienna and found myself surrounded by amazing pastries," she continues. 
"European pastries are an idealized, highly fetishized food, and they represent 
a kind of culinary high point in civilization. That part of the world has such 
a dark and complex history that there's a dark undercurrent to all the sweet 
food you find there -- it's as if the pastry helps maintain the dream that 
everything's nice and under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mattresses are related to this but different in that instead of being about 
dreams, they absorb dreams, along with other base parts of human life -- our 
sweat and so forth. Mattresses are like baroque clouds that are a metaphor for 
what we desire, and sweets are about human desire as well. It seemed as if they 
went together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I built the first piece using mattresses and cakes at UCLA in the spring of 
1993, then shipped it to New York where it was shown at the Paul Kasmin 
Gallery. When you unbind the mattresses the cake cracks, so you have to apply 
fresh cakes when you reach your destination. I come from a ceramics background 
so in a way I handle the cakes as if they were clay." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing Rubins talk about the mattress pieces leaves one eager to actually see 
one, but she has something else in mind for the show in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to take a break from the cakes and mattresses right now," she says. 
"The San Diego museum has a beautiful new building with a triangular room and 
I'm going to remove the high windows above the room, and use the room and the 
street for the piece -- that's about all I can say about it at this point, 
because my work takes shape as I make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she has a dream project she's never been able to pull off she looks 
surprised. "No," she says, as if such a possibility never crossed her mind. 
"I've never not been able to do anything I wanted to do with my work."*
