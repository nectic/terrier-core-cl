 You folks in the 43rd Congressional District won't have to wash your hands 
after going to your mailbox; this election's over. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ick Factor that made voters squirm was perhaps nowhere ickier than in this 
Riverside County race, where GOP freshman Rep. Ken Calvert was in a rematch 
with Democrat Mark Takano, who lost to Calvert by a few hundred votes in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert was caught with a prostitute by police last year--and nearly lost the 
primary because of it. Takano aired radio ads quoting Jay Leno joking about the 
incident. A mailer cited the police report in all its graphic detail, and on 
the front--framing a photo of a casting director's idea of a hooker, and a 
man's hand extending a fistful of money--are the words, "It's midnight. Do you 
know where your congressman is?" 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert's mailers--once upon a time they called it campaign "literature," 
remember?--quoted another Republican legislator calling Takano a "nutzoid 
liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 And another carried broad hints of the "at-least-I-like-girls" variety. The 
pink color of his "Mark Takano . . . EXPOSED!" wasn't the only shocking thing 
about it. Inside, it cited Takano's support for gays in the military and 
partnership benefits for gay couples, then asked, in pink letters, "A 
Congressman for Riverside . . . or San Francisco?" (Takano has declined to 
discuss his sexual orientation as irrelevant.) 
</P>
<P>
 The winner: Calvert. The loser: everybody in the 43rd District with a mailing 
address. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 So long, so very long: Losing candidates we're sorry to lose--a Republican in 
Berkeley and a Rodent in Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman and lawyer Tom Burcham, who believes he was the first Republican 
to seek a nonpartisan Berkeley City Council seat since, oh, the Summer of Love, 
did not get lifted up by the GOP victory tsunami. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 36%, he did better than the city's 9% Republican registration. "We 
have customers come up in the store," he had said hopefully. "They sort of look 
around furtively and say, 'I'm a Republican.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And, gentlemen, we won't have Rodent to kick around anymore. The Santa Cruz 
gas pump jockey and band promoter, a 24-year-old Woodstock baby by name and 
age, put himself forward for the council pledging a do-nothing term of office 
(not much new there), upfront lying to voters (now we're getting somewhere), a 
height-to-weight requirement for Spandex-wearing ("Spandex is not a right"), 
and having gentlemen listed as an endangered species (too late, perhaps, to 
halt extinction there). 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, poor Rodent: Once the Spandex Civil Liberties Union came out against 
him, it was all over. 
</P>

 * Where They Voted--or Didn't

<P>
 More than 58% of the state's registered voters went to the polls Tuesday, a 
turnout that could rise to 62% when all absentee ballots are tallied. But that 
average was far exceeded by the three top-turnout counties, all in Northern 
California. The three with the lowest turnout were in the Central Valley.

 Take my please, wife: There's the $64,000 question . . . and the $5-million 
word. 
</P>
<P>
 The length of TV campaign sound bites has shrunk--from 43 seconds in 1968 to a 
scant 9 seconds in 1988--and now, even the magic word please , which takes 
about half a second to utter, has been cut from Pacific Bell's directory 
assistance operators' greeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the math: about 2.5 million inquiries a day, at 22 seconds per call . . 
. let's see--dropping "please" lets in another 57,000 calls a day--at two bits 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of "What city, please?" callers hear "Hi, this is (name), what 
city?" 
</P>
<P>
 And even that (name) part is subject to revision: if the given (name) is 
overlong, operators can use a fake (name). 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Rabindranath Tagore and Nathanael West chose careers in writing. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Draw! Dianne Feinstein and Mike Huffington weren't the only ones chewing their 
nails well into election night. 
</P>
<P>
 Skip and Lew had a few rough hours, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpine County Sheriff Henry (Skip) Veatch had already gone through a 
cliffhanger against Villa (Lew) Roper in June, when they tied with 276 votes 
each--and that represented more than three-fourths of the county's registered 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's runoff--which generated the state's highest turnout, 86.4%--it 
didn't take long to count the votes from four of Alpine's five precincts. Roper 
was ahead by 17 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 But where was that last precinct? Where was Bear Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 Three and a half hours later, Bear Valley weighed in like the mail carrier 
undaunted by snow or gloom of night. California 4 had already been closed for 
the winter, and couriers had to carry the ballots through Calaveras and Amador 
counties to get to Alpine's county seat (not by cross-country skis, more's the 
pity, or there'd be a movie of the week in it). 
</P>
<P>
 Bear Valley, where Veatch said he "felt really confident," came through; he 
won, 383 to 316. EXIT LINE 
</P>

GUN SALE WAS FOILED BEFORE SHOOTING AT WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Francisco Martin Duran, the ex-convict accused of shooting at the White House, 
was prevented from buying a pistol a month before the incident when a gun 
dealer ran a background check on him. 
</P>
<P>
 No such on-the-spot check was required when he bought the rifle he allegedly 
used at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law did what it was intended to do in terms of preventing Francisco Duran 
from purchasing a handgun on Sept. 30," said Jim Borowski, head of the state 
bureau of investigation's crime information center. The bureau checks 
prospective handgun buyers in compliance with the Brady handgun control law 
Congress passed in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of High Country Wholesale Firearms, James Wear, said Wednesday that 
Duran tried to buy the pistol on Sept. 30, about two weeks after buying the 
semiautomatic rifle seized in the Oct. 29 incident at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 On his handgun application, as on his earlier rifle application, Duran did not 
mention his felony assault conviction, Wear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Felons are barred from gun possession. No waiting period for a background 
check is required before a rifle purchase is completed. The Brady law includes 
a five-day wait so authorities can check handgun buyers' backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran's attempt to buy the pistol came on the day he left home in Security, 
telling his wife he was going to stock up on material for target practice. The 
next she heard of him, he was accused of the White House shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell's office told authorities that it 
received a threatening phone call from a man identifying himself as Francisco 
Martin Duran two months before Duran is alleged to have fired at the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 The man called Aug. 23 and threatened to "go to Washington and take someone 
out," apparently because of the crime bill, which banned many military-style 
semiautomatic rifles, the Colorado Democrat's spokeswoman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The call was one of hundreds of angry, threatening or obscene calls Campbell's 
Colorado Springs office received during that time, Knight said. It came two 
days before Campbell voted for the legislation.

SHUTTLE OZONE TESTS GET SOME HELP FROM BELOW

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists on both sides of the Atlantic launched ozone-mapping balloons and 
rockets Thursday as the space shuttle Atlantis and its tag-along satellite 
soared overhead and made their own survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers need the extra insight into Earth's ozone layer to make sure the 
information they get from the orbiting spacecraft is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA has launched 18 weather balloons and 20 small rockets from Wallops 
Island, Va., so far for the experiment. The German weather service has sent up 
15 ozone-measuring balloons from an observatory in Bavaria. Russian scientists 
have sent up at least two rockets with atmospheric monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The launches will continue until the six shuttle astronauts retrieve the 
German satellite Saturday for the trip home on Monday. The crew released the 
satellite last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozone in the stratosphere protects humans, animals and plants from ultraviolet 
rays; man-made chemicals are weakening this layer, especially over Antarctica.

GOP LAWMAKER SUGGESTS POLITICS IN BASE CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A senior Republican demanded an investigation Thursday into whether the 
Clinton Administration sought to manipulate a base closing question to help 
Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.) defeat Republican Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.), who is in line to become chairman of the Armed 
Services Committee, said he wants to know why Deputy Defense Secretary John M. 
Deutch asked the Navy shortly before Tuesday's election to review a decision to 
move military offices out of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Spence said Deutch's move may have "resulted from political considerations." 
Deutch sought a review of a 1993 decision to move the Naval Sea Systems Command 
headquarters to Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood said the issue had nothing to do with politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did not ask the Navy to revisit the whole decision. He asked whether the 
figures the Navy used for moving are still valid. That's nothing unusual," 
Flood said.

CLINTON APPOINTS AIDS POLICY DIRECTOR; HEALTH: PATRICIA FLEMING SEES ADDED 
DIFFICULTIES IN GETTING AMPLE FUNDS FROM CONGRESS. PRESIDENT VOWS TO MAKE FIGHT 
AGAINST THE AILMENT A HIGH PRIORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to repair his tarnished image within the AIDS community, President 
Clinton on Thursday named Patricia (Patsy) Fleming, a widely respected 
legislative specialist with 21 years of government experience, as his new 
director of AIDS policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who promised to give AIDS a high priority in his Administration, has 
been attacked by AIDS activists who say he has not done enough.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, introducing Fleming in a White House ceremony, reaffirmed his 
commitment to battling the disease. "The face of AIDS is no longer the face of 
a stranger," he said. "It is the face of a friend. . . . It is a disease with a 
human face." 
</P>
<P>
 His voice breaking, he added that he was dedicating the occasion "to my dear 
friend Elizabeth Glaser," the Los Angeles woman who delivered a stirring speech 
to the 1992 Democratic National Convention which nominated him, and who is ill 
with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The President apparently hopes that Fleming can succeed where her predecessor, 
Kristine M. Gebbie, failed -- particularly in communicating what the 
Administration views as its achievements in AIDS policy. After a year on the 
job, Gebbie left amid criticism that she lacked access to the President and 
support from within the federal agencies and had neglected to consult with AIDS 
experts and activists on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 However, both Clinton and Fleming -- and the AIDS community -- almost 
certainly now will face a far worse problem than communication. With the new 
Republican and distinctively conservative Congress it is likely to be a 
formidable challenge to push increased -- or even current -- AIDS programs 
through a Congress whose leaders have promised to cut taxes, increase military 
spending and cut social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming said that she remains optimistic, saying Congress "has always been 
sympathetic to AIDS," particularly in supporting money for increased scientific 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said in an interview earlier in the week that she expects the new 
Congress to be "more difficult in terms of funding" AIDS programs in general. 
"We will have to use our funds more judiciously," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already been working with (Budget Director) Alice Rivlin on the AIDS 
budget." 
</P>
<P>
 And she acknowledged that it would be especially difficult to gain support 
among lawmakers for prevention and education programs promoting safer sex 
practices, particularly those targeting adolescents, one of the fastest growing 
populations of infected Americans. Clinton has asked that she compile a report 
on the problem of AIDS infection in teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to find a way," of getting money from Congress for these 
programs, she said. "We have to find approaches that are acceptable to a wide 
array of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming, who has been serving as interim AIDS policy director since last 
August, most recently served as a special assistant to Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna Shalala. She worked for nearly a decade for the late 
Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) where, among other things, she was a major force in 
shaping AIDS legislation for Weiss' House Government Operations subcommittee on 
human resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like many Americans, AIDS has changed my life," she said. "The utter horror 
of the AIDS epidemic has reinforced my need to be an activist. For that, I am 
grateful. But AIDS has also forced me to attend too many funerals, to hold the 
hands of too many grieving friends and family members and to participate in too 
many candlelight vigils. For that, I am angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am angry because as an African American, as a woman, and as a mother of 
three sons, I know all too well the threat that HIV poses for every American." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming, who last summer said she was not interested in a permanent 
appointment to the position, said that she changed her mind because "the 
President has made a commitment to me that I can talk to him and tell him what 
I think he should do, and (that) he should carry out the policies that we have 
developed." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, numerous representatives from AIDS organizations urged her to stay on, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who was accompanied by Shalala, promised Thursday that Fleming "will 
have direct access to me and to members of the Cabinet," and described her as 
having a "disciplined and passionate" approach to the task.  
</P>
<P>
 "Fleming's dedication to the fight against AIDS is unparalleled," said Daniel 
T. Bross, executive director of AIDS Action Council.

LOUIS NIZER, 92; ATTORNEY, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR; LAW: LEGENDARY TRIAL LAWYER IS 
REMEMBERED AS A RENAISSANCE MAN. ONE OF HIS CASES ARGUED BEFORE SUPREME COURT 
LED TO THE MOVIE RATING SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Louis Nizer, the legendary trial lawyer who took on some of the most 
formidable cases of the postwar period and who wrote 10 best-selling books, 
including the world-renowned "My Life in Court," died Thursday at Beth Israel 
Hospital of kidney failure. He was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Nizer, who founded the firm of Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & Ballon, was 
one of only a handful of courtroom lawyers to emerge as well-known figures. For 
more than 65 years he attracted national attention in headline jury trials and 
argued hundreds of cases across the nation, in foreign countries and the U.S. 
Supreme Court -- losing, in his words, "very, very few" of them. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued the issue of obscenity in movies before the U.S. Supreme Court as 
general counsel to the Motion Picture Assn. of America. The case ultimately led 
to the establishment of the movie rating system. 
</P>
<P>
 Nizer also became a subject of the entertainment industry. Actors Van Heflin, 
George C. Scott and Ed Asner portrayed him in stage, screen and television 
adaptations of his book "A Case of Libel." 
</P>
<P>
 Nizer's other books included "The Jury Returned," "The Implosion Conspiracy," 
"Reflections Without Mirrors" and "Catspaw." 
</P>
<P>
 His talent for public speaking emerged when he was a child in the 
Williamsburgh, Brooklyn, section of New York City. Only two years after 
graduating from Columbia Law School in 1924, he founded the firm that still 
bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm acquired an international reputation as it grew from its traditional 
roots in litigation and entertainment law into a full service law firm with 
offices in New York and affiliates overseas employing more than 200 people. He 
remained the firm's honorary chairman and senior partner until his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Louis Nizer was this century's quintessential Renaissance man," said Perry 
Galler, the firm's managing partner. "He taught and inspired a whole generation 
of younger lawyers in the firm and around the country. He emphasized that the 
law is a noble and demanding profession requiring a total commitment to both 
the highest ethical standards and the clients' best interests. Despite his 
extraordinary public prominence, he was always accessible to each generation of 
lawyers he groomed to carry on the traditions of the firm he founded." 
</P>
<P>
 Nizer believed that no case was ever won with words but by building a "solid 
foundation of facts." His books, which he wrote longhand, reinforced his 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 No trial was routine. Each was different from any other, with a new cast, 
director and plot. Every case was as exciting as the first he ever tried. For 
Nizer, his most exciting case was always the next one. 
</P>
<P>
 Nizer first came to prominence after his involvement in a number of highly 
publicized cases after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his most renowned cases was the libel suit of John Henry Faulk. Faulk, 
a popular CBS radio personality, had been libeled in 1956 by AWARE, a 
self-appointed anti-Communist group that "cleared" performers for sponsors. 
When Faulk opposed the group, the organization branded him a Communist. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, Nizer won a record $3.5-million in damages against the group, helping 
to end blacklisting in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott starred in the 1975 CBS presentation of "Fear of Trial," a docudrama 
about the Faulk case. 
</P>
<P>
 Nizer's involvement with the arts also extended to his personal life. Not only 
at home in the courtroom, he excelled as an author, painter and musician. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote rather than dictated his books, he said, "because the rhythm of 
dictation is different from the rhythm of reading." 
</P>
<P>
 All his manuscripts were written on legal pads so he could see "that the 
balance was good." 
</P>
<P>
 Nizer was a composer and member of the American Society of Composers, Authors 
and Publishers, whose record, "Songs for You," was released by RCA. He was also 
nominated for a Grammy award for a recording in which he analyzed decisions by 
Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a prizewinning artist, and the walls of his office on West 52nd Street 
were brightened by several of his works. Nizer's paintings were exhibited at 
the Hammer Gallery in New York, the Boston Museum, the Galerie Heritage in 
Toronto, the Permanent Art Gallery of the American Bank & Trust Co., New York, 
and at the Museum of Art, Science & Industry in Bridgeport, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in London in 1902 and raised in Brooklyn from the age of 2, he graduated 
from Columbia College in 1922 and from Columbia Law School in 1924. At college, 
he won the Curtis Oratorical Prize twice, the highest honor given for oratory 
and original composition. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, Presidents approached him about becoming a judge and even 
attorney general, but he steadfastly refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy the ardor, and also the freedom, of a law office practice," he would 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was active in politics, from serving in the "kitchen Cabinet" of New 
York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia to writing speeches for President Lyndon B. 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 His public prominence was underlined when he was asked to write the analysis 
of the Warren Commission's report on President John F. Kennedy's assassination, 
which was appended to the study when it was released in book form. He was an 
informal counselor to several U.S. Presidents and foreign heads of state, 
including Indira Gandhi and several Israeli prime ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nizer also lectured on various legal subjects at many universities and bar 
associations and was the recipient of honorary doctor of law degrees from 
Pepperdine University and Iowa Wesleyan College. In 1988, Nizer was honored by 
Tel Aviv University School of Law by the dedication of a new library wing 
bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the recipient of the Literary Father of the Year award and the Golden 
Plate award of the American Academy of Achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1939, he married Mildred Mantel Wollins, who died in 1993. He is survived 
by his children, Terry and Tony Wollins of Boca Raton, Fla., and several 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; POLICE SAY 
BABY WAS SLAIN BY MOTHER, THROWN TO DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old woman was arrested in Pomona on suspicion of killing her newborn 
son and throwing his body into the back yard of a neighbor's home where pit 
bulls were kept, police said Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
 Araceli Banda Garcia, who has two other children, was being held without bail 
at Sybil Brand Institute on suspicion of murder after her arrest Tuesday night, 
said Lt. Ron Frazier of the Pomona Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The mutilated body of the baby boy was found Friday in the yard of a house on 
Orange Grove Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Police initially believed that one or both of the pit bulls mauled the baby, 
but now believe that he was dead when his body was thrown into the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Garcia may have been trying to hide the birth from her 
parents, who live next door to where the baby was found. When questioned, 
Garcia said she had been pregnant and that she was treated for a miscarriage 
Friday at a hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when police obtained a warrant and searched her parents' house, where 
Garcia lived, they said they found a full-term placenta in a trash container. 
Garcia then admitted that the baby was hers and that she had thrown it into the 
neighbor's yard, Frazier said, adding that the identity of the baby's father 
was unknown.

NO QUICK FIX IN ISSUE OF BASE CLOSURES; EL TORO REFERENDUM HAS RAISED MORE 
QUESTIONS THAN IT HAS ANSWERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's confident growth after World War II was sustained in part by a 
vast military presence. During the recent recession, one sure sign of the need 
for economic restructuring was the challenge that planned base closures posed 
to the resourcefulness of communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The early debate over the future of the sprawling El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station in Orange County demonstrates that there are no short cuts for affected 
communities between the economic stability of the past and the uncertain 
choices concerning the future. The air station, one of seven California bases 
targeted in 1993, is scheduled to close by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County voters have just given very narrow approval to a 
developer-inspired initiative to mandate a new commercial airport at the 
4,700-acre site. But the countywide referendum, properly derided by opponents 
as ballot-box planning, has raised more questions than it has answered. Even as 
proponents were relishing whatever victory might be read in such a thin 
expression of community intent, the federal government, which owns the base, 
was saying that the local vote was all but irrelevant.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon said it intended, as always, to deal only with the county 
planning agency set up to explore possible uses for the base and that it did 
not consider itself bound in any way by the vote. It was an opinion likely to 
carry weight, in light of the fact that the county initiative dealt with 
rezoning of federal land. County supervisors already had been advised by their 
legal counsel that the planning agency they created to recommend uses doesn't 
have to pay any attention to this initiative.  
</P>
<P>
 So with litigation from opponents of an airport also likely, the base's future 
has not been resolved by an impatient rush to the voting booth. Is this a slap 
in the face to the notion of local control? Hardly. Wisely, the federal 
government's procedures for turning bases over for civilian use are tuned to a 
better frequency of community feedback. They favor discussion over expensive 
mailers put out by developers wishing to oversimplify things. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's something Washington is doing right. It wants to be sure that a plan 
for the future of a base has addressed all the options and reflects real 
community consensus.  
</P>
<P>
 There is a place for the initiative process, but not as a preemptive strike on 
complicated land-use judgments. Let airports be studied along with whatever 
other good ideas may be out there for the El Toro Air Station. The hard truth 
is that there is no easy route for communities facing base closures, and the 
lesson from this experience is that it's a good thing there isn't.

TERM LIMITS FOR ARAFAT?; NOT QUITE, BUT PALESTINIANS HAVE TO WONDER ABOUT THIS 
LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week ago Yasser Arafat was hissed and jostled when he appeared at a mosque 
in Gaza for the funeral of a Palestinian radical killed in a car bomb explosion 
that most Palestinians blame on Israel. The public humiliation of the PLO 
chairman was yet another sign of his weakened grip on the loyalties of those 
whose aspirations he claims to represent. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the harassment of Arafat reflects the growing gulf between those 
Palestinians who accept the peace process with Israel and those who remain 
committed to a posture of no negotiations and no compromise. What is also 
reflected is the mounting frustration Palestinians feel over the slow pace of 
the talks with Israel and the absence of material improvement in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Blame for this can be distributed all around. Israel plainly has been in no 
rush to resolve such key issues as how Israeli troops on the West Bank are to 
be redeployed and the nature of the self-rule council that Palestinians are to 
elect. 
</P>
<P>
 The security concerns indicated by this go-slow approach, Israelis would say, 
have been validated by the attacks on Israelis carried out by Muslim 
extremists, attacks Arafat seems unable to control. But Israeli foot-dragging 
has been more than matched by Palestinian ineptitude. Arafat, as always 
insisting on total control and as always trusting only his cronies, has failed 
to deliver as the head of the Palestinian Authority, which is supposed to 
handle the transition to self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's administrative failures, along with persistent doubts by donors that 
the notoriously corrupt PLO can be trusted, are largely responsible for holding 
up the transfer to the Palestinian Authority of hundreds of millions of dollars 
in pledged foreign help. As a consequence, what had earlier been seen as an 
urgent need to begin lifting living standards to build support for the peace 
process has been left largely unmet. And so anger and despair have increased, 
and Hamas and other radical Muslim groups have won greater sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and Israel are now concerned enough that they have agreed to speed up 
their talks on key issues and move ahead with Israel's transfer to Palestinians 
of authority over education, taxation, welfare and tourism. At the same time 
Israel will ease the restrictions on permits for Gazans who seek work in 
Israel. These are obviously useful steps. But profound challenges remain. Not 
the least of them is Arafat's own apparently incurable administrative 
incompetence and his jealous refusal to share power. There's no shortage of 
Palestinian technical and administrative talent and commercial acumen. But with 
Arafat in charge, these clearly are not being adequately used. Palestinians 
crave change. The place to start may be at the top.

LERNER ON CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Lerner, Hillary's "guru" on the "politics of meaning," opines that 
President Clinton will be in serious trouble for the next two years unless he 
can "reconstitute a serious campaign for a politics of meaning" (Commentary, 
Nov. 7). Lerner's definition of the "politics of meaning" shows that Clinton's 
embrace of this ludicrous suggestion would not only be futile; it would be 
suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lerner, President Reagan "legitimated an ethos of selfishness" 
which continues today as the polar opposite of the "politics of meaning." And 
how does this Reagan "ethos of selfishness" manifest itself? It does so, 
according to Lerner, by "people's desires for lower taxes and less government." 
Therefore, Lerner implies that if people would only desire higher taxes and 
more government, they would be following "a new communitarian ethos," which 
forms the backbone of this "politics of meaning." 
</P>
<P>
 I doubt that President Clinton is likely to leap on Lerner's suggestion, 
especially after the election results. What looks like "politics of meaning" 
and "idealism" to Lerner looks to most people like the shopworn liberal 
approach which the electorate has roundly rejected. Voters much prefer the 
lower taxes/less government approach of the Reagan years to the higher 
taxes/more government approach underlying Lerner's "politics of meaning."

 Lerner is what I call "unclear on the concept." Idealism is just that; it is 
not realism, which is where we, the American people, live and work. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality is as follows: In the world we have the most powerful economy, the 
best health care system, the best educational system, the finest military, etc. 
We can enjoy these achievements, because we, as a people, are grounded in a 
concept called economic realism. Economic realism ensures that each American is 
able to exercise certain inalienable rights, namely, life, liberty and the 
pursuit of happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality also consists of problems. Many of these problems, Mr. Lerner, have 
resulted from our government's attempt to build the "house of cards" that you 
idealize: a full-service government. And what has your idealism left us with? 
The answer is painfully clear: restrictions on our rights, runaway annual 
deficits, an enormous national debt, government subsidies that degrade the 
individual, and many other less-than-admirable qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 If you doubt whether the American people want your idealism, review Tuesday's 
election results. We no longer put our faith in a government that has "lost 
touch" with the concept of economic realism. We don't want or need a 
full-service government financed at the expense of every American. That's 
reality.

 Twenty-one months into an Administration which has proven to cognizant 
Americans that whomever was pulling Reagan's and Bush's strings was 
simultaneously jerking us all around, we see an opposition which is pitifully 
low in ammunition. Wright's self-help psychobabble is solid evidence for this 
case.

 Do we really need a full-time chief executive in the White House? Judging by 
President Clinton's absence from the Oval Office these past couple of weeks, 
and the nature of his activities, maybe not. First, he spends several days 
aboard Air Force One on what was largely a PR junket in the Mideast to enhance 
his approval rating with voters here at home . . . and then he spends the 
following week or so, also aboard Air Force One, crisscrossing the country 
campaigning for Democratic candidates in trouble with the electorate in their 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least it would seem only fair that his salary for that time, and 
the rather considerable cost of flying Air Force One so many miles, should be 
charged to the Democratic Party.

BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY TREATY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Don't Be Distracted by Alien Cows," by Donald Kennedy (Commentary, Oct. 24), 
paints a distorted picture of the value of the International Convention on 
Biological Diversity. The National Cattlemen's Assn., representing 
approximately 230,000 cattle producers nationwide, is vehemently opposed to the 
biodiversity treaty. By allowing "signatory nations to monitor organisms and 
their habitats and to develop protection plans for those in danger," this 
treaty would effectively trample private property rights by mandating undefined 
minimum levels of species diversity found primarily on privately owned lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy refers to the present as being "this greatest extinction episode in 
the planet's history," when in fact, the United States has several species 
protections in place, in the form of the Endangered Species Act and other 
federal and state laws. But the more difficult issue, that of defining 
"biological diversity," and identifying appropriate levels of biodiversity for 
current and future generations, has yet to be accomplished on a domestic level, 
let alone globally. It is therefore premature to obligate the United States to 
an international treaty which has yet to be defined in domestic law. 
</P>
<P>
 NCA considers the Senate decision to postpone ratification of the biodiversity 
treaty to be prudent. The treaty is very vague and incomplete. Additionally, 
NCA has received a copy of the draft Section 10, Global Biodiversity Assessment 
Section. This 600-page document outlines "measures for conservation of 
biodiversity and sustainable use of its components," and is designed to 
establish recommended national approaches to maximize biological diversity. 
This new document, and presumably many more serious sections which have yet to 
be drafted, were not transmitted to the Senate with the treaty and therefore 
have not been considered for U.S. ratification. Also, due to the broad nature 
of this biodiversity treaty, additional hearings should be scheduled next year 
for appropriate Senate committees.  
</P>
<P>
 The value of our nation's lands and resources is paramount to the very people 
who would be most affected by this treaty -- the private property owners.

HELP FOR PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sorting through our feelings of anguish and horror, as we watched the two 
little South Carolina boys buried and their mother jailed (Nov. 4-5, 7), I 
believe it is time to do a reality check on America, 1994. In my position of 
senior director of the Stephen S. Wise Temple Parenting Center in Los Angeles 
(a support program for parents with children from birth to 3 years of age), I 
have spoken to many new mothers who find themselves depressed and overwhelmed 
with the responsibility of nurturing their babies, taking care of their 
households, earning a living and struggling with feelings of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 One young woman who stands out in my memory came to me to ask for help in 
giving her children away. As a single mother she had done all she could to keep 
her head above water and she was ready to give up. Luckily we had the resources 
to help her and this story had a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to suggest that we establish drop-in centers for new mothers (and 
fathers) in churches, temples and community centers in our neighborhoods. I 
have personally observed the empty rooms available on a daily basis in so many 
of these facilities. Even hospitals could take part in providing this type of 
"emotional" emergency care. These drop-in environments could be staffed with 
senior citizens, retired teachers or other compassionate listeners who could 
give relief and also help to find appropriate resources for an exhausted 
mother. This would begin to provide the emotional safety net for new families 
that we have found to be so effective in our temple program. 
</P>
<P>
 This terrible tragedy provides an opportunity to turn our pain into 
constructive action and to protect our most valuable national treasure, our 
children.

PERSPECTIVES ON ELECTION FALLOUT; A RUDE AWAKENING FOR LATINOS; PROP. 187 
PROVED THE POWER OF THE VOTE TO THOSE RELUCTANT TO BECOME U.S. CITIZENS. NOW, 
THOUSANDS WILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. HAYES-BAUTISTA and GREGORY RODRIGUEZ, David E. Hayes-Bautista is 
director of the Alta California Policy Research Center, an independent think 
tank studying Latino issues. Gregory Rodriguez is a researcher and writer at 
the center. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Maybe this is the kick in the pants we Latinos needed," Huntington Park 
resident Rebecca Avila said after it was announced that Proposition 187 had 
been approved by an overwhelming majority of California voters. On election 
night and the following day, the mood in communities with the heaviest 
concentration of Latino immigrants was sullen, but not defeated. Many locals 
comforted themselves by pointing out that Latino immigrants have never before 
participated so enthusiastically in electoral politics in this or any other 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Many credit the activism inspired by Proposition 187 with birthing a new 
political consciousness among Latinos, driven in large part by immigrants. One 
day in the not-so-distant future, a predominantly Latino California electorate 
will be confronting complex issues like the state's response to illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 187 woke us up," said Ernestine Mansour, a Mexican-born poll 
watcher. The Southwest Voter Research Institute estimates that the percentage 
of Latino voters who are immigrants increased from 20% to 30% since the last 
election. Fifty-five percent of all Latinos who are registered to vote cast 
ballots last Tuesday. In neighborhoods from Boyle Heights to South Gate, 
precinct leaders reported that naturalized Latino immigrants, many voting for 
the first time, doubled their turnout in previous elections. Unprecedented 
numbers of teen-agers, too young to vote themselves, became politically 
involved.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the 2.7 million Latinos in California who are eligible by age and 
citizenship to register to vote, 1.75 million have done so, according to the 
Southwest Voter Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if immigration from Latin America were to come to a sudden halt tomorrow, 
high Latino birth rates, coupled with a virtual zero population growth for 
Anglos, would give California a Latino majority by the year 2040. As it is, 
Latinos will make up more than half the population by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Latino activists have been invoking the imagery of the Latino 
electorate as the "sleeping giant" for decades. On election night, Rep. Lucille 
Roybal-Allard recalled asking her father, Edward Roybal, California's first 
Latino congressman, what the phrase meant when she was a little girl in the 
1950s. Today, the now-hackneyed metaphor inspires groans in more than a few 
U.S.-born Latinos who have given up hope that Latinos will ever become a 
politically active population. They feel that without a galvanizing issue in 
1996, these same voters will slip quietly back into passivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Research Institute, finds 
the Swiftian imagery insulting as well as misleading. He sees Proposition 187 
as speeding up what has already been a healthy growth in Latino political 
involvement. He reminds us that the number of registered voters and Latino 
elected officials has doubled in California since 1984. "We haven't been 
sleeping," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Latin American immigrants have long confused the notions of citizenship and 
cultural identity. Largely because of that, they have had the lowest rates of 
naturalization of any immigrant groups. "Green card" holders have said they are 
reluctant to become U.S. citizens because they fear losing the values that make 
them Latino. Immigrants from Latin America, unlike those of European origin, 
also come from countries whose national identities have been, in great part, 
defined by the overpowering and often intrusive presence of the United States, 
the "Colossus to the North." Latin nations have frequently manipulated 
anti-Yankee sentiment to promote national unity. In Mexico, becoming "North 
American" is seen as betrayal of one's culture. So, in an ill-defined effort to 
maintain their identity, many Latinos have wound up straddling the border, 
living in the United States without becoming citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Latino immigrants were able to avoid having to make that choice. 
The hubbub over Proposition 187 and its ultimate passage has changed all that. 
Although the measure specifically targets illegal immigrants, many legal 
immigrants have taken the issue personally and feel they have been made guilty 
by association. According to Domingo Rodriguez, the head of Los Angeles Unified 
School District's citizenship program, huge numbers of legal immigrants have 
begun to search for security and a voice in citizenship. Since Gov. Pete 
Wilson's anti-illegal-immigrant campaign began, there has been a marked 
increase in the number of permanent resident aliens applying for citizenship. 
The district is preparing for 30,000 students to attend adult-school 
citizenship classes this academic year, up from last year's enrollment of 
8,300. This is happening at a time when more and more Latinos are realizing 
that becoming an American citizen does not stop them from maintaining the 
social ties and values that give their lives meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Proposition 187 wins," Huntington Park Councilman Raul Perez said shortly 
before the polls closed on Tuesday, "immigrants will get the message that they 
can't continue to sit on the fence. They need to make up their mind that this 
is their country and that they're here for good." 
</P>
<P>
 That message appears to be hitting home.

WILL BE THE MINORITY'S MINORITY, GIVING UP THE CLOUT AND COMMITTEE RANK THAT

 The American electorate changed the course of American politics this week. 
Considerable time will be spent analyzing the significance of Tuesday's vote. 
Buried among the many stories of defeated incumbents will be the inglorious end 
of an era for black members of Congress, who will now become the minority's 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
 While most black members were easily reelected, the collective clout of the 
Congressional Black Caucus was foreclosed the moment Republicans achieved 
majority status in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching a record-high 40 members in 1992, the Black Caucus boasted a 
political status far superior to its numbers. Frequently providing the margin 
of victory or defeat for important legislation, the caucus enjoyed some of its 
finest hours during the first two years of the Clinton Administration: It 
played a leadership role in "restoring democracy" to Haiti and in passing an 
omnibus crime bill and had a large role in negotiations on the Administration's 
ill-fated health-care reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfaltering support for Bill Clinton provided unencumbered access to the White 
House, which translated into unprecedented legislative and political clout. The 
participation or imprimatur of the caucus was essential for many successful 
coalitions. Many African American members had become well-deserved 
beneficiaries of the congressional seniority system -- a system decried by new 
members in the 1970s as racist and unfair. But, as conventional wisdom has it, 
the longer you stay in Congress, the more you like the seniority system. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1994, Black Caucus members held the chairs of three standing committees and 
16 subcommittees in the House. In January, these coveted positions, with their 
perks and additional staff, will vanish as Republicans take seats held by 
Democrats since 1954. Gone will be the black chairmanship of the Armed 
Services, Government Operations and the Post Office and Civil Service 
committees, along with key subcommittee chairmanships in appropriations, small 
business, education and labor, among others. The District of Columbia 
Committee, traditionally headed by a black member, is likely to go to a 
conservative white Californian -- Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 104th Congress, black Democrats will not only lose their leadership 
positions, but also stand to lose most of the oddly configured Southern 
districts, the result of so-called racial gerrymandering. New members from 
those districts could be forced to run in districts where the electorate is not 
majority African American. There could be as much as 25% shrinkage in the ranks 
of the Black Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 On a larger level, one of the more significant consequences of losing power in 
Congress is that the Black Caucus, as an entity, could become marginalized. 
Worse still, it could become relegated for some time to come to the ignominious 
role of the gnat on the elephant's hide. As the self-described "conscience of 
Congress," the caucus was able to exercise most of its leverage on Democratic 
congressional leaders who were predisposed, or at least inclined, to assist 
black leaders in delivering to their constituencies. In the end, it was always 
in the interest of the Democratic leadership to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new Republican majority led by soon-to-be Speaker Newt Gingrich, the 
caucus has no such leverage, and the Republicans have no such interest. The GOP 
is not beholden to African Americans for electoral victories, and there is 
little if any public mandate to preserve programs or policies of concern to 
blacks. Other than for reasons of noblesse oblige, Republicans really do not 
need to interact with the caucus, as a bloc, for anything. Given the polarities 
of the 1994 elections, the Republican majority could vote along party lines on 
all major legislative issues in the future and probably not suffer terribly at 
the polls in 1996. Adding insult to injury, the Democrats -- in their own 
baldfaced efforts to recapture a shrinking base of support -- are stumbling 
over each other in their unabashed move to the middle -- miles apart from 
policies traditionally embraced by the Black Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 As Republicans set upon the path of governing the legislative branch, 
Democrats should be prepared for a measured -- and hopefully short-lived -- 
dose of vengeance. Forty years is a long time to wait for anything, and 
Democrats were anything but gracious to the Republican minority throughout 
their majority years. From the ratio of senior staff on committees to the 
so-called patronage positions, the Republicans are poised to set the House and 
Senate on their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Given these prospects, the Black Caucus could founder in political never-never 
land, somewhere in the margins between Republican indifference and Democratic 
intransigence.

NO MARKET FOR SELLERS OF PLUTONIUM; NUCLEAR WEAPONS: REPORTS EXAGGERATING THE 
TERRORIST RISK ARE NEEDLESSLY ALARMIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MICHAEL JENKINS, Brian Michael Jenkins of Los Angeles is deputy 
chairman of an investigative and securities consulting firm. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recent arrests by German authorities prove that there are people with access 
to Russian stocks of plutonium who are willing to sell. The arrests do not 
prove the existence of a nuclear black market. A market requires both sellers 
and buyers. In this case, the only buyers appear to have been German police. 
Are there others? 
</P>
<P>
 The popular literature leaves the impression that there are a vast number of 
malevolent governments and others whose itch to acquire nuclear weapons has 
been frustrated only by the difficulty of acquiring the necessary materiel. 
With the fall of the Soviet Union, the impoverishment of its once mighty 
scientific community, rampant corruption and growing organized crime, this view 
has changed. We now see sellers -- like those arrested in Germany -- but ask 
who the buyers might be. 
</P>
<P>
 On the basis of motive alone, buyers are legion. They range from inmates of 
mental hospitals to nations convinced that their survival depends on nuclear 
weapons. The nations mentioned most often include Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, 
Pakistan, Algeria, North and South Korea, Taiwan and, in the past, Argentina 
and Brazil. Libya's Moammar Kadafi reportedly has offered millions to acquire a 
nuclear weapon. Israel is believed to have nuclear weapons, fabricated in part 
with materiel obtained covertly. There are unconfirmed reports that Iran 
obtained some of the nuclear warheads that had been stored in Soviet Central 
Asia. Before the Gulf War dashed Saddam Hussein's nuclear ambitions, Iraq may 
have progressed further in its secret weapons-development program than 
intelligence analysts have estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Belligerents in current wars might also be included in our nuclear market 
survey. There are today between 30 and 40 armed conflicts in the world. Driven 
by historic hatred or religious extremists, ethnic cleansing and other 
atrocities characterize the fighting. Ethnic foes are easily dehumanized; I 
have no doubt that had the bombers of the World Trade Center in New York 
somehow possessed a nuclear weapon, they would have detonated it.  
</P>
<P>
 But even those we label terrorist often operate under self-imposed 
constraints. They have always had the capacity to kill more people than they 
do, but generally, they have not done so because they fear it might alienate 
constituents, cause too much public revulsion and provoke government crackdowns 
with popular support. 
</P>
<P>
 To say that some fanatic might use a nuclear weapon if he had one handy does 
not make a market. Beyond fanaticism and hatred, terrorist buyers of nuclear 
materiel would also require enormous financial resources, organization, 
international connections, operational autonomy, scientific know-how and total 
security. The effort to obtain the materiel and fabricate a device would 
require months, possibly years. Applying these criteria makes it hard to 
identify a qualified buyer among today's terrorist groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized crime might meet the organizational criteria, but the motives would 
be primarily economic. And unlike cocaine, there is no ready market for 
plutonium. It is hard to imagine the Sicilian Mafia or Japan's Yakuza resorting 
to nuclear weapons as a means of extortion or deterrent to the police. 
Organized crime is more likely to buy nuclear materiel to sell it, which brings 
us back to the question. Who are the ultimate buyers? 
</P>
<P>
 Selling plutonium can be compared to selling a stolen Rembrandt masterpiece -- 
the goods are hot, the buyers few. We have no evidence that any terrorists ever 
sought to acquire nuclear weapons. Although terrorism has become bloodier as 
terrorists increasingly resort to more indiscriminate attacks, principally car 
bombs, there is no inexorable trend toward weapons of mass destruction.

SUSAN SMITH'S BITTER LEGACY; RACE: PREJUDICE CONTINUES TO FUEL MISCONCEPTIONS 
ABOUT CRIME, CRIMINALS AND VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA TUCKER, Cynthia Tucker is editorial-page editor of the Atlanta 
Constitution. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years to come, the name Susan Smith will be shorthand for deteriorating 
family structures, the loss of innocence in small-town America, infanticide. 
And, despite her family's forthright apology for her lie, she will also be a 
symbol of our failure as a nation -- a failure that belongs to all of us, white 
or black or brown -- to bring clearheadedness to the subject of crime and race. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Union, S.C., mother had favorable winds to carry her tale of a black 
man who stole her car and her children. Her story struck a chord across 
America, in households black and white. The evening news has left many 
Americans with the impression that black men routinely steal cars at gunpoint, 
even if small children are passengers. When Smith's story unraveled, that, too, 
struck a chord, but only in black households. Black experience has taught that 
black men can be accused of -- sometimes executed for -- crimes they did not 
commit. Her lie reinforced a widespread belief among blacks that whites find 
blacks a convenient scapegoat for all problems. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many misconceptions held by Americans of all colors about crime and 
the criminal-justice system, it is no wonder that the nation has had little 
success at curbing violence. Hard facts and solutions are given short shrift in 
an atmosphere thick with wrongheaded assumptions and blind prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 In an exhaustive analysis published last June, Money magazine highlighted the 
gap between beliefs about crime and the facts about crime. One common 
misconception is that violent crime -- murder, rape, armed robbery, aggravated 
assault -- is soaring. According to Justice Department statistics, violent 
crime peaked in the early 1980s and has decreased a bit since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Other misconceptions abound: More than half of those in the magazine's poll 
believed that blacks commit most crimes. Statistics dispute that. Whites commit 
about 54% of crimes; blacks, 45%. Many Americans believe incorrectly that 
blacks often target white victims. In fact, most crime is intraracial: In 1992, 
blacks were responsible for only 21% of the crimes against white victims. In 
that same year, whites were responsible for only 7% of the crimes committed 
against black victims. Regardless of their race, all Americans agree that there 
is too much violent crime in this country. But we are helpless to curb it until 
we come to terms with the facts. We cannot fight crime with hysteria. 
Unfortunately, recent elections gave us only that. Candidates pandered to our 
basest instincts, promising a prison on every corner and a guillotine in every 
town square. They refused to be honest about the enormous cost to taxpayers of 
ever-expanding prison construction and the waste of sending to prison 
nonviolent offenders who might be rehabilitated.  
</P>
<P>
 But some critics of anti-crime demagoguery offered a shortsightedness of their 
own. Self-appointed black leaders refused to acknowledge the carnage that 
violent black criminals inflict on poor black neighborhoods, denouncing even 
well-crafted proposals to keep the most violent criminals behind bars. Afraid 
of acknowledging black crime to a country in racial backlash, they also refused 
to be honest.  
</P>
<P>
 Our streets and homes are littered with the victims of that dishonesty.

NHL NEGOTIATORS TALK, BUT THAT'S ALL; HOCKEY: LITTLE PROGRESS MADE IN LABOR 
DISPUTE, DESPITE REPORTS THAT SIDES HAVE SOFTENED THEIR STANCES.

 The fate of the NHL season remained uncertain Thursday, after a meeting 
between representatives of the league and the players' association produced no 
indication that they had resolved their major differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports that they had moved closer to a deal that would result in the season 
starting Dec. 1 were contradicted by Bob Goodenow, the NHLPA's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, no significant progress was made," he said after the 
seven-hour session in Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiators agreed to speak by phone today and will discuss whether to 
convene this weekend or early next week. Goodenow was to brief players on the 
negotiations Thursday, before the start of a three-game charity exhibition 
tournament in Hamilton, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks, which appeared to reach a stalemate last week, took an optimistic 
turn Monday after sources among owners and players said meaningful compromises 
had been made. Players reportedly had agreed to accept an entry-level salary 
system and limited salary arbitration in exchange for more liberal free agency. 
Owners were said to be ready to drop their payroll levy proposal, which players 
had rejected as a salary restraint, and were prepared to restore most of the 
economic rollbacks they imposed Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 However, roadblocks remain, including the players' demand to be paid in full 
this season, regardless of the number of games missed. Owners, whose revenue 
has been reduced by the cancellation of six home games each, are balking at 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said owners also don't consider the players' acceptance of an 
entry-level salary structure enough compensation for dropping the levy and will 
ask for other concessions. Owners also have not restored game rosters to 18 
skaters and two goalies from 17 and two, a cut instituted during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 As the lockout began its 42nd day, player agent Rich Winter announced plans to 
create a new league if the season is wiped out.

WISCONSIN'S MOSS JAILED FOR COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wisconsin tailback Brent Moss, the 1994 Rose Bowl most valuable player who is 
on the verge of breaking the school's career rushing mark, was suspended from 
the team Thursday after his arrest on a cocaine possession charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss was jailed early Thursday after an anti-drug task force pulled him over 
and reportedly found two rocks of crack cocaine in one of his socks. 
</P>
<P>
 No formal charges were filed by the Dane County District Attorney's Office, 
but officials said no bail would be available to Moss before his first court 
appearance, tentatively set for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss was placed in an isolation cell at his request and spent Thursday 
conferring with lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am shocked with Brent's apparent involvement in this matter," said 
Wisconsin Coach Barry Alvarez, who suspended his star senior "pending a legal 
resolution." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very difficult day. I feel as if it was one of my own children," 
Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss' teammates were also troubled by his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as though you have a brother that's done something that isn't supposed 
to be done," senior offensive lineman Joe Rudolph said.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BOND YIELDS RISE AS DOW DROPS 9.76 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Treasury market reversed course Thursday, with bond yields ending higher 
after initially retreating on news of an unexpected plunge in October wholesale 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks closed lower on the higher bond rates and concern over the possibility 
of tax cuts and a larger federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market setback suggested that bearishness runs deep among 
fixed-income investors. After weeks of economic data indicating an uptick in 
inflation, players apparently decided that one more set of statistics would not 
deter the Federal Reserve from an expected hike in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose to 8.15% from 8.11% 
Wednesday. Its price, which falls when yields rise, ended down 7/16 point, or 
$4.38 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended 9.76 points lower at 3,821.99. Big 
Board volume totaled 282.10 million shares, down from Wednesday's 337.89 
million. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 5 to 3 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department's report of a 0.5% plunge in the producer price index in 
October initially surprised Wall Street analysts, who had expected a modest 
increase of around 0.2% in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The news reassured some investors and traders following weeks of reports that 
the economy grew robustly into the fourth quarter, suggesting higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds pay a fixed rate of return and tend to decline in price when inflation 
rises. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some market players decided the wholesale inflation news was mixed. 
Excluding auto, energy and food prices, the rate would have increased 0.1%, 
roughly within expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Also pressuring the bond market were reports that Wall Street dealers who had 
bought new three- and 10-year notes in Treasury auctions this week exploited 
the early rally to sell the securities and take profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks shot up nearly 30 points in the morning after the unexpected drop in 
producer prices. The rally halted, however, pulled down by rising bond yields, 
when Texas Republican Bill Archer, incoming chairman of the House Ways and 
Means Committee, said he favors cutting taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 His comments raised concerns of a larger budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 A weakening of computer stocks depressed broad-market indexes, which are 
heavily weighted toward technology issues. The NYSE's composite index fell 0.66 
point to 254.35. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 1.03 points to 
464.37. The Nasdaq composite index slid 2.87 points to 764.38. 
</P>
<P>
 Among individual issues: 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico dropped 4 3/4 to 51 1/4 in U.S. trading after AT&T Corp. 
Wednesday unveiled a $1-billion telecommunications joint venture with Mexican 
industrial group Grupo Alfa. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sears, Roebuck jumped 2 3/4 to 51 5/8 on news that it plans to divest its 
80.1% stake in Allstate Corp. to shareholders. Allstate slipped 3/4 to 24 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Semiconductor stocks fell after the industry's book-to-bill ratio fell 
October. Texas Instruments lost 2 to 76 3/4, Micron Technology fell 1 1/4 to 39 
5/8 and Intel dipped 1/8 to 61 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Genentech shares fell after the company said it was the target of a widened 
government inquiry, then recovered amid speculation of a buyout by parent 
company Roche Holdings Inc. Genentech shares ended down 1 3/4 at 46 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * First Alert tumbled 1 7/8 to 17 1/8 after the company said it postponed a 
public offering. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mail-order retailer Lands' End Inc. shed 1 3/8 to 16 7/8 on disappointing 
third-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks closed mostly lower in overseas trading. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei 
average ended off 159.03 points at 19,264.85. In Europe, the Frankfurt DAX 
30-share average closed at 2,082.40, down 14.07 points, while London's 
Financial Times 100-share average gained 3.9 points to finish at 3,103.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the dollar finished higher against most major currencies, closing 
at 1.530 German marks in New York, up from 1.5273 Wednesday. It fell to 97.78 
Japanese yen from 97.81.

POETIC JUSTICE; HEATHER MCHUGH AND DAVID ST. JOHN HAVE LABORED IN OBSCURITY ON 
THE WEST COAST FOR YEARS.BUT NOT ANY LONGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just how poetic is the life of the poet? 
</P>
<P>
 For a modern-day bard, poet Kenneth Rexroth summed it up quite succinctly: 
"Against the ruin of the world, there is only one defense -- the creative act." 
</P>
<P>
 Fine-tuning the precise architecture of the long line, intricately crafting 
little worlds -- literary dioramas -- the best of poets magnify the briefest of 
passing moments, dissect the most minute exchange. The prize: the larger, 
lasting value. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the greater world, the pursuit of poetry in this day and age at best 
appears noble; at the other end, charmingly anachronistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Voices that historically have spoken for entire societies, or been lauded as 
the filament inciting movements, nowadays seldom reap the grand rewards of the 
best-seller list. And even with the hot revival of the cafe poetry movement, 
the quaint world of the poet still appears remote and rarefied. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, far from the East Coast literary locus, poets David St. John of 
USC and Heather McHugh, currently of UCLA, might beg to differ. In their 
creative act, they have raged and won. 
</P>
<P>
 They are two of the five nominees for this year's National Book Award in 
poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 McHugh, 46, is visiting professor at UCLA this quarter, part of her Milliman 
Writer-in-Residence position at the University of Washington in Seattle. She is 
a finalist for her collection "Hinge & Sign -- Poems, 1968-1993" (Wesleyan/New 
England, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Editor of the Antioch Review, St. John, 45, grew up in Fresno and is a 
professor of creative writing at USC, where he has taught for eight years. 
Awarded fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the John Simon 
Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, as well as the Prix de Rome Fellowship in 
Literature, St. John is nominated for his collection "Study for the World's 
Body" (HarperCollins, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 The honor further animates two hale careers, both would agree. For West Coast 
poets in the margins, it is more than simply another tasteful validation of 
their accomplishments, and the importance of their addition to the canon. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Book Awards, to be presented in black-tie pomp Wednesday at New 
York's Plaza Hotel, are known among literati as the Oscars of the publishing 
world. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 But all the fuss upsets the orderly quiet of the writing life -- the silent 
room, the good pen, the blank page. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is something very unlike a poet's life," cracks McHugh, 
sitting in a Westwood Cafe with a bag of manuscripts the size of a week's worth 
of groceries, periodically eyeing election returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "You spend your life sort of eavesdropping. That is, you get to be the one at 
the next table who has kind impulses, or will not use the information in any 
damaging way, but is very curious about how human being is. That, for me, was 
the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 McHugh remembers. "I was incredibly shy. I never talked until I was 16. 
Finally, in senior high school in English class, I said something . . . and 
then just what I feared happened," she pauses, eyes opened wide behind 
teal-framed glasses. "Everybody turned around and looked. The dream was really 
to be invisible and love the visible at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 That attention startles even those less easily rattled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of all I've been really stunned by the response from other poets," says 
David St. John over a whistling Santa Monica wind and steaming cup of 
cappuccino at a sidewalk cafe hidden on the quieter fringes of Main Street. His 
voice is soft, yet textured. A good storytelling voice. A lover of words, he 
carefully enunciates each syllable, sparingly lending those with more import 
the assistance of his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Notes from poets. People I know casually and haven't heard from in many years 
just saying that they wanted me to know how important my work had always been 
to them . . . writers who I like, but haven't talked to. . . . Just that they 
would take that time and make that gesture, that the work has presence and 
relevance, is really the most important thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although St. John fancies the erotic tension crackling through interpersonal 
relationships ("What goes on between men and women in this world fascinates me 
endlessly"), much of the work found in the earlier pages of "Study" wades 
through the taut emotional landscape of loss and abandonment -- tests the 
limits of memory. The page becomes emulsion, slowly resurrects the form of a 
person, or a fragment of remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
 But what might at face seem simply a tango of want and need is inhabited by 
much more. The muted power of the particular was something that St. John 
explored at the prestigious Iowa Writers Workshop. Beyond the architecture of 
language, or workshop-speak, St. John began to understand something about the 
soul that informs the vessel -- the soul being the poet; the vessel, the verse. 
</P>
<P>
 An International Writers Workshop, also at Iowa, brought St. John into contact 
with authors who temporarily re-rooted their lives, arriving from Africa, 
Europe, South America with their trunks, poems and life stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from exotic tales of struggle on distant terrain, what most impressed 
him was a maturity of expression that St. John hadn't noted in the poems that 
crossed his desk as editor of the Iowa Review, or in sessions for critique. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me it had been a window on the relationship between a kind of political 
consciousness and how it enters poetry in other cultures," says St. John. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also made me very impatient with a kind of political playacting of many 
American poets . . . seeing these men and women, say, from China or Eastern 
Europe, who knew that they were being spied on constantly. What was fascinating 
to me was . . . even when their work had no overt political agenda, it was so 
brilliantly an enactment of the voice of individuality and freedom. It really 
made me think twice about the American poets who had sort of put on a 
particular political attitude as if it were a coat that could be taken off and 
changed with whatever the political season or fashion was." 
</P>
<P>
 The encounter, St. John believes, drastically rewrote his ideas about 
"political" poetry, how the world is seen and how it is "made into language." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that happens is that poems have to be understood not as 
objects, but as experience. " 
</P>
<P>
 And thus, St. John has whittled away this artful distinction: A good poem "is 
a poem that enacts in language as if the page were its own little stage. 
Whatever its particular concern is. Nobody wants to be told about anything. 
Nobody wants to be told how to feel. . . . You have to allow the reader to be 
part of what it is that you are concerned about. To feel it themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its acute powers of revelation, the poet's voice, McHugh fears, 
resounds more like thunder on the wane. As she reflects in "Blue Streak": 
</P>
<P>
 And the poets,  
</P>
<P>
 who should have spoken for us, were busy  
</P>
<P>
 panning landscape, gunning  
</P>
<P>
 their electrics, going  
</P>
<P>
 I-I-I-I-I  
</P>
<P>
 But of the medium, she keeps her good humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I speak to classes, people always ask me, 'Where is poetry going?' -- To 
Chicago?" McHugh suggests with a laugh, then leans forward into the thought. 
Talk about language warms her, the thoughts shoot up in luminous images, 
metaphors -- like a film montage. As a poet, she says, "it's not about knowing, 
it's about being. You just become a recorder of being -- but being in its most 
affecting or most revealing moments." 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, poetry embodies the act of persistently taking a reader down 
foreign roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be startled is sort of what you want in the arts," says McHugh. "People 
come at it from different angles. People are startled when Michael Jordan does 
a great shot. It's the moment that the thing gets beyond us , when you get 
beyond yourself, and the reader participates in it. And that's why we like to 
read. To get beyond our limits." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of stretching the limits is learning to broaden our definitions and 
perceptions of poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans are sentimental by nature and poetry can get quite sentimental," 
she observes. "That is almost the lay person's view of what poetry is. It 
accompanies the Whitman Sampler. The poems I like least are the poems that want 
to say: 'This is a sweet world. . . .' It's like singles ads: 100 people 
saying, 'I want the only other person on Earth who likes candle-lit dinners, 
wine by the fireplace and a walk on the beach.' To me that's boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interesting thing to me is the thing a person sees that no one else can 
see. For me that's the fresh, informing moment. But how to discover that in us? 
I'm really interested in the strangeness. The strangeness of being alive. Not 
the thing I want to hear. Not the Good Heaven. I'm more interested in the 
strange because it strikes me as probably truer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The craft survives, pushes on in various guises, as does the impetus fueling 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are purists who wring their hands at the very suggestion of the 
scruffy, rough-and-tumble cafe poetry scene with its poetry slams and open 
mikes, that tenacity St. John sees as prime evidence of the written word's 
fluidity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of friends who really object to the coffeehouse scene . . . who 
feel that it is just sort of an exercise in indulgence," says St. John. "My own 
feeling is . . . I'm for any occasion when people try to join what they're 
thinking and feeling to language." 
</P>
<P>
 St. John translates it as a coming-of-age process: The journey toward 
self-discovery should include pressing toward new language "that's separate 
from the official language they've been given by their culture and their 
parents." The problem is, "the way we use language in our daily lives is 
completely pragmatic and it is also reductive, and it's therefore antithetical 
to everything poetry wants to do. The world is frozen by its names." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from breaking down artificial barriers, distinctions, if a poet has a 
singular mission, it is this: "To free the world from the names that have 
petrified it. This is what a poem is. A poem is a little model of 
consciousness. It's how someone sees the world made in language. 
</P>
<P>
 "And so that is what I try to tell (my students). What we don't have, 
especially in our culture, is a vocabulary to talk about the things that matter 
to us most. So it's trying to help these students begin to locate . . . a kind 
of poetic language and poetic voice, that they can begin to represent some idea 
of themselves that is themselves."

AROUND TOWN: PIZZA AND JUSTICE FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The trial lasted one hour, including five minutes for jury deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors were seated instantly, without a challenge. Of course, as the judge 
observed, they were "pre-selected for their fairness and good attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 The charge: Petty theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The venue: a moot courtroom at Southwestern University School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to demystify the courts. So, Southwestern had invited gifted 
third-, fourth- and fifth-graders from Hoover Elementary, its adopted school 
and mid-Wilshire neighbor, to come on over. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a tour of the law library, where librarian David McFadden explained 
petty theft versus grand theft in accessible terms: Steal a marble, it's petty. 
Steal a diamond, it's grand. 
</P>
<P>
 "C'mon, gang," said McFadden, leading the way to a video monitor where the 
kids would see a film of a real petty theft trial. 
</P>
<P>
 A cultural faux pas. These are inner-city kids, and they wanted him to know 
they're not a gang. McFadden regrouped -- "C'mon, group. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters arrived wearing name tags designating them as judges, 
prosecutors, defense attorneys, witnesses or jurors. They were to be key 
players in a mock trial. 
</P>
<P>
 First, lunch. Over pizza and Pepsi, they met the Southwestern students 
assigned parallel roles for this trial, mentors for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Norman Garland, who would be presiding judge at the trial, introduced 
himself as a former criminal defense lawyer, "like Johnnie Cochran or (Robert) 
Shapiro," and a onetime deputy district attorney, "kind of like Marcia Clark 
without a skirt." This, the kids related to. 
</P>
<P>
 Could anyone define a juror's job? A hand shot up: A jury decides "whether 
someone goes to jail or whether they get to come home and play." 
</P>
<P>
 Be on the lookout for suspicious goings-on, the witnesses were told. Sure 
enough, two young men -- one with a ponytail, one with a beard -- were soon 
skulking about the room, touching purses. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman burst in, screaming, "Oh, my God! My purse was stolen!" 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects fled, but within minutes were apprehended by "police" 
(Southwestern security guard Nelson Kelly) and delivered, handcuffed together. 
</P>
<P>
 In the courtroom, Judge Garland called the proceedings to order and the 
"defendant," law student Charles Hausman, was brought in, having shed T-shirt 
and jeans for coat and tie. (The second defendant was tried in another room.) 
</P>
<P>
 The bench was a bit crowded, Garland sharing it with three black-robed 
helpers: fifth-graders Danny Chung and Rosalba Mendez and law student Carlotta 
Serna. Said Garland, "This is the first case in the history of the state of 
California to have four eminent judges sitting. . . . Mr. Hausman, you're a 
lucky man." 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement, "prosecutor" Jordan Thomas, a law student, warned 
jurors the defense was "going to try to convince you that what people saw 
wasn't real." 
</P>
<P>
 Lead "defense attorney" Paris Sahba, also a law student, was undaunted, 
reminding jurors that "nobody actually saw (her client) take the purse." 
</P>
<P>
 Time for testimony. "Ms. Witness," said the judge, asking fourth-grader Katy 
Hernandez to step forward. She solemnly testified that she'd seen Hausman 
"running out of the room." 
</P>
<P>
 With more than a little prodding from Thomas, his assistant prosecutors, 
fifth-grader Steve Cubias and fourth-grader Elvira Martinez, grilled the 
witness: 
</P>
<P>
 How long was Mr. Hausman in the room? What did you see him doing? 
</P>
<P>
 During questioning of the victim (law student Adrienne Liebman) and other 
witnesses, the youngest attorneys were a bit atypical. The judge had to remind 
one, "I can't hear you with your hands over your mouth." Another was too shy to 
ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizza played a major role. Professing innocence, Hausman swore that all that 
walking around the lunchroom was just to help himself to more pizza. "I eat a 
lot of pizza." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Garland: "How much did you eat?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Five pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Courtroom giggles. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the moment of decision. Approaching the ladies and gentlemen of the 
jury, defender Sahba reminded them no one had seen Hausman take the purse. "Mr. 
Hausman just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 A smoke screen, countered prosecutor Thomas. "If it walks like a duck, if it 
quacks like a duck, it's a duck." 
</P>
<P>
 With a few words about presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt, the 
judge dispatched the nine jurors to deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not guilty," said one, then pleaded, "Can I go to the bathroom?" It was 8-1 
for acquittal. Told he was the lone holdout, Sean Monteagudo burst into tears. 
(Later, his teachers assured him it's OK to stick to one's guns.) 
</P>
<P>
 A hung jury. The judge pondered that, then dismissed the case and released the 
defendant. "Insufficient evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 To the kids he said, "See you in law school in 12 years. . . ." Tearful 
Farewell 
</P>
<P>
 The party guests were a who's-who of those who once lived on the meanest of 
city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 They'd gathered in LAMP Village, a onetime warehouse on Skid Row to say goodby 
to Mollie Lowery, who for almost a decade had given hope and a home to these 
homeless mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, 48, is headed for Blythe and new challenges: working at a shelter for 
battered women, raising llamas and leading llama packing tours into the Eastern 
Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 Tears flowed as freely as the sparkling cider in the LAMP family -- the staff 
and guests, as Lowery unfailingly calls those who have found refuge at LAMP's 
three facilities for days or years. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiny "Yeah, Mollie" balloons floated above tables. Emcee Seamus Kenny of the 
LAMP staff set the tone, inviting one and all to "just come up and do or say 
whatever you want to say or do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on a folding chair, hands on his knees, Robert Hall faced the crowded 
room and sang, unwaveringly and a cappella, "Bridge Over Troubled Water." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, 41, has called LAMP home since 1984, when he came from Cleveland seeking 
a better life. Alcohol and drugs have been his demons. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Byrd Sr., 45, told of finding LAMP more than a decade ago: "I was 
living in a parking lot behind a church."  
</P>
<P>
 Lowery didn't give him a handout, he said. "She gave me a hand up." He told 
her, "I love you very much." Then they hugged. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanika Martin, 23, who came two years ago from Indiana, told Lowery, "I can't 
look at you right now because I'll probably cry." Her song, sung sweetly: "The 
Way We Were." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes, about the going-away gift. Lowery's "family" had collected $600 for a 
certificate redeemable for one llama.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: AVALON GIVES OTHER SEDANS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a simpatico, fresh, very casual California feel to this new and large 
sedan from Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
 * The sound system has sufficient suction to tug jazz, cool and Monterey 
smooth, to Woodland Hills from KLON in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * A sun roof adds God's light and the smell of warm beaches and coastal 
chowder joints to dawdling drives along Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 * And they call this car Avalon in obvious tribute to the lolling, idyllic 
ways of Santa Catalina. (A pox on mythologists who might remember Avalon as 
King Arthur's fantasy island for his fallen knights. Club Med for the dead, as 
it were.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although long awaited, the 1995 Toyota Avalon isn't quite what most people 
were waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
 Tweaked by leaks, teased by spy photos, warped by our needle-sharp views on 
What Toyota Needs to Do to Sell Cars, we presumed a huge, six-passenger sedan 
from Japan ready to do a Dracula on the hydraulic jugulars of Ford's Crown 
Victoria or Buick's Roadmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 What we will be examining in showrooms next week is a cannily engineered sedan 
with the external dimensions of an American mid-size but the internal room of a 
large car. Large, that is, by Japanese standards -- which is Infiniti Q45 or 
Lexus LS400 large. 
</P>
<P>
 Built on an extended Camry platform, the Avalon will have room for six 
travelers -- although shoulder pads will scrunch and all will certainly be 
closer friends, possibly even engaged, by the end of long trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Shades of yore and polished polyester backsides, the Avalon will be sold with 
an optional bench front seat -- a first for Asian sedans. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Toyota is betting 70% of new Avalowners will want cushioned buckets 
rather than little sofas that stir thoughts of the '50s and plaid seat covers 
in McTavish vinyl. 
</P>
<P>
 And instead of the 260-horsepower V-8 and rear-drive of a Detroit-built 
Belchfire GTO, the Avalon is powered by a 192-horsepower V-6 -- another 
transfer from the successful Camry -- spinning the front wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for Avalon's threat to the Oldsmobile Ninety Eight. 
</P>
<P>
 What it does menace is just about anything else with four doors in the 
American mainstream. Be it import or domestic; Maxima, Mazda or Toyota's own 
Camry. Be it Buick LeSabre, Pontiac Bonneville; even the new and lusty 
Concorde, Intrepid and Vision triplets from Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Avalon performs the role of a fleet of cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Four inches longer, also a little wider and taller than the Camry, it has 
enough size for marrieds with children and doting grandparents. It will purr 
around town at peace with all, but has enough power and sophisticated handling 
to growl and snarl at the very thought of Mulholland. In traffic, with someone 
mischievous at the wheel, it is a whispering predator. 
</P>
<P>
 The car looks, feels and smells horribly expensive yet prices start at 
$22,758. Even when loaded with everything Beverly Hills might desire -- 
including leather seats and a 12-disc CD player -- the sticker stays below 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction and assembly are Japanese tight, which means optimum levels of 
comfort and security of ride; fit and finish is as good as it gets without 
spending $60,000 and speaking German; the technology of anti-lock brakes and 
the safety of dual air bags are available; and noise of travel, vibration and 
harshness are virtually nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 In an expression: This is a rare car that delivers everything without a driver 
ever being conscious of the mechanics that make it all happen. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also an interesting marketing dynamic involved here. Avalon finally 
gives a generation of 40-plusers raised on Japanese cars something Asian and 
sizable to leap up to. 
</P>
<P>
 In college they drove boxes fortune cookies came in. Usually yellow Honda 
600s. Their first jobs brought zippy sports cars. Maybe a Datsun 240Z. 
Marriage, families and sedan years usually meant Nissan Maxima, Mazda 626, 
Toyota Camry or Honda Accord. 
</P>
<P>
 But where to go from there? Especially for those spoiled rotten by Japanese 
reliability, economy and general superiority of product. 
</P>
<P>
 Many swallowed pride and went shopping for an American cruiser, which probably 
helped Oldsmobile and Buick stay in business. Others munched the bullet, found 
a job for the spouse, canceled the kid's first semester at Stanford, and paid 
$35,000 or more for something sizable by Lexus, Infiniti or Acura. 
</P>
<P>
 But now comes Avalon, and with it the alternative of stepping up, moving back 
or pricing down to a full-size six-seater that wasn't whelped in Michigan. 
Although it should be noted that Avalon is built in another center dedicated to 
thoroughbred horsepower: Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Aimed at those who place family values above Charles and Di and Camilla, 
styling of the Avalon is safe to the point of a stifled yawn. It will be 
mistaken for a Camry redux or a mid-range Lexus, but never a breakaway from 
today's dedication to wraparound this and flush-mounted that, with a high, 
short trunk and a longer, lower nose. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior is much lovelier. 
</P>
<P>
 Not owning a pair of salmon bell-bottoms, we were given an Avalon XLS with 
leather-covered buckets as a test car. The chairs supported and cushioned 
without once becoming an intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the charm of Avalon. Like the perfect butler who performs without 
announcing a presence, so do the bits and functions of this sedan, from turn 
signals to overdrive disengage, make things happen without clacking and 
fussing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Avalon, one will never reach for the brake release and pop the hood 
because some doofus set the handles too close. Stretch the left foot and there, 
precisely where it should be, is the dead pedal. Nothing about controlling this 
car requires a grope, a long reach, small contortion or a hard thought, day or 
night. And such is the stuff of ergonomic theses. 
</P>
<P>
 Doors are balanced perfectly, even with the car parked uphill. It has a soft 
interior with calm and elegance provided by quality materials and flowing 
design, not "Star Trek" styling and walnut that came out of an injection mold. 
Despite the air bag, the horn button is in the center of the steering wheel 
ever awaiting the pounding fist. No matter the stalk, lever, handle, button, 
switch or knob, it seems built to the Toyota heritage of surviving several 
million cycles between now and 2023. 
</P>
<P>
 There's back-seat room for three without risking dried mousse on the 
headliner. Handling is nimble yet stable. And we tried very, very hard to fault 
this car. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the only sedan, said Mrs. Dean, that could separate She Who Will Be 
Obeyed from Henrietta, her Honda Accord coupe. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographer Con Keyes returned from a photo shoot wondering how cum he spent 
so much on a Lexus? 
</P>
<P>
 Only one gripe has substance. The horn is pretty puny for a car of this 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter. Just just add Avalon to the Mercedes C280, Mitsubishi 3000GT, 
Lexus SC300 and BMW 530i on a realistic short list of pleasantly priced, 
attainable cars we'd most like to be left alone with on European highways. 1995 
Toyota Avalon XLS 
</P>
<P>
 The Good: Large, six-passenger step-up car for those with Japanese car habit. 
Sensibly priced challenge to Lexus, Infiniti, Acura. New benchmark in 
smoothness, quietness, unhurried high performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bad: Overcautious styling. Needs a Buick horn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ugly: Not there. 1995 Toyota Avalon XLS 
</P>
<P>
 Cost 
</P>
<P>
 As tested, $29,798 (Includes optional leather bucket seats, 12-disc CD player, 
power moon roof. Also standard anti-lock brakes, two air bags, automatic air 
conditioning, power seat and windows, automatic transmission, aluminum wheels, 
keyless entry and theft deterrent.) 
</P>
<P>
 Engine: 3.0 liter, 24-valve, four-cam V-6 developing 192 horsepower.

 Vivien Straus is promoting organic milk in returnable glass bottles -- a 
product that offers a double benefit to the environment -- but is having 
trouble getting the concept across in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people hear the phrase organic dairy, they somehow get the wrong image," 
she says. "They think it might be rotting or imperfect in some way -- something 
weird left over from hippies and the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 Her family, who run the Straus Family Creamery in Marshall (60 miles north of 
San Francisco), introduced the new line last February. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going great guns in the Bay Area, but just starting to get accepted in 
Southern California," says Straus, the only family member who lives in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Strauses have been farming -- and environmentalists -- for 50 years. "My 
parents, William and Ellen Straus, were involved in founding the Marin 
Agricultural Land Trust to encourage small farmers to stay in agriculture 
instead of selling out to developers," Straus says. 
</P>
<P>
 But family farms are struggling these days, so the Strauses decided to find a 
niche. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no simple matter to convert their 660 acres and 215 cows to an organic 
dairy, says Straus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't use any hormones to increase milk production, we haven't used 
chemical fertilizers on our land for years, we don't use antibiotics in our 
milking herds (sick cows get aspirin and homeopathic remedies) and the cows eat 
only certified organic feeds." 
</P>
<P>
 The family built a bottling plant for environmental reasons and because they 
believe milk tastes better in glass than in plastic or waxed paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a deposit on the bottle. We're getting 90% return, and people love 
the taste of the milk," says Straus. 
</P>
<P>
 The creamery sells nonfat and whole milk at health food stores, such as Mrs. 
Gooch's. At $1.59 to $1.69 a quart (plus $1 for the first bottle deposit) the 
milk is more expensive than its non-organic competitors, but considering the 
growing interest in healthy eating, the Straus family thinks they're on the 
cutting edge. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first organic dairy in California (there are only a handful in the 
country), the Straus enterprise will be featured on "Green Means," the 
prize-winning PBS series about ordinary people whose activities are making 
positive contributions to the environment.

THE GOODS; WRAP UP THE SAVINGS; IF HOLIDAY SHOPPING SOCKS IT TO YOUR BUDGET, 
HERE ARE SOME TIPS TO KEEP YOUR BANK ACCOUNT OUT OF THE RED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Dara Duguay recalls dashing out for last-minute shopping two days before 
Christmas last year. "There were four people in line ahead of me, and each one 
tried to pay with a Visa card and each one was denied because the credit was 
overextended." 
</P>
<P>
 Duguay wasn't surprised. She is education director of the Consumer Credit 
Counseling Service and January is the nonprofit agency's busiest month, as 
people start picking up the pieces after overspending on the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our counseling schedule is just packed in January and February," Duguay says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a similar story at the Los Angeles County Department of Consumer Affairs, 
says director Pastor Herrera Jr. "People who don't make holiday budgets 
invariably spend too much," he says. "We start getting calls a few weeks after 
Christmas from consumers saying they overextended their credit and hadn't 
expected to get laid off, or thought they could work extra hours, but aren't 
able to. They're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 To help holiday spenders out before they get in trouble, his department has 
issued a "News Alert Holiday Shopping Tip Sheet." 
</P>
<P>
 Duguay's counseling service, which has 13 offices throughout Los Angeles 
County, has gone even further and organized workshops on "Surviving the 
Holidays." "We'd had a lot of requests from companies who say the garnishment 
and bill collector phone calls start coming to employees right after the first 
of the year," Duguay says. As a response, last fall the agency developed a 
program to help consumers get through the holidays without overspending. "It 
was a huge success," she says, "so this year we enlarged and refined it." 
</P>
<P>
 The two consumer experts offer these strategies for balancing holiday 
generosity with common sense: 
</P>
<P>
 * Credit Cards. "If you buy on credit, be sure you understand all of the terms 
of your credit agreement, especially how much you must pay," Herrera says. "You 
could end up paying twice the price of the item." 
</P>
<P>
 If you buy $1,000 worth of gifts on credit and only make the minimum payments, 
you will be paying for this Christmas or Hanukkah eight years from now, Duguay 
points out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sit down and decide how long you want to be in debt," she says. "Review your 
credit-card balance before you start, set a budget and stick to it." 
</P>
<P>
 She suggests that shoppers carry only one or two credit cards. Wrap each one 
in a piece of paper and each time you use it, write down the amount. Compare 
the running total to your holiday budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Shopping: "Overspending on gifts is a basic problem," Duguay says. And yet, 
"in our workshops, when people are asked to recall the gifts that meant the 
most to them, they almost always mention gifts that took time to think about, 
not just money." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the areas we are very concerned about," says Herrera, "is the 
importance of asking the store about the refund policy, especially when you are 
buying clothes as gifts. Don't assume the store will refund an item -- many 
don't. And keep all your receipts and warranties." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't push yourself to finish shopping if you're tired. When you're so 
exhausted, you just want to get out of there and go home and you tend to buy 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep a shopping diary during the holidays and note when you buy and what mood 
triggered your purchase. We tend to overspend when we are tired, angry or 
nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
 Limit the number of gifts to children, and don't feel guilty about saying "no" 
to them. Set up a budget with your children to show them that money is finite. 
</P>
<P>
 Re-examine purchases before buying, and put back the ones that aren't on your 
list or are too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wrapping: "A lot of people overspend here, especially by using the gift-wrap 
service of a department store. It is handy, but costly," Duguay says. 
</P>
<P>
 Buy gift sacks that can be reused. Paper holiday tablecloths are also good for 
wrapping large gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Buy holiday wrappings and cards after the holidays for next year. You can save 
more than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Traditions: "The best replacement for excessive gift-buying is meaningful 
activities. If you don't have any family traditions, create some," says Duguay, 
such as making decorations, going to a holiday concert or ballet, baking 
cookies for friends or having a family potluck. 
</P>
<P>
 * More Tips: Begin shopping in January of next year to take advantage of 
after-Christmas sales. Continue to buy gifts all year and store them in a gift 
drawer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Compare UPS and Postal Service rates to send gifts by the most inexpensive 
method. Plan enough time to avoid overnight or express shipping. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give gifts to adults on New Year's Day to take advantage of after-Christmas 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Recognize the warning signs of too much debt. Are you running out of money 
before the next payday and starting to use credit cards for everyday expenses 
such as gas or groceries? Are you using credit-card advances to pay your bills? 
Are you borrowing from family or friends? These are common warning signs. So 
are receiving past-due notices or creditor phone calls. If you are overloaded, 
it's time to cut back your spending, not add to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surviving the Holidays" is offered free to companies and organizations, lasts 
about an hour and a half, and includes props and handouts for making lists and 
budgets. Information: (213) 368-4587. 
</P>
<P>
 The free shopping-tip sheet may be ordered from the Los Angeles County 
Department of Consumer Affairs, 500 W. Temple St., Room B-96, Los Angeles, 
Calif. 90012. Think Before You Buy 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes holidays turn into a runaway shopping spree because people have lost 
sight of what they want from the celebration, says the Consumer Credit 
Counseling Service. To help restore a sense of direction, the "Surviving the 
Holidays" workshops include this exercise: 
</P>
<P>
 "Read and prioritize the following value statements, crossing off those that 
have no importance for you and adding any that do have meaning. Remember, there 
are no right or wrong answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suggestion: Do this with your family and significant others. First have 
everyone fill out one of these questionnaires. Then sit down and discuss what 
you have written. Use the information and discussion to formulate a holiday 
plan that addresses, as much as possible, each person's needs and desires. Rank 
the importance of each one, using 1 as the most important." 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday season is a time: 
</P>
<P>
 * to be a peacemaker in the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * to be a peacemaker in the family. 
</P>
<P>
 * to enjoy being with my family. 
</P>
<P>
 * to strengthen bonds with my family. 
</P>
<P>
 * to exchange gifts with my family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 * for parties, entertaining and visits with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 * to help those who are less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 * to create a beautiful home environment. 
</P>
<P>
 * to strengthen ties to the religious community. 
</P>
<P>
 * for relaxation and renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 * to celebrate the birth of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 * to celebrate the Festival of Lights. 
</P>
<P>
 * to celebrate Kwanzaa.

TECHNOWATCH: THE GOODS; NOT JUST A MERE TELEPHONE, BUT A WAY OF LIFE

<P>
 Is it possible the little black book could go the way of dinosaurs and 
eight-track tapes? 
</P>
<P>
 It is. PhoneMate Inc. in Torrance has just introduced the Electronic PhoneBook 
8775, a phone/answering machine/personal secretary that stores and dials up to 
200 pre-programmed names and phone numbers. And it answers the phone, takes 
messages and reminds you of important dates. 
</P>
<P>
 When you want to call a number you've stored, enter the first letters of the 
person's name and the machine will dial. The number -- up to 16 digits -- is 
automatically displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time you add a name to the directory, the Electronic PhoneBook 
automatically re-sorts all entries into alphabetical order. You can scroll the 
complete list at anytime. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8775's answering-machine function has an integrated speaker phone and a 
tapeless message with an operation that talks users through machine functions. 
It also has a voice that announces the time and day each message was received, 
and displays the number of messages. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're away from home, you can play, replay and save messages or change 
your greeting message from most touch-tone phones, pay phones and car phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Users also can record phone conversations or leave memos for themselves or 
other household members. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to worry about a power outage wiping out the system. The 8775 
has built-in protection for that, so it saves all messages, remote code 
settings, the message count and information in the Electronic PhoneBook for up 
to a month. 
</P>
<P>
 You can even program it to remember your wedding anniversary, but, sorry, you 
have to send the flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic PhoneBook 8775 ($169.95) is available in the Los Angeles area at 
Good Guys stores. In December it will be available nationally at selected 
electronic and department stores. No More Surprises at the Cash Register 
</P>
<P>
 It took 13 years, but Palmdale private investigator Gordon Sutton finally got 
his invention to market. It is Shopper's Helper, a unique calculator that 
attaches to the push bar of a shopping cart and keeps track of purchases, 
including tax, with the push of a couple of buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 It is simple to use, because, unlike regular calculators, there are no plus, 
equal or percent keys, or decimal point. Just put in the price of the item and 
the device adds it automatically. There is a correct key if you enter the wrong 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopper's Helper's tax key can be programmed for the amount of sales tax 
wherever you live and add it on automatically. There's also a MULT key for 
purchase of multiples of the same item. If shoppers are using discount coupons, 
the calculator will subtract those from the total as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-two Target stores in the Los Angeles area, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties and Las Vegas will begin test marketing Shopper's Helper for $9.95 by 
the end of the month. Or it is available from Sutton for $14.95, plus $2 
shipping and handling: Shopper's Helper, 1711 East Ave. R-3, Palmdale, Calif. 
93550; (805) 947-8773. A Gift for Those Who Like a Good Deal 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Industries' Automatic Card Shuffler is a reasonably priced, 
thoughtful gift for anyone who plays card games, and especially for people with 
arthritis who have trouble shuffling the deck. 
</P>
<P>
 With its automatic, push-button operation, the device can shuffle one or two 
decks completely and it operates on two C-size batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 This low-profile product has been sold in gift and specialty stores for 
several years, but has just recently hit the shelves of Toys 'R' Us and Service 
Merchandise nationally. It retails for $9.99.

INK: WRITING ON 'STAR TREK' AN ENTERPRISE IN ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After all these years, Leonard Nimoy is unsure why "Star Trek" still 
enthralls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to come at that question many times," says the man who was Spock. 
"There are a lot of factors: hope for the future, mankind survives, the 
teamwork of the characters, the avoidance of pandering and talking down to the 
audience, the scientific credibility. It all adds up to an interesting 
theatrical experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from bookstore shelves these days, the publishing industry is counting 
on the power of that experience to launch not only "Star Trek" novels and other 
tie-ins, but also cast members' stories. As the seventh "Star Trek" movie is 
prepared for release next week, three memoirs are competing for fans' attention 
as they offer views of squabbling on and off the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Star Trek Movie Memories" (HarperCollins) is William (Capt. Kirk) Shatner's 
off-camera look at the seven lucrative flicks about the Starship Enterprise. He 
draws on interviews with fellow cast members, as he did in writing the earlier 
"Star Trek Memories." 
</P>
<P>
 Nichelle (Lt. Uhura) Nichols writes in her new "Beyond Uhura" (Putnam) of an 
eventful career, which included work with Duke Ellington and a dramatic moment 
when Martin Luther King urged her to continue playing Uhura because he saw the 
character as a positive role model for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But she also fires at Shatner: "I'd witnessed Bill change from my hero to an 
insensitive, hurtful egotist and had seen his callousness affect everyone 
around him," she writes. 
</P>
<P>
 George (Sulu) Takei's "To the Stars" (Pocket Books) tells of being interned as 
a child with other Japanese Americans during World War II and later becoming 
politically active in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He, too, tweaks Shatner as a self-absorbed grandstander who often made it look 
"like some deep-seated insecurity was driving his congenital need to be the 
star. " In a recent promotional visit to Howard Stern's radio show, Takei 
joined in a snickering discussion of the different hairpieces that Shatner has 
worn on TV and in films. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the three books appear slow to catch on; none of them appeared last 
Thursday on USA Today's list of the top 150 sellers in the country, although 
Shatner's title finished last week as one of the more popular buys in Barnes & 
Noble stores. 
</P>
<P>
 On a separate front, Shatner and Nimoy are pursuing fiction unrelated to "Star 
Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 Shatner's "Tek Power," the sixth in his series of novels about futuristic 
private eye Jake Cardigan, was published this week by Putnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Nimoy's Primortals, a line of comic books that goes on sale next week, 
introduces a species that escaped the Earth in prehistoric times, evolved on 
other planets and now returns home to interact with modern man. The boldly 
drawn primortals, which look like dinosaurs, reflect a creative collaboration 
between Nimoy and the prolific writer Isaac Asimov, who died in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Together we came up with the idea of aliens heading to Earth who are, in 
fact, coming home," Nimoy says. He welcomes the chance to go back to the future 
by working in a medium he enjoyed as a child. As he puts it, "Comic books are a 
wonderful canvas to paint on." 
</P>
<P>

 Backing a Winner: Villard Books publisher David Rosenthal had a winning piece 
of last weekend's title fight action between Michael Moorer and George Foreman, 
but he still emerged $100,000 poorer. That's the bonus Villard had agreed to 
pay for Foreman's autobiography if the 45-year-old Mack truck won the bout -- 
"and we are gladly paying it," Rosenthal says, on top of an advance in the 
mid-six figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman's unexpected return to heavyweight glory is only part of the story he 
plans to tell with collaborator Joel Engel. There's the inspirational angle and 
his work in Christian ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of publishing "By George" (Rosenthal's choice of a title) next fall, 
the book will be moved up to spring. Foreman was represented by Los Angeles 
attorneys Henry Holmes and Miriam Altshuler, who is better known for handling 
literary properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I watched the fight, I thought I'd save some money and still come out a 
winner, because George would still be a popular guy," Rosenthal said. "Then, 
when the knockout came, I realized I had a champion under contract." 
</P>

 Restyled McCall's: Five months after Gruner & Jahr Co. bought the New York 
Times Company Women's Magazines, the best-known of the lot, McCall's, has 
unveiled a redesign that includes a greater proliferation of photos and the 
addition of 16 editorial pages. 
</P>
<P>
 And who better to herald the overhaul in the December issue (and help stem a 
decline in newsstand sales) than the ubiquitous Kathie Lee Gifford. She seems 
to front one woman's mag after another before starting the circuit all over 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on Wednesday, McCall's announced the appointment of new Editor in 
Chief Sally Koslow. Kate White, who signed off on the redesign and appears on 
Page 3, recently left for Redbook as the successor to Ellen Levine, who had 
segued to Good Housekeeping.

 Agatha Christie's play "The Mousetrap" has been a fixture in London's West End 
for decades, diverting audiences with eccentric characters and a surprise 
ending but without straining anyone's imagination or sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fine Lines," a first novel by British journalist Simon Beckett, isn't 
anything like "The Mousetrap" in terms of plot, but it, too, is an undemanding 
production written so professionally one forgives its broad-brush 
predictability. 
</P>
<P>
 The resemblance continues in the fact that the novel, despite being a 
will-he-get-away-with-it rather than a whodunit, seems to beg for popular stage 
adaptation; its parties, murder, arguments, sex scenes and general voyeurism 
would fit snugly in the protagonist's London art gallery . . . thus lending the 
work a patina of respectability it wouldn't otherwise deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fine Lines" needs respectability, too, for it deals with a theme much favored 
by commercial novelists these days, one that might well make Christie blanch -- 
sexual obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a crowd-pleasing subject, and difficult to bungle as long as a reasonably 
talented writer places it in a fitting milieu. Josephine Hart set "Damage" in 
high-level politics; Beckett sets "Fine Lines" in the art world, and it's a 
good choice, given the art culture's unavoidable preoccupation with 
representation and falsification, sensuality and taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Ramsey, the narrator of this novel, is a discerning, middle-aged art 
dealer who has made his reputation, and a considerable fortune, selling works 
of unquestioned merit. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a man of little interest or consequence aside from one quirk: Ramsey 
collects antique and old-fashioned erotica, a harmless hobby that compensates 
for his nonexistent, apparently unwanted, sex life. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwanted, at least, until the day he returns to the gallery after hours and 
discovers Anna, his young assistant, quite naked; in the midst of changing for 
a dinner date with her boyfriend, she is unaware of her employer's presence. 
Ramsey is at that moment transformed, feeling intense sexual urges for the 
first time since adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of "Fine Lines" is essentially a low-rent reversal of "Cyrano de 
Bergerac," with Ramsey hiring a gorgeous male model, Zeppo, to seduce Anna in 
his stead. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeppo and Ramsey have terrible arguments, and end up committing murder in the 
course of this criminal endeavor. Their partnership turns out to be the best 
part of the book; Ramsey is an aesthete and gentleman, Zeppo a hedonist and 
cynic, and the two mix like oil and water. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see why a rake like Zeppo would derive such sadistic joy from 
taunting Ramsey about his sexual innocence, and why Ramsey, likewise, might 
jeer at Zeppo for his dimwitted cockiness. Zeppo, in addition, has a way of 
making Ramsey act coldbloodedly; it's as if Ramsey's brain -- only 
superficially engaged with the world until he sees Anna naked -- is 
supercharged by access to Zeppo's brawn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Fine Lines" has one inescapable problem; it's a one-trick pony. Ramsey's 
obsession with Anna is plausible, given his thoroughgoing repression, but his 
dogged attempts to satisfy that fixation unfold with so few surprises the story 
becomes monochromatic. That's not an entirely bad thing -- think of film noir 
-- but doesn't suit a novel set in the art world, which could provide all sorts 
of engaging novelistic diversions. 
</P>
<P>
 The subplots Beckett does utilize -- Ramsey's ill-starred run-ins with a 
widowed decorator, his encounters with Anna's parents -- are well-executed but 
extraneous, little more than padding. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest surprise in "Fine Lines" -- and it's a pleasant one -- is 
Beckett's omission of the just-desserts ending one expects from a first-person 
confessional novel. Ramsey (caution: plot giveaway dead ahead) does in fact get 
away with murder, resuming his old art-dealing ways an unchanged man. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckett obviously intends to produce much titillation in the course of "Fine 
Lines," and does so, but its most noteworthy aspect is Ramsey's lack of guilt, 
his detached acceptance of the obsession that drives him to singularly 
uncharacteristic acts. 
</P>
<P>
 His compulsion satisfied, Anna becomes just another hireling, her mouth too 
big, her lips too rubbery, her thighs too heavy . . . and her employment at the 
gallery, of course, soon to end.

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: CREATURES OF THE NIGHT; STARS PREY ON THE LAVISH LUXURY 
OF 'VAMPIRE' PREMIERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Scene: Wednesday's world premiere of Warner Bros.' "Interview With the 
Vampire" at the Village and Bruin theaters in Westwood. It was an extravagant 
klieg-lit scene. Two streets were blocked off, 30 TV crews and about 100 
paparazzi were on hand and the LAPD estimated there were 2,000 screaming fans. 
One East Coast magazine editor said, "It looks exactly like what you'd think a 
Hollywood premiere would look like." Only more so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Setting: If Marie Antoinette had produced movies, this is the kind of 
premiere party she'd have had. Set on a nearby parking structure's roof was a 
75,000-square-foot burgundy tent done in late 18th-Century New Orleans-French 
style. The overriding theme was opulence. A dozen chandeliers hung from the 
tent's roof and dozens of white-wigged servers dressed like George and Martha 
Washington on their wedding day presented Cajun cuisine. A 21-piece orchestra, 
also in period costume, played Mozart and Handel. Eight couples did minuets. 
Out back was a "graveyard" where a zydeco band played. "I've never had so much 
fun in a parking lot," said Ellen DeGeneres. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's stars, Tom Cruise with wife Nicole Kidman (who wore 
blood-red nails for the occasion -- "My ode to the vampire," she said), Brad 
Pitt, Antonio Banderas, Stephen Rea, Christian Slater and Kirsten Dunst; 
director Neil Jordan, producers Stephen Woolley and David Geffen (who called 
his film "the 'Lawrence of Arabia' of vampire movies") plus 1,200 guests 
including Jodie Foster, Roseanne, Debra Winger, Rita Wilson, Steven Seagal, 
Queen Latifah, Mike Ovitz, Barbara Davis, Jim Carrey, Herb Ritts, Candice 
Bergen, Sugar Ray Leonard and studio execs Bob Daly, Terry Semel and Rob 
Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I think vampires are very sexy creatures," said Cruise. "And I think 
the idea of being lower on the food chain than someone else is a very 
terrifying idea." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Experience: Spanish film star Banderas on coming to the 
"Interview" opening: "I was working last night in Texas. We finish a movie 
there. We had a wrap party. I couldn't sleep. I got on a plane this morning. I 
got here. Someone put this suit of Hugo Boss on me and I went to the premiere. 
I didn't see the movie before so it was kind of 'Wow!' 'Amazing!' No, I am very 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Best Compliment: One woman said, "I just want to sleep in Antonio Banderas' 
coffin. Now that's a vampire." 
</P>
<P>
 Tag Line: "I'm not afraid of vampires," said a guest. "It's Hollywood that 
scares me."

YOUNGER OF CHARLES SONS WAS FAMILY'S BIG SUCCESS; PROFILE: FRIENDS CAN'T 
IMAGINE EDDIE, THE MORE AVERAGE SON, IS A SUSPECT IN KILLINGS OF HIS PARENTS 
AND BROTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At Eddie Charles' soccer game a few years ago, a parent ran into Dolores and 
Edward Charles on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they could do was brag about their other boy," said the woman, whose son 
was a teammate of Eddie Charles. "As a mother, my only reaction was, poor 
Eddie." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Edward Charles III, 22, was arrested on suspicion of killing his 
parents, Edward, 55, and Dolores, 47, and his brother, Danny, 19. Their bodies 
were discovered Monday night in a family car that had been doused with gasoline 
and set on fire outside a La Mirada high school. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Charles family, it seems, Danny was the sparkling success story while 
Eddie was the average kid, according to interviews this week with friends, 
classmates and neighbors who knew them. 
</P>
<P>
 When younger brother Danny went to USC to study acting and opera singing, for 
example, Eddie remained at home in Fullerton tuning up cars at the corner gas 
station. While Danny was a driven showman with a bundle of awards, Eddie was a 
regular Joe who dreamed of being an Olympic boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of those interviewed said they could not fathom how the easygoing 
Eddie Charles they know, who enjoyed spending time feeding his girlfriend's 
horses and openly worried about his father's health, could be a suspect in his 
family's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I think he could have done that? No. No. No," said Jeanne Bowen, whose 
daughter Tiffany is Eddie Charles' fiancee of a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Some friends and neighbors, however, said Eddie's mellow nature contrasted 
with an explosive side. 
</P>
<P>
 His high school girlfriend said that sometime after she broke up with him in 
1991, Eddie knocked her to the ground when he encountered her at a local soccer 
field. Two neighbors said that at his Terraza Place home, he was seen flying 
into rages, screaming at his parents and once throwing rocks at a recent 
girlfriend's car after an argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie had a temper. He was always arguing with his dad, yelling obscenities 
at them. His parents seemed afraid of him," said a neighbor who spoke on 
condition she not be identified. 'He acted like he was running the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Following Eddie Charles' arrest on Wednesday, investigators from the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department spent Thursday combing the family house and 
grounds in a tony section of Fullerton, where the family had lived for at least 
12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they believe that Charles on Sunday night killed his parents 
in the home and the brother nearby, then put them in Danny's car and hid them 
at an unknown location until Monday night. An autopsy determined that the 
father and brother died from bludgeoning with a blunt instrument, but the 
mother's body was too severely burned to tell. Danny, whose body was found 
unburned in the trunk, had also been stabbed repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they had no motive for the slayings. Charles declined 
interviews at the Fullerton Jail on Thursday, and his attorney issued a brief 
statement of "continuing confidence and support" for him but declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors said they expect to receive the case for review on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Ray Peavy said a search of the home produced 
evidence incriminating Charles, but he declined to specify it. He said there 
was no sign of a struggle in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday, relatives of the Charles family had flown in from as far as New 
York and Houston. As investigators searched the house and grounds, they sat 
inside with Dolores Charles' father, who lives at the home and was asleep there 
the night the family died. 
</P>
<P>
 Peavy said Charles has stopped talking to investigators since his arrest at 
the house, on the advice of his lawyer. Attorney John J. Donovan had said 
earlier that Charles told investigators he is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 The turn of events, first the grisly discovery of the charred Honda outside El 
Camino Continuation High School, then the arrest of the family's oldest child, 
stunned the normally tranquil neighborhood and left family friends searching 
for answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Charles Sr., a Hughes Aircraft engineer, and Dolores Charles, a 
self-employed typist, were known for their involvement in their sons' 
activities. He helped coach Eddie's youth soccer team in the early 1980s, while 
she provided refreshments and served one year as a club president. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed like a very supportive family, very supportive of their kids," 
said Larry Mitobe, coach of the Warriors youth team at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Charles was a leader of the booster club at the Orange County High 
School of the Arts, handling publicity and ticket sales for the school, where 
Danny Charles graduated in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But Danny Charles often seemed to outshine his older brother. 
</P>
<P>
 While Danny was making a name for himself at a prestigious performing arts 
school, Eddie was struggling just to be average on the soccer field at Sunny 
Hills High School. He was the player who tried hard, but was remembered most 
for missing a tying shot near the end of a playoff game, teammate Jason 
Fichtelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Charles played varsity soccer for three years, he never hung out with 
jocks, said former high school friends. His crowd worked on cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even remember him being on the team," said Mike Mitobe, who graduated 
from Sunny Hills a year ahead of Charles in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles "had a way of carrying himself that wasn't coordinated or cool," 
Fichtelberg said. "Sunny Hills was real cliquish. His friends weren't one of 
the major cliques; they would try to go out and be social (at) the major hip 
parties. For most people, your whole life at Sunny Hills is trying to be 
accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Charles was polite and well-liked by their parents and got along 
well with his own family. 
</P>
<P>
 "He bragged about his brother. You could tell he loved his family," said John 
Cho, the father of Charles' best friend in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Joonie Cho, the best friend, "Eddie got along well with his folks. I 
went to his house a lot and never saw any serious fights -- just regular 
teen-age arguments." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Eddie's high school girlfriend said he sometimes felt pangs of jealousy 
toward his brother and even complained that Danny was their parents' favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would say they loved (Danny) more than they loved Eddie. I doubt that's 
true. I think he was just feeling sorry for himself," said the former 
girlfriend, who asked that her name not be used. "They didn't neglect him or 
anything. He always had money." 
</P>
<P>
 The girlfriend said she met Eddie while the pair were students at Park Junior 
High School in Fullerton, but the couple didn't start dating until he was a 
high school senior.  
</P>
<P>
 "He treated me real good in the beginning." But when they broke up in 1991, 
Eddie started behaving strangely, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks after they parted, she bumped into Charles when she went to watch 
some friends play soccer on a youth team he was coaching. But after the boys 
left, she said, he pushed her to the ground and slapped and kicked her. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after that, she said, when she left her car in a store parking lot, 
she returned to find it dented. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next time he saw me he said he was with his friend and his friend did 
it," she said. "I was really scared. . . . My mom got a new alarm system on the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 But the mother of Charles' fiancee said she never saw any signs that he could 
be violent. In fact, Charles lived for much of the last few months at their 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 He also seemed full of dreams. He worked out at a Fullerton racquetball club 
and had bulked up noticeably, friends said, and told even casual acquaintances 
he was on his way to becoming an Olympic boxer. He told his fiancee's mother he 
planned to attend the Olympic training center in Colorado in March. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one on the local boxing scene has ever heard of Eddie Charles. He also 
was not registered in the organization that sanctions Olympic-level fights, 
though records show he belonged for three months last year. Eddie's boxing 
dream took some longtime friends by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up, he never seemed like a fighter. In high school you have people 
who were fighters and tough guys," said Shon Halverson, who grew up in the same 
neighborhood. "And he wasn't one of them."

BOARD SET TO DISBAND EL TORO REUSE AGENCY; MEASURE A: THREE OF FIVE SUPERVISORS 
VOW TO FOLLOW VOTERS' WISHES FOR AIRPORT. OPPONENTS SUGGEST COURT ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A majority of the Board of Supervisors said Thursday they are ready to disband 
the county's planning agency studying the conversion of El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station and will follow the apparent voter mandate to earmark 2,000 acres 
there for a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials, however, warned this week in letters to the supervisors 
that such an action would cost "valuable time" and could jeopardize federal 
funding given to the county for the conversion process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to continue with the positive gains we've made with ETRPA (El 
Toro Reuse Planning Authority)," Marine Col. Jim Ritchie stated in the letter 
received Thursday. "Any delays to the progress already made would disrupt our 
timetable for closure and impact the community redevelopment efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 The county planning authority was created by the supervisors in March to 
consider a range of options for the base, including siting an airport there, 
with a final decision coming in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Any move to disband the county planning authority is also likely to be opposed 
by officials from Lake Forest and Irvine, cities that belong to the authority 
and object to the development of a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have a tough time doing that," said Barry J. Hammond, a 
councilman from Irvine, where part of the base is located. "I think there are 
some real legal issues they have to address. I can guarantee you we would 
oppose that." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the potential legal and funding problems, Supervisors Harriett M. 
Wieder, William G. Steiner and Roger R. Stanton said Thursday they are prepared 
to carry out the wishes of Orange County voters, who narrowly approved Measure 
A, an initiative requiring that the county designate land at the base for a 
commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was favored by 51.1% of voters, a margin of 15,103 votes. With 
48,000 absentee ballots still to be counted, however, it is conceivable that 
the outcome could change. 
</P>
<P>
 But the preliminary results were enough for a majority on the five-member 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned the people have voted," Steiner said. "Withdrawing 
from ETRPA is consistent with the will of the public. Until the court tells us 
not to do it, we should move ahead and implement Measure A." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no choice," Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton agreed that the board "needs to get the ball rolling" and disband the 
county planning authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Gaddi H. Vasquez could not be reached for 
comment Thursday. The entire board is expected to discuss Measure A and make 
policy decisions at its meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Thursday, County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said his staff 
is preparing a list of options for the board to consider regarding Measure A. 
According to a draft of those options, the board could disband the county 
planning authority; ignore the referendum; join the county's current planning 
authority with a new 13-member airport committee, which is supposed to be 
formed under Measure A; or create a hybrid group of both committees to study 
the reuse issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the county's planning agency is made up of nine members: the five 
supervisors, three representatives from Irvine and one from Lake Forest. The 
agency is the only one recognized by the Pentagon to submit a reuse plan to the 
federal government for converting the Marine base to civilian use. It recently 
received $730,000 in federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Ritchie indicated that additional funding could be withheld if there is 
not "continued recognition" of the reuse authority as the lead planning 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, however, said he did not think that disbanding the county authority 
would "jeopardize" the county's ability to receive grants from the federal 
government. To withdraw from and disband the county authority, 30-days notice 
must be given to all members of the agency, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Stanton, Steiner and Wieder said that notice should be given as 
soon as possible. They also said the county should begin forming the 13-member 
advisory commission called for in the referendum. That committee is to work 
with federal, state and local agencies and the air-cargo industry in developing 
a commercial airport at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton and Steiner said the selection of that committee should include all 
county viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how the board acts on the issue, the future of the military 
remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 There continues to be deep divisions throughout the county over what sort of 
development would be best for the base, which is scheduled to close by 1999. 
For the most part, North County residents favor an airport and South County 
residents are against it. Lake Forest officials, are so adamantly opposed to an 
airport that they have threatened to challenge the initiative in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Pentagon officials, who will make the ultimate decision on how to 
convert the base, say they are not bound by any county recommendation or county 
measure.

 BEATING AFTERMATH: Still reeling from the Halloween night attacks on two Coto 
de Caza men by teens inside their gated community (E1), homeowners associations 
continue to meet to discuss security. . . . Resident Robert Follman says 
they're looking for long-term solutions: "Is there anything we can do to make 
this a better place? We're looking to go beyond the first emotional quick fix." 
</P>

 MOVING HISTORY: If you haven't seen the majestic Vietnam War Memorial in 
Washington, Knott's Berry Farm has the next best thing. Its replica is now on 
display through the weekend near its Independence Hall. It's half the size of 
the original, but still large enough that you can read the 58,191 names of 
those who died in the Vietnam War. . . . The wall travels around the country 
when it's not at Knott's. A candlelight vigil will be held there today at 5:30 
p.m.

 SATELLITE DADA: She cannot attend the Archives of American Art event held in 
her honor in Laguna Beach this weekend. Beatrice Wood, the renowned Mama of 
Dada, at age 101, doesn't get around like she used to. But she's still creating 
beautiful earthenware, and plans to accept its 1994 American Artist award via 
TV hookup. . . . She had fun writing to organizers: "I've sent a telegram to 
heaven to keep me alive until then. I'll have my hair dyed, and visit Elizabeth 
Arden's health farm to have my figure remade."

 HARVESTING ART: Barry Howe of Laguna Hills loves baseball stadiums. The 
professional photographer has put together a collection of dozens of photos of 
major league ball parks, including the old Ebbets Field and Polo Grounds in New 
York. He's one of 250 arts and crafts exhibitors who will show their wares at 
the Harvest Festival this weekend at the Anaheim Convention Center. With a can 
or box of food, you can get $1 off the $6 admission price for the three-day 
show, which draws nearly 20,000 annually.

 PATIENCE: Five years ago this week, it wasn't the Democratic Party that came 
down -- it was the Berlin Wall. But some ex-East Germans still believe that 
life was better under communism, says Franz Vogel, manager of the Old 
Heidelberg restaurant in Van Nuys. . . . Vogel, 43, who came to the United 
States in 1981, says: "Capitalism takes time. Things were worse in East Germany 
than we thought."

 BLOOD DRIVE: The county needs blood, and the Valley should be a big 
contributor. The situation is so dire, in fact, that the American Red Cross 
will hold its annual holiday blood drive Thanksgiving week, a month earlier 
than usual. . . . In all, 25% of the county's blood donations come from the San 
Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 COLLECTORS: What do a vintage Chatty Cathy doll, a pre-1969 Matchbox car and a 
brass purse necklace (above) have in common? Come to think of it, nothing. 
Except that they are among the thousands of highly coveted possessions of 
die-hard Valley collectors. . . . Says Frank Piccolo of Sherman Oaks: "Yes, 
they're material things, but they give you enjoyment that other people may 
not." See Valley Life! Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 THE WAY HE IS: Barbra, back on tour so soon? Well, sort of. You won't actually 
see the great one herself, but you can catch many of her popular hits Sunday at 
the Academy Plaza Theatre in North Hollywood. Illusionist Jim Bailey will 
become Barbra for the night (Valley Life! Page 3). . . . "I am an actor who 
happens to sing and portray women rather than men," says Bailey, also known for 
his rendition of Judy Garland. 
</P>
<P>
 DEEP FREEZE: Players, owners, and fans aren't the only casualties from the NHL 
lockout (C2). . . . Some shops selling hockey-related items have been skating 
on thin ice as well. Says Larry Bruyere, owner of All-Star Hockey-N-Sports in 
North Hills: "Last year, when the NHL was doing so well, we ran out during the 
Christmas rush. This year, it's been disastrous." Michael Arkush

STORM FOULS UP RUSH-HOUR; WEATHER: RAIN CAUSES HUNDREDS OF CRASHES BUT RAISES 
SANTA ANA RAINFALL TO NORMAL LEVEL FOR SEASON AND CHEERS SKI OPERATORS.

 Southern Californians slipped and skidded to work Thursday morning as the 
season's first major rainstorm made freeway driving treacherous. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol reported 70 rain-related accidents in Orange 
County alone and about 300 throughout the Southland, delaying commuters by as 
much as 90 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 "Today was a bad one," CHP Officer Ron Johnson said on Thursday. "This morning 
it was stopped everywhere, all the freeways. We have a sensor board that shows 
the speeds on the freeways, and today it was down to 20 miles per hour on most 
freeways." 
</P>
<P>
 A small mudslide on the Chapman Avenue off-ramp of the northbound Santa Ana 
Freeway in Orange temporarily closed the off-ramp and all westbound lanes of 
Chapman Avenue Thursday morning, according to Orange police and a Caltrans 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, the storm prompted the reopening of the city's storm 
operations center to help monitor the possibility of mudslides or other 
storm-related damage, a Fire Department spokesman said. No damage was reported 
in south Orange County, The rain also caused a delay for Dana Point work crews 
repairing the 1993 landslide on La Ventana above Pacific Coast Highway, which 
was scheduled to be stabilized in January, said Morton August, Dana Point 
director of public works, who is in charge of work on the bluff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have erosion controls in place," August said. "There's no danger for 
further property damage, and we're about 50% to 60% complete. We've stabilized 
two-thirds of the hillside and compacted the landslide area." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the storm clouds had a silver lining. At Snow Summit ski resort in 
Big Bear, where raindrops turned to snowflakes, folks were rejoicing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the snow!" cried spokeswoman Bonnie Tregaskis as the resort prepared 
to open this weekend. "We've had a couple of flakes before, but this is the 
first really good storm. It's beautiful!" 
</P>
<P>
 Snow fell in the San Bernardino Mountains above 6,000 feet, and six inches of 
powder was expected to accumulate. CHP officers were bracing for an influx of 
skiers taking advantage of the Veterans Day holiday today and heading to 
resorts, such as Snow Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow chains were required on California Route 18, but that wasn't enough for 
one driver, whose vehicle went out of control and over the side of the mountain 
road. But CHP Officer George Berge said no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to sea level, things were warmer but no less dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Two big-rig trucks hit freeway center dividers during rush hour Thursday 
morning -- one on the westbound Artesia Freeway in Compton, the other on the 
southbound Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm dumped .59 inch of rain on Santa Ana and .54 inch on Anaheim, but 
just .04 inch on San Juan Capistrano, said Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData Inc., which provides weather information for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair skies are forecast for today and through the weekend, with lows in the 
30s to 50s and highs in the mid-50s and 60s in the mountains and coastal areas, 
respectively. The high in Downtown Los Angeles on Thursday was 62 degrees and 
the low was 52. A total of 0.31 of an inch of rain fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain fouled many a commute, but at the Metropolitan Water District, the 
agency that supplies Southern California with most of its water, it was a happy 
sight. California is under a drought watch, and while most of the Southland's 
water is drawn from either the Colorado River or reservoirs in northern 
California, some comes from ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more there is down here, it lessens the need to trade supplies with the 
north," said MWD spokesman Rob Hallwachs. "We never complain about rain." Rain 
Check 
</P>
<P>
 Less than an inch of rain fell in Orange County Thursday, but it was enough to 
bring up the season total to normal for this time of year. Thursday's rain, 
from midnight to 4 p.m.: 02,21,08 City Inches Santa Ana 0.59 Anaheim 0.54 
Newport Beach 0.33 Lake Forest 0.65 Dana Point 0.26 Laguna Beach 0.30 San Juan

TRUE TO CHARACTER; JIM BAILEY WILL PERFORM HIS FAITHFUL RE-CREATION OF BARBRA 
STREISAND IN TWO SHOWS SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Barbra Streisand may not ever tour again, but you can still catch her act Sun 
day at the Academy Plaza Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when illusionist Jim Bailey will be strutting his Streisand stuff -- 
fingernails, blond wig and all -- performing "People," "The Way We Were" and 
other numbers from the singing star's shows. His two hourlong concerts, with 
opening act Kaye Ballard, are part of the "Show of the Month," a musical series 
designed for audiences older than 50. 
</P>
<P>
 A trained lyric tenor in his own right, Bailey, 46, pioneered the concept of 
faithfully re-creating the on-stage persona of female performers, rather than 
caricaturing them as would a female impersonator. The first of his "ladies," as 
he calls them, was Phyllis Diller. He is probably best known for his rendition 
of Judy Garland, even concertizing in Las Vegas with Garland's daughter Liza 
Minnelli. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am an actor who happens to sing and portray women rather than men," says 
Bailey, who has appeared on such television series as "Night Court" and "Here's 
Lucy," in "Zelig" and other movies, in the play "Nite Club Confidential" at the 
Tiffany Theatre in West Hollywood, and before the British royal family at a 
Command Performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do what Hal Holbrook does as Mark Twain, what Bobby Morse does as Truman 
Capote. They happen to be wearing men's clothes, and I wear women's clothes. I 
don't do the women as camp or satire. I do them as they are, or were." 
</P>
<P>
 J.D. Kessler, manager of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel's Cinegrill, where 
Bailey performed as Streisand last New Year's Eve, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim is actually quite amazing," he says. "Barbra is such a distinctive 
personality herself, she's not easy to play. Drag queens pick out her flaws and 
amplify them out of proportion. Jim doesn't send up her performance. This is 
much more subtle and much more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consequently, as far as I know, all the women he impersonates totally approve 
of him, because he's not out to editorialize on them. He tries to reproduce 
them, not make a joke of them." 
</P>
<P>
 For Sunday's concerts, it will take three hours to effect the Bailey-to-Barbra 
transformation. "My face becomes a canvas. I don't use putty or prosthetics," 
Bailey says. "It's shadows, shading." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides makeup, he dons costumes, created by Boston designer David Josef, that 
are copies of Streisand's tour togs. 
</P>
<P>
 His act does not replicate Streisand's entirely, of course. He is backed by a 
five-piece band rather than a Marvin Hamlisch-directed orchestra. And, he says, 
"I've heard from people that it's apparent I'm having more fun, a better time 
than Barbra does. I love to perform." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey's show not only predates Streisand's, but, he believes, may have served 
as a catalyst for her tour. In June, 1993, Streisand invited him to her Malibu 
estate to perform at a charity event before some of Hollywood's biggest names 
-- without telling her guests that it was Bailey, not Streisand, at the 
microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barbra snuck in the back of the room and watched," he recounts. "I don't know 
if she wanted to see what she might look like, what she might sound like. I 
think it opened her mind up to different things, and if so, I'm glad. After 
that, she announced her tour. I like to think she took a tip from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand, Garland and his other "ladies" will always be a part of his 
performing life, Bailey says -- he is planning to add Lena Horne to his 
repertoire -- but he is looking into other projects as well. Among them are a 
possible television series, film and a Broadway show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to educate people that there is a person here who is a 
talented character actor," he says. "I'm very particular about what I lend my 
talent and name to. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I can do serious stuff," he adds. "My manager contacted the people regarding 
'Sunset Boulevard' " when the now-closed Los Angeles production was looking for 
a replacement for Glenn Close as Norma Desmond. "I could have done that." Where 
and When

EXHIBITING AN UPLIFTING OUTLOOK; SHOW SHRUGS OFF THE PESSIMISM OF THE TIMES FOR 
A SWIRL OF SPIRITUALITY AND A MEASURE OF MYSTICISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Despite these cynical times, when some people throw up their hands in anguish 
and declare that people are rot ten, life stinks and it won't get any better, 
there are still artists who unabashedly reject that attitude. Instead, they 
depict visions of life full of mystery and possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Painters Merrilyn Duzy and Norma Jean Squires are two artists who subscribe to 
the notion that there is cause for hope in the universe. They manifest those 
feelings in the metaphorical and metaphysical images of their paintings. As 
both women spent part of their time in recent years working at Artspace Gallery 
in Woodland Hills, they saw that many of the artists whose work was on display 
there shared their expansive view of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Duzy and Squires decided to curate a show that would present "a variety of 
cultures and belief systems, everything that has to do with something beyond 
(the artists) themselves," Duzy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angels, Ancestors & Spirit Guides," their multimedia show of work by 20 
artists, is on view at Mythos gallery in Burbank. It is part of "Towards a 
Greater Realm," a series of 11 exhibits taking place this fall throughout 
Southern California that focus on spirituality, myth and inner journeys evident 
in contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 We "can look and understand that although we come from many difference places, 
it all adds up to the same thing -- a grand spiritual overtone permeating 
everything," Squires said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each of these artists is an island lost in the great sea of Los Angeles," 
said Glen Doll, Mythos gallery director. A painter and photographer, he has 
five works in the show. "They have so much in common even though the styles are 
different. There's no shared belief, (but) a shared desire. (The art) talks 
more about the journey than the arrival." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Duzy and Squires travel through spheres of science as well as art in 
their own work. Unlike some artists and curators, Duzy, Squires and Doll 
believe that the two fields are not mutually exclusive. As Doll said, "Art and 
science are both means of grappling with what is, and dealing with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Duzy has derived the whirling shapes and colors of her painting "Maya" -- 
which means illusion in Hindi -- from an image she created on a computer. The 
foundation of the computer image was a photograph of Duzy twirling around in a 
cape, which she scanned into the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting, though, with its glittery matter sprinkled about to convey a 
buoyant, starry atmosphere, presents a tangible texture that is not available 
from a computer image. 
</P>
<P>
 Squires absorbs in her mind's eye images from sources including photographs, 
charts, graphs, books on physics and astronomy and incorporates them in her 
paintings. "Peripheral Vision," with its eye-like center cut in two, surrounded 
by light and color and limitless dimensions, suggests a human connection with a 
vast but nonetheless spirited deep space. 
</P>
<P>
 In another approach to the blending of science and art, Rufus Snoddy rings his 
classical style Venus painting with actual computer circuitry in his work 
"Venus, Circa 2000." In contrast, the most significant objects of Ron Pippin's 
intricate sculptures come from nature. A dead bird is the focal point of "Saint 
With Bird." 
</P>
<P>
 Natural landscapes serve as spirit guides for Vern Wilson. His wood engravings 
depict Colorado River rapids and a waterfall, moonlight and a mountain trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Sicre's vibrant "Earth Angel" results from his interest in American 
Indian and Asian mysticism. Lynn Small and Dennis Paul pay tribute to an 
Israeli weaver by interpreting the letters of the cabala with mixed media 
collages for each letter. Scott Canty uses Christian biblical references to 
define the angels of his mixed media works on paper. The women of Gloria 
Longval's paintings are based on her mother, grandmother and aunts, who were 
healers and spiritualists in their native Cuba. Barbara Yates-Penny's 
wood-carved totem, "Know Myself," symbolizes a compatible melding of icons from 
various cultures and religions. 
</P>
<P>
 Squires sees this diverse presentation of art and ideas as a "dialogue that is 
so desperately needed in today's world."  
</P>
<P>
 Other artists in the show: Young Joo Choi, Sydney Cobb, Cecilia Davidson, 
Amani Fliers, Annelise Hansen, Leslie Klein, Midge Lynn and Joseph Piasentin. 
Where and When

 What: "Angels, Ancestors & Spirit Guides."

EXPANDING ON THE CLASSICS; EXCALIBUR OFFERS WILLIAM SHERIDAN'S COMEDY 'THE 
RIVALS' AS ITS SECOND PRODUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't tell Rajan Dosaj that there's no room in the San Fernando Valley for 
more than one classical theater company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big place," says Dosaj, co-founder (with Carl J. Pfeifer) of Excalibur 
Theatre Company. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more seriously, he observes that the more classical theater there is, 
the better it is for everyone. "I think giving an audience a choice of these 
types of theaters will be beneficial to us," he says, "because it can only help 
spread the awareness of classical theater." 
</P>
<P>
 The other classical company is Glendale's A Noise Within, whose success has 
proven that there really is a way for a classical ensemble theater to develop 
in Los Angeles' sometimes anarchic theater environment. 
</P>
<P>
 But A Noise Within has settled into its home on Brand Boulevard with a loyal 
audience base and plans to build a real theater. The Excalibur people don't 
even have a home yet, but instead have a friendly rental arrangement at 
Lionstar Theatre in Studio City's Sports Center building, where on Saturday the 
group is opening its second production, a revival of William Sheridan's 1775 
comic masterpiece, "The Rivals." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue isn't so much about too many classics on stage as every artist's 
bugaboo: comparison. "I told Carl when we first started this," Dosaj says, 
"that we were going to be compared to (A Noise Within). You can't do anything 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the group was considering Sheridan's "The School for Scandal" as 
the follow-up to its lauded initial production of Shakespeare's "The Taming of 
the Shrew." But no sooner had the idea occurred to Dosaj and Pfeifer than "we 
opened up the paper and saw that A Noise Within was doing it for the fall 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 That pretty much guaranteed "The Rivals," because if Excalibur was going to do 
a Sheridan play, there were very few to choose from. His other four plays -- 
"The Critic," "St. Patrick's Day," "A Trip to Scarborough" and a ballad-opera, 
"The Duenna" -- flounder in obscurity.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rivals" director Christine Ashworth, notes that Sheridan -- a notoriously 
undisciplined writer who wasted his money on booze and women -- "wrote the play 
in a couple of weeks because he was desperate for money to elope with a woman." 
The comedy, most famous for the spectacularly misspeaking character Mrs. 
Malaprop (the source of the term malapropism ), is perhaps born out of 
Sheridan's own hasty heart. Its complex web of plots, subplots and intrigues -- 
set among high society taking the waters at Bath, England -- ensnare a range of 
characters in various states of disastrous amour , jealously and passionate 
flux. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Ashworth, the late 18th Century need not be the only setting 
for "The Rivals." 
</P>
<P>
 "For 'School for Scandal,' " says Ashworth, an associate director of the 
Nevada Shakespeare Festival, "you need the proper period costumes, the hoop 
skirts, and so on. 1904 in England was a similar time to the 1770s, in that the 
natives were restless and the monarch was weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manners were extremely important in both eras," he added. "Your good name was 
more important than what you had in the bank. So we decided to shift the time 
to 1904, and all we had to change was the clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, costumer Jeffrey Schoenberg informed the company that 18th-Century 
costume design would be very costly. Practicalities, though, presented Ashworth 
and crew with new multicultural insights into Sheridan's social world: Dosaj, 
of Indian heritage (his father was born in New Delhi), is playing Fag, the 
servant of Sir Anthony Absolute, as an Indian manservant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes perfect sense for the time," says Ashworth, "at the height of the 
British Empire, and its hold on India." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ashworth and Dosaj, a veteran of Actors Alley, Santa Susana Repertory, 
the Globe Playhouse and the defunct L.A. Shakespeare Theatre, know the value of 
a stable acting company -- and both admit that Excalibur has yet to reach that 
kind of stability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for me and Carl," Dosaj says, "there is no one from the 'Shrew' cast 
in 'The Rivals.' You can never predict an actor's life, and because the actors 
we cast are so good, they're also in big demand for film and television. 
</P>
<P>
 "After seeing the mistakes made by other theaters, Carl and I decided last 
year that Excalibur would do two productions a year. With two, we can deliver 
the best, which is the only thing we think worth aiming for." Where and When

 Can a 63-year-old play be new again? John Rubinstein thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very similar to L. A. today," says the actor, who's starring in a 
revival of Elmer Rice's 25-character drama "Counsellor-at-Law" at Interact 
Theatre. "There's the same mixing together of ethnic groups, depending on each 
other and yet competing for business, turf and opportunity. There's also very 
much a class war going on now -- and the play is about that: people who are 
downtrodden, fighting their way up from the streets. Although it's a period 
play, it's not predictable or nostalgic. It's tough-talking, blood-and-guts." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubinstein was originally offered the role he's now playing -- hotshot divorce 
lawyer George Simon -- at the Williamstown Festival in 1993, but turned it down 
to spend time with his oldest son, Michael, who was home from college on summer 
break. Instead, the actor mounted a reading of the play at Interact (where he 
and his actress-dancer wife, Jane Lanier, have been members since 1992), a 
staging that included Lanier, Rubinstein, his son Michael and Michael's 
girlfriend, Zoe Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real family production," says Rubinstein, who also has a 22-year-old 
daughter, Jessica, from his first marriage. Now that the play is receiving a 
full-scale staging, he and Lanier are reprising their roles -- but Michael and 
Zoe are back in college. New on the sidelines, however, is Rubinstein and 
Lanier's 8 1/2-month-old son, Peter. "It's hard to concentrate when he's at 
rehearsal, and tough to learn my lines," admits Lanier, who met Rubinstein in 
1989 when they were both appearing on Broadway -- he in "M. Butterfly," she in 
her Tony-nominated role in "Jerome Robbins' Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 "He saw me dance and wanted to meet me," says Indiana-born, ballet-trained 
Lanier.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of mutual friends, but no one wanted to help him meet me." 
Lanier, who quips that she went from "point shoes in 'The Nutcracker' to cruise 
ships in bikinis" before making it in New York (her Broadway credits include 
"Guys and Dolls," "Anything Goes," "Sweet Charity" and "On Your Toes"), notes 
that the couple's 1992 L.A. move was in part a chance for her to redefine 
herself professionally: "In New York I was only known as a dancer. So it's been 
like starting over." 
</P>
<P>
 In this play, Lanier plays Bessie, the law firm's switchboard operator. "She 
runs the outer office; everyone likes her," explains the actress. "It's not the 
biggest part, but John said, 'It's the most fun.' And she has some great 
personality quirks." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubinstein's character is a flashy publicity hound with 18 years in practice. 
"He came from the East Side, very poor," says the actor. "And he's married this 
aristocratic blueblood. So there's some tension there, feelings of inferiority 
of my class." 
</P>
<P>
 Class is one of the persistent elements in Rice's work, and Rubinstein 
stresses that he has not altered the script to fit 1990s sensibilities: "We've 
changed nothing to be PC (politically correct). We left in all the raw stuff -- 
like calling people 'wops,' 'Jews,' 'coloreds.' We're keeping it in period and 
not apologizing for any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Muni originated the role on Broadway, John Barrymore later did the movie, 
and, says Rubinstein, "his Jewishness was one of the many themes of the work -- 
that ethnic melting pot of 1930s Manhattan." 
</P>
<P>
 For Rubinstein, his current role follows closely on the heels of his last 
stage outing, playing a successful painter in Donald Margulies' "Sight Unseen" 
at the Odyssey Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Los Angeles, the son of pianist Arthur Rubinstein, he attended UCLA 
and has spent his career segueing from music (his writing credits include the 
theme for the TV series "Family," in which he also co-starred) to acting. 
</P>
<P>
 His stage roles include the Broadway productions of "Pippin" and "Children of 
a Lesser God." The latter originated at the Taper and earned him a Tony in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, Rubinstein is wearing two hats: as performer and as 
co-director with Anita Khanzadian.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love the work, I love the business," he says. "I love to act; I always 
have. I love directing, and I feel I'm good at it. But without Anita, I 
wouldn't be able to put this on. It's an epic play, a big play -- it needs and 
could use a Broadway house. I think it's going to blow people away." Where and

IN SEARCH OF ELVIS; 'ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT?' EXPLORES DRAMA OF TWO FANS' 
OBSESSION WITH THE KING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Attention, all loyalists to The King. Elvis sighting impending. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, writer Adam Winston doesn't want his new play, "Are You Lonesome 
Tonight?" (which began previews this week and opens Nov. 17 at the Victory 
Theatre) to be pigeonholed as an Elvis sighting -- even though a guy looking a 
lot like Elvis lands in the play's setting of a dingy Lower East Side 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 And, to be sure (without giving Winston's game away) it's not quite the 
sighting fans might be expecting. Winston and collaborator/actor Robert Factor 
suggest that "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" is about Elvis sightings and why some 
people need them. 
</P>
<P>
 Factor understands the desire. "I'm a pretty big fan," he says, sitting in the 
Victory lobby with Winston and director Robert A. Ferretti. "Not like the two 
women in the play, Lisa and Marie. Not fanatical. But pretty big. I was 
collecting Elvis stuff years ago. And ever since I started rehearsals on this 
(in the role of the would-be King), I started collecting things again. Elvis 
watches, things like that. I can't rehearse in my tennis shoes. I've got to 
wear some wild blue or red shoes like the kind Elvis would wear." 
</P>
<P>
 A quick glance at Factor's feet confirm it: Today, he's wearing red suede 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Factor, a longtime member of the Colony Studio Theatre, was talking with 
Winston more than a year ago about a story idea he had about an Elvis poseur 
seducing two women. "Maybe it all started as a way for me to play Elvis, which 
I've always wanted to do," says Factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston and Factor, who both work in the NBC studio mail room -- which, in a 
bit of kismet, is where Factor met Ferretti several years ago -- talked about 
the story and worked and reworked ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Winston says, "I had enough to go on, said goodby to Bob, and went 
off and wrote the first draft in three weeks. That's how I work. If I spend too 
much time on a script, I get bogged down. Get it out, then rewrite." 
</P>
<P>
 What the 33-year-old Winston concocted was a tale of confused, alienated young 
New Yorkers living in "Alphabet City," an especially grimy section of Manhattan 
east of Washington Square. When discussing the characters with Winston, 
Ferretti says, "I asked him, 'Who the hell would live there?' And Adam looked 
at me and said, 'I did!' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I start with lost, forlorn, sorry people," Winston says, describing roommates 
and self-styled organizers of The Church of Elvis, Lisa (played by Darcy Lee) 
and Marie (Joleene Lutz). "This is the kind of place they would live, and I 
think, this is the kind of obsession they would hold onto. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not poking fun at them for it," Winston insists. "I want to make that 
clear. Lisa, especially, holds on to her belief. It gets her through the day. 
Who are we to say that it's wrong, or crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ferretti is often found behind a movie camera directing shorts and feature 
films, or in tiny, dark editing rooms as chief editor on such films as "Die 
Hard 2" and "Under Siege." More and more, he says that he wants to be in a 
theater, working with his pal Factor. (Ferretti has already directed Factor in 
three productions.)  
</P>
<P>
 "When I first read Adam's play," says Ferretti, "it was clear how well-written 
it was. I instantly fell in love with these characters. I already knew what a 
fan Bob was, but Adam had really fleshed it out into something more than a 
silly Elvis comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "As lost as the souls in this play are, there's hope for them at the end," he 
adds. "It reminds me of one night when I was driving a friend home from a 
screening in Hollywood, and we were going on, complaining about something. 
Suddenly, I saw an old woman without arms or legs going across the street in 
her wheelchair. And she looked like she was on an appointment, that she knew 
what she was doing. My friend and I looked at each other and wondered what we 
had to complain about. I get the same sensation from this play." 
</P>
<P>
 For its writer and director, such sensations are grounded in the story. "In 
anything I do," Ferretti, 45, says, "whether it's cutting a movie, or setting 
up a shot or directing my cast here, it's all about story. Storytelling is a 
trait that I've definitely picked up over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 And this story, with its search for the Church of Elvis, is hardly far-fetched 
in Factor's view: "Hey, these kind of people are everywhere. Some of them came 
for our auditions, just because of the Elvis theme. They couldn't act; they 
were just Elvis fanatics." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, Factor made another Elvis fanatic sighting, a case of life truly 
imitating art. "On the day of the first reading," he says, "I spotted an item 
in The Times about people forming a Church of Elvis in Colorado!" Where and

THEATER REVIEW; 'TRIUMPH' GETS TO THE HEART OF ITS HEROINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T.H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Two girls in silk kimonos, both/Beautiful, one a gazelle." That's how, in his 
poem in memory of Ire land's Gore-Booth sisters, William Butler Yeats described 
the protagonists in Victoria E. Thompson's intriguing drama, "The Triumph of 
Maeve." 
</P>
<P>
 This first production of the play, at Theatre East, paints a less chauvinistic 
picture of the sisters, the elder of whom married a Polish count and became the 
heroic Con Markievicz of the 1916 Irish uprising, and the younger of whom, Eva, 
was a suffragist and poet. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's play is a strong piece of writing as it deals out the emotional 
cards that dictate the shifting familial relationships of Constance (Con) and 
Eva. In addition, within the measure and weight of those relationships, 
Thompson etches the emotions and logic of both the centuries-old Irish hatred 
of the English and their rule, and the burgeoning power of the suffragist 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of its emotional and political depth, however, the script, in its 
present form, is overly cinematic. Scenes such as one in which feminist Esther 
Roper explains the movement to Eva, and another in which Con and suffragist 
Cristabel Pankhurst lead a rally, do nothing to build the tension. The 
pamphleteering exposition they provide is found in the more satisfying body of 
personal development elsewhere. These are only two moments among several that 
feel more like docudrama than drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Elaine Welton Hill makes even the less successful moments work with 
bravura staging, but she and the play are best paired at the human heart of the 
story -- in its relationships, not its news clips. There she and her exemplary 
cast suggest a richness of period and place, and the depth of detail is 
truthful and touching. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Thompson is powerful as Con, from her naively energetic youth to 
her hard and bitter maturity in an English prison. The transition is flawless, 
as is the simpler but more delicate metamorphosis of Nan McNamara's Eva from a 
state of emotional frustration to self-esteem. Eva's relationship with Esther 
Roper is given a subtlety and believability through the insightful performance 
of director Hill as Roper. The adoration and concern of Con's husband, Count 
Casimir Markievicz, are just as artfully drawn in George Clifton's 
characterization. 
</P>
<P>
 The incomparable supporting cast includes Eve Brenner's skyrocket of a Lady 
Gore-Booth, loving, crusty and wise; Peter Kaitlyn's silly, gormless 
brother-in-law, husband of the youngest Gore-Booth sister Mabel (Susan 
O'Sullivan); Maaren Edvard's cheerfully militant Pankhurst; John Hugo's steely 
brother Josslyn, and Hilary Kerrigan's solid, intelligent Maeve, Con's 
daughter. Where and When

COVER STORY; GATHERING NO DUST; COLLECTIBLES -- THEY'RE NOT ANTIQUES, BUT THEY 
HOLD JUST AS MUCH VALUE FOR THOSE WHO SEARCH FOR THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 You see them at swap meets and garage sales, antiques shows and flea markets. 
They have magnifying glasses in their pockets (the better to look for flaws and 
identifying marks, my dear) and a gleam in their eyes. They are not simply 
buyers. They are collectors, people whose notion of the good, the true and the 
beautiful extends to some very odd stuff indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 These are people who know what they want, whether it's a vintage Chatty Cathy 
doll, an old pocket watch, a 1940s cookie jar in the shape of a smiling pig or 
a pre-1969 Matchbox car in its original box. And when they find whatever 
functions as their own private Holy Grail, they are willing to pay top dollar 
for what looks to the rest of us -- the uninitiated, the unpossessed -- like 
junk. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not talking here about people who spend thousands of dollars for 
genuine antiques -- objects of varying degrees of fineness made more than a 
century ago. We are talking about people whose acquisitiveness is of a more 
personal, more idiosyncratic nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Such people see something that charms them, that amuses them, that reminds 
them of their childhood or their parents' childhoods, and they think, "Neat. I 
have to have that. Maybe I need more than one. Maybe I'm going to buy every 
single one I can find anywhere on the face of the Earth from now on. Oh, 
please, dear God, cloud the eye and paralyze the arm of anyone else who tries 
to collect them. Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 How weird do these obsessions get? Remember those paint-by-numbers sets that 
were all the rage among the "Howdy Doody" crowd? You think Pogs are hot today? 
At one point, Craft Master was cranking out 50,000 paint sets a day, and half 
the children in America were getting ulcers from trying to stay inside the 
lines. But the fact that the completed paintings are not rare, that the 
subjects range from the trite to the appalling and that the artists who 
completed them had to possess all the talent of a porch swing doesn't mean that 
people won't pay good money for them.  
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, actor Chevy Chase shelled out $250,000 for 200 choice examples, 
a collection that would be perfect if it only included the two critically 
acclaimed portraits of clown Emmett Kelly I did when I was 8. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The collecting virus -- the junking virus, if you will -- can strike anyone at 
any time. Van Nuys resident Natalie Hall got it several years ago during a trip 
through the Gold Rush country of Central California with friend Galen Kues. 
Kues has a collection of almost 4,000 beer cans, including some rare cone tops 
from the 1930s, and Hall couldn't help noticing that his passion for the 
foam-filled artifacts gave a pleasant urgency to their frequent stops at stores 
where collectibles were sold. Hall decided that she needed a passion of her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every store had fascinating old bottles, and that's how I got started," says 
Hall, who has a modest collection of 50 such bottles, mostly for 
turn-of-the-century patent medicines, as well as a handful of glass insulators 
once used to keep live wires away from wooden telephone poles. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many of her breed, Hall talks with lyrical enthusiasm about the odd 
objects she has painstakingly amassed. Love, after all, is notorious for its 
ability to transform the mundane. "They come in every color you can think of," 
she says. "I have one in a lovely blue-green that's just a delight." 
</P>
<P>
 And Hall, who writes educational materials for AIMS Media in Chatsworth, loves 
the tangible link her bottles give her to the past. For $16 (the most she's 
ever paid for one of her treasures) you can get a remarkable history lesson. 
Most of her favorites contained alleged cures marketed "before the Food and 
Drug Administration made it illegal to make outrageous claims." As a result, 
she has a bottle once full of hair tonic that promised results beyond Sy 
Sperling's wildest dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the era of paper labels, vital information was pressed right into the 
glass. Some of her favorites illuminate women's history, such as a bottle for a 
Lydia Pinkham tincture that promised to cure the ails that only women are heir 
to. "Women's health problems were not well understood -- they're still not, in 
my opinion -- and women flocked to anything that promised to give them relief 
from PMS or hot flashes," Hall says. She also has an old bitters bottle that 
recalls the time when no respectable woman would enter a bar or a liquor store, 
but a lady could drink herself comatose nipping at patent medicines that were 
virtually pure alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Local collectors stalk a remarkable range of stuff, from plastic snow globes 
to transistor radios, from Civil War memorabilia to early computers, from 
vintage vacuum cleaners to Pez dispensers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the collectibles being sought or sold in a single recent issue of the 
local Recycler, a favorite read of rabid junkers, were vintage lawn mowers, 
casino chips, coffins, GE refrigerators, Persian Gulf War memorabilia, stuffed 
animal heads, old safes, items made in occupied Japan, "Star Wars" figures and 
old Avon bottles in the shape of cars. There are always people in the market 
for Bakelite purses, advertising art, old cameras and salt-and-pepper shakers 
in every shape imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these have relatively long histories as collectibles, but new 
enthusiasms are being born all the time. A brisk market has developed in 
telecards, plastic cards issued by phone companies for prepaid calls. 
Collectors are already hoarding a series that promotes last summer's movie "The 
Flintstones." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Johnson, who manages the Sherman Oaks Antique Mall, says he never knows 
what to tell dealers who ask him what appeals to local collectors. "Everything 
sells," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But certain items can't miss. These include vases, dating from the '40s, '50s 
and '60s, in the shape of women's heads, which he calls lady-head vases or lady 
potheads. Five years ago, you could pick one of these up for $5 or $10. Now a 
choice one (some people especially like those on which the woman is holding her 
hand up to her face) commands $65. 
</P>
<P>
 Costume jewelry is also a bestseller. "People are now buying the kind of stuff 
our moms used to wear to church," Johnson says. But collectors don't want just 
any 40-year-old gold-wash earrings studded with fake pearls. They want those 
made by Trifari, tending to disdain those made by Monet. The market for costume 
jewelry extends far beyond the San Fernando Valley. "Japanese dealers take it 
out by the suitcase, and it's also popular with the Italians," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, "kitsch sells better in our store than antiques. We will sell a 
boomerang-shaped coffee table before we'll sell a crystal chandelier." Johnson 
speculates that this reflects the hipness of the local community. Los Angeles 
is, after all, the place where an inordinate number of trends are born. One 
result is that some traditional antiques and collectibles -- kitchen items such 
as juice reamers, for instance -- cost less here than they do in places where 
country is king, even places as close as Lancaster and Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Johnson, nothing is moving faster than toys from the late 1960s 
and early '70s. He can't get enough Nutty Mads, grotesque figures that 
38-year-old Johnson used to buy as a youngster for 79 cents and now sells for 
$45 apiece. He also sells enormous numbers of Hot Wheels race cars, which can 
bring $350 apiece (those from the late '60s to the early '70s with a red line 
on the tires are especially sought after). "I do $2,000 to $3,000 a month in 
Hot Wheels alone," Johnson says. "The $10 to $12 ones just fly out the door." 
</P>
<P>
 The typical toy car enthusiast -- a man of 25 to 30 with money in his pocket 
-- is a major force in the collectibles market. According to Ralph and Terry 
Kovel, who publish best-selling price guides to antiques and collectibles, 
Generation X is changing the very definition of a collectible. In the Kovels' 
view, "an 'antique' has become anything older than the buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has a theory as to why a 30ish collector was willing to pay $1,000 for 
a box of Quisp cereal and why dozens of young men compete for the Hot Wheels in 
his display cases. "They're either guys who had them then and want them again 
and can afford them," he speculates, "or they're trying to make up for 
something in their childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The desire to fill some emotional void is a motive for acquisition that many 
self-aware collectors acknowledge. Richard Carleton Hacker, for instance, is a 
writer, living in Burbank while his Sherman Oaks home is being repaired. The 
author of "The Ultimate Pipe Book" and "The Ultimate Cigar Book" (both 
published by Autumngold and available at tobacconists), Hacker is a collector 
of many things -- enough to fill 17 commercial storage bins, in fact -- 
including humidors and other tobacco-related items and anything to do with 
Teddy Roosevelt. But some of his passions reflect the hole-in-the-heart school 
of collecting, Hacker admits. 
</P>
<P>
 He has 200 vintage train sets and has no doubt that part of the reason he 
loves to buy them is that his parents couldn't afford to give him one as a 
child. And he also suspects that his fondness for Christmas collectibles, 
including such crossover items as Santa Clauses smoking pipes, date back to his 
Orthodox Jewish upbringing, when Christmas seemed a wonderful, exotic event 
that included everyone but him. (Hacker maintains that you don't have to be 
Gentile to love the North Pole. "It never diluted my religious upbringing," he 
says.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Hacker is a collector, he is amazed at what some people will buy. 
When he had a post-quake garage sale, there was a buyer for virtually 
everything he bothered to carry outside. Someone bought a bronze elk that lost 
its antlers in the quake "so what was a bull elk was now a cow elk" for $10. 
Hacker writes knowledgeably about small-batch bourbons and single-malt whiskeys 
and was amazed to find people would pay for his empties, such as the handsome 
bottle in which Jim Beam distributes its Knob Creek bourbon. "I had finished up 
the bottle the night before," he recalls. "I rinsed it out, put it out there 
and somebody bought it for $2." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some Valley collectors have a very personal interest in the items they seek. 
Former teen heartthrob David Cassidy and his wife, Sue Shifrin, are regulars at 
the Sherman Oaks Antique Mall, the monthly shows at the Pickwick Entertainment 
Center and the Equestrian Center in Burbank and other venues. Their 3-year-old 
son, Beau, shows signs of becoming a collector of Mickey Mouse, Alvin and the 
Chipmunks and objects related to horses. Shifrin collects Lalique glass, 
antique jewelry and vintage needlework that she thinks could be made into 
pillows. Cassidy likes Art Deco watches and Weller and Roseville pottery.

 The family is also always on the lookout for items relating to "The Partridge 
Family," the musical sitcom that Cassidy starred in from 1970 to 1974. "David 
has some pristine lunch boxes," Shifrin says, mostly given to him by fans. "One 
time we found an old David Cassidy guitar, one of these little plastic things. 
He was very tempted, but it had a crack in it, and they wanted too much for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest Partridge Family collectible of all -- the bus -- has managed to 
elude them, despite reported sightings in Downtown Los Angeles and Pacoima. 
"David has always wanted to buy the bus and donate it to the Smithsonian," 
Shifrin says.

 Frank Piccolo owns Piccolo Pete's, a Sherman Oaks shop whose stock includes 
everything from classic Ronson cigarette lighters to the blond wood bedroom 
sets that young marrieds of the 1940s and '50s regarded as the height of 
modernity. 
</P>
<P>
 As a collector as well as a dealer, Piccolo makes no apologies for his 
fondness for Fiestaware, and not just because it has skyrocketed in value. 
"Yes, they're material things," he says of his beloved turquoise plates and 
ebony cups and saucers. "But they give you enjoyment that other people may not. 
And it's a hell of a lot better than doing drugs. And you don't have to pay 
alimony." Junkers' Strategies 
</P>
<P>
 Hard core collectors prepare for their forays as if for war. Mary Randolph 
Carter, author of a new coffee table book on collecting called "American Junk" 
(Viking Studio Books), offers serious junkers this advice: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dress for the occasion in layers. She collects old fishing vests for the 
purpose and tucks credit cards, pre-moistened towelettes and other survival 
items into the many pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't carry your purse -- it gets in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure you have lots of $1 dollar bills and checks on you. Some dealers 
won't make change. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't hesitate to haggle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never, never walk away from something you fall in love with. You may never 
see it again.

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; SINGING OLD GEMS; DIAMONDS' HITS HAVEN'T LOST THEIR LUSTER 
FOR THE LEAD SINGER OF THE '50S GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The year is 1957. You and your significant other are cruising in your Chevy. 
The radio is blaring a new song by a singing group called the Diamonds. The 
world is right and you're in love. 
</P>
<P>
 You can recapture some of the magic this weekend, right here in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 David Somerville, lead singer for the 1950s singing group the Diamonds, will 
be singing at Foley's Family Restaurant in Shadow Hills tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diamonds were a Canadian vocal group that had 16 hits between 1956 and 
1961, 10 of which were cover versions of songs previously recorded by R & B 
artists. Their biggest hit was "Little Darlin'," a song originally done by the 
Gladiolas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the fifth song in a four-song session," Somerville remembers. "It was 
3 or 4 in the morning; we rehearsed it and cut it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Diamonds' version stayed at No. 2 in the charts for eight consecutive 
weeks in 1957. According to Billboard, it still holds the record for the 
second-longest run at the No. 2 position. Somerville remembers a singer named 
Elvis Presley was in first place during that eight-week stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Other hits by the Diamonds included "Why Do Fools Fall in Love?", "The Stroll" 
and "Silhouettes." The Diamonds toured with such rock / pop pioneers as Buddy 
Holly, Chuck Berry, the Everly Brothers, Roy Orbison, Paul Anka and Little 
Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, almost 40 years later, Somerville, 61, is still at it. He recently made 
two recordings: an album of songs written by Clyde Otis, who penned the 
Diamonds' million-seller, "The Stroll," and a children's music album, "The 
Cosmic Adventures of Diamond Dave in Dreamtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Somerville spends a lot of time on the road, appearing in '50s nostalgia shows 
and also as part of the New Four Preps. For the past three years -- when he's 
not traveling -- the Hollywood Hills resident has used Foley's as a Friday 
night musical workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," he says. "I love to see people light up when I sing something 
that was a hit years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 David Somerville performs from 7 to 10 tonight at Foley's Family Restaurant, 
9685 Sunland Blvd., Shadow Hills. No cover. Call (818) 353-7433.

 REMEMBRANCE: The Los Angeles Jewish Symphony will perform the closing concert 
of its season, "The Symphony Sings," on Sunday. Noreen Green, the ensemble's 
music director, has selected works by Dimitri Shostakovich, Serge Prokofiev, 
Eric Zeisl and Valley resident Michael Isaacson. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaacson, whose piece "Ezkerah -- In Memory of My Mother" will premiere 
Sunday, has worked extensively as a composer, arranger and conductor in film 
and television, in addition to conducting and producing recordings of the 
Munich Philharmonic, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico City Symphony, the Tel 
Aviv Symphony and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaacson says that he wrote "Ezkerah" (Hebrew for remembrance) as his way of 
dealing with the pain of his mother's death, and that the piece reflects her 
identity and their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 He also says that, for a composer, the performance of a work is usually a 
moment of confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The artist will be confirming and the son will be remembering," Isaacson said 
of Sunday's performance. "There will be two parts of me sitting there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Jewish Symphony performs at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at Adat Ari El, 
12020 Burbank Blvd., North Hollywood. Tickets are $36 for reserved seating, $18 
general admission, and $10 students and senior citizens. Call (818) 753-6681.

<P>
 STILL LAUGHING: "Thursday Nite Live" is entering its third year at the L. A. 
Connection Comedy Theatre, and producer Steve North thinks that he knows why. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are tired of the standard stand-up comedy club format," he says. "This 
is different; people can't get it in the clubs or on television. It's a cross 
between theater and stand-up." 
</P>
<P>
 The show, directed and produced by North and his wife, Barb, has a cast of 
eight stand-up comedians drawn from a rotating ensemble of about 30 performers. 
Using different people each week allows the show to constantly change, North 
says. Also, it uses videos on a giant screen, groups of stand-up comics all on 
stage at the same time and other comic inventions to offer an alternative to 
the usual string of one comic after another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like taking eight comedians and cross-wiring them," North said. "We're 
more character-based. This is an actual show that has a beginning, a middle and 
an end." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thursday Nite Live" begins at 9 p.m. Thursdays (except Thanksgiving) at the 
L. A. Connection Comedy Theatre, 13442 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. Admission 
is $8. Call (818) 710-1320.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: AN ILLUMINATING FIND; CANDLE SHOWROOM OFFERS FLICKERING 
GEMS, IN TRADITIONAL OR WHIMSICAL STYLES, FOR GIFTS OR FOR HOME.

 A shopping spree at General Wax & Candle is a fine launching pad for the 
holidays. Candles in every shape and form are sold here at wholesale prices. 
The company manufactures about 80% of the product carried in the factory store. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you're planning to utilize candles to add a special glow to your home 
or to give as gifts, it's a good idea to make a list before you go. Many of the 
items look so appealing, it's easy to get carried away. After one visit, I now 
wish I had purchased more of some and less of others. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is the perfect time to shop here, since the annual Holiday Blowout 
Sale is on until Dec. 10, and all General Wax & Candle products are 25% off the 
wholesale prices. Merchandise not of their own making is discounted an 
additional 15% in the 1,000-square-foot showroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Start in the close-out room, where everything is 70% below wholesale. Some 
irregulars are here, but with only minor flaws. Gold and silver tapers go for 
$4 a dozen, compared to $1.25 apiece at many stores. Column candles, 3 inches 
around and 9 inches tall, good as gifts or part of a gift basket, are only 
$2.25. These can run as high as $8 to $10 at other places. 
</P>
<P>
 In the main showroom, there are some colossal candles with three wicks that 
measure 8 inches tall and 6 inches across. These usually wholesale for $32, but 
the sale price is $27.20 -- for a candle that usually retails for $50 to $60. 
At the other extreme are the tea lights, which are tempting at 83 cents for a 
package of 10 or try a case of 250 for $18. 
</P>
<P>
 There are scented and votive candles, floaters and glow candles, pyramid 
candles and an amazing assortment of mystical figures including wizards and 
castles and sorcerers and dragons. One large dragon that has retailed for $150 
regularly sells here for $39; on sale it's $33.15.  
</P>
<P>
 I loved the Siamese cats that stand 12 1/2 inches tall and come in black or 
white. But they are too pretty to light just to watch disappear. Manager Scott 
Messick says the cats have a short burning life so most people don't light 
them. You could place a tea light in the head after the wick has burned down a 
bit, which would extend the burning time.The cats wholesale for $17 but are 
further discounted to $14.45. 
</P>
<P>
 An elegant white swan (7 by 7 inches) would make a handsome centerpiece for a 
holiday table. The swans cost $11.05. Retail on the cat or swan ranges from $20 
to $25. 
</P>
<P>
 There are candles in the shape of teddy bears, angels, winged horses, dogs, 
Western hats or boots, horseshoes, even a howling coyote. Some charming roses 
would be effective as part of a table setting. The roses retail for $6 and are 
usually $3.35 here, but until Dec. 10 they are $2.76. Smaller versions are 
$1.06 each. 
</P>
<P>
 This store is an excellent source for quality candles bargains, and during the 
sale it's even better. Where to Shop

3-HOUR TOUR: DECIDEDLY UN-MALL-LIKE; SEVERAL TERRIFIC BOUTIQUES LINE A SECTION 
OF RIVERSIDE DRIVE THAT EXTENDS FROM BURBANK TO TOLUCA LAKE.

<P>
 Nostalgic Toluca Lake is more than just home to Bob Hope and the birthplace of 
the "Our Gang" comedies. This charming enclave of sprawling residential pads is 
rife with charming shops and engaging little neighborhood restaurants. Its 
decidedly un-mall-like atmosphere appeals to browsers and serious spenders 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several terrific boutiques along Riverside Drive, extending from 
Burbank to Toluca Lake, and a particularly noteworthy segment on Riverside runs 
between Maple and Evergreen streets, which lie on either side of Pass Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the shops are directly on the Burbank and Toluca Lake borders, the 
cities they call home vary, but all share the same homey feel.  
</P>
<P>
 11 a.m.: Start at Priscilla's Gourmet Coffee, Tea & Gifts. This quaint 
beverage emporium serves as a home away from home to poets, aspiring actors, 
bell-bottomed groovers and muumuu-clad matrons. Indulge in one of the many 
regular coffees, or splurge on a frosty granita or a yogi latte (tea and 
steamed milk). Take a bistro table inside the bustling shop and admire the 
hand-painted murals, or grab one of the polyurethane numbers out front for al 
fresco people-watching. 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of baked goods (muffins, bagels and some decadent sticky buns) 
complement the beverages. Like any other coffeehouse worth their weight in 
beans, the store offers the de rigueur assortment of artistic mugs, thermos 
carafes, dainty teacups and other caffeine-related merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla's Gourmet Coffee, Tea & Gifts, 4150 Riverside Drive, Toluca Lake 
(818) 843-5707.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 11:30 a.m.: Cross the street and walk a few blocks down Riverside Drive to 
Antique Attic. Inside this rabbit's warren of booths, 12 dealers offer a wide 
variety of loot ranging from $1 to $15,000. Start at the back and work your way 
forward to avoid getting sidetracked by the many offshoots. On the left side, 
blue jeans connoisseurs will enjoy rifling through assorted dungarees in 
various faded hues of indigo. There are scores of 78-speed records, old 
magazines and comic books too. Fashion plates won't be able to keep from eyeing 
an alligator handbag -- in pristine condition -- for an amazing $85 -- 
seemingly steep but far less than the $600 to $800 a new one would fetch. 
</P>
<P>
 The store also offers new merchandise: infant clothing in festive, whimsical 
prints by My Little Cherub selling for between $35 to $50. Oriental art 
enthusiasts take note: there is a respectable assortment of cinnabar and 
cloisonne vases, plates and figurines. Perhaps the most noteworthy vases are 
the giant 19th-Century Italian urns, formerly housed in The Biltmore in 
Downtown Los Angeles; the pair sells for $15,000. And how about a "General 
Hospital" poster signed by the cast of this ABC soap opera, circa 1983? It 
sells for $245, a proverbial bargain for die-hard Luke and Laura fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Antique Attic, 4005 Riverside Drive, Burbank (818) 556-7155.

</P>
<P>
 12:15 a.m.: Saunter a few doors down to Two Sisters, where siblings Marsha 
Masterman and Jan Wright devote themselves and their store to romantic fashion. 
Their 465-square-foot boutique is filled with feminine, Deauville-inspired 
dresses, separates and lingerie, many made by local designers. The shop's 
rose-colored walls enhanced with hand-painted stencils are lined with 
ankle-grazing dresses in unusual prints, including some by local San Fernando 
Valley designer T.T. Mar that are actually hand-stamped. 
</P>
<P>
 Demure, one-of-a-kind cloches and sunbonnets enhanced with hand-applied floral 
and French ribbon trims further enhance the romantic appeal of the clothes. 
There are sexy slips for sleeping or for lining the sheer dresses, and an 
assortment of clingy stretch lace T's and tres en vogue thermal cotton tops. 
Intricate earrings, pins, necklaces and jacket clips are elaborately displayed 
near the store's back wall to tempt those on stricter budgets.  
</P>
<P>
 Two Sisters, 4150 Riverside Drive, Unit C, Burbank (818) 559-1549 . 
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 12:45 p.m.: Don't miss Trinkets & Treasures, one of the newest arrivals on 
Riverside Drive at Alameda. The shop, which debuted in April, is home to 
unusual gifts and jewelry, many made by Valley artisans. Most unusual is the 
shop's assortment of scrapbooks covered with elaborate trims and sumptuous 
fabrics. There are baroque-inspired gilded picture frames, as well as more 
modern brass, pewter and bronze styles. 
</P>
<P>
 An extensive collection of vintage jewelry runs the gamut from Blackmoor pins 
to trendier marcasite pieces. Some pieces -- including a few from Kenneth Jay 
Lane -- are signed, a bonus for die-hard collectors. Sabino's 
not-so-easy-to-find rainbow-hued urns and figurines are also available. 
</P>
<P>
 4200 Riverside Drive, Toluca Lake (818) 556-3700.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 1:20 p.m.: Duck into Bake It Again, Sam, the neighborhood bagel cafe, for a 
quick bite. It, too, has outdoor tables. Budget-conscious diners can grab lunch 
for as little as $1.90 for a bagel featuring any of the shop's flavored cream 
cheeses. Perpetual dieters may want to try the non-fat tuna salad bagel 
sandwich ($4.25.) 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of interesting desserts.

GREAT SOUND, BUT THE WRONG KIND

<P>
 On Saturday nights, Fantasia Northridge opens its door to a 21-and-older crowd 
looking for house, R & B and old-school music. There may not be a long wait 
outside, but if you are a hip-hop fan, you may encounter a lengthy wait for 
three or four rap songs back to back, while the house music seems to go on for 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 SCENE: The inside looks like Greg Brady's room when he moved into Mike's 
office and turned it into a hippie love nest. The club is small and very '70s 
with lots of purple, hot pink and turquoise neon lighting. A huge, mirrored 
wall borders one side of the dance floor and the air remains thick due to the 
steady use of fog machines. The DJ booth sits above the dance floor in a dark 
but spacious lounge area. By 11 p.m., two hours after opening, the place is in 
full swing with all the tables filled and the dance floor packed. 
</P>
<P>
 CROWD: Finally, a place where people wearing jeans were in the minority. The 
dress code is fashionable, meaning no hats, tennis shoes, T-shirts, tank tops 
and ripped or baggy jeans. Of course, there were a smattering of people inside 
who violated the restrictions, but most were dressed to impress -- women in 
tank dresses and heels, men in button-down shirts, sweaters and dress pants. 
</P>
<P>
 MUSIC: This is one of those places where the bass rattles your sternum. The 
sound system is outstanding, but can be annoying if the music is not your type. 
For example, KPWR DJ Charlie Huero is featured every Saturday night spinning 
blocks of hip-hop, retro and house music. Yet many said the music was way too 
heavy on the house and techno. When the hip-hop and old school eventually 
played, the crowd stampeded onto the floor to such favorites as "Funkytown" 
from Lipps Inc. and rap songs Volume 10's "Pistol Grip Pump," and "Tootsee 
Roll," from the 69 Boyz. 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD: Marvin Williams, 34, of West Covina noticed the mixture of whites, 
Latinos and African Americans in the crowd. "I like the wide variety of people, 
and it's cheap to get in, only $7," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 BAD: The long stretches of house music seem to annoy people the most. "This 
club would be phat if the DJ would play less aerobic class music and more 
dance, R & B and hip-hop," complained Katrina McKnight, 26, of Van Nuys. Also, 
Jodi Hudson, 28, of Canoga Park, thought the men were a little stiff. "They're 
too chicken to dance," she said. "They just stand around the dance floor and 
look at you."  
</P>
<P>
 WORD: "This place looks exactly the same as when we used to come in 1988," 
said a woman in her mid-20s to her friend, who nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Fantasia, 19470 Nordhoff St., Northridge. Cover $7, women admitted free before 
10:30 p.m. Hours: 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Saturdays only. Information line: (818)

U.S. TO STOP BLOCKING BOSNIA ARMS SHIPMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has ordered the U.S. military to stop enforcing the 
United Nations arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina, officials said Thursday 
-- a largely symbolic action but one that has drawn private protests from U.S. 
allies in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new policy, which goes into effect Saturday, U.S. Navy ships in the 
Adriatic Sea no longer will halt vessels that appear to be carrying weapons to 
Bosnia or Croatia but will continue to stop arms shipments bound for Serbia, 
which with Montenegro comprises the rump Yugoslavia, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, U.S. intelligence agencies will stop sharing information that 
they have collected with Britain, France, Italy and other members of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization that still are attempting to enforce the arms 
embargo against Bosnia, as called for by U.N. resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which officials stressed was made to comply with a law passed by 
Congress earlier this year, already has prompted sharp complaints from other 
NATO countries, which have thousands of troops on the ground in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have informed them of what we are doing . . . and we can't say that they 
are happy," a senior State Department official acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. action falls short of a decision to break with the U.N. arms embargo 
against Bosnia, however. And, indeed, the Administration will still obey the 
embargo in principle, while refusing to enforce it in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials predicted that the action would have little practical 
effect on the flow of weapons into Bosnia or any other part of the former 
Yugoslav federation, which has been at war since the federation collapsed in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Bosnia's weaponry has arrived overland or by air, and three years of 
naval embargo operations have had little effect, a senior Pentagon official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousands of ships have been intercepted -- tens of thousands -- and only 
three have been found to contain arms for the Bosnian Muslims," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Administration officials expect the other NATO countries that have 
participated in the operation to continue enforcing the embargo against Bosnia 
-- so that, while Bosnian arms smugglers need no longer fear the U.S. Navy, 
they will still have to look out for British and French ships. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will probably be switching positions," one official said, meaning that 
U.S. ships will concentrate on patrolling the coast of the rump Yugoslavia, 
while the Europeans focus on the Bosnian and Croatian coastlines. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said that the Administration is adopting the awkward new policy 
for one reason: Congress has required it by law. The Administration wants the 
United Nations to lift its arms embargo on Bosnia entirely, but Britain, France 
and other members of the U.N. Security Council -- which decides such questions 
-- have refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Congress, impatient with such diplomatic niceties, had passed laws 
requiring the United States to stop enforcing the embargo by Saturday and to 
cut off all funding for the operation by Tuesday. "Basically, this is a matter 
of adhering to the law," a Pentagon official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the wider context of our policy on Bosnia, we don't have many options, and 
we have no good options," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic U.S. aim is to pressure the Bosnian Serbs, who have seized about 70% 
of Bosnia's territory, to accept an internationally negotiated agreement that 
would leave them with 49%. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve that, the Administration has been trying to escalate economic 
sanctions against both Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs and has tried to increase 
military pressure against the Bosnian Serbs with more frequent NATO airstrikes 
if they violate U.N. and NATO restrictions on military action. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, this (decision) adds another element of pressure against the 
Bosnian Serbs," the Pentagon official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were sensitive about the friction that the action has caused within 
NATO, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, NATO had pointed to its enforcement of the arms embargo as a rare 
example of the old Cold War alliance finding a useful mission in the post-Cold 
War world. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the joint embargo operation has been under the command of NATO's 
southern European operations, headed by U.S. Navy Adm. J. Leighton Smith Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said it was unclear whether the chain of command would have to be 
altered now that the United States is not taking part in some operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. refusal to share intelligence with its allies could be a particularly 
sore spot, some officials said. The Pentagon asked for and received approval 
for exceptions to be made in cases where sharing the intelligence would help 
protect either U.S. or NATO personnel from harm, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain, France and other countries with peacekeeping troops on the ground in 
Bosnia have long complained that the United States -- with no troops there -- 
pays little attention to the impact of its policies on their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a point," one U.S. official said. "This action is likely to 
increase the risks to U.N. forces in Bosnia."

OFFICIALS DRAW FIRE FOR USE OF TAX FUNDS TO FIGHT 187; GOVERNMENT: SUPPORTERS 
OF THE CONTROVERSIAL NEW LAW CHARGE THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS BEING 
IGNORED.

 As elected officials in Los Angeles and communities up and down the state 
launch legal challenges to Proposition 187, an angry groundswell of criticism 
has arisen over use of public funds to undo what the measure's backers see as a 
clear mandate from the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged callers lit up switchboards Thursday at the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, Los Angeles City Hall and other agencies that had joined the 
effort to overturn the anti-illegal immigration measure approved Tuesday by 
nearly 60% of the state's voters. And the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors postponed a decision on its own legal challenge after a torrent of 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the final months of the bitterly contested campaign drove a political 
wedge into the California electorate, it appeared that the struggle over 
implementation of the landmark law was opening deep new fissures in the 
political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the pro-Proposition 187 headquarters said they were inundated 
with calls Thursday from fired-up supporters wanting to join recall efforts or 
class-action lawsuits against officials involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost hit the roof. What is this?" said Afrodite Dacoles, a Hollywood 
retiree and Proposition 187 supporter who was venting her furor Thursday in 
calls to elected officials. "This is not right. We put this issue in. It's the 
law and they are trying to fight it with my money." 
</P>
<P>
 Computer programmer Diane Shook also was on the phone and ready to sign up for 
any and all recall campaigns against officials using tax funds to try to block 
the measure. "There's no point in voting anymore," said the 41-year-old 
Woodland Hills resident, who became furious after listening to a discussion on 
a radio talk show. "My concern is: Why am I paying taxes? Why aren't they 
listening to us?" 
</P>
<P>
 Officials leading the challenges to Proposition 187 acknowledged that a strong 
backlash was hitting Thursday. Los Angeles school board offices were deluged 
with calls. Several Los Angeles City Council offices also reported dozens of 
protests. There were reports of school boards in various areas of the state 
being peppered with complaints. Even supporters of the measure -- including 
Gov. Pete Wilson -- were fielding large numbers of calls protesting the 
tax-dollar-backed lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sacramento City Unified School District, which joined Los Angeles, San 
Francisco and a coalition of districts in a lawsuit to overturn parts of 
Proposition 187, had taken dozens of calls by Thursday afternoon. "People are 
(telling) us we shouldn't be spending public funds on this suit," said George 
Medovoy, a spokesman for the Sacramento district. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected leaders around California were defending their actions, saying they 
have an obligation to resolve legal conflicts presented by federal and state 
laws and the new initiative, which bars most public services to undocumented 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to know whether we deny library cards, playing golf at a city golf 
course or being in a victim assistance program . . . if they are in the country 
illegally," said Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn, who was directed by the 
City Council to try to clarify the measure by challenging its 
constitutionality. By Thursday, Hahn's office had three attorneys working on 
the matter, though that was expected to be cut back next week. Officials 
insisted that the cost would be minimal and absorbed into the city attorney's 
regular budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawsuits have been filed by civil rights groups and individuals 
challenging the measure, but Hahn insisted that the city was compelled to mount 
its own challenge. "I need to know from the courts what kind of legal advice to 
give all my city departments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials maintain that they have a moral and constitutional duty to 
protect the rights of all constituents, particularly children and the needy. 
Los Angeles Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg argued that lawmakers, in keeping with 
their oaths of office, had to file suit to defend the principles of the U.S. 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Board of Education President Mark Slavkin, a point man in the 
legal attack on the measure by school systems, said: "Our fundamental interest 
is to protect the rights of students -- that's our guiding motivation. We're 
fighting to uphold a basic issue in the Constitution, which is the right to 
free public education." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Loofbourrow, the president of the California School Boards Assn., said 
the organization is representing 700 of the 1,000 school districts in the state 
in the lawsuit. Loofbourrow said individual school districts are hearing from 
voters and "most people are expressing their concerns" about the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 But she added: "It's important for the districts to understand that we're in 
court to straighten out the conflicting legal directions that we've been given 
-- for their sakes. Are we supposed to be educating all children or not?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles and San Francisco school districts, which are being 
represented by the large Los Angeles law firm of Munger, Tolles & Olson, said 
they did not know how much the legal battle ultimately will cost, though they 
stressed that the burden was being shared by many districts. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all. The Antelope Valley Union High School District is among those 
that opted out of the legal challenge. Board member Billy Pricer said districts 
should refrain from using public dollars on legal efforts to block Proposition 
187. "I don't think this is appropriate," Pricer said. "The voters have spoken 
-- that's it. I would prefer they didn't spend all this money on legal 
battles." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cost, Slavkin conceded that the Los Angeles board's stand is 
likely to cause problems for incumbents next spring, when most face reelection 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "For people who feel passionately on this issue, they're frustrated that no 
sooner did they vote for something and it's mired in the court system," he 
said. "I think they'll be looking at potential targets to vent their anger. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "But leadership requires that you do what you think is right, and not just 
duck for cover when there is an outburst of public anger." 
</P>
<P>
 Repercussions were also being heard at City Hall, where the council voted 10 
to 3 Wednesday to direct Hahn to challenge the measure. The council also 
instructed city agencies to hold off on enforcing the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are concerned that they are not seeing immediate enforcement," said 
City Council President John Ferraro, whose office had received about 15 
telephone complaints by midday Thursday. "But we have a responsibility to get 
the answers, or we could be exposed to severe liability" by enacting an unclear 
and contested law. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the Proposition 187 court challenges raised the specter of past 
ballot measures that won overwhelming support from the voters, only to be 
thrown into the courts. Property-tax-slashing Proposition 13 was challenged by 
many government agencies after its passage in 1978; it ultimately was upheld by 
the courts. Car insurance rate rollbacks ordered a decade later in Proposition 
103 were challenged by insurance companies, and many consumers still have not 
received their rebate checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight over implementation also appeared to be the ready-made stuff of 
campaign mailer hit pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 One candidate with his eye on a City Council seat was preparing to make 
implementation of Proposition 187 part of next spring's campaign. Mark Ryavec, 
a lobbyist from Venice who opposed the initiative, hopes to topple Councilwoman 
Ruth Galanter, who supported the city's challenge to the measure. "It is going 
to be an issue. In Ruth's case, it reflects her sort of pointy-headed liberal 
approach to issues in the city. At some point, you have to trust the will of 
the people." 
</P>
<P>
 But Galanter responded: "People often complain that politicians are not 
showing leadership and that we shouldn't wait for our constituents. Now, in 
this case, people are saying . . . that I should move aside and let the tide 
roll on, regardless of the fact that I took an oath to uphold the Constitution 
of the United States and the state of California. To me, that is leadership, to 
stand up even when popular sentiment is not on your side." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Prince, a leader of the pro-Proposition 187 campaign who fielded dozens of 
the protest calls Thursday at his group's Orange County headquarters, said his 
reading of popular sentiment is that people are revved up to take on local 
governments if they buck the voters' will. "I think you are going to see some 
legal action. . . . People are asking, 'How can they possibly do this?' "

L.A. SUPERVISORS DECLINE TO JOIN PROP. 187 CHALLENGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Reacting cautiously in the face of the strong public support for Proposition 
187, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Thursday declined to join 
other local government bodies in pursuing an immediate legal challenge to the 
anti-illegal immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, coming a day after the Los Angeles City Council and the Los 
Angeles Unified School District decided to press lawsuits, appeared to signify 
an acknowledgment both of the measure's 59%-41% margin at the polls and an 
emerging backlash against a rash of lawsuits -- eight statewide at last count 
-- to block its implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters have made it quite clear in all of the supervisorial districts 
that they don't want a lawsuit," said Supervisor Mike Antonovich, a strong 
supporter of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The board did, however, agree to direct county employees, who are responsible 
for administering many of the health and social welfare services covered under 
the initiative, not to implement any portions of Proposition 187 until the 
legal challenges are sorted out. 
</P>
<P>
 The first scheduled showdown will come Wednesday, when the state attorney 
general's office and civil rights lawyers are due in a federal courtroom in Los 
Angeles to debate a motion to suspend the sweeping measure, which bans illegal 
immigrants from publicly funded educational, social service and non-emergency 
health programs and requires officials to turn in the names of suspected 
illegal immigrants to state and federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments on the second day after California's landmark vote: 
</P>
<P>
 * Several hospitals and clinics in the Los Angeles area reported a decline in 
patient levels. The drop-off, officials said, was an indication that illegal 
immigrants are fearful of being reported to federal authorities and are 
beginning to stay away -- even though medical facilities are not currently 
denying services or turning in anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 * A series of small anti-187 rallies continued, including walkouts at UCLA and 
several other UC law schools. Former state Supreme Court Justice Cruz Reynoso, 
a UCLA faculty member, addressed the demonstrators, saying passage of the 
ballot measure only served to heighten already strained racial and ethnic 
tensions in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 * A coalition of more than 50 Asian American organizations prepared flyers in 
seven languages to urge undocumented Asian residents to remain calm and 
continue seeking government services. Estelle Chun of the Asian Pacific 
American Legal Center of Southern California said her agency heard from an 
undocumented Korean woman who was afraid to call police -- for fear of being 
reported -- even though her husband had beaten her. 
</P>
<P>
 * Co-sponsors of the initiative gave conflicting messages in interviews about 
how they would like to see forthcoming state regulations for implementing 
Proposition 187 worded. Co-author Harold Ezell said the word suspect should not 
be included in any regulations because it is too inflammatory. But Ron Prince, 
who headed the pro-187 campaign committee, says he has no problems with the 
word, which appeared several times in the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince also said that the flurry of lawsuits by groups ranging from the school 
boards to the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, could lead 
to countersuits and recall elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can certainly see the beginnings of a class-action lawsuit against the Los 
Angeles Unified School District -- in others words, we'll sue them for suing 
us," he said. "And we do have in the state of California a recall process. That 
may very well come into play." Supervisors' Decision 
</P>
<P>
 The county board said it would monitor the progress of lawsuits already filed 
in state and federal courts rather than prepare its own. The board indicated 
that it may still pursue some legal remedy, on its own or by joining one of the 
challenges already filed, depending on how strictly the state signals it will 
interpret and enforce the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the measure's passage, lawyers representing civil rights 
organizations filed suit in the Los Angeles federal district court to thwart 
its implementation. U.S. District Judge Matthew Byrne Jr. scheduled a hearing 
on the legal arguments for next Wednesday and strongly indicated that until 
then, he wanted enforcement of the entire measure held in abeyance. 
</P>
<P>
 The county supervisors' decision, made in closed session, appeared to reflect 
the potential pitfalls of opposing a measure that has garnered widespread 
public support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been deluged, but we are getting calls from people with the 
general sentiment being they don't want public money expended on a lawsuit to 
oppose this," said Fred MacFarlane, press deputy to Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke. "I would assume the other offices are getting this as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was supported by a narrow majority of voters in Burke's South Los 
Angeles district, which has mostly Latino and African American residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision today was a positive sign that elected officials are listening 
to the public," Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina, who had initially urged the board to file its own 
federal lawsuit, had a different take. "My interest is in protecting the 
well-being of the county and its residents, but first I have to find out what 
kinds of directions the governor is going to give us before we go into court to 
contest anything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are interested in being effective and not just in grandstanding, and that 
is why we are taking a wait-and-see attitude," said Supervisor Ed Edelman. 
"Granted, when an initiative passes, the voters have spoken, but they may have 
spoken in an unconstitutional way." 
</P>
<P>
 The board made one exception to its business-as-usual policy for employees. 
Sheriff's deputies will be asked to enforce the initiative's crackdown on the 
illegal sale and possession of fake identity cards. Hospitals and Clinics 
</P>
<P>
 From South-Central to the Eastside, hospitals and clinics in Los Angeles began 
reporting declines in patient numbers in the wake of the proposition's 
landslide victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some reports, mostly from inner-city hospitals, that their clinics 
and emergency room patient loads have dropped off," said David Langness of the 
Hospital Council of Southern California. "It means people are jeopardizing 
their health for fear of being turned in to the INS. We want to emphasize that 
we're not turning anyone in." 
</P>
<P>
 Langness, whose agency was a vocal critic of Proposition 187, said the 
drop-off in patients Thursday could not be attributed to the often-heavy 
morning rain. "We saw some drop-off Wednesday and it continued today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The patient load dropped by about two-thirds at the Community Health 
Foundation of East Los Angeles on Whittier Boulevard, officials reported. The 
cause was clearly fear of Proposition 187, not the rainy weather, said 
Executive Director Rodolfo Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are scared to come in. People are staying home," Diaz said. People 
have heard about Proposition 187 and they think they are going to get 
reported." The clinic, which serves about 138,000 patients a year and receives 
about a third of its budget from state funds, will continue to treat all people 
regardless of immigration status, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Arroyo Vista Family Health Center in Highland Park, as many as 60 
patients -- more than a third of the daily schedule -- failed to show up for 
appointments Wednesday and the trend continued on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinic director Lorraine Estrada blamed the cancellations on fear of the 
impact of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are scared," said Estrada, who said staffers were working the 
telephones trying to reassure patients, mostly women and children. "We're 
spending a lot of time on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 Some health facilities, however, reported no appreciable drop in patient 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 At the state level, officials of the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health 
Systems said they have advised their members to continue business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait for further guidance from the courts or the (state) Department of Health 
Services prior to implementation of the provisions of Proposition 187" read a 
memo faxed by the association to its member hospitals.  
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the ballot measure was approved, Gov. Pete Wilson issued an 
executive order directing health care providers to discontinue prenatal 
services for illegal immigrants as soon as legally permissible and to halt new 
admissions of illegal immigrants to nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But hospital association attorney Lilly Spitz said Thursday that the 
organization's business-as-usual directive applies to both categories of 
services. Los Angeles County will also continue providing prenatal services, 
based on advice of its county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the governor's executive order, a memo issued by the Department of 
Health Services says that prenatal benefits cannot be terminated without proper 
notice. A spokeswoman for the governor explained that the state is required to 
give a 60-day notice before ending such benefits under the Medi-Cal program. 
Federal Reaction 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said Thursday that 
they were studying Wilson's request that the INS assist in verifying whether 
applicants for publicly funded services are legally entitled to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Stern, chief spokesman for U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, said the INS wants 
to determine the "burden" that providing access to the agency's records would 
create in terms of staffing. Wilson, noting that California already uses the 
system to check on legal residency for driver's licenses and state-funded 
employment and training services, made the request in a letter to President 
Clinton Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern pointed out that California pays the INS for the use of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House aide said that the Administration felt no urgency about 
questions arising from passage of the measure because it "could be enjoined for 
a year or more" in state and federal courts. He said that lawyers were studying 
whether any of its provisions violate existing federal law and would therefore 
lead to a mandatory cutoff of federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a San Francisco Superior Court judge, acting on a lawsuit filed 
on behalf of the Los Angeles and San Francisco unified school districts and the 
California School Boards Assn., temporarily barred enforcement of the 
proposition's requirement that illegal immigrants be excluded from California 
public schools. In issuing his order, he cited a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court 
decision, Plyler vs. Doe. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the Justice Department would consider bringing a suit of its own 
against Proposition 187 or would join suits already filed, Reno said: 
"Speculation would be premature. I want to make an informed judgment based on 
what the state of California does, how it construes the proposition, how they 
propose to implement it." 
</P>

John Broder, Carol Chastang, Larry Gordon, Nancy Hill-Holtzman, Shawn Hubler, 
John Hurst, K. Connie Kang, Robert J. Lopez, Patrick J. McDonnell, Ron Ostrow, 
Doug Shuit and Beth Shuster. The Prop. 187 Paperwork 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Proposition 187 paperwork was mailed last week before passage of 
the initiative. This form, for use in turning in children and adults with 
"apparent illegal immigrant status," was sent to health, social service and law 
enforcement agencies, as well as public schools, which are enjoined from using 
it. State officials said Thursday that so far no one has been reported.

GOP ASSEMBLY GAINS MAY MAKE BRULTE SPEAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE and JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Brulte, a former advance man for President George Bush, may be on the 
verge of a political coup so rare in the California Assembly that Brulte was 
all of 12 years old the last time it happened: a Republican's election as 
Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The pragmatic two-term Rancho Cucamonga legislator had figured he would get 
GOP legislators within striking distance of taking control of the Assembly this 
year and then watch his successor finish the job in 1996, when he is barred by 
term limits from seeking reelection, or even 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 To his surprise, however, his campaign legwork paid off on Election Day and 
Republicans expect the 38-year-old Brulte to be the first GOP Assembly Speaker 
in a generation, ending the record 14-year reign of San Francisco Democrat 
Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brulte's ascendance is not certain, Republicans are optimistic. The 
Assembly will convene in December to choose a Speaker, which requires 41 votes 
from the 80 members. Based on unofficial election returns, the tally stands at 
40 Republican votes and 40 Democratic ones, but Republicans expect to pick up 
one more seat when absentee ballots are counted. Even then, a single defection 
could stop Brulte or, as has happened in the past, a coalition leader could 
emerge with backing from some members of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, to cheers and applause, GOP colleagues unanimously reelected a 
beaming Brulte as the Assembly's Republican leader. At a news conference later, 
Brulte sounded a conciliatory note -- even though he has yet to tally the 
necessary 41 votes -- saying he wanted to work with Democrats but also warning 
against any attempts "to steal a Republican victory."  
</P>
<P>
 Who is this man that most Californians have never heard of and whose 
formidable, 6-foot-4, 349-pound frame is reminiscent of the legendary 
Democratic Assembly Speaker Jesse M. Unruh, the original "big daddy" of 
California politics? 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte's friends describe him as a pragmatic conservative who relishes the 
back-room strategizing of politics. Others say he is non-ideological, allowing 
him to walk a narrow line between staunch conservatives and Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson, especially in budget squabbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who did not seek reelection, said 
Brulte's style is flexible, similar to that of U.S. Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.). If 
he assumes the speakership, Ferguson predicted, Brulte "will try to emulate 
Willie Brown in the building of power." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, too, praise Brulte for his political sense, which has brought him 
to the verge of accomplishing what half a dozen other GOP legislators have only 
dreamed about. They describe him as a cunning political operative fixated on 
winning an Assembly majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The shape of a Brulte speakership in a chaotic and narrowly divided Assembly 
remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 During Brown's lengthy tenure as Assembly Speaker, the job has been generally 
considered the second most powerful political position in state government. The 
Speaker appoints all the Assembly's committee heads and members, who screen all 
bills. Brown also gains power by collecting large amounts of campaign 
contributions from special interest groups and dispensing them to his 
Democratic allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer, a Hayward Democrat who took over his 
leadership post this year, said Brulte is "constructive and upbeat" but worries 
that the GOP legislator "occasionally feels compelled to assert the right-wing 
dogma that emanates from many of his caucus members. That's always a bit of a 
show stopper." Lockyer is expected to retain his post because a majority of 
Democrats remain in control of the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte says he would lobby for the Republican agenda that GOP legislators have 
pressed in recent years, including immigration reform, cracking down on crime 
and improving the business climate in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "When 41 Republicans are sworn in Dec. 5, and when we elect a Republican 
Speaker, the focus will turn to Republicans to govern," Brulte said Thursday. 
"We are excited about the opportunity and the prospect. It is our turn. And I 
promise you that Republicans will use this opportunity wisely." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he would favor a school prayer bill, Brulte said: "If you ask me if I 
think there is anything wrong with a moment of silence in the public school, no 
I do not. I would support such a bill." 
</P>
<P>
 But Assemblywoman Kathleen Honeycutt (R-Hesperia), who did not seek 
reelection, said Brulte does not believe in fighting unnecessary political 
battles, adding that "he's very much a realist." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte said he initially figured Republicans would pick up two or three seats. 
But several weeks ago he realized GOP chances might be even better. He began to 
focus attention and money on four races: two in the Central Valley, one in San 
Diego, and one in Long Beach, where Democrat Betty Karnette won a close race in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans lost in San Diego but won the two farm-belt campaigns and believe 
they will unseat Karnette, who is ahead by 64 votes with 2,000 to 3,000 
absentee ballots still to be counted. Brulte said Karnette's opponent, Steve 
Kuykendall, received a massive infusion of cash in the days before the 
election, including about $125,000 from tobacco giant Philip Morris. 
Kuykendall's victory would give Republicans the 41 votes they need to control 
the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballots are among 170,000 absentee ballots yet to be counted in Los 
Angeles County. On Thursday, dozens of lawyers and political operatives hovered 
in library-like silence while the ballots were opened and signatures checked. 
Election officials expect to issue their first update Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Republicans gained a 41-39 majority and Republican Robert Monagan 
became Speaker. Monagan on Thursday urged Brulte to hold out an olive branch to 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "My words are that you can get elected with 41 votes, but you can't run the 
Assembly with 41 votes so he needs to make some overtures to a significant 
number of Democrats that they can operate the Assembly in an effective manner," 
Monagan said. He noted that he appointed five Democrats as committee chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte was a few months short of his 13th birthday when Monagan took the job. 
A native of Glen Cove, N.Y., Brulte, who grew up in San Bernardino County, is a 
onetime aide to the late U.S. Sen. S. I. Hayakawa and served as an advance man 
for President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected to the Assembly in 1990, Brulte was a surprise choice two years ago as 
Republican leader to succeed Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno). The post had 
been expected to go to Assemblyman Dean Andal (R-Stockton) but he was locked in 
a close election, which would be decided by absentee ballots. So his GOP 
colleagues turned to Brulte. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte told reporters then: "I have no detailed plan right now. Give me a week 
or two to develop one." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte holds a bachelor's degree in political science from Cal Poly Pomona. 
One of his most-publicized moments occurred in 1993 when, while playing golf, 
he was shot in the arm by a BB fired by a teen-ager who apparently missed a 
tree that was his target, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 As minority leader, Brulte has at times cooperated with Speaker Brown and has 
seldom enforced strict party loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles) said: "I think he's an effective 
minority leader who has used many different tools in his job in the past, 
including being sharply partisan and, when he needed to be, conciliatory, and 
working behind the scenes to strike a deal with the Speaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Caldera said that if Brulte gains 41 votes, there are Democrats, including 
himself, who might consider backing the Republican for Speaker, especially if 
he pledged to take a bipartisan approach. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's unclear whether all Republicans will line up behind Brulte. On 
Thursday, Assemblyman Paul Horcher (R-Diamond Bar) said he has no intention of 
becoming a Democrat but that he might vote for himself for Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said that for the next three weeks -- until the Assembly reconvenes in 
early December and elects a Speaker -- Brulte will be in middle of a political 
storm and how he handles the limelight could well influence the upcoming 
legislative session.

U.S. RESTORES FUNDING FOR L.A. SUBWAY PROJECT; TRANSIT: OFFICIAL SAYS MTA HAS 
ADDRESSED QUALITY AND SAFETY PROBLEMS. TUNNELING IN HOLLYWOOD WILL RESUME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON and DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five weeks after taking the extraordinary step of withholding $1.6 billion for 
future subway work in Los Angeles, a Clinton Administration official Thursday 
reinstated the funding and said he expects improvements in construction quality 
and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Transit Administrator Gordon J. Linton said local officials have 
adequately addressed his concerns by making a number of changes in the way that 
the multibillion-dollar subway project is to be managed. 
</P>
<P>
 Linton also announced that he is satisfied that tunneling can resume safely in 
Hollywood, where excavation has been halted since August and surface sinkage 
has damaged streets and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Areas of Hollywood Boulevard have sunk as much as 10 inches, and engineering 
reports have blamed soil conditions and the use of wood bracing in the tunnels, 
instead of metal struts. The Times reported Sept. 11 that project officials 
also did not order the tunneling contractor to do soil-stabilizing grouting 
procedures that could have minimized the sinking. 
</P>
<P>
 In only the second such action ever taken by the Federal Transit 
Administration, Linton on Oct. 5 announced that the government was withholding 
money for extension of the subway to East Los Angeles and the San Fernando 
Valley until the Metropolitan Transportation Authority showed that it could 
competently manage the project. Linton also at that time ordered the MTA not to 
resume tunneling. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect to start tunneling again sometime in December. Linton 
announced his actions Thursday in a letter to the MTA, saying that the 
authority's recent changes stand to improve quality, safety and accountability 
for the work performed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a significant change," Linton wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has provided about 50% of the funding for the Los 
Angeles subway. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA, Linton said, has demonstrated its "commitment to . . . properly 
exercise stewardship of federal funds." But Linton said he has directed the 
federal agency's engineering consultants in Los Angeles to increase their 
monitoring of the project "to assure ourselves more fully that the (MTA's) 
recovery plan is properly executed." 
</P>
<P>
 Linton also said in an interview that his agency has directed the MTA to 
consider whether to seek remuneration from the tunneling contractor, 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, for its use of the less-expensive wood bracing. Transit 
officials approved use of the wood, instead of metal, bracing, in 1992 but did 
not demand financial concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The stepped-up federal presence will result in more frequent visits to the 
tunnels and stations, meetings each week with local officials, and weekly -- 
instead of monthly -- written reports monitoring the MTA's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who has questioned the MTA's handling 
of subway construction, criticized as premature the Clinton Administration's 
decision to restore the funding and authorize the resumption of tunneling in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feds have performed inadequately as watchdog in their haste to resume 
construction," said Hayden, who organized a Senate Transportation Committee 
hearing last week regarding the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), whose district encompasses 
Hollywood Boulevard, also was critical. "I can't believe they want to move 
forward with a project that is still structurally unsound. I feel that we're 
watching an accident about to occur and those who have the power to stop it 
have their heads in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
 As the federal government was giving the go-ahead for tunneling to resume, 
complaints to transit officials continued to grow. The owner of Mann's Chinese 
Theatre said in a letter that the hand- and footprints and signatures of such 
entertainment icons as Bette Davis, Lana Turner and Myrna Loy have sunk 
three-quarters of an inch. The manager of the nearby Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel 
also reported recent damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there's a full re-evaluation of the environmental impact report, the 
problems are going to continue," said Robert W. Nudelman, a business owner and 
director of the Hollywood Boulevard Community Council. "I'd have to go through 
more approvals than they did to resume tunneling if I was going to change a 
storefront in a building." 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials, however, said their instruments have found no evidence of 
damage at the historic theater or the Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Other questions remain, such as who -- contractors, taxpayers or both -- will 
pay for the millions of dollars in damage caused by the sinkages in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Linton reiterated that the freezing of the funding five weeks ago 
was done in full consultation with U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena 
and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately we had to take the action that we did," Linton said from 
Washington. "It's not something that we take very often . . . in the history of 
this agency. So that in itself was dramatic. . . . We have agreed to allow them 
to go forth with the understanding that they have responded to our concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Linton and Pena last month had questioned the competence of subway 
construction, referring to both the problems in Hollywood and the tunnel walls 
built thinner than designed in areas of the project now open to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents Hollywood, said that 
before tunneling resumes, she wants the MTA to pay for daily inspections of the 
tunnel by city engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never wanted to stop the project," Goldberg said. "We want them to get 
through, and frankly, get out. But we did not feel that we could support their 
continued tunneling if it was going to mean the destruction of Hollywood. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to insist that they do everything, including some extraordinary 
things, to restore (the public's) confidence," Goldberg said, adding that she 
is pleased that federal approval for resumption of tunneling was conditional on 
the MTA's "commitment to implement all of the recommendations of the city of 
Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have threatened legal action to block resumption of tunneling 
unless the MTA requires additional, preventive construction procedures.  
</P>
<P>
 In response to the cutoff in federal funds, MTA Chief Executive Officer 
Franklin E. White last month ousted rail construction President Edward 
McSpedon. The MTA's project manager for the construction, Joel J. Sandberg, was 
reassigned to a lesser role. 
</P>
<P>
 And the MTA hastily approved management and engineering changes aimed at 
preventing a repetition of the problems that have plagued the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Linton cited the reorganization plan, including the dissolution of the MTA's 
Rail Construction Corp., as evidence of the transit authority's "commitment to 
clarify accountability and responsibility" for the subway project. The 
subsidiary has been criticized by some officials as being too cozy with 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA now intends to shift quality control and safety inspectors from a 
private management firm, Parsons-Dillingham, to the MTA. New construction 
procedures also are planned, including the use of metal struts -- not wooden 
wedges -- for tunnel bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 An engineering firm retained by the MTA to assess the construction along 
Hollywood Boulevard concluded Oct. 18 that the substitution of wood wedges for 
steel bracing was "inappropriate." The wedges had failed beneath the areas of 
greatest surface sinkage, and the engineering firm found that the wood was 
installed improperly and that required concrete material was not placed around 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA hopes to resume work on one of the twin tunnels in mid-December and on 
the other in early January. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said Thursday that they are still unclear whether the MTA will 
require an adequate amount of soil-stabilizing grouting. The costly and 
time-consuming work was not done in the most severely affected areas of 
sinkage, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 White said the changes made by the transit authority will minimize repetition 
of the kinds of problems that have plagued the subway project. 
</P>
<P>
 He said MTA officials will try to recover the costs of fixing problems and 
covering damage to property. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a painful lesson for us all," said White, "but the outcome will 
ensure the citizens of Los Angeles of a better, more efficient rail transit 
system."

GOP LEADERS VOW QUICK DRIVE TO CUT CAPITAL GAINS TAX; CONGRESS: KEY REPUBLICAN 
LAWMAKER ALSO WANTS TO EXPLORE ELIMINATION OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX. TOUGH WELFARE 
REFORM IS ANOTHER PART OF THE AGENDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Republican leadership of Congress vowed Thursday to push for an 
immediate cut in the capital gains tax early next year, and the GOP 
chairman-designate of the House Ways and Means Committee said he plans to 
explore the possibility of eliminating the federal income tax altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, congressional Republicans must enact welfare reform legislation 
that strips most recipients of benefits after two years with no government 
safety net -- even if that forces indigent parents to give up their children, 
said Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.), who is in line to take over the Ways and Means 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to be serious about having a program that requires work, then 
you've got to be in the position to say: 'You lose your welfare benefits and if 
the children cannot be supported by you, they have to be put into foster 
homes,' " Archer said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas conservative is the first Republican committee chairman to begin 
spelling out details of his legislative priorities in the wake of Tuesday's 
electoral landslide. But the likely Republican chairmen of several key House 
and Senate committees served notice that they will seek to reverse some of the 
changes enacted since President Clinton took office and steer the nation into a 
sharp, Reaganesque right turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the proposed tax cuts are perennial GOP priorities, including the 
reduction of taxes paid on capital gains -- the profits from selling stocks, 
bonds and other investment assets. And even before the election, the 
Republicans' "contract with America" had called for a two-year limit on welfare 
with no guarantee of a fallback government job. 
</P>
<P>
 But weighing the eventual elimination of the income tax, the primary source of 
federal revenues, represents a radical departure from mainstream tax policy. 
And enforcing a two-year limit on welfare, including food stamps, so strictly 
that poor families could be forced to place their children in foster homes 
would be Draconian even by conservative standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts had expected the Republicans to moderate their more 
controversial positions once they take control of Congress. Archer said that, 
on the contrary, their electoral victories if anything will make their 
positions even "tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a responsibility now to roll up our sleeves . . . and deliver," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.), likely chairman of the Ways and Means 
subcommittee on human resources, which will handle welfare reform, said the 
bill he plans to draft will follow Archer's prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 While it seems improbable that Congress will vote to scrap the federal income 
tax any time soon, the conservative wave produced by this week's midterm 
elections appears to have made some kind of tax reduction almost a certainty 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Clinton Administration officials conceded Thursday that the White House 
is likely to propose its own broad, middle-class tax cut in an effort to blunt 
Republican initiatives. "I think the chances may be going up that we will do a 
tax cut," said one senior official who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Archer and other senior Republicans made it clear that the Democrats face 
wrenching changes inside Congress as well as in policy initiatives, including 
reductions in committee assignments and staff sizes, as they slip into 
minority-party status after losing control of Congress for the first time in 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing to replace Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.) as chairman of the pivotal Ways 
and Means panel, Archer said his first order of business will be a major 
revision of the nation's tax laws to promote savings and investment. The 
changes are designed to carry out provisions of the GOP "contract," which was 
signed by more than 300 Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the immediate priorities: cutting the capital gains tax rate, phasing 
out the "marriage penalty" that taxes married couples at higher rates than two 
single people living together and raising the earnings limit on outside income 
for Social Security recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Archer said that within the first 100 days of the new Republican 
Congress, he will seek to restore tax-sheltered individual retirement accounts 
for upper-income earners and approve a $500-per-child tax credit for families. 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming Ways and Means chairman said a longer-term goal is the "complete 
replacement" of the current system of income taxation in favor of a "national 
consumption tax," or sales tax, that could serve as an "engine to drive job 
creation . . . and economic activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how the proposed tax cuts could be enacted without violating 
congressional budget rules and running up the federal budget deficit, Archer 
said the GOP contract had identified "innumerable" ways to cut spending and 
achieve savings in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 One immediate target is Congress itself. The Republicans plan to cut committee 
staffs by about a third and reduce the number of seats on many committees. 
Archer said he hopes to pare the Ways and Means panel from 38 to 29 seats and 
"return millions of dollars to the taxpayers" through staff reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to truly change this Congress and the way it operates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials, while still shocked by the prospect of conservatives 
like Archer seizing control of national economic policy, said they realize it 
will be politically difficult to draft a new budget that does not contain some 
kind of tax-cut proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cautioning that final budget decisions are still weeks away, White House 
officials said any tax cuts must be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget to 
comply with the President's deficit-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The election doesn't change the basic economic considerations that we would 
have to make in our budget deliberations before we can do a tax cut," said Gene 
Sperling, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Sperling said Administration officials, who savaged the "contract with 
America" and other GOP campaign proposals before the election, are eager to see 
whether the Republican congressional majority can make the budgetary math 
behind their plans add up. 
</P>
<P>
 "They now have the same responsibility that we do for showing the American 
people how they will pay for their tax cuts," Sperling said. "And one thing 
that both parties should agree to is not to go back to the days of magic 
asterisks and rosy scenarios . . . to make the math work." 
</P>
<P>
 But it appears likely that the Clinton "investment agenda" of new domestic 
spending will languish in the new Congress. And the Administration may find 
itself forced to spend its political resources in a renewal of its battle 
against a balanced-budget amendment, a key element of the Republican contract.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time they trumpeted the changes they want to make, the new barons 
of Capitol Hill sought to soften their post-election rhetoric by pledging to 
work with the Democrats wherever possible after taking control of the House and 
Senate in January. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior aide to incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia said 
Republicans will try to focus initially on issues "where we think we can 
cooperate and reach some agreement with the President."  
</P>
<P>
 The first priorities are likely to be welfare reform and a line-item veto, 
both of which have been endorsed in concept by Clinton, the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conciliatory tone contrasted sharply with the pointed critique offered the 
previous day by Gingrich, who characterized the President and First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton as "counterculture McGovernicks," and the White House 
staff as "left-wing elitists." 
</P>
<P>
 As they begin the transition from opposition to governing party, the 
Republicans are realizing that "to get things done, we are going to have to 
start working with the White House," a senior GOP aide said. Remaining at 
loggerheads, the aide said, would foster "the kind of gridlock that hamstrung 
the institution when (George) Bush was President" and the government was 
divided between a Democratic Congress and a Republican White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Archer acknowledged that the Republicans will have to cooperate with the White 
House because their majorities in the House and Senate will not be large enough 
to override a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech at Georgetown University on Thursday, Clinton cited welfare reform 
as the kind of major issue on which he and the GOP leadership clearly "can work 
together" and find common ground in the new political world created by this 
week's election. 
</P>
<P>
 And vetoing a reform bill could open Clinton to criticism of reneging on his 
own popular campaign pledge to "end the welfare system as we know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet key Republican and Democratic lawmakers said in interviews Thursday that 
the stark legislative package that House Republicans plan to force quickly 
through Congress bears little resemblance to the carrot-and-stick approach to 
overhauling the welfare system that Clinton and his allies envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to cutting off all benefits -- including food stamps and health 
insurance -- to most recipients after two years on welfare, the GOP proposal 
would deny benefits to teen-agers who have babies and make illegal immigrants 
ineligible for all federal assistance programs, including food stamps and Aid 
for Families With Dependent Children, the main cash assistance program for 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 These provisions, along with others in the GOP initiative, are far harsher 
than changes sought by Clinton, who has proposed making the government the 
employer of last resort for welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least in the President's version, a job has to be available," said Rep. 
Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento). "If welfare becomes just a two-year program 
with no provisions for jobs . . , that would have the impact of creating a 
massive amount of homelessness throughout the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential collision over welfare policy could become one of the defining 
political issues of the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 And with Tuesday's election returns widely interpreted as a public rejection 
of big government, Democrats may find it difficult to muster enthusiasm for a 
Clinton-style reform plan that would require significant increases in federal 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Archer and Shaw said Americans had spoken clearly Tuesday in favor of welfare 
reform that seriously combats the problems of out-of-wedlock births and 
dependence on entitlements such as welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately if they cannot support their children, the children will be taken 
care of through loving families through foster care and adoption," Archer said. 
"It's better for their children." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan, Archer charged, is "anemic" because it exempts all but the 
welfare recipients between 18 and 25 years old from the work requirement and 
allows states to exempt a sizable portion of welfare recipients in that age 
group, so only about 250,000 would have to work by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican bill, in contrast would require work for 1.5 million welfare 
recipients by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he believes that political considerations will make it difficult for 
the President to reject the welfare reform proposal presented to him by the 
Republican Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President's own party was unwilling to carry it forward last session. I 
think that's part of the reason so many Republicans were elected around the 
country," Shaw said. "Now the Republicans carry the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he does not believe that Clinton could veto a welfare reform bill.

 "He would regret that the rest of his political life," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other key Republicans began serving notice that they will seek 
major changes in their areas as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Jesse Helms, the conservative North Carolina Republican who is in line to 
take over the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he plans major cuts in 
foreign aid to keep "taxpayer money . . . from going down foreign rat holes." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), who will replace Georgia Democrat Sam Nunn as 
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said through a spokeswoman 
that his main priority will be to increase defense spending significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.), the most likely candidate to succeed Rep. 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on health and the environment, said he will snuff out an ongoing 
congressional investigation of the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we need any more legislation regulating tobacco," said Bliley, 
who represents a district in which Philip Morris Inc. is the largest private 
employer and who received substantial contributions from the tobacco industry 
for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 A transition team composed of senior aides to Gingrich and Rep. Dick Armey of 
Texas, the probable new majority leader, worked behind closed doors on plans to 
cut hundreds of congressional staff positions and replace Democratic appointees 
in scores of patronage posts. The looming reduction in force is expected to put 
several thousand Democratic staff members and other officials out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 An atmosphere of resignation and gloom pervaded Democratic offices on both 
sides of the Capitol as anxious and dejected aides began cleaning out their 
desks and writing their resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I am going to do," said one House aide, who asked not to be 
identified as she broke down in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many of us who are going to be out of work, and there's not much 
of a market out there for losers."

D1 Contract With America 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare reform initiative is part of a "contract with America" that 
Republican candidates for the House signed in September. It promises that 
within the first 100 days of 1995, the House will vote on: 
</P>
<P>
 THE BUDGET: A balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution and a presidential 
line-item veto. 
</P>
<P>

appeals and more money for prisons and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 WELFARE: Welfare reform limiting recipients to two years of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 CHILD SUPPORT: Enforcement of child-support laws, tax incentives for adoption 
and an elderly dependent care tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
 TAX: A $500-per-child tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
 TROOP DEPLOYMENT: A prohibition on U.S. troops being placed under United 
Nations command and "restoration of the essential parts of our national 
security funding." 
</P>
<P>
 SOCIAL SECURITY: Allowing Social Security recipients between 65 and 70 to earn 
$30,000 a year, up from the present $11,000 limit -- before any retirement 
benefits are lost. 
</P>
<P>
 TAX CUTS: Cutting the tax rate on capital gains; regulatory relief for 
business.

CLINTON HINTS AT PURSUING A LESS LIBERAL AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sounding frustrated and weary, President Clinton complained Thursday about the 
judgment of angry voters in the midterm elections and sent signals that he 
intends to move farther to the right -- away from the liberal wing of his 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 In a notably downbeat assessment, Clinton told a Georgetown University 
audience that in "normal times" he and other Democrats would have gotten 
greater credit. "But this is no ordinary time," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 A confused and worried public was reacting in Tuesday's election landslide for 
the Republican Party to personal anxieties and to governmental processes that 
they found "messy," and often "almost revolting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foretelling a likely shift to the right, Clinton suggested that the election 
taught him that he needs to refocus on the centrist agenda that thrust him to 
national prominence. He returned to phrases and ideas of his 1992 campaign, 
saying: "With all my strength, I will work to pursue the new Democrat agenda." 
He has used the term "new Democrat" sparingly since his election. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's comments differed sharply in tone from his remarks at a Wednesday 
press conference, when he said that he would stoically abide by the judgment of 
voters who he thought only wanted government to move successfully and more 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 In outlining his accomplishments, Clinton stressed actions that have greatest 
luster with conservative and moderate voters: cutting the federal deficit, 
shrinking government, deregulating business, fighting crime and reforming 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton has pursued social legislation that would expand the role of 
government, often reaching out to liberal elements of the party in the process, 
he described his vision of government Thursday in limited terms: "The primary 
job of government is to empower citizens to make the most of our lives and then 
to insist on responsible behavior in return." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled that during his presidential campaign, "I argued that the main job 
of government is not to solve all our problems. In this day and age, it simply 
can't do that."  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledged that he was taken aback by the election outcome, saying 
with a rueful laugh that, while he knew there had been difficulties, "until 
Tuesday, I thought we'd made a pretty good beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Defending his Democratic allies, he said that he "regretted particularly the 
loss of those who were trying to take the country in the direction the voters 
said they wanted" -- toward smaller government, a reduced deficit, deregulation 
and a more responsive Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech, at the university Clinton attended as an undergraduate, was 
originally planned as a major foreign policy address to kick off a nine-day 
trip to Asia for a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign policy concerns were largely overshadowed by the election results, 
although Clinton did outline his trade agenda and in doing so, used the term 
"fair trade," which signals a more aggressive stance in trade negotiations. It 
was another term from his 1992 campaign that had largely fallen by the wayside 
since his election. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's Asia trip, which begins today, is part of what the White House has 
described as a three-part push for action on trade liberalization. The other 
elements are Clinton's fight for congressional approval of the new world trade 
agreement, which will come to a vote in Congress later this month, and his trip 
to Miami in December for a Summit of the Americas that will chart ways to 
increase trade throughout the hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has come under pressure from Congress and human rights groups to press 
firmly for human rights reforms in China and Indonesia when he meets with 
leaders of those countries Monday and Wednesday. Human rights advocates have 
publicized the treatment of dissidents in China, as well as actions in 
Indonesia against organized labor, the press and the East Timor minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that those issues will be discussed at the meeting, but was 
careful in his remarks to avoid giving offense to the Asian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be doing everything I can to be frank in terms of our differences," he 
said. But he added: "I don't think we have to choose between increasing trade 
and fostering human rights and open societies." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Clinton has focused on domestic issues his first two years, setbacks 
for some of his major domestic initiatives are elevating foreign policy to a 
more prominent place on his agenda. The election results appear to have raised 
doubts in the minds of some foreign leaders about Clinton's political strength 
and longevity as well as whether the world trade accord, which is the 
cornerstone of future trade liberalization, will win approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton portrayed the trade fight in the most heroic terms, calling it one of 
the most important decisions in decades. "In this century, there have been a 
handful of congressional votes that have demonstrated what kind of country we 
are and what kind of people we are gong to be," he said. He cited the votes on 
the League of Nations after World War I and the Marshall Plan for European 
reconstruction after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we again face such a test," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton urged Republican leaders to help him win approval of the trade 
agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 "This should not be a partisan issue," Clinton said. "If we continue to work 
together on this trade issue . . . we can agree on ways to help all our people 
make their way in the new global economy." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Jakarta, the leaders of 18 
Pacific Rim countries are expected to agree to strive for free trade by the 
year 2020. Though the means to that goal remain uncharted, Clinton attached 
considerable significance to the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll move from a common vision to a common direction," he said.

IRAQ OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZES KUWAIT, BUT U.S. IS SKEPTICAL; MIDEAST: HUSSEIN USED 
CLAIM TO LAND AS EXCUSE FOR 1990 INVASION . WASHINGTON NOT READY TO LIFT 
SANCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Iraq, heeding the demand of the Security Council, officially recognized Kuwait 
on Thursday, but skeptical American officials insisted that Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein must still meet a host of other requirements before the United Nations 
can lift any sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The recognition means that Iraq has abandoned its traditional claim to Kuwait, 
a claim that Hussein invoked as his excuse for invading the small emirate in 
1990 and precipitating the Persian Gulf War that ended with his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a statement issued in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, and purportedly 
signed by Hussein, the Revolutionary Command Council decided to recognize "the 
sovereignty of the state of Kuwait, its territorial integrity and political 
independence." The council, headed by Hussein, also recognized the 
international Iraq-Kuwait boundary set down by a U.N. commission in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The council said it was taking these steps because of its respect for the U.N. 
Charter and international law and its intention "to comply fully with all 
relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council." 
</P>
<P>
 The Iraqi National Assembly also recognized the independence and boundary of 
Kuwait, passing the resolution in a special session attended by Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev. The Russian foreign minister has annoyed American 
officials recently with his persistent campaign to lift some of the sanctions 
on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iraqi News Agency quoted Kozyrev as saying, "There is a wall of ice 
surrounding Iraq, intended to isolate it, but the sun has now risen to melt 
this ice."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the skeptical reaction from Americans, the Iraqi government intends to 
press its case for at least a partial end to sanctions by sending Deputy Prime 
Minister Tarik Aziz, who has long served Hussein as spokesman to the Western 
world, to the United Nations on Monday. American Ambassador Madeleine Albright 
told reporters that she has agreed to meet him, but only in her capacity as 
president of the Security Council for the month of November. 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting of the two would mark the highest-level Iraqi-American meeting since 
the Gulf War. But a U.S. official cautioned against "attaching any significance 
to the meeting." Albright will not be meeting Aziz as American ambassador, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 James P. Rubin, spokesman for Albright, made it clear that the United States 
will not agree to any lifting of sanctions when the Security Council makes its 
bimonthly review of the issue next week. Without the acquiescence of the United 
States, which has the power of veto in the Security Council, no lifting of 
sanctions is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The recognition of Kuwait "complied with only one of a number of requirements 
set by the Security Council," Rubin said. "We have to keep in mind that Saddam 
Hussein's blatant provocation against Kuwait and the United Nations last month 
demonstrated anew his untrustworthiness and his readiness to resort to threats 
and confrontation to achieve his objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be important," he went on, "that the council continue to make clear 
there will be no modification of the sanctions regime so long as Iraq has 
failed to establish its peaceful intentions by complying fully with all 
relevant Security Council resolutions." 
</P>
<P>
 This longstanding American position is at odds with that of Kozyrev and, to 
some extent, the French government. The Russians and French have argued that 
the Security Council should follow the strict letter of the Security Council 
resolutions.  
</P>
<P>
 Under this strict reading, the sanctions on the sale of oil will be lifted 
when a U.N. special commission determines that Iraq has eliminated all of its 
weapons of mass destruction and has submitted to a system of long-term 
monitoring that makes sure it does not build such weapons again. 
</P>
<P>
 But American officials say that it is impossible to trust Hussein's acceptance 
of a monitoring system as long as he has not complied with all Security Council 
resolutions. To prove his good intentions, they say, the Iraqi leader must 
comply with various other Security Council demands, including an accounting of 
missing Kuwaiti prisoners, a halt in the persecution of the Kurds and Shiite 
Muslims in his country, and payment of compensation to Kuwait for destroyed 
property and to other countries hurt by the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument has led to some angry exchanges between the Americans, who appear 
sure that the French and Russians are interested only in resuming a lucrative 
trade, and the French and Russians, who seem certain that the Americans have no 
intention of ever lifting sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The American refusal to halt sanctions was strengthened by a report from Rolf 
Ekeus of Sweden, the head of the special commission, who said Iraqi officials 
barely cooperated with his inspectors during the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ekeus attributed this to fallout from the crisis provoked by Hussein last 
month when he moved troops to the Kuwait border in a manner that the United 
States said threatened a new invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ekeus told reporters that he looked on the recognition of Kuwait as an 
"extremely positive" development because it seemed logical for it to lead to "a 
policy of full cooperation" with the commission's inspectors.

COLUMN ONE; LATINA WRITERS ARE SILENT NO LONGER; FRESH, FRANK VOICES ARE 
FUELING A SURPRISING LITERARY BOOM IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA AFTER CENTURIES 
OF MACHO-MINDED REJECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ana Pizarro returned to Chile in 1991 after 17 years in exile, she 
offered the manuscript of a novel to a local publishing house, which rejected 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizarro, 53, was discouraged but not surprised. As a scholar of Latin American 
literature, she knew that innumerable women writers in this region had been 
silenced for centuries by macho-minded prejudice and rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 But through a friend's contacts with another publisher, Pizarro's "The Moon, 
the Wind, the Year, the Day" finally was printed last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, much to her surprise, the Sunday book section of the conservative El 
Mercurio, Chile's most influential newspaper, splashed the author and her novel 
on its cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the publisher tells Pizarro that her book is selling well -- just one 
sign among many of a growing trend in Latin America, where women authors are 
enjoying unprecedented success. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an opening for feminine writing," Pizarro said in an interview. "I 
believe the field is opening up more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 Books by Latin American women have become international bestsellers, in what 
some critics are calling a new boom. It is reminiscent of Latin America's 
celebrated -- all-male -- literary explosion in the 1960s when luminaries such 
as Gabriel Garcia Marquez of Colombia, Carlos Fuentes of Mexico and Mario 
Vargas Llosa of Peru attracted international recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's latest crop of big-name writers is headed by a Chilean, Isabel 
Allende, whose books, including the novel "The House of the Spirits," have sold 
more than 10 million copies worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Literary scholars, while reluctant to belittle Allende's knack for telling a 
popular story, say privately that other women in Latin America are producing 
richer, more literary material; many of these also are achieving the big sales 
and critical acclaim once reserved almost exclusively for men. 
</P>
<P>
 Because books are expensive in Latin America and education levels generally 
are low, writers of either gender still lack the mass readership that many 
authors enjoy in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But economic development, population growth and rising education levels have 
expanded the market for books, creating openings for new writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, gender bias has been breaking down throughout Latin America. Women 
have more opportunities for education, career success and intellectual freedom. 
This has translated into a larger public of women readers with greater interest 
in serious feminine literature. It also has meant that more men are discarding 
prejudices against reading what women write. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are scads of women emerging at this moment, at least in Chile and 
apparently in Mexico and Argentina also," said Beatriz Berger, editor of El 
Mercurio's book section. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing numbers of Latin American women are being published outside their own 
countries, including in the United States. (Some finance their writing careers 
by teaching at American universities; a few, including Allende, have married 
Americans.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them have leverage with American publishers, and they are the ones 
that get the attention, but there are hundreds more good women writers out 
there," said Kirsten Nigro, a professor of Romance languages at the University 
of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Many others are little known abroad but are changing the face of literature in 
their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most original things being produced in Latin America is women's 
voices," said Marjorie Agosin, a Chilean poet and professor of Latin American 
literature at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Much of the new writing 
reveals refreshing -- sometimes even shocking -- frankness by women on society, 
politics, sex and other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's women talking about themselves in a very open way, very transparent, 
very daring," Agosin said in a telephone interview. "Before, women never spoke 
about how they felt, they never spoke about their sexuality. They censored 
themselves. It's new in the sense that women are doing it with great openness." 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Ferman, an Argentine who teaches Latin American literature at the 
University of Richmond in Virginia, called the trend a Pandora's box: "You open 
it, and the most unexpected things come out, because this is the classic 
phenomenon of when someone is silenced, then there are many things in 
fermentation. And that, it seems to me, is what is attracting the public . . . 
that novelty of vision." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, women's erotic poetry is breaking ground in Caribbean Basin 
countries. In other parts of the region, women's poetic expression is invading 
the traditional territory of narrative writing "so there is a kind of very 
lyric narrative," Ferman said. "What we are seeing is that, when women start 
writing massively, they change not only what is said, but the genre it is said 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 When experts are asked who are the best women writers in Latin America today, 
the most-mentioned names include novelists Elena Poniatowska of Mexico, Diamela 
Eltit of Chile and Cristina Peri Rossi of Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
 Poniatowska's novels "Here's Looking at You, Jesus" and "Tinisima" are 
"testimonial narratives" that look at history through the eyes of women who 
lived it. 
</P>
<P>
 The avant-garde Eltit challenges conventional thinking with stories about 
misfits, rebels and others on society's fringe. 
</P>
<P>
 Peri Rossi, who lives in Spain, deals with the confused sexual and national 
identities of the exiled characters in her best-known novel, "The Ship of 
Fools." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of other women have well-established reputations, and scores more are 
seen as promising new talents. 
</P>
<P>
 David Geis, head of the Spanish and Portuguese department at the University of 
Virginia, is especially enthusiastic about Mexican novelist Maria Luisa Puga. 
He said her works are "powerful and lyrical," exploring the condition of women 
in developing countries with critical realism. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the last decade or two, women in Latin America did not have 
opportunities that men did "to make a life in writing, to think they could be 
writers," Geis said. A few exceptional women did break through. Chile's 
Gabriela Mistral won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1945 with her earthy, 
maternal-voiced poetry, and Brazilian Clarice Lispector's reflective novels and 
short stories are ripe with provocative ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
 But only since the early 1980s have greater numbers of Latinas gained broader 
access to publishing circles, to the press and to the literary Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've broken in," Geis said. "I think we've pretty much eliminated the 
macho mind-set, and we are all richer for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers are richer too. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Orellana, editor in Chile of the international publishing firm 
Editorial Planeta, observed: "Really, there is a pretty spectacular apogee in 
Latin America, from the point of view that today the best-selling authors -- 
Garcia Marquez aside -- are women." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest blockbuster has been Allende's "The House of the Spirits," 
followed by Mexican Laura Esquivel's first novel, "Like Water for Chocolate." 
</P>
<P>
 Both dramatize Latin American cultural virtues and vices with storytelling 
virtuosity and enticing touches of magic realism -- or "magic feminism." 
</P>
<P>
 Orellana said their huge success has helped pave the way for others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It contributes to knocking down complexes and prejudices -- in women writers, 
who dare to do more now, as well as in publishers who could have misgivings 
about the commercial possibilities of publishing women," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizarro, a researcher in culture at Santiago University, said that since the 
1970s, women's fiction in Latin America has become more daring, while 
maintaining a female identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a writing that has great aesthetic quality and speaks from another 
place, a place where sensitivities are different, where the relationship with 
reality is a little different from what we are used to in fundamentally 
masculine writing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women, such as novelist and poet Carmen Bullosa of Mexico, have developed 
artful ways of interpreting history through elaborate symbolism, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 They are "taking on history, and in a new way," she said. "It is a 
de-solemnized history -- open, playful." 
</P>
<P>
 In her novel "Llanto" (Crying), Bullosa jokingly questions conventional 
versions of Mexican history, examining it through the eyes of the Aztec emperor 
Montezuma. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, interpretation of such "serious" subjects in Latin American 
literature had largely been left to men. 
</P>
<P>
 Women writers were around but went unnoticed, Pizarro said. "They didn't have 
a tribune. And because they didn't have a tribune, they couldn't advance in 
their aesthetic projects, because the only way to advance is to publish." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the political and ideological ebullience of the 1960s, when 
revolutionary movements and social activism spread through the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a great process in Latin America of affirmation of identities," 
Pizarro said. "Starting from that time, the voice of the woman begins to emerge 
in the rest of the countries of the continent." 
</P>
<P>
 Pizarro earned a doctorate in literature at France's Sorbonne in 1968, then 
became a professor at Chile's University of Concepcion, a hotbed of social and 
political activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Like thousands of other leftists, she went into exile in 1973 after a 
right-wing military coup harnessed Chile with a harshly repressive regime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s and 1980s, when much of Latin America was ruled by military 
governments, women also played an important role in resisting dictatorships and 
pushing for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men give them a place, because they need women in those struggles," said 
Ferman of the University of Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
 She said a feminist movement and more assertive writing by women have sprung 
from those political origins. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have acquired permission, they have permitted themselves to move ahead, 
to have a voice," she said. "They begin to understand that they were silenced." 
</P>
<P>
 The progressive return to democracy throughout Latin America since the early 
1980s has permitted more open discussion, and that has further contributed to 
the surge in women's literature. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle for literary equality has been a long one in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Juana Ines de la Cruz, a Roman Catholic nun in 16th-Century Mexico, ran 
up against a wall of church censorship with her writing. Sister Juana is best 
known for her penetrating poetry, such as "First Dream," a metaphorical 
interpretation of dreaming and awakening. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 1920s through the 1950s, pioneers included Maria Luisa Bombal of 
Chile, who wrote subjective, stream-of-consciousness novels about women in 
reclusion, and Rosario Castellanos of Mexico, whose novels and short stories 
described native life and racial discrimination in the southern state of 
Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 While women authors have come a long way in Latin America, they continue to 
lag behind their American and European sisters. Silvia Pellarolo, a professor 
of Hispanic literature at UCLA, said many continue to go unnoticed because what 
they have to say is "not very appealing to a wider audience or to the owners of 
the publishing houses, who are usually men." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing is just the tip of the iceberg, and there are many, many, 
many other women's voices that are completely ignored," Pellarolo said.

OFFICIALS BLASTED FOR TAX FUND USE IN 187 FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 As elected officials in Los Angeles and communities up and down the state 
launch legal challenges to Proposition 187, an angry groundswell of criticism 
has arisen over use of public funds to undo what the measure's backers see as a 
clear mandate from the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged callers lit up switchboards Thursday at the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, Los Angeles City Hall and other agencies that had joined the 
effort to overturn the anti-illegal immigration measure approved Tuesday by 
nearly 60% of the state's voters. And the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors postponed a decision on its own legal challenge after a torrent of 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the pro-187 headquarters said they were inundated with calls 
Thursday from fired-up supporters wanting to join recall efforts or 
class-action lawsuits against officials involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no point in voting anymore," complained Diane Shook of Woodland 
Hills. "My concern is: Why am I paying taxes? Why aren't they listening to us?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shook, a 41-year-old computer programmer, said she was ready to sign up for 
any campaigns aimed at recalling officials who use tax funds to try to block 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Herb Pencille, who owns a small pest control business in North Hollywood, said 
he was outraged at the school district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should be recalled on the school board," Pencille said. "If I had the 
means and money to do it, I would start the recall campaigns myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Fumed Afrodite Dacoles, a Hollywood retiree: "I almost hit the roof. What is 
this? . . . We put this issue in. It's the law, and they are trying to fight it 
with my money." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the final months of the bitterly contested campaign drove a political 
wedge into the California electorate, it appeared that the struggle over 
implementation of the landmark law was opening deep new fissures in the 
political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials leading the challenges to Proposition 187 acknowledged that a strong 
backlash was hitting Thursday. Los Angeles school board offices were deluged 
with calls. Several Los Angeles City Council offices also reported dozens of 
protests. There were reports of school boards in various areas of the state 
being peppered with complaints. Even supporters of the measure -- including 
Gov. Pete Wilson -- were fielding large numbers of calls protesting the 
tax-dollar-backed lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sacramento City Unified School District, which joined Los Angeles, San 
Francisco and a coalition of districts in a lawsuit to overturn parts of 
Proposition 187, had taken dozens of calls by Thursday afternoon. "People are 
(telling) us we shouldn't be spending public funds on this suit," said George 
Medovoy, a spokesman for the Sacramento district. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected leaders around California were defending their actions, saying they 
have an obligation to resolve legal conflicts presented by federal and state 
laws and the new initiative, which bars most public services to undocumented 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all. The Antelope Valley Union High School District is among those 
that opted out of the legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is appropriate," said board member Billy Pricer. "The 
voters have spoken -- that's it. I would prefer they didn't spend all this 
money on legal battles." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn, who was directed by the 
City Council to try to clarify the measure by challenging its 
constitutionality, said: "We want to know whether we deny library cards, 
playing golf at a city golf course or being in a victim-assistance program . . 
. if they are in the country illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday, Hahn's office had three attorneys working on the matter, though 
that was expected to be cut back next week. Officials insisted that the cost 
would be minimal and absorbed into the city attorney's regular budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawsuits have been filed by civil rights groups and individuals 
challenging the measure, but Hahn insisted that the city was compelled to mount 
its own challenge. "I need to know from the courts what kind of legal advice to 
give all my city departments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials maintain that they have a moral and constitutional duty to 
protect the rights of all constituents, particularly children and the needy. 
Los Angeles Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg argued that lawmakers, in keeping with 
their oaths of office, had to file suit to defend the principles of the U.S. 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Board of Education President Mark Slavkin, a point man in the 
legal attack on the measure by school systems, said: "Our fundamental interest 
is to protect the rights of students -- that's our guiding motivation. We're 
fighting to uphold a basic issue in the Constitution, which is the right to 
free public education." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Loofbourrow, the president of the California School Boards Assn., said 
the organization is representing 700 of the 1,000 school districts in the state 
in the lawsuit. Loofbourrow said individual school districts are hearing from 
voters and "most people are expressing their concerns" about the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 But she added: "It's important for the districts to understand that we're in 
court to straighten out the conflicting legal directions that we've been given 
-- for their sakes. Are we supposed to be educating all children or not?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles and San Francisco school districts, which are being 
represented by the large Los Angeles law firm of Munger, Tolles & Olson, said 
they did not know how much the legal battle ultimately will cost, though they 
stressed that the burden was being shared by many districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cost, Slavkin conceded that the Los Angeles board's stand is 
likely to cause problems for incumbents next spring, when most face reelection 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "For people who feel passionately on this issue, they're frustrated that no 
sooner did they vote for something and it's mired in the court system," he 
said. "I think they'll be looking at potential targets to vent their anger. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "But leadership requires that you do what you think is right, and not just 
duck for cover when there is an outburst of public anger." 
</P>
<P>
 Repercussions were also being heard at City Hall, where the council voted 10 
to 3 Wednesday to direct Hahn to challenge the measure. The council also 
instructed city agencies to hold off on enforcing the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are concerned that they are not seeing immediate enforcement," said 
City Council President John Ferraro, whose office had received about 15 
telephone complaints by midday Thursday. "But we have a responsibility to get 
the answers, or we could be exposed to severe liability" by enacting an unclear 
and contested law. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the 187 court challenges raised the specter of past ballot measures 
that won overwhelming support from the voters, only to be thrown into the 
courts. Property-tax-slashing Proposition 13 was challenged by many government 
agencies after its passage in 1978; it ultimately was upheld by the courts. Car 
insurance rate rollbacks ordered a decade later in Proposition 103 were 
challenged by insurance companies, and many consumers still have not seen their 
rebate checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight over implementation also appeared to be the ready-made stuff of 
campaign mailer hit pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 One candidate with his eye on a City Council seat was preparing to make 
implementation of Proposition 187 part of next spring's campaign. Mark Ryavec, 
a lobbyist from Venice who opposed the initiative, hopes to topple City 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who supported the city's challenge to the measure. 
"It is going to be an issue. In Ruth's case, it reflects her sort of 
pointy-headed liberal approach to issues in the city. At some point, you have 
to trust the will of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 But Galanter responded: "People often complain that politicians are not 
showing leadership and that we shouldn't wait for our constituents. Now, in 
this case, people are saying . . . that I should move aside and let the tide 
roll on, regardless of the fact that I took an oath to uphold the Constitution 
of the United States and the state of California. To me, that is leadership, to 
stand up even when popular sentiment is not on your side." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Prince, a leader of the pro-Proposition 187 campaign who fielded dozens of 
the protest calls Thursday at his group's Orange County headquarters, said his 
reading of popular sentiment is that people are revved up to take on local 
governments if they buck the voters' will. "I think you are going to see some 
legal action. . . . People are asking, 'How can they possibly do this?' "

STORM SNARLS RUSH-HOUR COMMUTING; WEATHER: CHP REPORTS 300 ACCIDENTS ON 
SOUTHLAND FREEWAYS. BUT SKI RESORTS AND WATER OFFICIALS WELCOME SNOW AND RAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Southern Californians slipped and skidded to work Thursday morning as the 
season's first major rainstorm made freeway driving treacherous. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol reported a 69% increase in traffic accidents on 
area freeways between 5 and 9 a.m. More than 300 accidents occurred in that 
span, delaying commuters by as much as 90 minutes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of accidents, that's for sure," said CHP Officer Susan 
Gonzalez. "Every time it rains like this, our activity at least triples." 
</P>
<P>
 No rain is expected today or this weekend, but for commuters, Thursday was bad 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Freeway was flooded near East Los Angeles. A jackknifed 
tractor-trailer rig at the northbound interchange of the Long Beach and Artesia 
freeways tied up traffic for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the storm clouds had a silver lining. At Snow Summit ski resort in 
Big Bear, where raindrops turned to snowflakes, folks were rejoicing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the snow!" cried spokeswoman Bonnie Tregaskis as the resort prepared 
to open this weekend. "We've had a couple of flakes before, but this is the 
first really good storm. It's beautiful!" 
</P>
<P>
 Snow was falling in the San Bernardino Mountains above 6,000 feet, and six 
inches of powder was expected to accumulate. CHP officers were bracing for an 
influx of skiers taking advantage of the Veterans Day holiday today and heading 
to resorts such as Snow Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow chains were required on California 18, but that wasn't enough for one 
driver, whose vehicle went out of control and over the side of the mountain 
road. But CHP Officer George Berge said no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the Los Angeles Basin, things were warmer but no less dangerous. "We 
have this big board which lights up to show all the traffic problems," said 
California Department of Transportation spokesman Russ Snyder on Thursday 
morning. "The big board (is) solid red." 
</P>
<P>
 Two big truck rigs hit freeway center dividers during rush hour Thursday 
morning -- one on the westbound Artesia Freeway in Compton, the other on the 
southbound Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County was more fortunate -- rain there tapered off before daylight 
and the CHP reported that traffic was normal. "We just missed it," said a CHP 
officer in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Orange County, it was messy. About 9 a.m. in Orange, mud cascaded down 
a steep embankment near the Santa Ana Freeway onto Chapman Avenue, closing a 
freeway on-ramp for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair skies are forecast for today and through the weekend, with lows in the 
30s to 50s and highs in the mid-50s and 60s in the mountains and coastal areas, 
respectively. The high in Downtown Los Angeles on Thursday was 62 and the low 
was 52. A total of 0.31 of an inch of rain fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain fouled many a commute, but at the Metropolitan Water District, the 
agency that supplies Southern California with most of its water, it was a happy 
sight. California is under a drought watch, and while most of the Southland's 
water is drawn from either the Colorado River or reservoirs in northern 
California, some comes from ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more there is down here, it lessens the need to trade supplies with the 
north," said MWD spokesman Rob Hallwachs. "We never complain about rain."

CHRISTIAN BLOC OUSTED FROM BOARD; EDUCATION: TWO MEMBERS OF VISTA SCHOOL PANEL 
ARE RECALLED AFTER SEEKING TO IMPOSE A RELIGIOUSLY ORIENTED APPROACH TO 
TEACHING STUDENTS ABOUT SEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Voters in suburban Vista have recalled two members of a Christian conservative 
bloc on the school board, which had gained national attention by seeking to 
impose a strait-laced approach to sex education. 
</P>
<P>
 The third member of the bloc opted not to seek reelection to the Vista board, 
which sets policy for a middle-income, racially diverse district of 22 schools 
and 22,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The new board members have said they will consider revoking the Sex Respect 
sex education program in which teachers stress abstinence and religious notions 
of chastity. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has been criticized for allegedly showing intolerance toward gays 
and for leaving students ignorant about safe sex practices and birth control. A 
group of parents, backed by Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties 
Union, has threatened to sue to block the program. A similar suit is under way 
in Hemet in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my fervent hope that one of the first things the new board will do is 
throw out Sex Respect," said Barbara Donovan, a leader in the recall movement 
and a successful candidate for a board spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalled board members did not return calls Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Billy Falling, head of the Christian Voters League in Northern San 
Diego County, blamed the ouster of the Christian members on the refusal of 
local ministers to "come to their defense against the big liberal guns" of 
Planned Parenthood, the ACLU and the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling predicted that the victory of the new board members will hurt 
students. "They (the winning candidates) convinced the community that religious 
bigotry is acceptable," he said. "They want to go back to the failed sex 
education practices that have produced some of the moral problems we have in 
this country. Theirs is a very hollow victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after taking control in 1992, the Christian bloc sparked controversy with 
a long and emotional debate over whether creationism should be added to the 
curriculum. Although blocked from adding creationism by state law, the board 
voted to have teachers tell students that evolution is "just a theory." 
</P>
<P>
 Another controversy involved the board's decision to refuse a state grant to 
start a breakfast program for low-income children. Board members said children 
should have breakfast with their families instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just had this 'Ozzie & Harriet' view of the world," Donovan said. "We 
need a board that will work with the entire community." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Christian bloc in charge, school board meetings became contentious 
affairs where members bickered with parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The district superintendent left to take a lower-paying job in another 
district. Another district official and a highly regarded elementary school 
vice principal also left. 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent job remains open. Donovan said she believes the district's 
reputation for political volatility may be hurting efforts to fill it. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego County has been home to a movement by Christian conservatives to win 
spots on local school boards. Two years ago they were successful in several 
races but later were criticized as "stealth" candidates who had not been candid 
with voters about their goals. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a Christian slate in Encinitas, running for three seats on the San 
Dieguito Union High School District, which has 8,000 students in six junior and 
senior high schools, was defeated. One of the candidates suggested during the 
campaign that Shakespeare is inappropriate for high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 A rival slate, consisting of two incumbents and a sheriff's captain, utilized 
the slogan "We Don't Want to Be Like Vista" in defeating the Christian slate. 
</P>
<P>
 In school districts in eastern San Diego County, where the Christian influence 
is considered to be the most powerful, results were mixed. Christian 
conservatives won four races but lost four others.

SRI LANKAN PREMIER'S PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY A LANDSLIDE; ELECTION: CHANDRIKA 
KUMARATUNGA IS FIRST WOMAN TO ATTAIN TOP POST. SHE PLEDGES TO PURSUE PEACE WITH 
TAMIL REBELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Buoyed by a landslide margin of nearly 2 million votes, President-elect 
Chandrika Kumaratunga on Thursday claimed a "clear and massive mandate" to 
press on with her quest for a peaceful end to Sri Lanka's 11-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ballot-box rout that political observers said is without precedent in 
this Indian Ocean island's history, Kumaratunga, the prime minister from the 
left-leaning People's Alliance, emerged victorious in a six-way race, beating 
her closest rival from the main opposition United National Party by 4,709,205 
votes to 2,715,283, official results showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 62.28% score in her successful bid for the powerful executive presidency 
was the crescendo of an electoral career that began in earnest only in May of 
last year, when the 49-year-old daughter of two former Sri Lankan prime 
ministers scored an upset victory in a provincial council election. 
</P>
<P>
 This August, the widowed mother of two led the People's Alliance to a narrow 
win in national parliamentary elections, ending a 17-year chokehold on power by 
the UNP, which had used murder and mob violence to safeguard its rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "We, I think, have come to the end of the dark tunnel, and we are marching 
toward a new era of freedom and light," said an emotional Kumaratunga, clad in 
a blue and white sari, after Wednesday's election results were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 But the president-elect warned supporters that even if they suffered when the 
UNP held power, she will not brook any revenge-seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is true that for 17 long years you have bottled up the anger of much 
political victimization and harassment," Kumaratunga said. "But the answer to 
that is not to repeat the same barbaric style of acting." 
</P>
<P>
 After a violence-marred campaign, an island-wide curfew starting at 2 p.m. was 
imposed for the second straight day Thursday to prevent further disorder, and 
the rain-lashed streets of this seaside capital were practically devoid of cars 
and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Oct. 24 assassination of her principal opponent, Gamini Dissanayake, 
the pivotal issue of the presidential campaign became the policy of 
Kumaratunga's 2 1/2-month-old government toward the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam, who control enclaves in the east and the northern Jaffna peninsula. They 
are widely suspected of carrying out Dissanayake's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In an overt bid for the sympathy vote of members of the island's Buddhist 
Sinhalese majority, the UNP put up the slain Parliament member's 51-year-old 
widow, attorney Srima Dissanayake, as its candidate. In its crudest campaign 
rhetoric, it also told Sri Lankans that a vote for Kumaratunga would be a vote 
for the Liberation Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge majority the prime minister won in the so-called battle of the widows 
showed that the UNP gambit miscarried badly. The main opposition party lost in 
all 22 polling districts, whereas Kumaratunga garnered a clear majority among 
all main voter groups: the Sinhalese, Muslims and Hindu Tamils. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, was Sri Lanka's first female prime 
minister, and now Kumaratunga will become this country's first female 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, she sent emissaries to Jaffna to begin the Sri Lankan government's 
first contacts in more than four years with the Liberation Tigers. After 
Dissanayake's death, she broke off the preliminary talks until possible rebel 
responsibility could be probed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her government has been scrupulously careful not to pin responsibility for the 
suicide bombing that killed Dissanayake and 54 others on the Liberation Tigers. 
Just as prudently, Kumaratunga did not say Thursday whether she intends to 
resume the talks, or what she will do if the insurgents' complicity in the 
killings is proved. But she said she is as determined as ever to forge ahead 
with the "peace process" to end the ethnic war that has claimed more than 
30,000 lives since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shall take this as a clear mandate from you, the people of this country, 
the Sinhalese Buddhist majority, and all the other people living in this 
country, belonging to all races, to all religions, to all communities, for our 
government to forge ahead with peace," she said. "But not peace at any cost; 
negotiated peace where the rights of the majority Sinhalese people would be 
safeguarded and strengthened, but where we would build a society where all the 
peoples of this country could live with equal rights, without fear and in 
brotherhood and with freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentiments of Tamils in lands controlled by the Liberation Tigers were 
unknown, as the guerrillas did not allow them to vote. The war also continued, 
impervious to the election, with a clash reported in the northern town of 
Penilankulam in which two rebels were slain by government soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Kumaratunga's father, former Prime Minister Solomon Dias Bandaranaike, 
and her actor-politician husband, Vijaya Kumaratunga, died at the hands of 
assassins.  
</P>
<P>
 Her victory, Kumaratunga said, "is the victory of millions of people in this 
country who watched and waited in silence during nearly two decades of 
harassment, political victimization, of state terror and violence." 
</P>
<P>
 She is expected to be sworn in Saturday as successor to outgoing President 
Dingiri Banda Wijetunga of the UNP, and in theory could serve for six years. 
But on Thursday, she repeated a pledge to abolish the powerful office she had 
just won, and set herself a deadline of July 15. Kumaratunga has said the 
executive presidency created in 1978 is a temptation to the abuse of power, and 
that most of its functions should be transferred to the Parliament, prime 
minister or Cabinet.

2 EMPLOYEES OF U.S. EMBASSY IN HAITI KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Haitian employees of the U.S. Embassy were shot and killed during a 
robbery Thursday, and a third employee was critically wounded, U.S. authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees were accosted before noon while driving to a bank in the capital 
to pick up pay packets for embassy workers, according to an embassy statement. 
</P>
<P>
 A Haitian citizen witnessed the employees "in trouble" and called U.S. 
authorities. Military police rushed to the scene, but the two employees were 
already dead, the embassy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All indications are that this was a criminal act, an armed robbery with no 
political motivation whatsoever," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Slain were Kesnel Jean-Paul and Sandra Rigaud, both in their 20s. U.S. and 
Haitian authorities were searching for a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamartine Guerrier, an embassy driver, was to be airlifted to the United 
States for treatment, said Lt. Jeff Gordon, a spokesman for the U.S. military.

 President Jean-Bertrand Aristide conveyed to U.S. Ambassador William L. Swing 
"his shock and grief and also has sent his condolences to the families of the 
victims," Aristide spokesman Yvon Neptune said. "We're in a country that's 
trying to get back on track. Security hasn't been completely re-established, 
whether in Port-au-Prince or other parts of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 150 Haitian refugees, most of whom had fled poverty and 
repression under old military regimes, flew home from Cuba on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations arranged their return on a Cuban airliner, one of three U.N 
flights this week carrying Haitian refugees who fled by boat to Cuban shores. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Haitians, reassured by Aristide's return, are heading home from 
the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and other Caribbean nations.

RELIGION; TV FILM SHOWS NO MERCY FOR MOTHER TERESA; THE ONE-SIDED DOCUMENTARY 
CLAIMS THE 84-YEAR-OLD NUN SPENDS MORE TIME JET-SETTING THAN CARING FOR INDIA'S 
POOR. CATHOLIC OFFICIALS DENOUNCE THE PROGRAM AS 'SLANTED.' 
</P>

<P>
 To most of the world, Mother Teresa has become a larger-than-life symbol of 
faith, hope and charity for her labors on behalf of the poor and starving of 
India. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Christopher Hitchens, a left-wing writer and a Washington-based 
contributing editor of Vanity Fair, and Tarik Ali, a radical Muslim, the 
84-year-old nun is "a demagogue and obscurantist, and a servant of earthly 
powers," who lends spiritual solace "to dictators and wealthy exploiters." 
</P>
<P>
 That view -- presented in "Hell's Angel," an independently produced, highly 
critical, one-sided TV documentary that aired this week -- has stirred a bitter 
controversy here. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Basil Hume, the senior British Catholic cleric, has called the 
Hitchens-Ali production for Independent Television's offbeat Channel 4 a 
"grotesque caricature" of Mother Teresa. Hume praised Mother Teresa's efforts 
"to plead with the rich and powerful on behalf of the poor." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hitchens, in the program, asserted that Mother Teresa has "a penchant for 
the rich and famous, no matter how corrupt or brutal." He said she has accepted 
support from dictators like Haiti's Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier and 
criminals like Charles Keating, who figured in one of California's messiest 
savings and loan scandals and is currently serving a 12-year federal prison 
term. Keating received a personalized crucifix from the elderly Roman Catholic 
nun. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchens pulled no punches in the 30-minute program, which made no pretense of 
being balanced and provided no case for the defense of Mother Teresa, who first 
came to public consciousness 25 years ago in "Something Beautiful for God," a 
British Broadcasting Corp. film by Malcolm Muggeridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchens scorned her saintly reputation, calling her work a "profane marriage 
between media hype and medieval superstition." 
</P>
<P>
 The program asserted that Mother Teresa represents only the Catholic right 
wing, which opposes contraception. It noted that, when she received the Nobel 
Peace Prize in 1979, she insisted that abortion was the greatest threat to 
world peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchens and Ali also took aim at Mother Teresa's hospices for the dying poor 
in Calcutta and elsewhere, asking whether they provide sufficient medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 The British medical journal Lancet, in a recent issue, claimed that patients 
in the Calcutta hospices receive little more than a bed, food and sympathy -- 
while being denied proper painkillers or other medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Mother Teresa was born Agnes Goxhu Bojaxhiu in 1910 to Albanian parents in 
Skopje, now in Macedonia. A merchant's daughter, she trained as a nun in 
Ireland and arrived in India in 1928. In 1948, she set up her mission in the 
slums of Calcutta, among the poor, sick and dying. Her Missionaries of Charity 
now have 500 centers in about 100 countries, feeding half a million families a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny, stooped, bird-like figure, she has traveled widely, raising money and 
being honored by presidents, princes and private personages. 
</P>
<P>
 In Calcutta, Mother Teresa, though a Catholic missionary in a Hindu area, is 
rarely criticized. As Biplab Dasgupta, a Communist member of the British 
Parliament, says: "She's part of Calcutta now. Of course we have differences on 
the philosophical plane. I don't share her religious feelings. But I appreciate 
what she's doing for the poor." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hitchens claims that Mother Teresa, in her distinctive blue-and-white 
cowl, is rarely in Calcutta -- instead flying around the world and being feted 
by the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
 In reply, the Catholic Media Office accused Hitchens and Ali of factual 
inaccuracies. "The choice of images and their juxtaposition are all slanted 
toward a nasty attack," said a spokeswoman. "The program causes upset and 
disquiet among many Catholics who hold Mother Teresa in very high regard." 
</P>
<P>
 But Waldemar Januszczak, a Channel 4 executive, said he was speaking as a 
Polish Catholic when he explained that the Hitchens-Ali program sought to raise 
the questions: "What can the good, overcrowded people of Calcutta learn from 
Mother Teresa's fierce opposition to birth control? To what extent is she a 
mouthpiece of reactionary Catholicism? Did her much-publicized visits to Baby 
Doc Duvalier in Haiti or Enver Hoxha of Albania give succor to their repugnant 
regimes?"

ECONOMY; RICH SLIP THROUGH BRAZIL TAX CRACKS TO TUNE OF $83 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometime early next week, 4,000 wealthy Brazilians -- including the nation's 
460 richest families -- will get the kind of letter that sends chills down the 
spines of most Americans: The tax man cometh. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be seeking a large part of $83 billion in taxes that the government 
says the rich and other Brazilians evaded last year through outright cheating 
or by slipping through the gaping loopholes in Brazilian tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The outstanding debt figure, released early this week, was stunning in itself 
because it totals: 
</P>
<P>
 * Almost as much as the $85.5 billion the government here actually collected 
in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Roughly twice the nation's federal reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 * About twice the amount of money in personal savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than the combined sales of the top 1,400 Brazilian companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enough to buy the entire Brazilian auto production for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 That Brazilians cheat on their taxes was hardly news. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Brazil, there is a culture of tax evasion," said Sen. Ronan Tito, who 
heads a congressional commission investigating the practice. "It runs from the 
lawyer to the doctor to the largest magnates of the country. If we locked them 
all up, the Maracana (a 200,000-seat stadium) couldn't hold them." 
</P>
<P>
 But what has shaken Brazilians about the recent revelations are the striking 
examples of alleged tax evasion by the wealthy in this country, which has one 
of the world's greatest gaps between rich and poor and where more than 50% of 
the population subsists on an average of $150 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, for example, the tax bureau reported that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Wiebert Ferreira Tartuce, a congressman and businessman whose $19-million 
estate includes a 63-room house and 11 cars, claimed an annual income of 
$30,000. He paid just $2,100 in taxes, less than the amount paid by an engineer 
at his construction company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Camilo Cola, owner of 28 firms, including the nation's largest interstate 
bus company, boasted of having an estate worth $154 million. But he declared an 
annual income of just $84,000, upon which he paid $26,000 in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Construction magnate Cecilio do Rego Almeida, with an estate worth $515 
million, declared an annual income of $96,000, paying $15,500 in taxes. That 
same year, he spent roughly $150,000 on his wedding, which included chartering 
a Boeing 727 airliner to bring guests from another city. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sen. Jonice Siqueira Tristao claimed $1.8 million in annual income from a 
coffee company headquartered in New York, but he paid only $17,300 in Brazilian 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with cases like these, "People are quite upset," said congressional 
aide Joao da Silveira in Brasilia, the capital. "In the past, there was apathy 
about this kind of thing, but now, everybody is saying, 'I pay so much, and 
these people pay so little.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The wealthy pay relatively little, experts say, because they -- or their 
accountants -- know how to exploit the huge loopholes in Brazil's tax law. 
Executives and business owners, for example, routinely hide personal 
expenditures and earnings, claiming they are company expenses. They avoid 
paying taxes on some income by claiming that it is exempt because it came from 
exempt gifts and donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree that I should pay more, but I can't do anything with the faulty 
legislation in relation to large fortunes," said Olavao Egydio Monteiro de 
Carvalho, the president of holding and construction companies. He paid $72,500 
in taxes on an estate worth $36 million and a declared income of $420,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when scofflaws are brought to justice, the long, legally required, 
eight-step procedure to make them pay up can drag on for 12 to 15 years, 
government officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole situation has critics crying out for reform. But getting such 
measures through the Congress might prove difficult. As federal records show, 
many lawmakers are themselves some of the worst tax evaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Sen. Tito is hopeful. "We have three very good proposals being 
presented now," he said. "Maybe one of them will get through."

KILLING IMPERILS IRISH PEACE PROCESS; 2 HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested two Irish Republican Army suspects Thursday after gunmen 
killed a postman in a botched robbery, sending shock waves through Northern 
Ireland's fragile peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing was the first in the British-ruled province to be linked to the 
IRA since it announced a cease-fire in August, but the group denied breaking 
its pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland's justice minister, Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, rescinded plans to release 
jailed IRA prisoners early. The first two inmates would have been released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement to Belfast media, the IRA said its cease-fire meant "a complete 
cessation of military operations. All our units were instructed accordingly. 
This position has not changed." 
</P>
<P>
 But the killing of Frank Kerr, a 54-year-old Catholic, confirmed to the 
British and Irish governments that the IRA-Sinn Fein movement could not control 
all its activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoghegan-Quinn said police intelligence confirmed that at least one 
well-known IRA member was involved in the attack at the post office in Newry, 
30 miles south of Belfast near the Irish border. 
</P>
<P>
 "So therefore, of course, the position is all changed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the truce, the IRA had robbed so many post offices, the distribution 
point for welfare payments, that some offices were closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest incident, three gunmen drove into Newry's new central post 
office Thursday in a van painted like a British postal vehicle. They tied up 
several employees at gunpoint.  
</P>
<P>
 Kerr tried to resist and was shot in the head and back, police and witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio was unable to steal any money and escaped in a hijacked post office 
van. Police arrested two men near the van after it was abandoned in Meigh, a 
village southwest of Newry. Army units combed the area by helicopter in search 
of the third suspect.

LATIN AMERICA'S NEW AUTHORS COVER SPECTRUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William R. Long 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today, whether highbrow works of art or bestsellers, Latin American prose and 
poetry by women shine more broadly and brightly than ever before. A full list 
of established and emerging women authors in the region would go on and on. But 
a sampling, as described by experts, indicates how widely they range over the 
regional map and the literary spectrum: 
</P>
<P>
 * Argentina: Luisa Valenzuela has won critical acclaim and publishing success 
in the United States with her sensual, "hormonal" novels that are often 
critical of political repression in Latin America. Olga Orozco's meditative 
poetry, with themes such as obsession and madness, has established her as a 
major Argentine poet. Griselda Gambaro is an internationally known playwright 
whose work examines violence and cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brazil: Lygia Fagundes Telles is well known for the disciplined prose and 
social content of her novels, including "The Naked Hours." Nelida Pinon's 
novels often debunk male dominance while exploring religiosity, sex and the 
concept of sin. Marilene Felinto's novels, including "The Women of Tijucopapo," 
speak of ethnic roots, poverty and alienation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Central America: Honduran-born Argentina Diaz Lozano has won the top 
national literary prizes of both Honduras and Guatemala. Nicaraguan Gioconda 
Belli's exuberant and erotic poetry celebrates the body and the Sandinista 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chile: Elena Castedo's psychological novel "Paradise," about a girl's 
wrenching adventures in South America, was a 1990 finalist for the U.S. 
National Book Award. Novelist Ana Maria del Rio's erotic fantasy "Seven Days of 
Mrs. K." is a recent bestseller in Chile. Pia Barros' more intellectual fiction 
sometimes draws parallels between sexual and political repression. The 
experimental feminist poetry of Elvira Hernandez is concerned with popular 
culture, repression and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexico: Novelist Angeles Mastretta's gossipy page-turners have been 
publishing successes. Emerging poet Coral Bracho has been writing about gender 
identification. Sabina Berman is a prominent Mexican playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 * Puerto Rico: Ana Lidia Vega's playful short stories revel in the hybrid 
nature of Caribbean culture and reveal the contradictions in Puerto Rican 
identity. Rosario Ferre, daughter of former Puerto Rican Gov. Luis Ferre, has 
won critical acclaim with her innovative short stories and her novel "Sweet 
Diamond Dust," about materialism and miscegenation in a sugar baron's family.

BUNDESTAG OPENS ON MODERATE NOTE; GERMANY: SOCIALIST STEFAN HEYM, 81, DELIVERS 
CONCILIATORY ADDRESS TO PARLIAMENT. SPEECH GETS APPLAUSE FROM SOME, SILENCE 
FROM KOHL AND HIS PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former best-selling American novelist Stefan Heym opened Germany's 13th 
Bundestag on Thursday on an uncharacteristically conciliatory note, calling on 
fellow members of Parliament to "quarrel calmly" about their "widely divergent 
visions" of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that we can concur on one thing: that chauvinism, racism, 
anti-Semitism and Stalinist methods should be forever banned from our country," 
said Heym, who at 81 is the oldest member of the lower house of the German 
Parliament, and thus empowered to conduct the opening session. 
</P>
<P>
 His call for moderation brought spontaneous applause from some leftist and 
centrist Parliament members, but stony silence from members of Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Heym, a German-born Jew who fled Hitler in 1933 and became a U.S. citizen, 
fled Sen. Joe McCarthy's anti-Communist witch hunts in the early 1950s and 
returned to live and write in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a committed -- though unaffiliated -- socialist, and he ran for the 
Bundestag on the ticket of the reconstituted East German Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the party has a new name -- the Party of Democratic Socialism -- and 
insists that it has broken with the past, many Germans deeply distrust it and 
consider it improper that such an unrepentant leftist as Heym should have the 
opening-day honors in Germany's all-powerful Bundestag. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of Heym's nationally televised speech, allegations were raised that 
he had gone so far as to volunteer information to East Germany's notorious 
secret police, the Stasi, in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 Heym, who was himself the subject of extensive Stasi spying and state 
harassment, has promised to address the allegations in a statement today.  
</P>
<P>
 Until Thursday, there had been suggestions that mainstream members of 
Parliament might either heckle Heym when he opened the Bundestag or walk out on 
his speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they sat in a somber hush as the hunched, white-haired novelist 
recalled the events of the early 1930s, some of which he had witnessed 
personally: the election of Nazi leader Hermann Goering as president of the 
Reichstag, or legislature; the election of Adolf Hitler as Germany's 
chancellor; the dispatch of almost 200 members of the Reichstag to jails and 
concentration camps, and the burning of the Reichstag building in central 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies from most of the other parties applauded Heym when he finished, but 
the Christian Democrats did not, and Kohl, a famously tough and unforgiving 
party leader, sat looking sharply around, making sure no one in his ranks had 
made the mistake of clapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl, who since October's national elections has been negotiating the terms of 
the new government with the two parties that were his coalition partners in the 
last Bundestag, has come under sharp criticism in Germany lately for his 
perceived failure to bring any clear new vision to Germany's economic and 
political problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, 4.7 million Germans are unemployed or in state-subsidized 
unemployment-prevention programs, though social activists say the real figure 
is more like 6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists worry that even as the economy grows, new jobs are not being 
created fast enough. German business leaders are crying for an overhaul of 
their country's tax and regulatory structures. Taxed-to-death western Germans 
are bitter about the unexpectedly high cost of national unification, while 
easterners feel patronized by the west.  
</P>
<P>
 Addressing such problems "will be no less demanding a task than it was to 
bring a defeated Germany into the community of free nations in 1949," says 
Walter Stuetzle, a senior editor of Tagesspiegel, a Berlin daily. 
</P>
<P>
 And Kohl will be facing the problems from a seriously weakened position, once 
he is reelected chancellor, as expected, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 134-seat majority his three-party coalition government enjoyed after the 
last general election, in 1990, was whittled to 10 seats in October's voting. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Kohl's traditional coalition partners, the Free Democratic Party, was 
all but annihilated at the state level in a string of elections earlier this 
year. Newspapers here have been tallying up the number of potential dissidents 
within the Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how weak he may be, Kohl still managed to demonstrate Thursday 
that he is stronger than his political enemies. In a surprise move, his 
Christian Democrats voted to give a member of the left-of-center Greens a 
Bundestag vice presidency -- something the Greens have sought for more than a 
decade -- stripping Kohl's top rivals, the Social Democrats, of the position.

ISRAELIS CHEER JORDANIAN KING'S FIRST PUBLIC VISIT; MIDEAST: AT A CEREMONY IN 
GALILEE REGION, HUSSEIN AND RABIN SIGN RATIFIED COPIES OF PEACE PACT. A NEW 
BORDER CROSSING IS OPENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A beaming King Hussein, making his first public visit to Israel, stepped out 
of a helicopter Thursday into a throng of cheering schoolchildren waving 
Israeli and Jordanian flags. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by a phalanx of security men, the Jordanian monarch walked several 
hundred yards here at the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee alongside Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, down a road lined with hundreds of ecstatic 
children and watchful soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hussein! Hussein!" the children shouted. Some sang "Havenu Shalom Aleichem," 
a popular Israeli song of welcome and peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffered by the security men, Hussein had little physical contact with the 
children. But his less tightly guarded brother, Crown Prince Hassan, earned 
squeals of delight from the children when he reached into the crowd to shake 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a dream come true," said Betty Fessler, 50, who immigrated 12 years 
ago from Pasadena to Kibbutz Massada, half a mile from the Jordanian border. 
"Hussein is a very, very sensible leader, very pragmatic. I think he is 
probably even happier about this than we are." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been looking for this moment for a long time," said Tali Tal, a teacher 
who lives on a cooperative farm in the Galilee region. Tal brought her two 
daughters, 15-year-old Hadar and 10-year-old Zohar, to see the king. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 10 years old in 1967, and I remember the war then," Tal said. "There 
were bombs dropping all around, and we were in a hole in our garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "To come from there to here," she said, shaking her head in disbelief. "All my 
life, I have wanted peace. It is very easy for me to welcome the king. There 
are no hard feelings."  
</P>
<P>
 Hussein's contact with non-official Israelis was brief. His short walk led to 
the manicured grounds of Beit Gabriel, a cultural center on the shores of the 
Sea of Galilee built by Geta Sherover, a wealthy philanthropist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Sherover had a vision," said Anat Fonarov, general director of Beit 
Gabriel. "She thought that one day, we will host here our neighbors. Now, we 
are waiting for (Syrian President Hafez) Assad to come." 
</P>
<P>
 At a gilt-edged table on the lakeside, in the mellow glow of a late afternoon 
sun, Hussein and Rabin signed ratified copies of the Israeli-Jordanian peace 
treaty first signed Oct. 26 in the Arava desert, with President Clinton as a 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jordanian Senate ratified the treaty Wednesday. Thursday morning, four 
hours before Hussein and Rabin met, the two nations opened a new border 
crossing over the Jordan River about 60 miles north of Jerusalem. The 
Jordanians call the crossing the Sheik Hussein Bridge; the Israelis call it the 
Jordan River Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens of the two nations will be able to obtain visas and cross freely in 
another week. Ambassadors are expected to be exchanged within a month. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of senior officials from the Israeli Foreign Ministry plans to travel 
next week to Amman, the Jordanian capital, to search for a site for the Israeli 
Embassy and to finalize arrangements for issuing visas. "I thank God the 
almighty for blessing us both with the ability to see our long and objective 
march through to its conclusion," Hussein said in a brief speech after the 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping to the podium after the king, Rabin turned toward the monarch as he 
spoke. "I believe our aspiration is to achieve a comprehensive peace, for the 
purpose of having an entirely different Middle East," Rabin said. "You led your 
country with courage, imagination and vision. You led your country and your 
people under difficult times. It is a day when we celebrate together." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said he hoped that Syria and Lebanon will soon follow Jordan in making 
peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders then held a brief working meeting but no news conference. 
Hussein wanted to keep the session low-key, according to Jordanian officials, 
because the treaty continues to draw criticism in Jordan. Islamic 
fundamentalists there and elsewhere in the region say the treaty failed to 
secure Jordan's rights and that it grants Israel too many economic advantages 
in trade with Jordan.  
</P>
<P>
 Other Jordanians also have criticized the accord. Ahmed Obeidat, a former 
prime minister and staunch supporter of the regime, resigned from his Senate 
seat -- to which he was appointed by Hussein -- on Wednesday to protest the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli-Jordanian pact also has been criticized by Palestinians, who fear 
that Israel and Jordan are making decisions without their participation that 
ultimately will affect the 1.2 million Palestinians living in the West Bank and 
East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat -- who has been on 
bad terms with Hussein for months -- reached out to the king Wednesday night, 
telephoning him for the first time since Arafat moved to Gaza in July to head 
the self-governing Palestinian Authority there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was decided that contacts between them would continue," said Nabil abu 
Rudeineh, a spokesman for Arafat. Palestinian officials said Arafat may travel 
to Amman soon to meet with Hussein. The two have publicly sniped at each other 
recently over who should protect Muslim holy sites in East Jerusalem, and over 
the nature of future ties between the Palestinian-run territories and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no accident, Israeli analysts said Thursday, that Hussein decided to 
make his first visit to Israel one to an obscure site in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed far away from Jerusalem, where Palestinians are sharply critical of 
him and might have publicly protested his visit.

BLACK INTERESTS TRY TO GET A POLITICAL GRIP; AFRICAN AMERICANS: TO SOME, 
CONGRESSIONAL CHANGE HERALDS A LONELY FIGHT FOR SOCIAL POLICIES. OTHERS SEE 
DOORS OF POWER OPENING FOR CONSERVATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As they come to grips with the changed congressional landscape, organizations 
representing African Americans are groping for a new strategy to advance their 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Some -- like Wade Henderson, Washington director of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People -- have begun planning the unimaginable: He is 
seeking issues where the civil rights group can form coalitions with GOP 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be necessary to cultivate more access and involvement with the 
Republican leadership," Henderson said, adding that points of common interest 
have yet to be defined or suggested to the incoming congressional leaders. 
"That's going to require our opening doors we've never considered crossing." 
</P>
<P>
 While many black lawmakers were pumped up two years ago by the election of the 
first Democrat to the White House in more than a decade, they now find 
themselves stripped of many of their congressional allies and stunned by a 
seeming national rejection of social policies that they believed could be 
enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping change in Congress came as a humbling reversal for members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, whose members are overwhelmingly Democrats and will 
have to surrender three committee chairs and 17 subcommittee chairs to 
Republicans in the 104th Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Congressional Black Caucus will become a non-player because no one will 
need their votes anymore," said Raynard Jackson, Washington bureau chief of 
National Minority Politics, a conservative black-owned magazine published in 
Arlington, Va. "The White House is going to move away from the black caucus to 
appeal to the center of the nation and the Republicans can pass anything they 
want without a single vote from the Democrats in the Black Caucus." 
</P>
<P>
 But others saw opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results of the elections made it respectable for blacks to be 
conservative and Republican," said Armstrong Williams, a Washington-based black 
radio talk-show host. "Black Americans can come home. They can come out of the 
kitchens of the Democratic Party." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong pointed to the strong showings of black Republicans in the midterm 
elections as proof of opportunities for blacks within the GOP. In particular, 
he said, the election of former Oklahoma University football star J.C. Watts to 
a seat in Congress as a Republican and the reelection of Rep. Gary Franks 
(R-Conn.) illustrates the willingness of whites to vote for blacks who have 
conservative values. Both Watts and Franks represent majority white districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about race, it's about old-fashioned, conservative values and 
beliefs in the Creator," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Richardson, publisher of National Minority Politics, said that 
politically active blacks will find over the next two years that they will have 
more opportunities to advance within the GOP than in the Democratic Party. He 
said that Democrats take black participation for granted because blacks tend to 
overlook Republican candidates and vote blindly for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, this year's election shows that is changing. Twenty-two blacks 
ran for House seats on the GOP ticket, up from 15 in 1992. More importantly, he 
said, eight of the candidates won at least 40% of the votes in their races, a 
remarkable feat because most of them were running against black Democrats and 
because black voters tend to give GOP candidates only about 10% of their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Others glumly predict that black lawmakers and their constituents will find 
few sympathetic ears within the Clinton Administration or among congressional 
leaders -- Democrats or Republicans -- as they fight to maintain policies and 
programs supported by their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This new situation is certain to pose a new challenge because it raises 
questions about how blacks relate to the Administration, which we expect will 
move to the right and away from our concerns," said Linda Faye Williams, who 
heads the Institute for Policy and Education at the Congressional Black Caucus 
Foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 "The same can be said of Congress. Even the Democrats who were our allies will 
be rushing to the center and away from anything that smacks of liberal or 
special interests. Right now, we don't know whether we have foes or allies." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Williams said, black lawmakers expect a lonely fight as they 
struggle to hold on to voting rights laws and try to prevent enactment of laws 
that might disproportionately harm blacks, such as on welfare, crime and other 
social policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Reeves, assistant professor of electoral politics and public policy at 
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, said that he fears black Americans may 
consider politics not worth their time if their choice is between supporting 
Republicans intent on reversing social policies and right-tilting Democrats who 
fail to support black concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see the minority caucus having influence whatsoever over the next two 
years," Reeves said. "This is a real dangerous situation as far as black voting 
participation is considered. This renders our choices down to voting against 
something all the time because the politicians will not be giving (blacks) 
something to vote for." 
</P>
<P>
 But the NAACP's Henderson disagreed. He said that a GOP-controlled Congress 
might make it easier for his group and other black-led organizations to 
motivate black participation in politics so they can effect changes in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP's future Speaker of the House, Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and his 
allies "will frighten many black people," Henderson said. "Much of what he says 
on subjects like crime and welfare has an undertone that strikes a racial chord 
among African Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that leaders of black interest groups must deal aggressively and 
affirmatively with what he called "the new regime" on Capitol Hill. "Our whole 
strategy can't be a defensive one," Henderson said. "We will have to develop a 
functional relationship with the Republicans. To do otherwise would mean we're 
shutting ourselves off from any progress." How Minorities, Women Fared in House 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers of women and minorities in the House remained largely intact after 
Tuesday's elections. But these groups will be decidedly more conservative than 
their previous counterparts because Republicans picked up seats. 03,09,17,16

RECOUNT ORDERED IN RACE WITH A 2-VOTE MARGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A recount has been ordered for a congressional race in which unofficial final 
results show seven-term incumbent Democrat Sam Gejdenson winning by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gejdenson received 79,169 votes to 79,167 for Republican challenger Edward M. 
Munster, the secretary of state's office said.Third-party candidate David 
Bingham finished with 27,729 votes. A recount is automatic if the margin 
between candidates is less than 0.5% but not more than 2,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite trailing in the first count, Munster made his plans for Washington, 
confident that the new count would favor him. 
</P>
<P>
 He issued a news release Thursday describing himself as "United States 
Congressman-elect." 
</P>
<P>
 Gejdenson, meanwhile, ducked the spotlight and waited out the suspense in 
private. Bob Baskin, a spokesman for the Gejdenson campaign, said he is 
confident Munster will be defeated again. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Gejdenson defeated Munster, a former state senator, by 2 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 The 54 towns in eastern Connecticut's 2nd District will have until Monday to 
conduct their recounts, and until Nov. 18 to submit new tallies. Results can be 
appealed to state Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In another close race, meanwhile, the Democratic candidate for governor of 
Maryland remained ahead by several thousand votes Thursday as absentee ballots 
were tallied, but the Republican was chipping away at his lead. 
</P>
<P>
 By today, election officials were expected to know whether Ellen Sauerbrey had 
picked up enough votes to offset Parris Glendening's 6,187-vote lead in the 
unofficial count Tuesday. More than 1.2 million ballots were cast. 
</P>
<P>
 With reports in from 14 counties, Sauerbrey had 9,379 absentee votes and 
Glendening 6,110. That cut his lead to 2,918 votes, but Glendening said he is 
confident.

SUIT CITES IMPAIRED CHILDREN AIDED BY SERVICES; COURTS: CLASS-ACTION CHALLENGE 
TO NEW LAW DESCRIBES CASES SUCH AS A DEAF GIRL IN THE STATE ILLEGALLY WHO 
LEARNED SIGN LANGUAGE IN SPECIAL CLASSES. CO-AUTHOR OF MEASURE SAYS LEGAL 
TACTIC IS DISHONEST.

<P>
 Opponents of Proposition 187 say there are at least 300,000 reasons to keep 
fighting against the popular new law. Barbara Ayala is one. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara, 15, is an illegal immigrant who would be forced out of school by the 
measure and a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits filed to block it. Hearing- and 
speech-impaired, she was unable to communicate with others until her parents 
brought her from Mexico in 1992 and enrolled her in special classes at Alhambra 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that I could not talk, people did not understand me," she said 
Thursday, speaking through a sign-language interpreter. "Now I can sign. . . . 
I feel free." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit naming Barbara is one of at least eight legal challenges filed since 
Tuesday's passage of Proposition 187, which denies public services to illegal 
immigrants, including about 300,000 students statewide. Legal experts say it is 
too early to tell whether the suits will ultimately be combined. 
</P>
<P>
 For her parents, Cipriano and Andrea Ayala, the lawsuit is the latest chapter 
in a lifelong quest to help their daughter. The trek began, they said, with 
incessant tests and ineffective treatments when she was a toddler. It continued 
with the decision to abandon good jobs and family in Cuernavaca for an illegal 
hike across the border and an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard that education would be better for her in the United States -- that 
there were special programs," said Andrea Ayala, who left two grown children 
behind when she came north. "We came for our daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara's father, who traded a journeyman contractor's position in Mexico for 
entry-level work in a factory here, said the sacrifices have been worthwhile. 
"It was really very, very small, that sacrifice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of Proposition 187 say that peppering lawsuits with emotional stories 
such as Barbara's is a clever but dishonest tactic to influence public opinion. 
A boy identified only as Gregorio T. in the suit filed by the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund has encephalitis that will be terminal, the 
suit says, if he is denied medical care. Another has had a kidney transplant 
and allegedly will not survive without rigorous follow-up care. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pick out the horror stories, the hard-luck cases," said Alan Nelson, 
co-author of the new law and former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. "Of course, if I was on the other side, I'd be doing 
the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 These hardship cases are the exception, not the rule, and they are not this 
country's responsibility, Nelson said. In addition, he said, disabled illegal 
immigrants such as Barbara may be taking special education slots away from 
legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 However, current state law requires that public schools accommodate all 
students with special needs. Alhambra's superintendent of schools, Heber Meeks, 
said there is no waiting list for the Alhambra High program. 
</P>
<P>
 Special education students are among the most expensive to educate. On 
average, a student costs the state about $3,400 a year, and hearing-impaired 
high school students cost at least $1,000 a year more, state education 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Alhambra High keeps classes small in its special education program and 
Barbara Ayala also takes regular classes -- with a personal interpreter -- the 
tab for educating her is higher than $6,000 annually, according to Assistant 
Supt. Dianne Saurenman. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara is blissfully unaware of that cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, she attended school only with hearing-impaired students and the 
teachers required them to read lips. She never learned to sign there and 
conversed as best she could with her parents and a few close friends in a 
combination of a gestures, grunts and note-writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very frustrating," she said Thursday. "I felt oppressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, she eagerly shoulders a full academic load -- math, science, history and 
English -- as well as taking cooking and physical education classes. She is 
learning to work on computers and envisions that skill as leading to a possible 
career. She has more friends here, she said, many of them deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, her father said, he finds himself relying on his daughter. She can 
read English signs and labels. He cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara's attorney, Fred Kumetz, said Thursday that he initiated the 
class-action suit after he met the Ayalas through another client and was 
touched by their concern for their daughter. Under federal court rules, Kumetz 
can be paid for his efforts by taxpayers, but only if he wins. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Money) is not the motivation," he said. "I was born in Mexico. This is an 
important issue to me."

NEW CITIZENS SAVOR THEIR TRIUMPH; IMMIGRATION: FORTY-EIGHT HOURS AFTER THE 
ELECTION, 3,500 IMMIGRANTS ARE SWORN IN AT AN EMOTIONAL CEREMONY IN LOS 
ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The 3,500 begin arriving two hours early for the 1 p.m. ceremony that, with a 
few words, will turn the concrete floor of the Los Angeles Convention Center 
into a federal court and, with a few more words, turn them into U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an electric sign that last week advertised a meeting of the National 
Food Processors Assn. and now says, "Welcome Citizens," they come for the 
fourth swearing-in ceremony over two days, designed to naturalize 14,000 people 
in all. And though these have become monthly events in Los Angeles, this 
citizenship marathon comes just 48 hours after an election in which immigration 
was a lightning-rod issue, leading some to complain that the welcome mat had 
been yanked from California's front door. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, however, the talk is not of politics. The hall is alive 
with stories about the personal struggles that have faced immigrants for 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated near the back of the hall, Johnny Jacman, 19, says his family emigrated 
from Israel to Northridge for a better life and of how he will use his 
citizenship "to become a policeman." 
</P>
<P>
 A row behind, a small American flag sticking out of his breast pocket, is Amin 
Basaria, 31, of Torrance by way of Pakistan, who came here as a student 14 
years ago, "became illegal after I finished," and on this day says, "I finally 
feel free." 
</P>
<P>
 Next to him, in a suit and tie, is Philip Wi, 52, of Pasadena, a contractor 
who came from Korea 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens-to-be are from 120 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Each is given a packet containing, among other things, a voter registration 
form. Collecting the completed forms at one table is David Selayadia of the 
registrar's office, who was surprised to find one of his cousins, originally 
from Mexico, among those being sworn in Thursday. Selayadia's immediate family 
has been here for years, living in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father fought in World War II, my brother in Korea and another in 
Vietnam," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The front row is set aside for the old and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 In a wheelchair, a scarf covering her head, is Kim Anh Duong, 75, who is 
recovering from a stroke. She and her husband moved from Vietnam after the war, 
and she is the only one in the family still without citizenship, says her son, 
a computer worker from San Gabriel. "She's waiting for 15 years now," he says, 
noting that the citizenship test was hard for a woman whose English remains 
shaky. But after her stroke, "they only asked her a couple of questions, that's 
all," he confides. 
</P>
<P>
 Two seats away, Juan Esparaza, 33, clutches his papers in hands twisted from 
cerebral palsy. Here from Mexico 19 years, the San Bernardino resident is in a 
black tuxedo, with a light purple shirt, that he wore only once before. Hearing 
of the old woman's struggles, he volunteers his own: fighting the disease, 
learning a second language, graduating from high school and looking to further 
his studies, in mathematics or computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I very proud," he says, holding his flag, just as the loudspeaker commands, 
"All rise." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Ronald Lew takes the stage, pounds the gavel and court is 
in session. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your honor, the government is presenting . . . 3,500 candidates for 
citizenship," an INS official says. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Lew, though, also has a story, of how his own parents came from a 
Chinese farming village in the 1920s and bore nine children, and how his father 
asked him to become a lawyer for the sake of the family. He didn't really want 
to, but "I was obedient," the 53-year-old judge says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he chokes up, recalling how the parents he loved "so much" never lived to 
see him succeed like this, leading thousands through the ceremony his own 
father went through back in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony has remained much the same, all the candidates raising their 
right hands and pledging to fight "all enemies, foreign and domestic." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Lew says, "Congratulations, you are now the new citizens of this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 And he reminds the throng, "This country was only great because it was 
immigrants that made it strong," drawing the biggest cheers of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now of late we've had some problems," he adds, a clear reference to the furor 
over Proposition 187. "Let's try to put that aside. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . You're the citizens of the country now. . . . Burn it into your hearts 
and your minds." 
</P>
<P>
 And so they do, with a Pledge of Allegiance and "The Star-Spangled Banner," 
then the gavel comes down again and the new citizens of the United States are 
told, "this honorable court is now adjourned."

 San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan announced Thursday night that a tentative 
agreement had been made with one of the unions involved in the strike against 
the city's two major daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative agreement was made with the 46-member machinists union. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't mean to say we are going to settle the strike . . . but it's a 
strong step in the right direction," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Machinists' representatives said there was enough progress made with the 
agreement that it could be presented to members. But neither side would discuss 
terms of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan said talks would continue today with the other seven unions for the San 
Francisco Examiner and San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Delivery drivers, reporters, ad sales workers and printers walked off their 
jobs Nov. 1 at the Chronicle and Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout began after negotiators failed to reach an agreement on the future 
of about 150 delivery driver jobs, a pay raise and other issues. The labor 
contracts expired Nov. 1, 1993.

REAGAN DOING 'JUST FINE,' HIS WIFE SAYS AT BOOK SIGNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Ronald Reagan has been doing "just fine," riding horses and 
chopping wood on his Santa Barbara County ranch since telling the American 
public last weekend that he has Alzheimer's disease, Nancy Reagan said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope coming out like that will help people," she said of the two-page 
handwritten letter her husband released last weekend."His letter said it all." 
</P>
<P>
 A crush of well-wishers bearing cards, prayers and warm words for the former 
President greeted Mrs. Reagan on Thursday as she signed copies of her 
autobiography at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.  
</P>
<P>
 Giddy in her presence, they edged up to where she sat, whispered their best 
wishes and handed over copies of "My Turn." 
</P>
<P>
 As she signed their books in a neat, careful hand, some visitors assured her 
gently, "Your husband's in our prayers," then sidled away with nervous smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Reagan thanked them quietly and smiled back.

MEDICINE / ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE; EYE DRUG HAS PROMISE FOR EARLY DETECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Using a drug commonly employed to detect cataracts during eye examinations, 
Harvard researchers have devised an inexpensive new test for Alzheimer's 
disease that promises to speed the identification of the hard-to-diagnose 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Alzheimer's, which causes loss of memory and bodily control and is eventually 
fatal, affects as many as 4 million Americans -- including former President 
Ronald Reagan, who announced Saturday that he is in the early stages of the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers are enthusiastic about the new technique, whose discovery is 
reported today in the journal Science. But they caution that it has been 
studied in only a small number of people and must be tested on a much larger 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 That caution, some experts argue, is justified. At least three other highly 
touted tests for the disorder failed to live up to their preliminary promise 
when tested in larger trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Neurologists are desperate for a simple way to diagnose Alzheimer's in its 
earliest stages, or even before symptoms appear. They believe several drugs now 
in development could delay progression of the disorder if they were given early 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "While this is certainly an exciting finding, we have to do more research to 
confirm these results and see if the test is reliable for Alzheimer's disease," 
said Dr. Steven DeKosky of the University of Pittsburgh, a member of the 
Alzheimer's Assn. advisory board. If it does work, "It would be marvelous," 
added Dr. Leon Thal of UC San Diego.  
</P>
<P>
 The cause of Alzheimer's is unknown, but it is closely tied to aging. One in 
10 people over age 65 have the disease and nearly half of those over 85 are 
afflicted, suffering severe memory loss, an inability to think clearly, a short 
attention span and accelerated physical deterioration. Care for Americans with 
the disorder costs an estimated $80 billion per year, according to the 
Alzheimer's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 There is currently no easy way to diagnose Alzheimer's. Patients such as 
Reagan are diagnosed with a battery of blood tests, a physical examination, 
magnetic resonance imaging and sophisticated neuro-psychological tests that 
rule out all other sources of symptoms. But these tests may cost thousands of 
dollars and are wrong 25% to 40% of the time, according to neuroscientist 
Leonard F. M. Scinto of Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
 Scinto's colleague, neuroscientist Huntington Potter of Harvard, got the idea 
for the new test from his work with Down's syndrome, whose victims share many 
symptoms and biological problems with Alzheimer's patients. Down's patients who 
survive past age 30 develop brain lesions virtually identical to those of 
Alzheimer's patients and also display most of the characteristic mental 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Down's patients are known to be unusually sensitive to a class of drugs that 
inhibit transmission of signals between brain cells by a neurotransmitter 
called acetylcholine. This hypersensitivity is detected by a change in heart 
rate or an increase in pupil size after administration of such drugs. The 
response to these drugs had apparently never been studied in Alzheimer's 
patients, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Scinto's team used the drug tropicamide, settling on a dose 1/100 of that used 
to dilate pupils during an eye examination. They found that placing a drop of 
this solution in the eye caused the pupils of Alzheimer's patients to dilate by 
13% or more within 30 minutes, while those of healthy individuals dilated an 
average of only 4%. The dilation disappears within an hour or two. 
</P>
<P>
 They then examined 58 elderly individuals, including 19 with early symptoms or 
a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer's. Eighteen of the 19 showed the increased 
dilation. One of those had no obvious mental problems and only a mild 
difficulty with daily living activities. Within nine months, however, he had 
developed marked cognitive problems and memory loss, indicating that the test 
may be able to diagnose Alzheimer's very early in the course of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the remaining healthy patients, only two showed a positive response to 
the test. The researchers are monitoring their progress to see if they also 
develop the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers said that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other subjects need 
to be tested before they are confident that procedure successfully identifies 
the disease, a process that will take at least two years. They also noted that 
the test presently cannot be conducted by most ophthalmologists because special 
equipment is necessary to measure the change in pupil size. (Southland Edition, 
A24) Test for Alzheimer's 
</P>
<P>
 Alzheimer's disease can currently be diagnosed only with a complete battery of 
blood, clinical and psychological tests, and even then the diagnosis is only 
75% accurate, at best. Here is a look at a new test that promises to be 95% 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Researchers put a drop of a diluted solution of the drug tropicamide in the 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 * A sophisticated instrument is used to measure dilation of the pupil. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the pupil dilates 13% or more within 30 minutes, the patient has 
Alzheimer's. If it doesn't, the patient is healthy.

FORMER PRIEST IN SEMINARY MOLESTATION CASE COMMITS SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Santa Barbara priest who had pleaded no contest to molesting a boy 
hanged himself in his Albuquerque, N.M., apartment shortly after completing his 
probation, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Wolfe had spoken of suicide shortly before his death, which came less 
than a month after his probation ended, the News-Press of Santa Barbara 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Wolfe's friends found his body Sunday evening after he failed to arrive 
for dinner as scheduled, Albuquerque police spokeswoman Mary Molina Mescall 
said late Wednesday. No note was found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of the Medical Investigator of New Mexico ruled Wolfe's death a 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Wolfe, 40, pleaded no contest to engaging in oral sex with a minor. 
He was sentenced to a year in jail and five years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe had been a boys choir leader and teacher at St. Anthony's Seminary. His 
conviction triggered investigations and church admissions of decades of sexual 
abuse of children by a dozen priests at the seminary. 
</P>
<P>
 The boarding school, which was run by the Franciscan order of the Roman 
Catholic Church, was closed for financial reasons in 1987 after 89 years of 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, 12 people were accused of participating in sex acts or 
questionable behavior with 34 boys who attended the seminary from 1964 to 1987. 
The Franciscan order defrocked Wolfe after his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the leader of the choir, the Rev. Robert Van Handel, was sentenced 
to the maximum eight years in prison after pleading guilty to lewd and 
lascivious behavior with a 14-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe also had faced a pending civil lawsuit brought by two former students at 
St. Anthony's. The lawsuit also names Van Handel and the Franciscan order. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of the former students, Paul Smith, expressed dismay at the 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe in suicide as a way to handle these things, and are very 
sorry he took that route," Smith said.

MAN CHARGED IN 1985 SLAYING OF HIS WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine years after his wife died, a 39-year-old Lake Elsinore man has been 
charged with murdering her by forcing her to consume soap and then strangling 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Cohn was arrested at the time of his wife's death in 1985, but was not 
charged because investigators could not prove that he forced his wife to eat 
the soap, said Riverside County Deputy Dist. Atty. Eileen Hunt. Prosecutors at 
the time believed she died of toxic asphyxiation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cohn's son, now 11, told authorities several months ago that his father 
has beaten him and made him eat soap and dog feces as punishment since the 
death of his mother, Hunt said. The boy came forward after school officials 
noticed signs of possible abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the youngster's tip, the body of Carla Cohn was exhumed in September 
and a second autopsy detected that the 29-year-old woman had sustained a broken 
bone in her neck, apparently from being strangled, Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Cohn was arraigned Tuesday in Riverside Consolidated Court and held 
without bail. Because he allegedly forced his wife to eat two pounds of soap 
before he killed her, he was charged with the special circumstance of torture, 
Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to facing charges of torture and murder, Cohn also was charged 
with child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his first arrest, Cohn said bruises on his wife's body were 
self-inflicted and that she had eaten the soap on her own. According to court 
papers, investigators were told at the time that Cohn beat his wife, burned her 
with cigarettes and stuck pins in her.  
</P>
<P>
 After the boy was taken into protective custody in June by authorities, Cohn 
was arrested after threatening to burn down a Department of Public Social 
Services facility, then showing up there with gasoline.

FOR SOME, ELECTION TENSION CONTINUES OVER ABSENTEE BALLOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pumped up with adrenaline, they waited with champagne bottles in luxury hotels 
two nights ago, eager to hear that their candidate had won. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, weary staffs involved in three close contests were still waiting, 
this time in the drab surroundings of the Los Angeles County 
registrar-recorder's office, where the largest number of absentee ballots in 
the state will be counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Their assignment was to watch like hawks as dozens of elections officials 
started the process by beginning to open more than 170,000 absentee ballots to 
verify signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 140 public employees were to continue working today and over the 
weekend with the goal of beginning to count the votes Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The results could change the outcome in the 54th Assembly District, where 
incumbent Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach) leads Republican Rancho Palos Verdes 
Mayor Steve Kuykendall by just 64 votes; in the 36th Congressional District, 
where Republican Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks leads incumbent 
Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) by 93 votes, and in the U.S. Senate race between 
incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein and the GOP's Mike Huffington, who trails 
by 123,610 votes statewide.

CONGRESSIONAL SHAKE-UP SENDS SHOCK WAVES ABROAD; FOREIGN POLICY: THE GOP'S HUGE 
VICTORY CATCHES MANY INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS BY SURPRISE. TRADE, AID CONCERNS 
ARE RAISED. 
</P>

<P>
 In the eyes of the world on Thursday, President Clinton looked like the 
walking wounded, facing two years of legislative gridlock with Republicans in 
control of Congress and the prospect of a one-term presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Political commentators -- from Asia to Europe and liberal to conservative -- 
expressed surprise over the scope of Democratic losses and concern that the 
Republican congressional majority could mean more isolationism and less 
commitment to free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the map, newspapers and political commentators debated whether the 
Democrats' drubbing was the result of a "morose national mood," as the French 
daily Le Figaro suggested -- that is, part of a global anti-incumbent trend -- 
or whether it marked a true shift to the right by the United States, as 
Canada's Toronto Star determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most voters embraced the Republican platform of fighting crime with more 
police, fighting the world with more defense spending and fighting the poor by 
slashing services and cutting taxes," the Star's editorial said. 
</P>
<P>
 In either case, Clinton was the clear loser to just about anyone looking at 
the electoral upheaval in the world's surviving superpower. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican victory was welcomed in some parts of the world, although few 
newspapers had kind words for the GOP's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 A reporter for Britain's pro-business Financial Times described House 
Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) as "a slash-and-burn conservative" and 
another said Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y) would be the GOP "chief attack 
dog" on the Whitewater affair as the new chairman of the Senate Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 A commentary in Germany's conservative Die Welt newspaper called the prospect 
of 91-year-old Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) at the head of the Armed Services 
Committee "depressing." 
</P>
<P>
 But most comment was reserved for the likely chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, right-wing Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, whom even 
the conservative Times of London called "a loose cannon." 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign policy issues, "Bill Clinton will find himself on a leash held by 
the all-powerful Senate," said an editorial in the left-leaning French 
newspaper Liberation. "To be sure, Clinton's foreign policy, particularly in 
Europe, was considered chaotic. But now national isolationism has a beautiful 
future ahead of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, various newspapers added, there is a new generation of more populist 
Republican leaders, which means that the GOP is no longer necessarily the party 
of free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately at stake on the trade front is ratification of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's Uruguay Round pact, on which Congress is 
scheduled to vote later this month. The pact, the result of years of painful 
negotiations, is meant to dramatically reduce world trade barriers and would 
create the World Trade Organization as the watchdog successor to GATT on Jan. 
1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to ratify the pact this year could deal "a mortal blow" to the 
multilateral trading system, GATT Director-General Peter Sutherland warned in 
Brussels.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is scheduled to discuss trade with leaders of Pacific Rim nations in 
Jakarta, Indonesia, later this week and with Latin American leaders in Miami on 
Dec. 9 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, some analysts voiced hope that traditional, pro-business Republicans 
would put a brake on the Administration's "managed trade" approach to Japan, 
which calls for trade agreements based on measurable results, such as a larger 
U.S. market share. 
</P>
<P>
 But others feared that a Republican-dominated Congress would increase pressure 
on Tokyo to cut its bureaucratic red tape and dismantle other hidden barriers 
that prevent newcomers from entering the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest concern centered on Helms. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper, 
echoing other analysts, noted that Helms had strongly advocated sanctions 
against Japan in 1987, when a Toshiba subsidiary was discovered to have sold 
submarine technology to the then-Soviet Union in violation of international 
agreements. "He is known as a hard-liner toward Japan," the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms has strong opinions on just about every foreign policy issue. While it 
is widely known that he has called Haiti's President Jean-Bertrand Aristide "a 
psychopath," it is less known that he has been an undying supporter of Taiwan 
in its 50-year conflict with China, though the United States does not recognize 
Taiwan as an independent country. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan, along with the issue of human rights, is among the most visceral for 
China's Communist leadership, which continues to view Taiwan as a province. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Russia, which has been the most important foreign policy issue 
for the Clinton Administration, several political commentators expressed 
concern that Republican control of Congress could lead to a cooling of 
U.S-Russian relations. They predicted that Clinton will be pressed to distance 
the United States from Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans have been preparing for a long time for an attack against 
what as early as a year and a half ago was policy agreed upon by the two 
parties: the Russo-centric, East European orientation of the Administration, 
and also against the outdated policy of focusing on the one figure (Yeltsin) in 
the Kremlin," wrote Izvestia's Washington correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Republicans are viewed as tough on Russia -- and sympathetic to an 
enlargement of NATO -- Poland and other former Communist countries eager for 
membership in the organization welcomed the U.S. election results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we have great support in both houses of the American Congress," said 
the centrist Zycie Warszawy newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Germany, Europe's richest country and closest U.S. ally under Clinton, 
even the conservative Die Welt newspaper expressed fear that security issues in 
general would be mishandled under feeble leadership.  
</P>
<P>
 In Israel, the mass-circulation Yediot Aharanot worried that the Republican 
landslide might mean a reduction in aid -- Israel is the single largest 
recipient of U.S. aid -- and could lead to U.S. reluctance to contribute 
peacekeeping troops to police an eventual Israel-Syria peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Israelis contemplate returning some or all of the strategic Golan 
Heights to Syria, they are counting on as many as 1,000 U.S. troops 
participating in a multinational monitoring force that would be stationed in 
the area for years to come. Some Republicans, including Helms, have spoken 
against such a deployment of U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "American Jewish lobbyists are trying to calm us that no dramatic change is 
going to take place, not in the political support to Israel and not in the 
economic support. But the facts tell us otherwise," said the main editorial in 
Yediot on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Mary Curtius in Jerusalem, David Holley in Seoul, Teresa 
Watanabe in Tokyo, Scott Kraft in Paris, Dean E. Murphy in Warsaw, Rone Tempest 
in Beijing, William Tuohy in London and Craig Turner in Toronto contributed to 
this report, as did Andrei Ostroukh of The Times Moscow Bureau.

CLINTON STRESSES PRIORITY, NAMES AIDS POLICY CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to repair his tarnished image within the AIDS community, President 
Clinton on Thursday named Patricia (Patsy) Fleming, a widely respected 
legislative specialist with 21 years of government experience, as his new 
director of AIDS policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who promised to give AIDS a high priority in his Administration, has 
been attacked by AIDS activists who say he has not done enough.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, introducing Fleming in a White House ceremony, reaffirmed his 
commitment to battling the disease. "The face of AIDS is no longer the face of 
a stranger," he said. "It is the face of a friend. . . . It is a disease with a 
human face." 
</P>
<P>
 His voice breaking, he added that he was dedicating the occasion "to my dear 
friend Elizabeth Glaser," the Los Angeles woman who delivered a stirring speech 
to the 1992 Democratic National Convention which nominated him, and who is ill 
with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The President apparently hopes that Fleming can succeed where her predecessor, 
Kristine M. Gebbie, failed -- particularly in communicating what the 
Administration views as its achievements in AIDS policy. After a year on the 
job, Gebbie left amid criticism that she lacked access to the President and 
support from within the federal agencies and had neglected to consult with AIDS 
experts and activists on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 However, both Clinton and Fleming -- and the AIDS community -- almost 
certainly now will face a far worse problem than communication. With the new 
Republican and distinctively conservative Congress it is likely to be a 
formidable challenge to push increased -- or even current -- AIDS programs 
through a Congress whose leaders have promised to cut taxes, increase military 
spending and cut social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming said that she remains optimistic, saying Congress "has always been 
sympathetic to AIDS," particularly in supporting money for increased scientific 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said in an interview earlier in the week that she expects the new 
Congress to be "more difficult in terms of funding" AIDS programs in general. 
"We will have to use our funds more judiciously," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she acknowledged that it would be especially difficult to gain support 
among lawmakers for prevention and education programs promoting safer sex 
practices, particularly those targeting adolescents, one of the fastest growing 
populations of infected Americans. Clinton has asked that she compile a report 
on the problem of AIDS infection in teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming, who has been serving as interim AIDS policy director since last 
August, most recently served as a special assistant to Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna Shalala. She worked for nearly a decade for the late 
Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) where, among other things, she was a major force in 
shaping AIDS legislation for Weiss' House Government Operations subcommittee on 
human resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like many Americans, AIDS has changed my life," she said. "The utter horror 
of the AIDS epidemic has reinforced my need to be an activist. For that, I am 
grateful. But AIDS has also forced me to attend too many funerals, to hold the 
hands of too many grieving friends and family members and to participate in too 
many candlelight vigils. For that, I am angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am angry because as an African American, as a woman, and as a mother of 
three sons, I know all too well the threat that HIV poses for every American."

$2.7-BILLION PLAN DRAFTED TO ENHANCE MILITARY LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to boost the quality of life in the armed forces, the Pentagon 
announced an ambitious $2.7-billion initiative Thursday to modernize and build 
new military housing, enhance family-support programs and raise military 
paychecks for those who live in high-cost areas like Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs, which officials hope to begin by the next fiscal year and 
continue until the end of the decade, underscore a belief by senior defense 
officials that modern American soldiers are under increasing stress as they are 
called on to defuse more and more regional crises around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the highest quality force in our nation's history," said Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry. "But there are stress points that need to be 
addressed if we want to maintain that quality into the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: "We 
cannot jeopardize the backbone of our armed forces, the core of military 
excellence -- our people. This is not merely a sentiment but it is a 
conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said that the initiatives will not require an increase in 
defense spending. Instead, the money will be shifted from programs for 
modernization and other technological improvements that had been planned for 
the years ahead. Perry would not specify which of those programs would be cut 
but he suggested that keeping troop morale high is more important at this point 
than investing in new weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent it's necessary to trade off between modernization on the one 
hand and readiness items on the other, I am prepared to do that in favor of 
readiness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also declined to comment on whether the public would support increased 
defense spending as proposed by some Republicans taking over key roles in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not making any assumptions at this point about increases in the top line 
of the Pentagon budget," the secretary said. "We will meet with the new 
committee chairman and get their views and their programs." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he and other Pentagon officials have worked well with members of 
both political parties in Congress. "I don't have any basis as I stand here for 
seeing a discontinuity in decisions or judgments about support for our defense 
program," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main elements of the six-year program call for keeping 10,000 on-base 
homes that otherwise would close for lack of maintenance, making repairs to 
another 5,000 barracks spaces and establishing "private sector housing 
ventures" to stimulate new home building projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highlights are paycheck boosts of up to $167 a month for some 30,000 
enlisted people living in communities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and New 
York where housing prices are high, and improved child care centers, recreation 
programs and base commissaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, Perry said, is to make a military career more enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that as the military reduces its size, "many service members question 
their long-term commitment and the prospects of a full career." He said that 
the turbulence of base closures "has disrupted" many military families. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighter squadrons in Europe are being moved around even "before families were 
settled," he said, and a "high operational tempo has put an extra strain on 
selected units." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Air Force alone, he said, the number of service members deployed away 
from home is four times as high as it was just five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Easing some of these stress levels will go a long way to improving the overall 
effectiveness of the military, he predicted.

PANEL CALLS FOR BROADER WORLD HISTORY LESSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal education panel today will release a new curriculum guide for 
teaching world history to students in grades 5 through 12 that asks teachers to 
redirect their scope beyond old Europe and toward "a genuine globe-encompassing 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 The new guidelines encourage a refocusing on non-traditional hallmarks of 
history such as China's Song dynasty, which developed paper currency and 
gunpowder and printing, panel members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The standards, which are voluntary, will retain the study of the Greek 
city-states and the Roman Empire but add the Mauryan Empire in India and the 
Olmec civilization, which influenced the Zapotec and Mayan civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The standards were already under fire from conservatives who say they belittle 
Western civilization in the name of multiculturalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The architect of the guidelines -- the UCLA Center for History in the Schools 
-- said it stands by its plan, which was approved by hundreds of historians and 
educators.

GOP LIKELY TO SEEK TURNAROUND ON DEFENSE FUNDING; SPENDING: REPUBLICANS ARE 
EXPECTED TO SEEK SPEEDED DEVELOPMENT OF NEW WEAPONS. PERIL TO MILITARY 
READINESS AT ISSUE IN GLOBAL PEACE OPERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Republican takeover of Congress next January is expected to lead to a 
noticeable increase in defense spending and heightened pressure on the Clinton 
Administration to cut back U.S. participation in global peace operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no major revamping of the military is likely, analysts said that GOP 
lawmakers are likely to try to reverse defense cuts by adding as much as $20 
billion more to the Pentagon's coffers over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans also are expected to press the Defense Department to speed up 
development of new weapons designed to defend U.S. troops against ballistic 
missiles on the battlefield -- considered a point of vulnerability for American 
forces now. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense has been a bone of contention for Republicans since the Clinton 
Administration took office. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP lawmakers have bridled over the Administration's plan to speed up the pace 
of the defense cutback. They also have criticized Administration decisions to 
deploy U.S. troops for peace operations, including those in Rwanda, Macedonia 
and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have said that those operations siphon off badly needed operating 
funds and eventually cut into military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 The "contract with America" that House GOP leaders drafted before the election 
called for restoring money that the Administration has cut from the defense 
budget and reimposing budget restrictions designed to protect it from raids by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar plan outlined by Republican senators earlier this year called for 
adding $20 billion to the defense budget over five years. But analysts said 
that it is too early to tell how far GOP lawmakers actually will go, 
particularly given the grim budgetary realities that Congress will face. 
</P>
<P>
 With overall budget limits already tight -- and with the GOP now pledged to 
cut taxes and reduce the federal budget deficit -- there will not be enough 
money left to revamp the defense program substantially, defense experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew F. Krepinevich, director of the nonpartisan Defense Budget Project, 
estimated that the most that Republicans will be able to increase defense 
spending will be about $2 billion to $4 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect the defense budget to rise very much," Krepinevich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, for all the talk about changes, Republicans on the House and Senate 
Armed Services committees are not that far from the positions of their 
Democratic colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and 
his likely replacement, Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), see most issues 
essentially alike. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.), who probably will be named chairman 
of that chamber's Armed Services Committee, is largely in agreement with the 
panel's current majority. Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland) now chairs the 
committee.  
</P>
<P>
 Differences between House and Senate versions of the defense bill have been 
negligible over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expect these changes once Republicans take control of Congress: 
</P>
<P>
 * Heightened pressure from lawmakers to limit the use of U.S. troops in 
peacekeeping operations, particularly in cases where the military budget does 
not contain funds to finance such ventures without depleting the services' 
operating budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new push to finance development of a weapon designed to destroy ballistic 
missiles that threaten U.S. troops on the battlefield -- a project that the 
Clinton Administration has downgraded. Some Republicans also want to revive the 
Ronald Reagan-era "Star Wars" program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Added monies for procurement of major weapons systems, such as the Air 
Force's proposed F-22 advanced fighter aircraft or the Army's 
soon-to-be-developed Comanche attack helicopter, both of which the 
Administration has hinted it may cancel or delay. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pressure for a speedup in the admission of Poland, Hungary, the Czech 
Republic and other former East European countries as full members of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization. Nations of the former Soviet Union have raised 
concerns over granting full status to those countries and Clinton, mindful of 
the issue, has granted them what amounts to only apprenticeship status. 
</P>
<P>
 * A move to restore the so-called "firewalls" in the congressional budget 
process that previously had protected the defense budget from raids by 
lawmakers who wanted to channel defense monies into domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the GOP takeover is apt to relax pressure on the Pentagon to 
eliminate duplication. Nunn and others have been pushing a project in which the 
armed services would redefine functions that each service should perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how the Administration will react to the Republican demands is not 
certain. Defense Secretary William J. Perry told reporters Thursday that the 
Pentagon is preparing its fiscal 1996 budget for submission in February as 
though no changes had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perry also expressed some skepticism about the ability of the GOP 
lawmakers to square their various demands with one another, hinting that it may 
not be possible to boost defense spending and reduce the overall budget deficit 
at the same time, as the Republicans have pledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they start putting their programs together, . . . they'll find some 
degree of conflict between these two objectives," Perry said. "My planning for 
the defense budget . . . is based on the same assumption of . . . resources 
that I made before the election."

OREGON VOTERS ALLOW ASSISTED SUICIDE FOR THE TERMINALLY ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oregon has become the only place in the nation that will let doctors hasten 
death for the terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure 16 on Tuesday's ballot passed 52% to 48% Thursday. Not all the 
absentee ballots were counted, but both sides said they do not expect the 
margin to change when the tally is completed today. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure 16 will allow a patient with six months to live to ask a doctor to 
prescribe a lethal dose of drugs to end unbearable suffering. At least two 
doctors must first agree that the patient's condition is terminal. The patient 
must request the drugs at least twice, then a third time in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 It is up to the patient to take the final step and administer the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Oregon doctors welcomed the prospect of legalizing suicide with a 
physician's help. They said that it has long been a common practice with the 
terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The physicians who are presently involved and have kept it secret and are in 
the closet, so to speak, will now be able to speak to their colleagues and say: 
'I will do this in the future because I think it's appropriate care,' " said 
Dr. Peter Goodwin, a medical school professor and a leading supporter of 
Measure 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar measures were defeated in Washington in 1991 and California in 1992, 
but those initiatives differed significantly by allowing a doctor to administer 
the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, lawmakers in the Netherlands approved guidelines that allow doctors 
to assist in the suicide of a patient. 
</P>
<P>
 The national debate over euthanasia intensified 4 1/2 years ago when Janet 
Adkins, a victim of Alzheimer's disease, killed herself with the help of Jack 
Kevorkian, who has been present at 20 deaths since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legalization of any form of assisted suicide will have just tremendous 
consequences that will reverberate through American society," said Arthur 
Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania 
School of Medicine in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Fieger, attorney and spokesman for Kevorkian, said of the Oregon 
measure: "It's just the first domino to fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Measure 16 foes warned that Oregon could become a haven for doctors like 
Kevorkian and could attract the terminally ill from around the world. But 
Caplan and others rejected that notion.

U.S. WON'T FIGHT PORNOGRAPHY CONVICTION; SUPREME COURT: U.S. SOLICITOR GENERAL 
HAD FAILED TO DEFEND PROSECUTION. IN BID TO END CONTROVERSY, ATTY. GEN. RENO 
PUBLICLY OVERRULES HIS POSITION. 
</P>

<P>
 In an effort to remove her department from an embarrassing legal flap over 
child pornography, U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno told the Supreme Court Thursday 
that the Clinton Administration no longer will side with a Pennsylvania man who 
was prosecuted for purchasing movies of scantily clad young girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Reno said, the government will enforce a strict definition of child 
pornography which outlaws not only photos of nude children but also 
provocatively posed depictions of minors wearing underwear or bathing suits.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Justice Department officials, her legal brief filed Thursday 
marked the first time in 24 years that a U.S. attorney general had publicly 
overruled a position taken by the solicitor general, who normally speaks for 
the government before the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an issue upon which reasonable people, applying the law in good 
faith, can and have disagreed," Reno said. Her department will seek to punish 
child pornographers "to the maximum extent allowed by the Constitution," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Solicitor General Drew S. Days III surprised the Supreme Court and 
outraged conservative activists when he announced that he would not seek to 
uphold the government's successful prosecution in a test case involving 
borderline child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 The conviction had been won by prosecutors for the George Bush Administration, 
who brought the charges before a jury in a conservative district in central 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Stephen A. Knox had purchased three sexually oriented videos from a 
Las Vegas company, but rather than prosecute its owners in Nevada for selling 
pornography, the Bush Administration brought federal charges against the 
Pennsylvania man for buying the videos. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox was found guilty, sentenced to five years in prison and his conviction 
was upheld by lower courts. In an appeal to the Supreme Court, lawyers for Knox 
argued that, if the law made it a crime to buy photos of scantily clad girls, 
the child models displayed "in newspapers, magazines, clothing catalogues and 
art exhibits" could be deemed pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices agreed to review the Knox case but, to their surprise, Days said 
that he would not defend the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the child models were clothed and were not "lasciviously engaging in 
sexual conduct," the videos did not violate the 1977 anti-child pornography 
law, Days maintained. In angry protest, conservative groups such as "Enough is 
Enough" and the American Family Assn. sent messages by the thousands to 
Congress and to the White House. By a 100-0 vote, the Senate passed a 
resolution condemning the Justice Department's stand.  
</P>
<P>
 Knox's appeal was returned to the lower courts, which rebuffed the Days 
position and upheld the far-reaching definition of child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Knox case again came to the high court, requiring the Justice 
Department to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, in a brief signed personally by Reno, the department said that Knox 
was properly convicted. The law makes illegal "all lascivious exhibitions of 
the genitals of children," regardless of whether the children are nude or 
wearing snug-fitting outfits, Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case is not over. The high court could still agree to hear Knox's 
claim that the law is so "vague" as to be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Though no mention was made of the Republicans' resounding victory in Tuesday's 
elections, one anti-pornography activist said that Reno had read the election 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a definite reflection of the realignment of powers . . . and a portent 
of things to come," said John McMickle, a lawyer for the National Law Center 
for Children and Families. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carl Stern, Reno's chief spokesman, said that the election did not affect 
the outcome. "This brief did not get written between Tuesday and Thursday," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's announcement was not the first signal that the Administration would 
reverse its initial position in the Knox case. Late last year, President 
Clinton ordered Reno's department to "aggressively attack the scourge of child 
pornography," to seek new laws if necessary and to review the Pennsylvania 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney general last publicly overruled a solicitor general in 1970 when 
John N. Mitchell disagreed with Solicitor General Erwin Griswold and sent a 
brief to the high court defending a conviction in a draft registration case.

DISNEY HALL

<P>
 Re "Disney Hall Work Halted, Study to Cut Costs Started," Nov. 3: 
</P>
<P>
 It came as no surprise to me and I am sure countless others that the projected 
structure, as designed, would present an extremely difficult problem for the 
cost estimators and that cost overruns would be a predictable result. It is 
commendable that the Walt Disney Hall Committee halted the project before 
construction started, to minimize this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems a bit self-serving that the Gehry firm welcomes a cost review, as it 
was, after all, the primary responsibility of the architect to design a 
structure that can be built at a cost within or close to the client's budget. 
Sadly, this is not always the case. Let's hope that all the involved parties 
can subjugate their desires and still produce a quality product that doesn't 
resemble the proverbial camel that results from a horse designed by a 
committee.

DANA PARSONS: FULLERTON POLITICS: IT'S OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe they're bored and just wanted some excitement. Maybe they're tired of 
being thought of as that sleepy town north of Anaheim that nobody ever talks 
about. Or, maybe they're just confused. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever. Will someone please explain what's going on in Fullerton, or, as 
we've come to know it, "The City That Loves Elections"? 
</P>
<P>
 In an election-year routine that has amounted to playing a shell game with its 
own City Council, Fullerton voters have kept us all guessing. When it comes to 
the council, now you see 'em, now you don't. This town changes council members 
more often than "All My Children" changes the cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The fun began in June, when a citizens' group opposed to a 2% utility tax 
recalled the three council members -- Buck Catlin, Molly McClanahan and Don 
Bankhead -- who voted for it. Citing the cost of a special election and noting 
that two of the evictees' terms ended this year, city officials wanted the 
three ousted members to serve until this week's election. Recall leaders, 
understandably wanting to savor their victory, insisted on a special election 
to replace the three. 
</P>
<P>
 So, they got one on Oct. 18, with none of the three ousted members eligible to 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 But, like a Quentin Tarantino script, there was a screwball twist. Because two 
of the terms ended in November, anyway, it meant that those two replacements 
would serve only until the regular elections this week. The third new member 
would finish out a two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 18, Peter Godfrey won the last two years of Bankhead's term. Jan Flory 
and Conrad DeWitte won the other two seats, subject to running again three 
weeks later. Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead surrendered their seats in late 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, things made at least a modicum of sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Tuesday, that is, when in the best show-biz tradition Fullerton voters 
gave us the surprise ending. 
</P>
<P>
 McClanahan and Catlin had said they wouldn't run in the November election, but 
Bankhead decided to try again. With Godfrey already sworn in to finish his 
original term, Bankhead was running for one of the other two seats. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, apparently to show there were no hard feelings, Fullerton voters 
voted Bankhead back into office. He finished right behind Flory in the voting, 
and they will be sworn in within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, DeWitte, who won a seat in October, finished fourth this week and 
out of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 I expected Bankhead to be gloating when I talked to him Thursday, but he 
wasn't. He said he still supports the utility tax as the fiscally responsible 
thing to do. He said the recall "really didn't make sense from the beginning" 
because the city isn't being mismanaged. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributed his success this week to a larger turnout and the public's 
willingness to "re-evaluate a lot of things and look at the city as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that the recall and special election resulted in Fullerton 
"spending $300,000 of the city's funds that could have been avoided with a 
little sense." 
</P>
<P>
 And as for DeWitte, he must be wondering if it was something he said. Riding 
high in October, shot down in November. 
</P>
<P>
 He explained things by noting the difference between the recall election that 
targeted specific candidates and the difficulties of running in a wide-open 
field. "I really did want to win," he said Thursday. "I felt I was a very good 
candidate and a very good councilman." 
</P>
<P>
 He defends the recall election in June. "I think we did a tremendous, 
excellent service for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, DeWitte has sat in on two council meetings and expects to be at two 
more before stepping down. If nothing else, he said, he'll be able to vote to 
repeal the tax before he leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitte said he ran in October only because none of the other recall leaders 
had come forward. He said his council experience has been richly rewarding and 
that his campaign signs leading up to this week's election read, "Conrad 
DeWitte Says Thank You." 
</P>
<P>
 After treating us to this puzzler, the impish Fullerton voters have left only 
one unanswered question: What would have happened if McClanahan and Catlin had 
also run again? 
</P>
<P>
 On second thought, never mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead said he considers his election as vindication for McClanahan and 
Catlin too. 
</P>
<P>
 If I were Bankhead, I'd be careful about statements like that.

LEARN A LANGUAGE? IT'S ELEMENTARY; EDUCATION: CHINESE, JAPANESE AND RUSSIAN ARE 
TAUGHT TO CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS 6 AT A NEW WILSHIRE DISTRICT MAGNET CENTER. 
THEIR RAPID PROGRESS AMAZES PARENTS AND TEACHERS.

 Their principal says you wouldn't believe it if you didn't see it with your 
own eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jin Duan's class, 10-year-olds are shouting out the solution to 71 plus 5, 
in Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 In Marina Sokolovsky's class, 8-year-olds are chanting a long poem in Russian. 
 
</P>
<P>
 In Bert Christensen's class, 7-year-olds are writing the alphabet in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hilge Ziazie's class, 6-year-olds are distinguishing the word for tree from 
flower in German. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not the children of international diplomats in an expensive private 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 These are inner-city children in a Los Angeles public school, after one month 
of foreign language instruction.  
</P>
<P>
 Their secret? 
</P>
<P>
 "Wo cong ming. Wo piao liang. Wo hui cheng gong."  
</P>
<P>
 The spirit of "I am smart. I am beautiful. I will succeed," in Chinese, rings 
through Marvin Avenue Elementary's new language magnet center, housed in a row 
of small prefab bungalows on the campus at the southwestern edge of the 
Wilshire district. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's enthusiasm brings tears to the eyes of parents, teachers and 
visitors, who marvel at the speed of their growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have thought I was crazy . . . if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes," 
said Anna McLinn, principal of the 1,086-student Marvin Avenue Elementary and 
mastermind behind the Dual Language Arts Magnet Center. "For the first time, 
I'm able to see enthusiasm on the faces of these youngsters. I just want to 
cry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McLinn devised the program -- the first of its kind in an elementary school in 
the giant Los Angeles Unified School District -- based on a model in Dade 
County, Fla. In the Florida program, student test scores are consistently among 
the highest in the district, school officials there say. 
</P>
<P>
 McLinn says she wants her program to open Los Angeles youngsters' minds and 
prepare them for the global economy.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be able to establish a program where youngsters can perform 
academically and have the cultural awareness of all peoples. After becoming 
bilingual or trilingual, instead of them beating around the bushes looking for 
a job, the jobs will come to them," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The school opened in September with 180 children in kindergarten through fifth 
grade, all taught in bilingual classes in English and either Chinese, Japanese, 
Russian or German. 
</P>
<P>
 For 90 minutes every morning, the youngsters receive formal training in the 
foreign language of their choice in classes that mix students across grade 
levels. During the rest of the day, students are taught subjects such as 
reading, math and social studies in those same classes, but in English, with 
foreign words and concepts sprinkled in. 
</P>
<P>
 This intensive language training has been a source of pleasure and pride for 
the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun," said 6-year-old Iman Sylain of Inglewood, as she slowly etched the 
squiggly hiragana characters in her book. "My mommy and daddy love it. They ask 
me to tell them how to say the words and they want me to teach them Japanese. 
And I teach my grandma too."  
</P>
<P>
 "One time I called my mother's job and everybody wanted to hear me talk in 
Russian," echoes Tyra Brewer, 8, of the Wilshire area. She is among the 
children reciting a Russian poem, which she proudly announces she memorized by 
repetition. "You practice without looking and you learn."  
</P>
<P>
 "My friends, they are shocked," said Adam Fowler, 8, of South-Central, sitting 
shoeless at his desk. In the center's two Japanese classes, students follow the 
Japanese custom of removing their shoes before entering class. "They don't even 
know what I'm saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the team of six teachers providing the language lessons say they are 
amazed at the children's progress.  
</P>
<P>
 "They have literally no accent. It's just perfect," said Margaret Fang, who 
teaches Chinese to first- and second-graders. "This is the best time for them 
to learn. I use a technique called 'total physical response.' We use 
finger-pointing, nursery rhymes and songs. It's very easy for them to pick up." 
 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers were recruited by McLinn for their language skills and cultural 
knowledge. Most are teaching for the first time in the Los Angeles city 
schools.  
</P>
<P>
 More than half the students in the language program are from Marvin Avenue 
Elementary, which houses the magnet center. The others are bused in by the 
district from across the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents say they have already seen a difference in their children's attitudes 
toward learning since the school year began. 
</P>
<P>
 "The languages are helping them use their minds more," said Virginia Thomas, 
whose two daughters, China Thomas, 6, and Amber Spurlock, 9, are enrolled in 
the Chinese and Japanese classes, respectively.  
</P>
<P>
 "Not only do you have to use English, you have to do your homework in Chinese 
and Japanese. It stretches their minds," she said. "In just 10 days, (China's) 
handwriting, her reading and math improved. I couldn't believe it. I had tears 
in my eyes."  
</P>
<P>
 Parents and students pick the language the children will learn, based on the 
children's interest and the availability of the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 McLinn said the Russian class was the hardest to fill, because most students 
opted for Chinese and Japanese studies. To keep each class under 30 children, 
she assigned some students to the Russian class, which pleasantly surprised 
many children.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know there was a Russia," said Kurtis Greene, 9. "So I wanted to try 
it. And I just got the hang of it."  
</P>
<P>
 McLinn said all the parents agreed to her requirement that children do three 
hours of homework every night, and teachers say the students seem to enjoy the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The children in other schools could do much more (homework) than they are," 
said German teacher Ziazie. "It's only that they are not challenged enough. 
These children realize homework is just emphasizing what they learned during 
the day. They've gotten used to it. This kind of routine is very good for the 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and teachers say the only thing worrying them now is that there is no 
public middle school in the city with such extensive foreign language 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the success of this program will probably motivate administrators at 
the middle school level to provide a similar program to act as a feeder school 
to this one," said Richard Battaglia, who coordinates the school district's 132 
magnet centers and schools. "L.A. is a very multicultural community. It's part 
of the Pacific Rim. There are more than 80 languages spoken in the city. This 
(kind of program) is something a city like L.A. with its cosmopolitan setting 
should have." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, people at the school take pleasure in the permanent imprint they know 
they are leaving on the youngsters' minds, even though the children say they 
are sometimes teased when they try out their new language skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends laugh at me," says Anysse Wilmore, 9, who studies Japanese. "They 
should be laughing at themselves because I'm getting a chance to learn 
something different, instead of just English."ELEMENTARY SC

DREAM TEAM; MAKE-A-WISH GROUP MARKS MILESTONE IN HELPING CHILDREN WHO ARE 
CRITICALLY ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hers are happy stories that can have unhappy endings. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Lewis has smiled -- and cried -- through them all during the 11 years she 
has granted final wishes of Los Angeles children with life-threatening or 
terminal illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 A dying 4-year-old dreams of meeting the Power Rangers in person. A critically 
ill 8-year-old wishes she could have cheery new furniture in her bedroom. A 
10-year-old chemotherapy patient wants to visit Disney World if she gets 
stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Make-A-Wish Foundation office in West Los Angeles that Lewis helped 
establish, it is often a race to make a wish come true. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the chapter will grant its 2,000th wish. It's a professional-style 
treadmill for a Compton girl whose hobby of running marathons has been halted 
by lupus, a chronic inflammation of her body's tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something so compelling about granting just one wish to a child whose 
life is being cut so tragically short," said Lewis, 52, of Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a joy to see children light up like candles when their wish is granted. 
You can see the change in their faces. You can see the reaction in their 
parents. It brings tears to your eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 There can be tears of frustration too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When a 6-year-old boy with a brain tumor wished for a ride in a Lamborghini, 
he was too sick to leave the hospital when the sports car came to get him. So 
Lewis hurriedly rounded up Lamborghini posters, key rings and a jacket and took 
them to his bedside. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis described the items to the boy as he lay dying. "He smiled and said, 
'Thank you.' Then he said, 'Please keep talking,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's excruciating, terribly painful when children are very close to the end 
of their illness. They are very aware -- they know when a playmate at the 
hospital has passed away between treatments. Sometimes I go home and cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, a former kindergarten teacher with two grown children, helped organize 
the local Make-A-Wish chapter in 1983 after a friend read about the 
Phoenix-based program in a TRW aerospace company employee newsletter. It's now 
the largest of 80 national chapters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles chapter's first wish was a simple one: a VCR for an 
11-year-old boy from Ventura who was missing his favorite TV shows during 
hospital treatment for cystic fibrosis. After that, a 7-year-old Camarillo boy 
with leukemia was granted the first of what would become hundreds of trips by 
various children when he asked to visit Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
 Final wishes since then have been limited only by children's imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
 A 14-year-old Inglewood boy with liver cancer whose hobby is raising pigeons 
dreams of attending an international pigeon breeders' convention in Germany. A 
15-year-old boy with cancer from Westlake Village asks to see the Air Force One 
presidential jet. A 9-year-old La Crescenta boy with cystic fibrosis wants "to 
be rich and famous." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' group has granted them all. Often, imagination has been required at its 
end too. 
</P>
<P>
 Make-A-Wish officials ended up chasing Air Force One halfway across the 
country after President George Bush unexpectedly flew out of Washington the day 
the Westlake Village boy arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Crescenta youngster was made to feel rich and famous when he and his 
family were treated to a vacation at a posh Hawaiian resort. Hotel workers were 
given pictures of the boy so they could recognize him and greet him by name 
when he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-year-old Alhambra girl with cystic fibrosis who dreamed of the meadow 
where characters in her favorite film, "Anne of Green Gables," picnicked went 
there to visit after the foundation traced the film location to Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation flew a Granada Hills leukemia patient by private jet to the 
Miramar Naval Air Station. The 6-year-old boy had confided that his wish was to 
become a fighter pilot, like characters in his favorite movie, "Top Gun." Real 
Navy pilots stood at attention and saluted when he buzzed the base control 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
 When an 8-year-old San Fernando Valley boy with an inoperable brain tumor 
asked to see his grandmother, it took weeks to find her and get her out of 
war-torn Beirut. After she arrived at his bedside and spoke to him in Arabic, 
he pulled out of a coma and rallied enough to go home for a last visit, Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,000th wish is being granted to a 15-year-old Compton High School 
sophomore whose diagnosis of lupus has put an end to her love of running 
outdoors. The girl -- who asked to remain unidentified -- will receive a $3,000 
treadmill donated by a major fitness company. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are unhesitatingly generous when it comes to granting sick 
children's wishes, according to Lewis. So are celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor David Hasselhoff once canceled a weekend trip so he could visit a 
10-year-old Van Nuys boy who was critically injured when he was hit by a car. A 
boy who asked to watch the rock band Metallica play was invited to play guitar 
during a recording session. A wish to meet the rock group Testament touched 
musicians so deeply that one of them later attended the youngster's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' group does not keep statistics on wish-makers who die. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, foundation workers -- including 80 volunteers who work in pairs while 
interviewing young patients -- are not encouraged to stay in touch with the 
children. Seeing youngsters' health fade could become too emotionally 
stressful, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Make-A-Wish is one of two organizations in Los Angeles that grant the wishes 
of children with life-threatening illnesses. The 12-year-old Starlight 
Foundation additionally works with children who are either chronically or 
seriously ill, according to Gail Simons, its director. The Starlight office 
assists children from throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen Los Angeles-area hospitals nominate young patients for 
Make-A-Wish's help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives children and their families something to really look forward to when 
they're going through pretty painful tests," said Elva Tamashiro, supervisor of 
a patient-assistance program at Los Angeles Childrens Hospital. "It gives them 
something to focus on -- to know they're going to make it through these really 
tough times." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That was just what the doctor ordered for 5-year-old Jeffrey Kettle, a 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patient from Arcadia. Before undergoing a bone-marrow 
transplant, Jeffrey wished for a treehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The one that Make-A-Wish volunteers built for him was so elaborate that a city 
permit was ultimately needed. The boy's anticipation of playing in the 
treehouse helped him through something that "they didn't think he'd live 
through," according to his father, Tim Kettle. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 7, "Jeffrey's over the hump -- he's beating the odds," Kettle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But a lot of these kids don't make it. Their wish is one of the last pleasant 
things they have to look forward to."

BARRACKS FROM JAPANESE INTERNMENT CAMP UNLOCKS MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA NGUYEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking at the World War II internment camp barracks reconstructed in Little 
Tokyo, Ron Mukai felt a tinge of worry and pride. 
</P>
<P>
 He was proud that he was able to help transport to Los Angeles an original 
barracks from a former camp in Wyoming, where his father's family was forced by 
the federal government to live because of concerns that Japanese Americans were 
a subversive threat.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Whittier resident also worries that the barracks, part of an exhibit 
opening today at the Japanese American National Museum, may be only a small 
step toward dispelling ignorance and intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are xenophobic and afraid of the unknown. It's easy to have this fear, 
this phobia," said Mukai, 25. "This exhibit can open the doors to education and 
help people understand the genuine disservice to people who went through this 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the goal of the exhibit, "America's Concentration Camp: Remember the 
Japanese American Experience." Its centerpiece is the Heart Mountain, Wyo., 
barracks, dismantled and trucked to Los Angeles by a group of former inmates 
determined to inform future generations about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Bacon Sakatani, 65, who was interned at the camp during the war, first got the 
idea of displaying the barracks nine years ago after almost a dozen trips to 
the camp, which is now farmland. Only about two dozen barracks remain of the 
450 that once housed 10,000 internees. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Japanese American National Museum considered organizing an exhibit 
two years ago to commemorate the 120,000 Japanese Americans interned from 1942 
to 1945, Sakatani jumped at the chance to transport the barracks to Los Angeles 
and quickly got approval from the museum. In September, Sakatani, along with 
Mukai, his father, and 40 others from Southern California, revisited the 
Wyoming camp and loaded flatbed trucks with two 20-by-60-foot barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 With saws and hammers, Sakatani and volunteers resurrected a three-unit 
barracks in Los Angeles over a windy October weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sakatani, who was 13 when incarcerated with his family in 1942, the 
barracks memorialize a painful wartime experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The barracks have taken out much of my anger," said the retired computer 
programmer, who lives in West Covina. "I had a lot of anger before. But now I 
don't have to speak about it. (Visitors) can just look at the barracks and 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 The barracks had no ceilings or insulation, Sakatani recalled. Instead, the 
drafty wood-frame structures -- often with inch-wide openings in the planks -- 
were merely covered with tar paper on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it would get down to 30 degrees below zero and we had no 
insulation," said Sakatani, rubbing his fingers down the peeling black tar 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 A family of three usually lived in a single unit, half the size of a typical 
living room and supplied with a single light bulb, steel cots and a coal stove. 
There was no running water, and bathroom facilities were outdoors and communal. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the barracks, the museum displays more than 700 donated artifacts 
and photos from families who were interned in the 10 relocation camps . 
</P>
<P>
 One photo is of a banner on a house: "Japs Keep Moving, This Is White Man's 
Neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of this exhibit is to help a community and country remember its 
history so that it never happens again," said museum curator Karen Ishizuka. 
"Throughout this experience, I felt strengthened and enriched." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mukai, whose father helped assemble the barracks: "My dad talked about 
his camp experience a lot. I would ask about it so I could tell other people. 
Now the discussion is open to the public."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: REDONDO BEACH; MOTHER, 
SON ARRESTED IN ARMORED CAR ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Redondo Beach police arrested a suspected mother-and-son armored car robbery 
team after the 30-year-old son allegedly grabbed a cash bag from a Brinks guard 
and sped away amid a blaze of gunfire in a getaway car driven by his 
49-year-old mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were identified as Luis Fernando Roca, 30, and Maria Aracely 
Riveria-Cordero, 49, both of La Puente.Redondo Beach Police Lt. Ken Keating 
said the two are possible suspects in other armored car robberies in the Los 
Angeles area. There also may be other arrests in the case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating said the incident began about 3 p.m. Wednesday at the Smith's Food 
King market at 4001 Marine Ave. when a man walked up behind an armored car 
guard as he was making a cash delivery to the store. The man grabbed the 
guard's gun and a bag containing an undetermined amount of cash, then jumped in 
the back seat of a getaway car. As the car pulled away, the robber fired four 
shots toward the Brinks truck with the guard's gun, police said, but no one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating said Agent Jim Bell of the Redondo Beach Police Department happened to 
be in the market parking lot on routine patrol when he heard gunshots and saw a 
man holding a gun in a car. Bell pursued the car, capturing the man after he 
bailed out of the car with the money bag and fled. The woman was captured in 
the car shortly after. The money and a gun were recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were being held in Redondo Beach jail in lieu of $50,000 bail.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; MOTHER CHARGED 
IN DEATH OF BABY THROWN TO DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-aged woman with two children was charged with murder Thursday in the 
death of her third child, a newborn boy who may have been dead when he was 
thrown into a yard occupied by two pit bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Araceli Banda Garcia, 19, is scheduled to be arraigned Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, arrested Tuesday and held on $1-million bail, is charged with single 
counts of murder and child endangerment in the death of her baby, whose body 
was found last Friday afternoon in the 500 block of West Orange Grove Avenue in 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Garcy Hearnsberger said an autopsy indicated the nine-pound 
boy suffered a crushing injury to his head and a puncture in the chest, which 
the coroner's office believes caused the death.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe Garcia gave birth to the baby Friday morning, killed him 
and threw the body over the back fence.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators initially believed that one or both of the pit bulls had mauled 
the baby, whose body was missing an arm and testicles. But the large dog was 
penned up and the other was a puppy.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLLYWOOD; SLUM CHARGES 
FILED AGAINST BUILDING'S NEW OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slum charges were filed Thursday against the owners of a Hollywood apartment 
building, which they received as a gift earlier this year from a convicted 
slumlord in violation of a judge's order.  
</P>
<P>
 Named in the 35-count criminal complaint filed in Los Angeles Municipal Court 
were Alejandro Camacho, 24, and his wife, Tina, 30.They do business as Wyatt 
Properties and live at the four-story apartment house at 2017 Argyle Ave., said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Bobb.  
</P>
<P>
 The Camachos were given the property by Mark Savoy, 32, of Sherman Oaks, who 
pleaded guilty last year to 10 Building and Safety Code violations for slum 
conditions at the 72-unit building, the prosecutor said.  
</P>
<P>
 Savoy was sentenced by Los Angeles Municipal Judge Linda Lefkowitz to 120 days 
in jail and 160 hours of community service in a hospital emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefkowitz also ordered him to pay $15,748 in fines and costs and to refrain 
from transferring ownership of the property until repairs had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 But Savoy, who had acquired the building in October, 1991, did not make the 
repairs and transferred ownership of the property as a gift to the Camachos on 
July 28 of this year, Bobb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefkowitz subsequently found Savoy in violation of his probation and sentenced 
him to another 10 days in jail, said Bobb, who heads the city attorney's 
Housing Enforcement Unit and coordinates the city Slum Housing Task Force.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
EXTENDS CURBSIDE QUAKE REMOVAL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has approved a six-month extension beyond Jan. 17 
for a free curbside earthquake debris removal program. 
</P>
<P>
 The council extended the deadline even though federal funding for the program 
will end on the first anniversary of the Northridge quake. Officials said many 
property owners may not finish repairs by then.  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the plan, public works officials will begin notifying owners to 
dispose on their own of any curbside debris not related to earthquake damage, 
such as tree trimmings and yard clippings. If owners do not comply, city 
workers will remove the yard waste and bill each owner about $500 to $700 plus 
administrative costs.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY; 10 
ARRESTED AT 3 HOUSES IN ASIAN SEX RING PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal and local authorities raided three suspected houses of prostitution in 
the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday, arresting three men and seven women alleged 
to have ties to an international Asian crime syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those arrested were Mainland Chinese nationals, although they included 
a Thai and a Malaysian, all of whom were in the country illegally, said Sgt. 
Tom Budds of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, who works the Asian 
Organized Crime Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects are believed to have links to the Fu Qing gang, long known for 
smuggling Chinese illegally to the United States, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The raid was staged by an inter-agency task force including representatives of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 
U.S. Customs and the county sheriff, who hope the arrests will lead them to 
gang kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men were charged with felony pandering and the seven women were 
charged with residing in a house of prostitution, a misdemeanor. It was unclear 
whether the women were being held against their will, but at least one woman 
told authorities she was too afraid to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our minds, it's a slavery operation," Budds said. 
</P>
<P>
 The houses, in Rosemead and Monterey Park, advertised through word of mouth 
and business cards, according to several clients who were briefly detained at 
the house by police. They told authorities they were prepared to pay $100 for 
sex.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ENCINO; WOMAN GETS 45 
DAYS IN JAIL IN HIT-AND-RUN ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Encino woman will spend 45 days in jail and 45 days on a Caltrans work crew 
for hitting a 9-year-old girl with her car and fleeing the scene, the city 
attorney's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mona Dowidar, 47, was also placed on three years of summary probation by Van 
Nuys Municipal Judge Michael Knight. 
</P>
<P>
 Dowidar was sentenced after a jury found her guilty of hit and run with injury 
after a four-day trial, Deputy City Atty. Elijah Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred the evening of July 29 as Dowidar was northbound on 
Yarmouth Avenue near Margate Street in Encino.  
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the victim stepped into the street in front of Dowidar's car, 
which struck the child, slightly injuring her. They said Dowidar continued on 
without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
 A Whittier man jumped into his car and followed Dowidar into a parking lot in 
the 17900 block of Ventura Boulevard, Richardson said. Dowidar was later 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was treated at a hospital for cuts to her leg and released.

 You may remember the big galoot -- all 6 feet and 10 pounds of him. He doesn't 
weigh much because he's made of a soft cloth fabric. But decked out in a suit

those who don't like to be seen driving alone. (We're sure Angelenos would 
never use him to qualify for diamond-lane status). 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Safe-T-Man -- who is manufactured in El Monte -- is now being 
advertised in a holiday catalogue called the Safety Zone at $99.95 for these 
models: "Light Skin/Blonde Hair," "Light Skin/Gray Hair" and "Dark Skin/Dark

 * Fake Closed-Circuit TV Camera: "Fools even the pros. . . . It replicates an 
expensive closed-circuit surveillance camera in every detail, from the LED 
light camera to the simulated coaxial cable and plate. . . . $99.95." 
</P>
<P>
 * Yard Gard: "Keep animals away from your yard. (It) emits and amplifies 
ultrasonic sounds that annoy and repel -- but do not harm -- dogs, cats, deer, 
raccoons, possums and other small animals, making them avoid your yard. Will 
not affect birds. . . . $99.95." We'd only buy it if it affected wild parrots.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GANG 
MEMBER SOUGHT IN KILLING OF CHEERLEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police were searching for a gang member suspected of killing a 
Dorsey High School cheerleader who may have inadvertently gotten mixed up in a 
robbery attempt.  
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said fingerprints and other evidence found at the crime scene on 
Oct. 28 helped them identify Carlton Maurice Gladden, 24, as a suspect in the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Anitra Jolie Watson, 17, was shot several times execution style inside a 
duplex near Haas Avenue and Century Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said Watson was killed in an area police have called a drug hot 
spot. She was there when a robbery attempt took place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may have been a drug rip-off or it may have been a straight robbery; we do 
not know," said Lt. Sergio Robleto.  
</P>
<P>
 "She was there at the location at a time when there was possibly a robbery 
going to take place, a robbery of the occupants of the location," Robleto said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow or other it appears somebody may have mistaken her for one of the 
assailants and then subsequently executed her."

JURY PICKED FOR HEIDI FLEISS' TRIAL ON PANDERING, DRUG COUNTS; COURT: OPENING 
ARGUMENTS ARE SET FOR MONDAY. ALLEGED 'MADAM TO THE STARS' FACES UP TO 12 YEARS 
IN PRISON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury of five women and seven men was seated Thursday in the trial of alleged 
Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss on charges of pandering and possession of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 One potential juror was excused by the defense after he stated that 
prostitution is forbidden in the Bible, but the prosecution had no objection to 
the seating of an alternate juror who said he thought prostitution should be 
legalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss faces up to 12 years in prison if convicted. Opening arguments in the 
Los Angeles Superior Court trial are scheduled for Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Marks, one of Fleiss' lawyers, said the possibility that his client was 
entrapped in an improper sting operation "is clearly going to be something 
discussed in the trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Touted as the "madam to the stars," the 28-year-old high school dropout was 
first arrested last year after she allegedly provided cocaine and four 
prostitutes to a "Japanese businessman" who turned out to be an undercover 
Beverly Hills police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last August, she and her 60-year-old father, pediatrician Paul Fleiss, 
were arrested on federal charges of tax evasion and money laundering -- for 
allegedly hiding hundreds of thousands of dollars from Heidi Fleiss' purported 
prostitution ring. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, she was arrested for a third time, for violating the terms of 
her $50,000 bail in the federal case by testing positive for drugs six times 
since the August arrest. The drugs involved were Valium and methamphetamines, 
according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark Holscher. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 26, she was transferred from the Downtown federal Metropolitan 
Detention Center to Impact House, a drug treatment and rehabilitation center in 
Pasadena, where she is a residential patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection in the trial before Judge Judith Champagne began last week. A 
15-page questionnaire was handed out to the 65 prospective jurors, and court 
was adjourned until Monday so lawyers could review their responses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although eclipsed by the O.J. Simpson trial, the Heidi Fleiss case -- which 
centers on charges that she ran a glamorous call girl service that catered to 
the rich and famous -- has generated considerable interest. 
</P>
<P>
 That interest has been heightened by speculation that Fleiss eventually may 
open her "black book," disclosing the names of clients, who are said to include 
entertainment industry executives and jet-set glitterati. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal trial is scheduled to start Jan 24.

STREET VENDORS MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD ESTABLISHING WORK ZONES; BUSINESS: GROUPS 
REPRESENTING THE MERCHANTS HAVE FILED DOCUMENTS IN LOS ANGELES THAT ARE THE 
FIRST STEP IN CREATING AREAS WHERE THEY CAN LEGALLY PEDDLE THEIR WARES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After nearly a year of red tape and internal strife, two groups of street 
vendors have taken the first step toward establishing city-sanctioned zones in 
which they can legally sell their wares in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 This week the Pico-Union-based Street Vendors' Assn. submitted a petition to 
the city requesting a district at Santa Monica Boulevard and Western Avenue in 
Hollywood, a longtime vending hub. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Street Vendors' Assn. of the San Fernando Valley completed its 
application for a vending zone along Van Nuys Boulevard in Pacoima. The vendors 
sell such things as fruit, tools, cassettes, greeting cards and toys from carts 
or tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the City Council passed an ordinance in January allowing vendor 
groups to organize districts, snags in implementing the new law and infighting 
in the city's largest and most powerful vendors' group caused months of delay. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition for the Pacoima vending district was originally submitted to the 
city's street vending administration office in July. However, city officials 
decided that the signatures of the required 20% of merchants and residents in 
the proposed zone would have to be verified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since this was the first district, no one knew what they were doing," city 
vending administrator Robert Valdez said. "We were feeling our way through this 
blindly." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the vendors group and the city had to go back into the 
field and verify at least 100 signatures, said Jorge Sanchez, coordinator of 
the Valley vendors. Verification was completed in early October. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that month, city officials met with the vendors to renegotiate the 
boundaries of the proposed district, trimming it to a 32-block stretch of Van 
Nuys Boulevard between Glenoaks Boulevard and the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The road toward establishing a vending district has been even rockier for the 
Pico-Union-based Street Vendors' Assn., which helped lead the fight to legalize 
street vending in the city. Known by its Spanish acronym, AVA (Asociacion de 
Vendedores Ambulantes) is Los Angeles' oldest organized vendors' group. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the group split into rival factions, with one side, based in Echo 
Park, embracing militant tactics such as protests in front of police stations 
over the alleged harassment of vendors. A Pico-Union contingent opposed to the 
protests -- mostly longtime members -- believed the demonstrations served only 
to alienate police and city officials with whom they had been attempting to 
ease relations since AVA was formed in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were only focusing on protesting against the police, while we were 
trying to work with them," said Guillermo Lopez, a vendor who sides with the 
old guard. "We kept telling them that what we should really be doing is working 
on getting the districts legalized, so that no one could bother us. But they 
wouldn't listen, so we stopped making progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Complicated by a dispute over how the association's money should be spent, the 
split prompted a legal battle, the freezing of $30,000 in assets and the delay 
of a petition for a vending zone in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Echo Park-based faction filed a lawsuit in August seeking use of the 
association's name and the frozen assets, arguing that because four of AVA's 
six board members joined their side, they should be considered the true Street 
Vendors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the majority of the last board of directors," said B. Kwaku Duren, 
an attorney representing the Echo Park group. "They have a right to the name 
and assets." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Pico-Union group, which turned in the petition for the Hollywood 
zone, is the one recognized by several community organizations dealing with 
vendors, including the Central American Resource Center and the Sidewalk 
Vending Coalition of Los Angeles, an umbrella group representing most the 
city's vendor groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But until a judge decides who the real AVA is, the organization's assets will 
remain with the Community Services Organization Credit Union, which froze AVA's 
funds when credit union employees realized two groups were claiming leadership, 
said Cruz Reynoso, the former state Supreme Court justice, who is acting as a 
legal representative of the credit union.

VENTURA PANEL WILL VOTE ON LIBRARY CLOSURE; FINANCES: COUNTY OFFICIAL ADVISES 
CONSOLIDATING WRIGHT FACILITY INTO FOSTER IF FUNDS AREN'T FOUND TO OPERATE IT 
FULL TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reflecting a continuing crisis in the county library system, the top librarian 
has recommended closing the only branch in the eastern half of Ventura if money 
cannot be raised to operate it full time. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Ventura Library Board is expected to vote next week on 
whether to recommend consolidation of the popular H. P. Wright Library near 
Ventura College with the city's main library downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixie Adeniran, director of the county Library Services Agency, told the 
library board Wednesday night that if Ventura will not provide financial 
support for its libraries, she thinks it should shut down Wright and move all 
its books to the E. P. Foster Library. 
</P>
<P>
 The board backed away from an immediate decision, but will debate the issue at 
a special 7:30 p.m. meeting at the Wright library Wednesday. The board's 
recommendation would be forwarded to the City Council for a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating the two libraries only 20 hours a week each -- and sharing 10 staff 
members between them -- "is just not tenable on a long-term basis," Adeniran 
said in an interview Thursday. "It's wearing our staff out, and it's a great 
turnoff to people who come to the library, find the doors closed and just sort 
of give up on the library." Some members of the council-appointed library board 
said they can tolerate the status quo no longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once people feel they are going to lose their library, they will do 
something," Keith Burns, a local writer, told his fellow board members.  
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the 97,000-volume Wright library at 57 Day Road is open Mondays 
from 2 to 8 p.m., Wednesdays from noon to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 1 to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The 133,000-volume Foster facility at 651 E. Main St. is open Tuesdays from 
noon to 8 p.m., Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 1 to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright is far more popular with readers, circulating nearly 225,000 books a 
year, while Foster checks out 107,000. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting this week, Ventura Mayor Tom Buford urged the library board 
to take a stand on closing the Wright branch and force the issue before the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The City Council) will take the heat -- that's fine, as long as you give us 
something to support you on," Buford told the seven-member board. "We will work 
with you to hold workshops, to get the word out and to give people a chance to 
participate." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's libraries are run by the county and financed by the county and 
state. But in the last few years, funds have been so meager that Ventura 
bibliophiles have gone begging to the city -- so far to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said they do not want to take on the county's burden, 
because that might encourage the county to cut back its support even further. 
Some other local cities have increased library hours by augmenting the county 
library budget. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, patrons at the Foster library downtown said the pinch is obvious 
to anyone trying to check out a book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very depressed about the whole situation," said Alyca Moraga, 33, who 
takes her 4-year-old daughter, Markie, to the library every Thursday. The 
Moragas used to go to Wright because it is in their east end neighborhood. But 
it is not open on Thursdays, the day that best fits into the family's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go through 10 books a week," Moraga said. "Bookstores are fine, but if 
that's all we had, we'd go broke." 
</P>
<P>
 Moraga said she would not mind if the two libraries were consolidated. But 
other patrons found the idea unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be opposed," said Rita Lofland, 64. "It would be hard on older people. 
People who live in the vicinity of H. P. Wright are going to have to truck on 
over (to Foster), and that's not right."  
</P>
<P>
 Lofland sighed. "I wish they'd cut from something else besides libraries." 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's library board meeting, participants expressed the same thought. 
Librarians, board members and the audience all beseeched Buford and visiting 
Councilmen Steve Bennett and Gregory L. Carson to dig into city pockets for 
library funds. But Buford told the board not to expect city money. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a crisis," he said. "This is the reality you will be facing for 
the foreseeable future. We're certainly going to try to support you, but it's 
not with additional monies." 
</P>
<P>
 The room was silent for a few moments. Then Adeniran, the head county 
librarian, broke the quiet by saying that in that case she would recommend 
closing Wright until more funds became available. 
</P>
<P>
 That way the consolidated main library would have a $1.45-million annual 
budget, enough to stay open 40 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Other City Council members took issue Thursday with Buford's pronouncement. 
Councilman Gary Tuttle said he would support giving city money to libraries. 
Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures said she, too, would consider the idea if she 
knew that the county would allow the city to spend its library money where it 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where Tom made that unilateral decision," Tuttle said. 
"Libraries are one of the most precious things citizens want from cities."

STORM DRENCHES COAST AREAS, DUMPS SNOW ON MOUNTAINS 
</P>

<P>
 A winter storm blew through Ventura County early Thursday, drenching coastal 
areas with more than an inch of rain and dumping the season's first significant 
snowfall on the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 National Weather Service officials issued a flood watch for Ventura County at 
4:30 a.m., but canceled it later in the morning. There was no flooding 
reported, said Hassan Kasraie, hydrology manager of the Ventura County Flood 
Control Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early in the season," Kasraie said. "It takes a while for the 
watershed to get saturated with rain." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, county fire officials urged residents to prepare for the rainy season 
by removing debris from drains and gutters. In addition, the Fire Department 
issued a list of local stores that stock sand and sandbags. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Department spokeswoman Sandi Wells said she hoped that Thursday's 
storm would serve as a warning that the rainy season had begun in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives people the time and impetus to prepare their property," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Servaes, state Department of Transportation maintenance manager for 
Ventura County and western Los Angeles County, said the storm created a few 
potholes and dislodged a few rocks that landed on state roads. But he said 
there were no major problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol reported a few rain-related accidents in Ventura 
County, none involving major injuries. On the freeways closer to Los Angeles, 
though, the rain brought with it more than 300 accidents, a 69% increase over a 
typical morning. Commuters added an average of 90 minutes to their trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Today for the holiday weekend, the CHP is bracing for traffic heading toward 
ski resorts in the San Bernardino Mountains, where six inches of powder was 
expected to accumulate by the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, Caltrans sent snowplows up California 33 on Thursday 
morning to keep the road open. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Vanni, a dispatcher at the county Sheriff's Department substation at 
Lockwood Valley, said six to eight inches of snow had fallen there by about 8 
a.m. The snow was melting quickly in the valley, Vanni said, but there were 
still about four inches at roadside in the middle of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The snowfall covered elevations from about 3,500 feet, just above Rose Valley, 
to Pine Mountain, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For David Dame, who lives near Pine Mountain, the snowstorm meant that he had 
to put chains on the tires of his four-wheel-drive vehicle before visiting a 
friend who lives deeper in Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most beautiful thing to wake up in the morning and see the snow," 
Dame said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanni said the storm came early in the year, adding that the ground in 
Lockwood Valley is usually not covered with snow before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm brought county rainfall totals to well above seasonal norms. But 
Kasraie said it is too early in the season to draw any conclusions about the 
possibility of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The one conclusion Kasraie did draw from Thursday's storm? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice because it keeps the grass green," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Showers could continue today, but forecasters do not predict any significant 
downpours this weekend. County Rainfall

MEMORIAL FOR 4 VICTIMS OF LAST YEAR'S SHOOTING SPREE PROPOSED; SUPERVISORS: 
COUNTY BOARD WILL CONSIDER PLANTING A ROSE GARDEN AT GOVERNMENT CENTER FOR 
THOSE SLAIN IN DEC. 2 RAMPAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With the first anniversary looming for Ventura County's bloodiest shooting 
spree, the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday will consider planting a memorial 
rose garden at the government center to commemorate the four murder victims of 
Alan Winterbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Maggie Kildee and Maria E. VanderKolk are proposing that two rows 
of roses be planted on a slope around the flagpole at the main entrance to the 
County Government Center in Ventura to remember those who died Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Winterbourne, a 33-year-old unemployed computer programmer, killed three 
people at the Oxnard Employment Development Department and an Oxnard police 
officer as Winterbourne made his way to another employment office in Ventura, 
where he was shot dead by police. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the rose garden, Kildee and VanderKolk will ask the board to 
approve moving a police officers memorial to a more visible location in front 
of the Hall of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors of the deadly Oxnard rampage said the rose garden would honor those 
killed and wounded as well as those who assisted the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously a lot of us don't want to remember, but it did happen," said Bobbie 
Espinoza, a jobs program supervisor who watched the rampage but was not 
injured. "So this is a very nice gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very sad, but this rose garden means that people will remember, and 
that's always good," she said. "You don't want to forget the people that were 
injured or died." 
</P>
<P>
 Kildee and VanderKolk envision two rows of about 10 rose plants, one row on 
each side of the government center's main flagpole. 
</P>
<P>
 One of two plaques on each side of the pole would serve as a remembrance to 
the four people killed that day, including Detective James O'Brien. The second 
plaque would honor the four people wounded and those who assisted the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our employees will feel added worth to themselves and the co-workers we 
lost," said Oxnard jobs office manager Avelina Villalobos. "Things will 
probably never be back to business as usual, but people are doing well." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Winterbourne stepped behind the counter at the Oxnard Employment 
Development Department office and methodically began shooting, a number of 
security measures have been implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid because we have the bullet-resistant glass, steel doors and 
the armed guard," said Espinoza, who returned to work days after the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm very much more aware of my surroundings now," she said. "It's changed 
me in that way. Even if I'm just going to the store, I'm on the lookout." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt said he likes the idea of honoring public 
servants outside the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oftentimes when things like this happen, we think about the peace officers 
because of the dangers they face every day," Hurtt said. "But this offer is a 
real recognition to those other public employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Miguel Colon, a board member of the Peace Officers Assn. of 
Ventura County, said his group wants to relocate an existing memorial to 
officers killed in the line of duty to a more visible spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The bronze plaque outside the main entrance to Ventura County Jail would be 
moved to an area between the law library and the front of the Hall of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody gets to see it unless you're coming into the Sheriff's Department or 
the jail," Colon said. Colon said his association is accepting donations to pay 
for the relocation and construction of another peace officers monument at the 
same location. 
</P>
<P>
 He said donations can be sent to the Peace Officers Assn. of Ventura County, 
Post Office Box 796, Fillmore, Calif., 93016.

CHINA HONORS LOCAL AIRMEN FOR RISKY WWII DUTY OVER HIMALAYAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carl Vice says he will never forget a flight he piloted out of Kunming, China, 
during the summer of 1943, when his plane's engines shut down at 18,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Having just dropped off a load of war materiel, Vice was on the return leg of 
a supply run over the towering Himalayas to his home base in India when he 
found himself in a thunderstorm so violent that his huge plane was tossed about 
like a toy. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point, both of my engines just quit," said Vice, a Camarillo resident 
who was 23 at the time. "Moments later, a powerful updraft blew us up and out 
of the storm and into clear air at 23,000 feet. Luckily for us, we were then 
able to restart the engines and continue on." 
</P>
<P>
 Such experiences were not uncommon for pilots like Vice and thousands of 
others who flew in the China-Burma-India theater -- one of the lesser-known 
terrains of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, about 50 years after the war, the Chinese government is paying tribute to 
the American veterans for their efforts in defending the nation from the 
Japanese army's onslaught. The aging pilots recently were given a pair of 
official Chinese air force wings as a token of that government's gratitude for 
their service. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-year-old Vice, one of a handful of Ventura County-based residents who 
have received a pair of the wings, said he was touched by the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of my service and I think the wings are great," Vice said. "But I 
think it's important for everyone to take the time to remember those pilots who 
never made it back." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the airlift began in 1942, CBI routes from the upper Assam region 
of India to western China became known as the Aluminum Path because of the 
wreckage of crashed C-46 Commandos, C-47 Skytrains and B-24 Liberator bombers 
and tankers -- all of which were victimized by bad weather, the towering peaks 
or attacks by Japanese Zero fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Official estimates say that during the three years of cargo flight operations 
over The Hump -- as the pilots called the Himalayas -- at least one plane and 
its crew were lost each day. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the losses were heavy, the quantity of materiel, troops, fuel and 
food shipped into China was staggering. Records kept by the Popular Bluff, 
Mo.-based China-Burma-India Hump Pilots Assn. indicate that during July, 1945, 
more than 78,000 tons of supplies were flown into the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough flying. It really was," said Jerry Pfister, 72, of Ventura. "I 
know in my mind what we did was important. But I think other areas of the war 
captured people's attention stateside. Ours admittedly wasn't the most 
glamorous operation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pfister, who received his Chinese wings in September, flew Commandos and 
Liberators while assigned to the theater. He said he remembers icicles forming 
on his oxygen mask while he nearly froze in the cramped cockpits, despite 
layers of clothing and thick, sheepskin-lined boots and flight jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 20,000 feet, it can get cold as heck," Pfister said. "I remember that it 
was cold enough that you didn't want to ever take a glove off and touch 
something with your bare hand. And yet when we would be on the ground in India 
or China, it often would be sweltering." 
</P>
<P>
 William Hartill, 70, a member of the Camarillo-based Confederate Air Force, 
said he learned firsthand how dangerous the airlift could be when he and his 
crew mates had to bail out of their Commando after straying off course over the 
East China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartill, who now lives in Palmdale and was a flight engineer on the plane, 
remembered anxious moments after he pulled on the rip cord of his parachute and 
nothing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to try one more time. I yanked hard and fortunately my chute 
deployed," Hartill said. "I learned later that our plane actually made it back 
to land and took the top off an uninhabited building." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hump Pilots Assn. helped coordinate the Chinese government's efforts in 
giving the wings to the pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 Peyton Walmsley, the group's president, said that several thousand former CBI 
pilots -- including fighter and bomber pilots -- have received the Chinese air 
force's wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a great shot in the arm for our members," Walmsley said. "And it's 
had the impact of shedding some light on a part of history that not too many 
people remember or know about."

 Fearful that a disaster could strand thousands of residents without water, 
Ventura County analysts Thursday outlined several construction projects needed 
to shore up shaky reservoirs in Simi Valley, Fillmore and Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 The water projects top a county wish list of a dozen measures needed to repair 
vital infrastructure damaged during the January Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Other key needs include: constructing a Tapo Street bridge to provide a backup 
getaway route for employees in Simi Valley's Brandeis-Bardin industrial park, 
improving traffic flow into the North Fillmore Industrial Park, and repairing 
damaged curbs, gutters and sidewalks in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The total price tag for all improvements would top $13.5 million -- a whopping 
sum that neither Simi Valley nor Fillmore could come up with, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (city's) dollars don't go far enough," said Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy 
Mikels, who will soon represent her city on the Board of Supervisors. "For a 
lot of these projects, there are no quick fixes. They take a lot of money."  
</P>
<P>
 To help the battered cities pay for the projects, Ventura County supervisors 
Tuesday will consider applying for a $5-million federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're certainly very important needs," said Supervisor Maggie Kildee, who 
represents Fillmore and Piru. "It'll be wonderful if we're able to (get the 
grant)." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ann Krause, senior county administrative analyst, said she believes there 
is a "very high probability" the federal Economic Development Administration 
will meet the county's request within two months. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county does pull in a $5-million grant, officials could use some of the 
money to help cities issue municipal bonds -- thereby doubling the money 
available for the improvements, Krause said. "There may be ways to leverage the 
money so all the projects can be done," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 To secure the federal grant, Fillmore and Simi Valley must put up 10% of the 
projects' costs. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they would very likely be able to find that money in 
reserve accounts stocked with developers' fees or redevelopment funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a whole lot of different checkbooks we've been pulling money out of 
(for quake repairs)," Fillmore Councilman Roger Campbell said. "If we can get a 
federal grant to help us, that would be great. It sounds incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Economic Development Agency will dole out $50 million to 
quake-shaken Southern California over the next few months, Krause said. Ventura 
County's application is due Nov. 30, and officials expect a verdict by Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the projects on the list are designed to add jobs or stimulate 
development as well as repair earthquake damage. Under federal guidelines, any 
infrastructure improvement that helps lift a hard-hit city from economic 
doldrums is eligible for the grant, Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are all extremely important projects to us," Fillmore Councilman Mike 
McMahon said. "Everything on that list is something we've been trying to find 
the money for. If the county can help us out, that's just great."  
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the supervisors at Tuesday's meeting, Ventura County's grant 
application will include the following projects: 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley  
</P>
<P>
 * Upgrading pipes in a major water-storage tank to hold up better during 
quakes. Cost, $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Providing emergency backup power at the sewage-treatment plant. Cost, $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Restoring damaged pavement, curbs, sidewalks and driveways throughout the 
city. Cost, $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Constructing a Tapo Street bridge to provide a backup route to the 
Brandeis-Bardin industrial area. Cost, $930,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Installing an ultraviolet disinfection system at the water quality control 
plant to eliminate the use of hazardous chlorine gas, which could leak during 
an earthquake. Cost, $2.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore  
</P>
<P>
 * Replacing two wrecked reservoirs. The city has lost more than one-quarter of 
its water-storage capacity, and another 25% is at risk because of a damaged 
roof. Cost, $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Installing emergency generators to increase the city's water-pumping 
capacity. Cost, $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Relocating the William L. Morris auto dealership from a quake-damaged 
building to a new parcel on California 126 off C Street. The grant will pay for 
public improvements on the dealership's new site. Cost, $320,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Improving the intersection of A Street and California 126 to provide better 
access into the North Fillmore Industrial Park. Cost, $820,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preparing downtown for a proposed redevelopment that would bring in tourist 
attractions and office space. Cost, $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Constructing a public parking lot to serve the redeveloped downtown. Cost, 
$350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Piru  
</P>
<P>
 * Replacing a cracked and leaking reservoir that serves the unincorporated 
neighborhood. Cost, $475,000.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; HUSBAND GUILTY IN WOMAN'S MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard man charged with fatally shooting his wife at a birthday party was 
found guilty Thursday of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Santos Castaneda, 26, will be eligible for a sentence of 50 years to life 
in prison under the three-strikes law, Deputy Dist. Atty.Patricia M. Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has two robbery convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda shot his wife, Mina, through the head when he returned to a Santa 
Paula birthday party after helping Anthony Castillo rob an Oxnard motel clerk, 
according to trial testimony. Mina Castaneda, 25, was angry with the defendant 
because he had left the party without explanation, and she was wielding a 
baseball bat when he returned, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor argued during the Superior Court trial that Castaneda killed 
his wife because she humiliated him in front of Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo, who testified against Castaneda in exchange for a reduced sentence 
on the robbery charge, said he was walking toward the house when he heard the 
gun go off and saw Mina Castaneda fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda claimed during the trial that Castillo was the killer. The jury 
deliberated three hours before finding Castaneda guilty of the April 2 murder, 
as well as being a felon in possession of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scheduled for sentencing Dec. 13, Murphy said. Under the three-strikes 
law, Castaneda can receive sentences of 25 years to life on each of the murder 
and gun possession counts, the prosecutor said. BARBARA MURPHY

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-year-old Oxnard gang member pleaded guilty Thursday to second-degree 
murder in connection with a fatal Ventura motel shooting last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Bolo became the third defendant convicted in the case when he entered 
his plea before Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath, who must hand down a 
sentence of 16 years to life in prison under state law.Sentencing is set Dec. 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Martinez, 21, of Whittier was gunned down Dec. 18 on the second-floor 
balcony of the Motel 6 on Johnson Road. Prosecutors charged Bolo; his brother, 
Willard, 23, and Steve Hidalgo, 20, with murder. All were either members or 
associates of the same Oxnard gang, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a sentence of 18 
years to life. Naomi Honohan, a 20-year-old former Channel Islands High School 
cheerleader and honor student, received two years in prison for accessory to 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Martinez was shot after getting into an argument with 
Honohan, Shaun Bolo's girlfriend, who was attending a party in a room at the 
motel. Martinez was attending a separate party there. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles L. Cassy, Shaun Bolo's lawyer, said his client pleaded guilty to being 
armed during the murder but not to actually firing a shot at Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, he was an aider and abettor," Cassy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew J. Hardy said Shaun Bolo drove the vehicle from 
which the fatal shots were fired. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DRUG TESTING FOR SPORTS TEAMS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that they want to motivate student athletes to abstain from drug use, 
the Ventura Unified School District has approved a voluntary drug testing 
program for sports teams at Ventura and Buena high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 5 to 0 Tuesday to launch the program immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura High Principal Hank Robertson told the board that the voluntary, 
random drug testing is intended to steer athletes away from using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see it as an additional way for kids to say 'no,' " Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, officials at Buena and Ventura high schools will ask 
athletes who want to volunteer for drug testing to sign up for the program and 
get written consent from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena High Principal Jaime Castellanos said the schools may also ask students 
who decline to participate to present a written statement from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 With the cooperation of a local drug rehabilitation program, each school will 
test 50 athletes per school year. 
</P>
<P>
 A school nurse or other school official assigned to run the program will give 
numbers to participating students and put the numbers in a jar. Each week, the 
nurse will pull numbers from the jar and call those students in for urine 
tests. But only the drug rehabilitation program officials running the tests 
will know the results. 
</P>
<P>
 If any test results show drug use, drug treatment counselors will call 
parents, not coaches or other school officials, Castellanos said. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; TRIBAL YOUTHS ATTEND COLLEGE WORKSHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the sun broke through rain clouds Thursday morning, about 70 Ventura County 
high school students gathered on a damp lawn at Ventura College and joined 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 While three men inside the circle beat a table-sized drum, another walked 
around fanning pungent smoke from a clump of burning sage into students' faces. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Native American descent, the teen-agers had come to the college to meet 
admissions counselors from universities and to learn about financial aid 
available to youths of their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no better way to approach such serious matters, the students said 
later, than a traditional Native American ceremony such as the ritual with 
burning sage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made you get into the mood and the spirit," Ventura High School student 
Joe Quiroga said. "It made you feel like you're not intimidated by everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one goal of the Ventura County Indian Education Consortium that 
sponsors the annual college and career workshop is to bolster the youths' 
self-confidence and pride in their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by a $103,000 annual federal grant, the consortium serves about 800 
schoolchildren from Fillmore, Ojai, Oxnard, Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Program staff members and volunteers meet with students periodically for 
mini-lessons on Native American history and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 And once a year, the consortium sponsors the college and career workshop for 
older students. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Ventura College, representatives from technical and business schools, 
Oxnard College, UC Santa Barbara and a Native American-run university in Kansas 
attended the workshop Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the usual admissions information, the college representatives 
said they had some messages tailored for students of Native American descent. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Santa Barbara counselor Laureen Lewis said she tells teen-agers how her 
office serves as an extended family for Native American students, putting them 
in touch with other youths of their heritage and by helping them register with 
their family's tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura College counselor David Robles agreed that students need such support, 
especially when they are new to college. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be a support system is the most important thing," Robles said. "To let 
them know they're welcome here." MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; TRIAL SET IN STABBING OF VETERINARIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Dec. 19 trial date was set Thursday for a Ventura woman accused of 
attempting to kill her ex-fiance by stabbing him 22 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanette Smith, 32, pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted murder at her 
Superior Court arraignment, and to charges that she inflicted great bodily 
injury on Ventura veterinarian Jeffrey K. Saur and battered the motorist who 
stopped the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 She remains in custody with bail set at $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At a preliminary hearing last month, Saur testified that Smith began stabbing 
him after he got out of his car when she suddenly kissed him and blocked his 
view of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 After stabbing Saur once, Smith cut herself and then resumed her attack on the 
41-year-old veterinarian, stabbing him 21 more times before a passing motorist 
pulled over and stopped the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 At the preliminary hearing, Smith's attorney argued unsuccessfully to have the 
attempted-murder charge reduced to assault with a deadly weapon. Deputy Public 
Defender Donna Forry said Smith was suicidal at the time of the attack and was 
trying to win Saur back, not kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 An allegation that the attempted murder was premeditated was dismissed at the 
preliminary hearing, and prosecutors chose not to refile it when the case went 
to Superior Court. BARBARA MURPHY

<P>
 A 52-year-old Fillmore man was arrested Thursday on suspicion of sexually 
molesting a girl 16 years ago when she was 8, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Ronnie Slay was taken into custody by Ventura County sheriff's deputies 
at his home, Sgt. John Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald said the investigation was sparked by the accusations of the 
24-year-old woman, who alleged that she and others were sexually molested by 
Slay in 1978 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Slay was booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of 10 counts of lewd and 
lascivious acts against minors, jail officials said. He was being held late 
Thursday in lieu of $20,000 bail. J. E. MITCHELL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert L. Quist, president and chief executive officer of Los Robles Regional 
Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, announced Thursday that he would step down 
from his post. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Donahue, a hospital spokeswoman, said Quist made the announcement during 
a brief staff meeting Thursday morning.She said Quist offered no explanation 
why he was leaving after 13 years. Quist said his resignation will be effective 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Quist could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Frank Weil, chairman of the hospital's board of trustees, said he believed 
that Quist's decision to resign was prompted by the hospital's corporate 
parent, Columbia HCA Inc. of Nashville, Tenn. Officials at Columbia were not 
available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have a clue this was happening," Weil said. "We were completely out 
of the loop on this one. It was a corporate decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Weil said Quist deserved credit for the hospital's continued profitability, 
and its expansion of programs and facilities. He said Quist was the driving 
force behind efforts to renovate the medical center's obstetrics ward, 
construction of a new neonatal intensive care ward, a soon-to-be-opened women's 
health center and an additional cardiac surgical unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is quite a shock to us," Weil said. "We are going to miss Bob a great 
deal." J. E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SUPERVISORS OK FUNDS FOR HOMELESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County will spend $22,000 to fund a portion of an emergency shelter 
for the homeless that would be operated at the Oxnard National Guard Armory, 
the Board of Supervisors has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, which was approved unanimously Tuesday, the American Red 
Cross will use the money to pay part of the $90,000 cost of operating the 
wintertime shelter between Dec. 15 and March 14, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County chapter of the American Red Cross has operated the facility 
since 1987, providing beds and hot meals to as many as 120 people each night. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money comes from a federal grant awarded to the Red Cross, but the 
cities of Ventura and Oxnard also chipped in to keep the armory open this 
winter season. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate the shelter will provide the homeless with as many as 
10,000 nights of service this year, at a cost of about $9 each. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY GIVES NOTICE OF DEFAULT TO BUILDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The contracting firm hired to build a new medical examiner's facility at the 
Ventura County Medical Center has been sent a notice of default by county 
supervisors, who are concerned that workers have not shown up at the 
construction site in weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The notice was sent to New York Construction Inc. of Tarzana, which was 
awarded the $1.4-million contract to build the center earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than just being behind schedule," Public Works Director Arthur E. 
Goulet said. "They have not been on the job site in quite some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the notice of default approved by supervisors Tuesday complains 
that the company has failed to meet its obligation to submit a completion 
schedule, drawings and a written program detailing other aspects of the 
project, Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our theory is that they're undercapitalized," he said. "They haven't been 
paying their bills to their subcontractors." 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the agreement, the American Claims Co. is liable for any losses 
the county incurs as a result of New York Construction's failure to complete 
the work, Goulet said. No one at New York Construction Inc. was available for 
comment late Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Both companies have five days to respond to the board's action, Goulet added. 
If New York Construction defaults on the agreement, the board would seek a new 
contractor to finish the project, a process that could delay construction for 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members unanimously approved the request to send the notice of default. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though this is a delay, I want to make sure we have the best building 
possible" when it is completed, Supervisor Susan K. Lacey said. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CHILD SUPPORT SETS COLLECTION RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recent sting operations and increased staffing helped the Ventura County 
district attorney's office set a one-day record for child support collections 
in the county, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 31, the district attorney's Child Support Division collected $254,519 
in child support payments -- besting by about $20,000 an earlier record set 
Nov. 1, 1993, Deputy Dist. Atty.Stan Trom said. The office collected about $28 
million in support payments in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited that we have been able to make strides in this area," Trom 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Trom said recent collection efforts placed Ventura County first among medium 
and large counties in the state and seventh in California overall. The 
rankings, which were publicly released Nov. 1, were compiled by the state 
legislative analyst's office in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with recent gains in collections, Trom said an estimated $100 million 
in back child support payments remains on the books in the county. J.E.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LAWSUIT TARGETS WATER-STORAGE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $20-million plan to store Ventura County water underground has been 
challenged in a lawsuit, filed Thursday, that contends the project has 
proceeded without the proper environmental review or adequate notice to an 
affected landowner. 
</P>
<P>
 In the complaint filed in Ventura County Superior Court, Joseph Viramontez of 
Ventura alleges that the Calleguas Municipal Water District went ahead with 
plans to condemn two acres of his land near Moorpark without informing him in a 
timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were finally told, we noticed that there were several other sites 
near the area that would serve them just as well and were vacant," he said. 
"But they said they had already started the process and didn't want to start 
over again with somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Viramontez's complaint also contends the large water project should receive 
more thorough environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas, which supplies water for 75% of the county's residents, plans to 
use the site for four pumps that would send water into the North Las Posas 
Basin. Eventually, as much as 300,000 acre-feet of water could be stored in the 
underground aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 The water stored in the aquifer would not only help met the county's growing 
water needs, district officials said, but also provide a backup supply during 
emergencies such as the devastating Northridge earthquake when the pipeline 
supplying water to the district was badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of our long-term plan to drought-proof the county," said Don 
Kendall, the Calleguas general manager. But plans to begin the construction in 
January could be stalled if the district is forced to do a time-consuming and 
expensive environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 Viramontez's attorney, Glen Reiser, said Calleguas must do the work to comply 
with the California Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall said the district has already conducted the necessary environmental 
studies. He said plans had to go through a series of reviews by various county 
agencies before it was determined that it did not require a full environmental 
review. SCOTT HADLY

REAGAN STILL ACTIVE, WIFE SAYS DURING BOOK SIGNING; PUBLISHING: ADMIRERS FLOCK 
TO REAGAN LIBRARY TO GREET THE FORMER FIRST LADY, WHO AUTOGRAPHED COPIES OF HER 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY, 'MY TURN.' 
</P>

<P>
 Former President Ronald Reagan has been doing "just fine," riding horses and 
chopping wood on his Santa Barbara County ranch since telling the American 
public last weekend that he has Alzheimer's disease, his wife said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope coming out like that will help people," Nancy Reagan said of the 
two-page handwritten letter her husband released last weekend. "His letter said 
it all." 
</P>
<P>
 A crush of well-wishers bearing cards, prayers and warm words for the former 
President greeted Mrs. Reagan on Thursday as she signed copies of her 
autobiography at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Giddy in her presence, they edged up to where she sat, whispered their best 
wishes and handed over copies of "My Turn." 
</P>
<P>
 As she etched her name into the books in a neat, careful hand, some visitors 
assured her gently, "Your husband's in our prayers," then sidled away with 
flustered grins. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Reagan thanked them, quietly, and smiled back. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, it was a momentous experience -- meeting this Republican icon 
face-to-face two days after her party seized control of Congress for the first 
time in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was also a chance to wish the Reagans well, to deliver cards through 
her to him and -- for at least one visitor -- to offer the former President 
pamphlets on Alzheimer's disease. About 100,000 people die of the mind-damaging 
illness every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Reagan told a reporter she is "very pleased" with the power shift in 
Congress. "But," she said bluntly, "my thoughts are with my husband right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Then she turned back to her task, signing books, waving to schoolchildren, 
thanking her fans and smiling into the staccato blaze of a hundred snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clutching a signed, red-bound copy of "My Turn," Rose M. Sternad waited in the 
cash-register line with her son, basking in the afterglow of a few seconds with 
Mrs. Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we've dreamed of for a long time, meeting her," said Sternad, 
56, a retired secretary from La Puente. "It's so beautiful, and for me it was 
just the cherry on top of everything that's happened since the election." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting in line to pay $35 apiece for their books, some relived their brief 
words with the former First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her I was praying for her husband, and she said, 'I appreciate your 
prayers,' " recalled Dolores Hale, a 57-year-old Simi Valley homemaker. "It was 
real sweet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Reagan rebuffed one man, signing his copy of her book but spurning a 
stack of photos and matted prints of her and the former President that he 
offered in a trembling hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said 'no,' " groused the man, an autograph collector who would not give 
his name as he left the gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, she smiled at their crying infants and fidgety children, quietly 
shared a word or two and signed stacks of books -- more than 600 copies in all. 
</P>
<P>
 Darin Plotnick, 32, an insurance worker and self-described Democrat from 
Sherman Oaks, said he came "because of who she is, rather than what she is." 
</P>
<P>
 "She came through all the negative press and the opinions that were going on 
for a while there," Plotnick said. "She came through it and faced it all."

PARENTS GET PANEL TO KILL SEX EDUCATION PROPOSAL; MOORPARK: THE GROUP PERSUADES 
A DISTRICT COMMITTEE TO DROP CONSIDERATION OF PROGRAM TO TEACH HIGH SCHOOL 
STUDENTS ABOUT CONDOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fearful that teaching Moorpark High School students about condoms would 
promote promiscuity, a group of angry parents successfully lobbied a school 
district committee Thursday to kill the proposed sex education program. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Taylor, a parent and frequent critic of the district, organized a small 
but vocal group of parents to attend a meeting of the district's Growth and 
Development Committee, which oversees health and sex education curricula in the 
Moorpark Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like fighting fire with a blast of oxygen," said Taylor, who is also a 
member of the committee. "This tells students that it's OK to engage in sexual 
activity. It encourages and promotes sex." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue surfaced after Moorpark High School health teacher Rich Uphoff 
proposed that the committee consider adopting a 12-step instruction program 
that has been taught at Channel Islands High School in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a recommendation or a proposal," he told the committee Thursday. 
"I'm just trying to get some direction to see if you feel this would be 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, which includes teachers, school administrators and a school 
board member, was formed several years ago to develop the district's 
abstinence-based sex education curriculum. While the program allows for 
discussion of contraceptives such as condoms, it has never included details on 
how to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abstinence is still the No. 1 point we make," Uphoff said. "We make the point 
that the only way to avoid pregnancy or HIV is abstinence, but we can't be like 
ostriches. Eighty-five percent of high school seniors engage in or have engaged 
in sexual activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Uphoff said the method used in the Channel Islands High class includes a group 
activity with both male and female students that goes over the steps on the 
proper use of a condom. 
</P>
<P>
 But of about 10 parents at Thursday's meeting, none spoke in favor of the 
curriculum. Several condemned the district's sex education program altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more it is discussed the less embarrassed kids are about sex," said Kandy 
Zierenberg who took her two daughters out of Moorpark High School in part 
because of the sex education program. "I think embarrassment solves a lot of 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Patty Daniels, who came to the meeting with her husband, agreed. She said the 
more that students were exposed to sex education courses the more they would 
have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee member Lorraine Feuerstein was the only one at the meeting to speak 
in favor of teaching students how to use condoms. Feuerstein's motion to 
approve the curriculum, however, failed for lack of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ignorance is what we are trying to avoid here," she said. "Frank speech is 
essential to prevent disease and pregnancy. I don't think anyone is comfortable 
talking about this, but I'd much rather demonstrate the proper use of a condom 
than read about someone killing their kids."

ELECTIONS / LEGISLATIVE SEATS; NEW CLOUT MAY AID GALLEGLY ON IMMIGRATION; 
BECAUSE OF A PRODUCTION ERROR, A PORTION OF THIS STORY WAS MISSING IN SOME 
EDITIONS OF THE TIMES ON THURSDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 After years of publicly condemning the unchecked tide of illegal immigrants, 
Rep. Elton Gallegly is poised to become a congressional leader in the campaign 
to rewrite the nation's immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Congress comes under Republican control next year, Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley) said he may have the seniority to become the next chairman of the House 
Judiciary subcommittee on international law, immigration and refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, that subcommittee has bottled up his bills to create a 
tamper-resistant green card, end automatic citizenship to illegal immigrants' 
children born in this country and other tough measures to curb illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing is right," said Gallegly, who easily won a fifth term in office 
Tuesday. "If nothing else comes out of Proposition 187, there should be a 
strong message to Washington that Californians want us to deal with this 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly is not the only local lawmaker elected Tuesday who will undergo a 
dramatic change in stature and clout in Sacramento or Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), who apparently was reelected by 
a slender margin to represent the Conejo Valley, will enter his 10th term 
stripped of his chairmanship of a powerful House Rules subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he has no idea what to expect after spending 18 years with the 
ruling party in the House of Representatives and the preceding 14 years as part 
of the Democratic majority in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have to see how our Republican colleagues in the House deal 
with us," Beilenson said. "I'm looking forward to helping get things done, if 
I'm allowed to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he will continue to try to line up federal dollars to purchase 
more parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains. Also, he said he was enthusiastic 
about working with Gallegly, who has become a close friend, on creating a 
tamper-proof green card and other immigration-reform laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson held a 3,201-vote lead over Republican challenger Rich Sybert, who 
received overwhelming support among Ventura County voters in a district that 
reaches deep into the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert has not conceded the race, hoping that about 19,000 absentee ballots 
yet to be counted will turn the race around. Among the absentee ballots already 
counted, Sybert won by a 5% margin, far short of the advantage he would need in 
the remaining ballots to change the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state Assembly next year, Ventura County will be represented by three 
Republicans who joined in the GOP tidal wave that may yet take control of the 
Assembly from Democratic Speaker Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman-elect Brooks Firestone, a Santa Barbara vintner, handily defeated 
Democrat Mindy Lorenz to claim the seat being vacated by Assemblyman Jack 
O'Connell (D-Carpinteria). 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone flew to Sacramento on Wednesday to meet with Assembly GOP leader Jim 
Brulte and was unavailable for comment. Firestone will represent the 35th 
Assembly District that covers Ventura, Santa Paula, the Ojai Valley and much of 
Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills), who easily won reelection over a 
UCLA student, said she hopes to become the chairwoman of the Assembly Committee 
on Public Safety, should the Assembly fall into Republican hands.  
</P>
<P>
 Boland, now the top Republican on the committee, has spent much of her time in 
Sacramento pushing to toughen sentencing laws for sex offenders and other 
law-and-order measures. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brulte appoints her chairwoman, Boland said she will make even greater 
strides to crack down on criminals, such as ending conjugal visits in prison 
for some offenders. Boland's 38th Assembly District covers Simi Valley, 
Fillmore and portions of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) easily fought off a challenge from 
Democrat Dorothy Maron, his old nemesis from his days on the Oxnard City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although he only won a second term, Takasugi hopes to be considered for a 
chairmanship of some committee, if Republicans take control. "I'll be 
considered a veteran," Takasugi said. "We are being primed for some leadership 
roles." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hopes to make additional progress in reforming worker's 
compensation laws and toughening penalties for violent crime, and bringing back 
a new version of the controversial CLAS tests that would be acceptable to 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell, who defeated Republican Steve MacElvaine, said he is excited about 
replacing Gary K. Hart as a state senator. He said he plans to use his position 
to make sure Ventura County becomes the home of a four-year state university. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now with Gary retiring, I'm going to carry the ball," O'Connell said. "It's 
going to be a major priority."

Q & A; SLUGGISH INVITRO'S NEW CHIEF GETS WORD OUT ON HIS GOALS; BIOTECHNOLOGY: 
THE IRVINE FIRM HAS BEEN LOSING MONEY SINCE IT WENT PUBLIC IN 1991. RICHARD 
ULMER SAYS A MARKETING EFFORT INVOLVING CUSTOMER CONTACT IS ESSENTIAL TO TURN 
THINGS AROUND.

<P>
 InVitro International has won high praise from animal-rights activists for its 
products, which it says are a low-cost substitute for testing corrosive 
substances on living tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Irvine biotechnology company, which went public in 1991, has yet to 
succeed at marketing its Corrositex and other products, and it has yet to post 
a profit.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the company announced the appointment of Richard Ulmer, a 25-year 
veteran of the pharmaceutical maker Allergan Inc., as its president and chief 
executive officer. He fills a position vacated in August, when President Bill 
Fisher left the company to pursue other business interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say that the new job will be a difficult test of management and 
marketing skills for Ulmer, who worked in various marketing capacities for 10 
years before taking an executive position in Allergan's domestic sales 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 InVitro's executives "need to successfully launch a major marketing effort, 
and if they don't they will have more problems," said David Anast, publisher of 
Costa Mesa-based Biomedical Market Newsletter Inc. In a telephone interview 
Thursday, Ulmer discussed the challenges he faces and his plans for the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Despite past marketing efforts by InVitro, its products have not 
been selling. Why is that? How do you intend to turn that around? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I plan on having a tremendous customer orientation. We have superior 
technology, and there are not enough people who recognize it. InVitro pretty 
much had an "if we build it, they will come" mentality that does not work. They 
had not gone out and talked to enough customers in the earlier stages. 
</P>
<P>
 At Allergan, I took a job with an ailing surgical products division and helped 
them increase their volume. The way we did that was to go out and talk to 
customers. I went to surgery with doctors and talked to them about their 
problems with the lenses we made, for example. I talked to patients about how 
they had used the lenses. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of potential is realized when you figure out how to fit your 
products into the world. It has not been done at InVitro. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When the Department of Transportation approved the use of Corrositex to 
test hazardous materials, a lot of analysts expected the revenue to start 
rolling in. But since that time, sales have not changed much. The company has 
suggested that the government should get serious about enforcing regulations on 
the transportation of hazardous materials. Is there any reason to believe the 
enforcement will be more strict in the future? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Corrositex did not take off like a rocket as was expected. But just saying 
it got this approval does not mean anything without selling and marketing. It 
is a tool for sales and marketing. It does not mean companies will do the 
testing or use our product. 
</P>
<P>
 And I don't think we can look for government to bulk up and enforce the 
regulations. But there are companies that will want to make the transportation 
of hazardous materials safer. Businesses with a conscience will want to do 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the market potential of the products? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It is elephant-sized. Analysts have said that it is in the hundreds of 
millions to billions, but I can't project what we expect this to represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: InVitro's stock was once a high-flier on the Nasdaq market because of the 
expected revenue. It traded as high as $15 a share. But it has been in a steady 
slide, and it recently hit a 52-week low of $1.38. Do you have a plan to bring 
value back to the stock? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The idea is to build shareholder value by building InVitro into a 
profitable company. Shareholder value needs to be at the forefront of your 
strategy. What I would say to every shareholder is, if you win over customers 
and they stay with you, you have provided value for them. And shareholder value 
will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't need to go to Wall Street first. You listen to customers, have good 
technology and employees, and all those things are going to come together to 
create value for our shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who do you think are the biggest potential customers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is no doubt that the pharmaceutical, skin-care "cosmo-ceutical" 
industries are not using our products enough in testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, despite the fact the Department of Transportation tested and accepted 
Corrositex for the transportation of hazardous materials, it is not being used 
enough. We need to make waste haulers, for example, aware of this.  
</P>
<P>
 We also see tremendous potential in the area of workplace safety and can 
approach a number of employers about that. I was shocked to find out that 30% 
of all workers' comp claims have to do with skin irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: At one point, $5.2 million was raised by InVitro from the sale of warrants 
and was supposed to be tagged for acquisitions and joint ventures. What 
happened to those plans? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I had a lot of success with Allergan establishing joint ventures. I think 
there is plenty of room for us to talk with people in partnering in the world 
of the '90s. So that strategy is much more likely than an acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Having worked at a large, profitable company like Allergan, why do you want 
to head up a small company that nearly went bankrupt two years ago and still is 
not reporting profits? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I never had as much fun at Allergan as when it was growing like the 
proverbial weed. Allergan grew from $3 million (in annual revenue) to $900 
million over the time I was there, and it was a wonderful 25-year ride. 
</P>
<P>
 But your focus changes when you get big. You don't spend a lot of time with 
the customers . . .  
</P>
<P>
 At small to medium-size companies, it is a different environment. There is a 
fire in people's hearts for making things happen. But when you get to be big, 
it is hard to keep that fire alive. InVitro's New Leader

SEARS GETS BACK TO BASICS; ALLSTATE INSURANCE TO BE SPUN OFF AS RETAILING GIANT 
RETURNS TO ITS ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sears, Roebuck & Co. all but completed a return to its 106-year-old retailing 
roots Thursday by announcing the spinoff of its huge Allstate insurance unit 
and signaling that the architect of its merchandising recovery will run the 
transformed company. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears said its chairman and chief executive for the last eight years, Edward 
A. Brennan, 60, will retire when the realignment is completed. Brennan 
recommended he be replaced by Arthur C. Martinez, 55, the man hired away from 
Saks Fifth Avenue in 1992 to revive Sears' retailing operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears' decision to spin off its 80.1% holding in insurance giant Allstate 
appeared to be the final major step in the merchandising company's strategy of 
dismantling its multi-industry structure to focus on its core retailing 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears executives said the distribution of the 360 million Allstate shares, 
valued at about $9 billion, would be one of the largest spinoffs in U.S. 
business history. They said holders of Sears common stock would receive almost 
one share of Allstate stock for each Sears share under the plan, which would be 
implemented sometime in 1995, subject to shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sears and Allstate are ready, and the economic environment is right, for 
these successful American franchises to operate as independent companies," 
Brennan said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street welcomed the news by bidding Sears shares up $2.75 to $51.625, 
while Allstate stock dropped 75 cents to $24.125. Sears also said it is 
exploring the sale of its Homart Development Co., a leading regional mall and 
community center developer with assets of $2.2 billion, including 18 office 
buildings and 32 suburban shopping malls around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's strategy of the last two years has been to remake Sears in its 
original image -- to achieve an incarnation as a retailer without the 
distracting operational interests it has had in insurance, real estate and 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort began in September, 1992, when Sears announced it would sell its 
Coldwell Banker Residential Services realty unit and remove the Dean Witter 
Reynolds Financial Services Group out from under the corporate umbrella by 
spinning off most of it to Sears shareholders and selling the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Allstate spinoff is completed, Sears will consist of about 750 
department stores and about 1,200 specialty stores such as Homelife furniture 
and its Sears Hardware stores. It also owns 61% of Sears Canada and 75% of 
Sears Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail industry analysts said this new retail-focused entity will be 
tailor-made for Martinez, who has reversed Sears' failing fortunes since the 
company hired him to head the Sears Merchandise Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is expected to named Sears' next chairman and chief executive on the 
strength of Brennan's recommendation. Brennan made his choice public Thursday 
when he announced that he would retire after the Allstate spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all of this restructuring, the company would have been top-heavy with 
both Brennan and Martinez because Sears is now in need of one leader to steer 
its retailing operations," said Richard Nelson, an analyst at Duff & Phelps in 
Chicago. "Brennan restructured the company and Martinez is well qualified to 
manage it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said Martinez has earned the trust of Sears shareholders by closing 
poorly performing stores and cutting costs. Among his bold strokes was a 
January, 1993, decision to close Sears' venerable but flagging catalogue sales 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 By cutting costs, Sears was able to lower prices and attract more 
value-conscious consumers, said Kurt Barnard, a New Jersey-based retail 
economist. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez "has worked wonders for the company," Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts also credit Martinez with expanding the amount of store 
space devoted to apparel and for displaying it more attractively -- changes 
that have generated increases in clothing sales.  
</P>
<P>
 The retail turnaround helped Sears rebound in 1993 with earnings of $2.3 
billion after a record loss of $3.9 billion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that Allstate was an important contributor to those profits, analysts 
said Thursday's decision is a "vote of confidence" in Sears' current retail 
operations. Sears Refocuses on Retailing 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, Roebuck & Co. announced that it is spinning off Allstate insurance, the 
latest in a series of company moves to focus on its core retail operations. 
Some major developments in the company's transformation: 
</P>
<P>
 * 1978: Sears decides to make itself less dependent on retailing. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

and No. 2 Kmart. 
</P>
<P>

division. 
</P>
<P>

COMPANY TOWN; BUSINESSMAN OR JUST BLUES MAN? DIXON'S SONGS IN ROYALTY DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the hundreds of songs written by the late blues pioneer Willie Dixon is 
called "I'm a Businessman." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three years after Dixon's death, a jury is being asked to decide how 
good a businessman he was, and whether he should have known better when he 
signed away a portion of his song rights 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case just getting under way in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Dixon's 
widow, Marie, is pitted against the singer's former personal manager, Scott 
Cameron. The main issue is a one-page agreement Dixon signed in 1977 forever 
giving Cameron a third of his publishing royalties, a document Marie Dixon 
argues should be voided because her husband was duped into signing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of dollars are at stake in the battle. Dixon, one of the legends in 
American blues, who died in 1992 at age 76, inspired some of rock's top 
performers and wrote scores of songs recorded by major artists, including "Back 
Door Man" by the Doors, "Seventh Son" by Johnny Rivers and "Little Red Rooster" 
by the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Music royalty court fights have become increasingly common as artists and 
their attorneys challenge details of contracts, some signed decades ago. In a 
similar court case being heard in Los Angeles, Beach Boy Mike Love is suing his 
cousin Brian Wilson over royalties and credit for some of the group's 1960s 
classic songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Such disputes have been especially bitter for blues artists, many of whom 
maintain they were shamelessly exploited by record executives when they were 
young. Indeed, Dixon in 1979 founded the Blues Heaven Foundation, which helps 
blues artists recover their royalties and rights. Dixon himself once filed a 
lawsuit -- and received an out-of-court settlement -- claiming the 1969 Led 
Zeppelin hit "Whole Lotta Love" was virtually identical to his 1962 song "You 
Need Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon's royalties today flow to Hoochie Coochie Music, a business of Marie 
Dixon named for the Dixon classic "I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man." It receives 
half the royalties as songwriting rights, with the remaining half being the 
publisher's share of the royalties, the ownership of which is at the center of 
the dispute between Marie Dixon and Cameron. 
</P>
<P>
 One court document suggests that the publishing rights overall could be worth 
$6 million, though such valuations are highly subjective and can change 
depending on the popularity of specific songs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, three songs Dixon either wrote or co-wrote appear on Eric 
Clapton's recently released hit blues album "From the Cradle," and two others, 
including his classic "I Just Want to Make Love to You," are being used in beer 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, Dixon fought a legal battle to regain his songs from ARC Music, 
a blues publishing firm that Dixon said improperly gained control over his 
songs. He reached an agreement in 1977 to get them back. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron and his attorney, Russell J. Frackman, argue that the agreement to 
give Cameron a third of the publishing royalties amounts to a contingency fee 
he earned doing invaluable research to help Dixon get his songs back. They 
argue that before he died, Dixon realized payments of about $3 million as a 
result of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When Scott started to look into it, Willie Dixon didn't have any rights. When 
Scott was finished, he got back his rights," Frackman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Dixon and her attorney, Joseph Hart, claim Cameron exaggerates his role 
in helping Dixon reclaim his songs and that any lawyer put on the chase would 
have easily unearthed the evidence Cameron found. They further argue that Dixon 
was no businessman and was barely even literate, submitting as evidence one 
letter he wrote full of misspellings and grammatical errors. As a result, they 
argue, Dixon didn't understand what he was signing when he agreed to give 
Cameron the one-third share. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be partners with this man, and Willie didn't want to be 
partners with this man," Marie Dixon said just before a court hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frackman disputes the characterization of Dixon as unsophisticated, noting 
that he acquired some publishing rights on his own and was therefore familiar 
with the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't dumb at all. Willie Dixon was a very smart man," Frackman said.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: GOP IS POISED TO CUT CAPITAL GAINS TAX -- AND 
CLINTON COULD JOIN IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the Republicans dominating Congress for the first time in four decades, 
Wall Street sees a spectacular chance to get a favorite wish granted: a cut in 
the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains, now 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the nation's arguably low savings rate, Republicans have insisted for 
decades that people need greater incentive to save and invest. Limiting Uncle 
Sam's take of any asset's long-term rise in value has always sounded like a 
logical way to boost investment and spur economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing is simple inside the Washington Beltway, so Democrats and 
Republicans have battled for years over whether a lower capital gains tax 
really helps the economy in the long run, or is just a costly tax dodge for the 
wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, it seems clear that Congress will send President Clinton some 
kind of capital gains tax cut in 1995. The probable new chairman of the 
tax-bill-writing House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, 
appears unshakable in his commitment to a cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Archer introduced a bill in January that would slash the maximum effective 
long-term gains tax rate to 14%, the lowest rate in the modern era. His 
proposal is part of House Republicans' "Contract With America," their blueprint 
for immediate action in the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republicans haven't been specific with capital gains proposals, but 
it's hard to imagine they won't go along with a cut. When the Republicans took 
control of the Senate in 1980, on President Ronald Reagan's coattails, the 1981 
tax reform law that came out of Congress sliced the top capital gains rate from 
28% to 20%. It went back up to 28% with the 1986 tax law. 
</P>
<P>
 But would a sharply lower capital gains tax rate be bullish for financial 
markets in 1995, as popular wisdom might suggest? Some Wall Streeters worry 
that the timing, in the short run, isn't fortuitous. 
</P>
<P>
 With the bull market aged and thus vulnerable to selling anyway, a lower 
capital gains tax rate could conceivably encourage many long-term investors to 
take their stock profits and run back to the bank, where CD yields are alluring 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Metz, investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York, says 
that any new selling pressure in the market could be exacerbated by another 
probable side effect of a capital gains tax cut: a slew of initial public stock 
offerings by private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every entrepreneur in the world would be trying to sell his company to the 
public" as a way of taking out some of the accumulated wealth in the business, 
Metz says. Unless interest rates come down, those new issues could be fighting 
for the attention of a shrunken pool of stock investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the short term isn't what a capital gains tax cut would be about. The 
issue is whether Americans deserve to keep more of the capital they put at 
risk, long-term, in investments. For two reasons, Republican logic on a capital 
gains tax cut may be unassailable, even if other tax reductions (such as an 
income tax cut) must be limited to allow room for a capital gains cut: 
</P>
<P>
 * At 28%, the top U.S. tax rate on long-term capital gains -- that is, gains 
on investments held more than one year -- is higher than that of any other 
major industrialized country except Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany doesn't tax long-term gains at all. The French tax them at 18.1%. Even 
welfare state Sweden takes less. Coincidentally, most of the industrialized 
world also boasts of higher personal savings rates than the United States. Or 
perhaps it's not a coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investing is no longer the exclusive domain of the wealthy, if it ever was. 
As the stock and bond mutual fund buying explosion of the last 10 years shows, 
Middle America has become a big investor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich or not so rich, anybody who makes a long-term investment decision that 
ends up a winner would like to keep as much of the gain as possible. And 
investment winnings are likely to beget more investment, in the long run if not 
right away. If you know you'll pay a 39.6% tax rate on interest income from the 
bank, but only 14% on a long-term stock gain, chances are you will find stocks 
irresistible for at least some of your savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, one of the electorate's messages in Tuesday's swing to conservatism 
was that more people believe the old Republican mantra: Government shouldn't 
create jobs; the private sector should. If that's the new marching order, then 
the private sector shouldn't be impeded in its search for capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But could President Clinton sign a tax cut bill that includes a huge capital 
gains tax reduction without risking alienating Democrats who would initially 
view such a move as a handout to the wealthy? It is said that "only Nixon could 
have gone to China" -- a reference to President Richard Nixon's rabid 
anti-communism. Perhaps only a Democratic, liberal-leaning President could sign 
the most aggressive capital gains tax cut in U.S. history and get America's 
thanks.

 Wholesale prices fell unexpectedly for a second straight month in October, as 
car prices posted their sharpest drop in a year and gasoline and heating oil 
prices also slumped, the government said Thursday. But economists said the good 
news won't prevent another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve Board 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The big decline in the Labor Department's producer price index was identical 
to the 0.5% decrease reported in September, marking the first time the index 
has posted back-to-back declines in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Clinton Administration and Wall Street welcomed the price report. 
Most analysts had been looking for a modest pickup in inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 "All recent signs are that the U.S. economy continues to enjoy a winning 
combination of healthy growth with modest inflation," said White House chief 
economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson noted that the good news on wholesale prices and a report Wednesday 
showing a tiny increase in unit labor costs "indicate that inflationary 
pressures in the American economy remain well contained." 
</P>
<P>
 However, private analysts said they still expect the Fed to boost interest 
rates for a sixth time this year when it meets Tuesday. Many analysts said they 
expect increases of half a percentage point in both the federal funds rate, the 
interest that banks charge each other, and the discount rate, the Fed's charge 
for direct loans to banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed is going to go ahead and hike interest rates on Tuesday. The debate 
will be over how much, not whether to raise rates," said Sung Won Sohn, chief 
economist of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said they believe the steep decline in the PPI will limit the 
Fed to a half-point increase rather than the full point some had feared. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing 
new claims for unemployment benefits rose a steep 8,000 to 330,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts cautioned against reading too much into the volatile weekly 
number. They said labor markets remain healthy, as evidenced by last week's 
report that the unemployment rate fell to a four-year low of 5.8% in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest jump in claims was reported in Michigan, up 2,331, an increase 
blamed on seasonal layoffs throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 California had the biggest decrease for the week of Oct. 29, reporting a 5,679 
drop in new jobless claims, an improvement credited to fewer layoffs in the 
service industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The back-to-back 0.5% declines in the producer price index in September and 
October left inflation at the wholesale level rising at an annual rate of just 
1.2% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading contributor to the decline in October was a 2.6% drop in new car 
prices, the biggest in more than seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some analysts called that a statistical quirk. Producer Price Index

FCC MOVES TO SPUR NEW CABLE CHANNELS; TELEVISION: THE AGENCY SAYS OPERATORS CAN 
RAISE THEIR SUBSCRIBER RATES IF THEY EXPAND THEIR OFFERINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to encourage the cable television industry to offer more program 
choices, the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday adopted rules that 
let cable operators raise rates when they add channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the changes, to take effect Jan. 1, cable operators can boost monthly 
fees for basic cable service by as much as $1.50 a month in return for offering 
subscribers at least six new cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite Thursday's 3-2 vote to relax price regulation, experts say 
consumers should not expect to see a sudden explosion of new channels among the 
nation's 11,000 cable systems, because most are already using nearly all their 
channel capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules, adopted more than six months after the agency ordered a 7% 
rollback in cable rates nationwide, are aimed at addressing industry complaints 
that rate regulation had discouraged cable operators from modernizing their 
systems to increase channel capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes "will produce more diversity in programming by giving cable 
operators reasonable incentives to add new channels," said Meredith Jones, 
chief of the FCC's cable services bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators have been under pressure to prod cable operators to add 
programming without upsetting the consumer price and service protection 
measures Congress approved two years ago in its re-regulation of the cable 
industry. Consumer groups have urged the FCC not to ease price restrictions so 
soon after it forced the industry to cut cable rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable operators, whose systems now sport an average of 38 to 40 channels each, 
have been slow to add channels in recent months despite new competition from 
phone companies and new satellite systems, which offer up to 150 video 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because many systems remain tapped out at full capacity and will 
require major overhauls to make room for new channels -- a process that could 
take months if not years, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rule change by itself is not going to do the trick," said John Manssell, 
a senior analyst with Kagan Associates. "Most cable operators in major markets 
don't have more than a few channels that they aren't using." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Thursday's action won plaudits from cable operators and from 
Wall Street, where Ray Katz, an industry analyst for Bear, Stearns & Co., 
called the FCC decision "a good thing for the industry. It will help increase 
cash flow. And anything that increases cash flows is a positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The old FCC cable rate rules "didn't make it worthwhile to offer new 
channels," said Joe Waz, a vice president at Comcast Corp., the nation's 
third-largest cable operator, with about 3.3 million subscribers. "But I think 
this action today frees up new opportunities for (cable) programmers." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Thursday's action, operators will also be allowed to offer an expanded 
tier of cable channels at unregulated rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say small cable systems with just a few dozen channels will probably 
be among the first to take advantage of the rule changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm a cable operator with an 80-channel system, it doesn't make sense to 
add new cable networks no one has ever heard of," said Michael Wirth, director 
of the University of Denver's School of Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if I'm only operating 35 channels and can add brand-name networks that 
people know, it might be worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related action Thursday, the FCC authorized the auctioning of licenses 
for a "wireless" cable service that would compete with traditional hard-wired 
cable TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to auction licenses for multi-channel, multi-point distribution 
service cable, or MMDS, caps recent agency efforts to maximize commercial use 
of the airwaves by selling communications licenses to the highest bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 MMDS technology, which has been around for nearly a generation, utilizes 
microwaves to transmit video signals. But because the home receiving antenna 
must be within the line of sight of the microwave broadcast tower, the 
technology is not suitable for mountainous and wooded areas.

 New Derivatives Rule Proposed: The Financial Accounting Standards Board has 
drawn up a proposal to simplify reporting of derivatives when they are used to 
hedge the risk of loans or other investments.The accounting industry's 
rule-making group asked its staff to generate a proposal that could be sent out 
for comment in the first quarter of 1996. The plan drew strong opposition from 
bankers, who said it would cause volatility on their balance sheets. 
Derivatives are complex financial contracts that enable corporations to 
minimize the risk of sudden changes in interest rates, foreign currency values 
and other market variables. Conventional accounting standards never envisioned 
the rapid spread of derivatives used by corporations.

 T-Bill Interest Rates Rise: Rates on the 52-week Treasury bills rose at 
auction to the highest levels in nearly four years. The average discount rate 
was 6.09%, up from 5.72% at the last auction Oct. 13.It was the highest average 
since the 6.22% of Jan. 10, 1991. The bills will carry an equivalent coupon 
interest rate of 6.48%, with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,384.20. 
Sales totaled $17.06 billion out of bids of $55.18 billion. The Treasury 
Department also sold 37-day cash management bills at an average discount rate 
of 5.11%. The discount rate understates the actual return to investors: 5.21%, 
with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,947.50. A total of $12.01 billion in bills 
were sold out of bids totaling $49.81 billion.

 Rockwell Finds Financing for Reliance Deal: Rockwell International Corp. said 
it has lined up $2.5 billion in new credit.The backing removes the final 
barrier to a proposed buyout of Reliance Electric Co. -- except for Reliance's 
refusal to sell. Rockwell said it has arranged two revolving credit lines with 
a group of 27 banks: one for $1.5 billion with a term of five years and one for 
$1 billion with a term of 364 days. Seal Beach-based Rockwell last month 
offered $30 a share in cash to Reliance stockholders, valuing the Cleveland, 
Ohio, company at $1.5 billion. Reliance had already agreed to a $1.4-billion 
takeover by General Signal Corp.

 Court Stays 20th Century Rebates: 20th Century Industries on Thursday won a 
stay of a California Supreme Court ruling that ordered the Woodland Hills-based 
insurer to pay policyholders $120 million in premium rebates and interest under 
Proposition 103. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs granted 
the delay to allow 20th Century to file an expected appeal to the U.S. Supreme 
Court.Janavs' stay expires Dec. 28, 20th Century's deadline for filing the 
appeal. If the U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear the case, the delay could last 
much longer. A lawyer for state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi attacked 
Janavs' action as illegal. "We don't think she has the authority to stay a 
Supreme Court order," said attorney Michael J. Strumwasser.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BOND YIELDS RISE; DOW DROPS 9.76

<P>
 Stock and bond markets' excitement over Tuesday's Republican victory in 
Congress evaporated Thursday, as bond yields rose and stocks fell modestly. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite news of a sharp decline in wholesale inflation in October, sellers 
took control in the bond market once again. Interest rates rose across the 
board, with the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond closing at 8.15%, 
up from 8.11% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow industrial average lost 9.76 points to 3,821.99 as 
losers outnumbered winners by 13 to 8 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market setback, which undercut stocks, suggested that bearishness 
runs deep among fixed-income investors -- especially with the Federal Reserve 
Board expected to raise short-term rates for a sixth time this year when it 
meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of economic data indicating that inflationary pressures are 
building as the economy expands, traders apparently were unwilling Thursday to 
put much faith in the wholesale prices report, or to assume that it will deter 
the Fed from another credit-tightening move. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department's report of a 0.5% plunge in the producer price index in 
October initially surprised Wall Street analysts, who had expected a modest 
increase of about 0.2% in October. 
</P>
<P>
 However, excluding auto, energy and food prices, wholesale inflation would 
have increased 0.1%, roughly within expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Also pressuring the bond market were reports that Wall Street dealers who had 
bought new three- and 10-year notes in Treasury auctions this week exploited 
the early rally to sell the securities and take profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow shot up nearly 30 points in the morning after the 
inflation report. The rally then halted, however, as bond yields rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders said it didn't help the bond market that Texas Republican Bill 
Archer, incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he 
strongly favors cutting taxes. Investors fear that new tax cuts will cause the 
federal budget deficit to balloon again. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks, which had rallied recently, gave back some of their 
gains. IBM fell 2 to 72, Texas Instruments dropped 1 3/4 to 77 and Adobe 
Systems lost 1 to 33 3/4. Semiconductor stocks were pressured by news of 
lower-than-expected industry orders in October. 
</P>
<P>
 * Genentech shares plunged after the biotech firm said it was the target of a 
widened government inquiry, then recovered amid speculation of a buyout by 
Roche Holdings, which holds 65% of the stock. Genentech was off 1 3/4 at 46 1/2 
after falling as low as 43 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy stocks dropped on concerns about falling oil prices. Chevron fell 5/8 
to 41 7/8, Exxon dropped 3/4 to 59 1/2 and Unocal fell 5/8 to 27 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * In continuing fallout from Tuesday's elections, many big drug stocks rose 
further on expectations that federal health care reform is dead. Merck gained 
3/8 to 37 1/8, Pfizer added 3/8 to 76 1/2, Warner-Lambert rose 1/2 to 77 3/4 
and Schering-Plough jumped 7/8 to 73 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, some casino-related stocks dropped in the wake of voter 
rejection of gambling in some regions. Caesars World slid 2 1/8 to 39 3/4, 
Promus sank 1/2 to 30 and International Game Technology fell 5/8 to 18 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sears, Roebuck jumped 2 3/4 to 51 5/8 on news that it plans to divest its 
80.1% stake in Allstate Corp. Allstate slipped 3/4 to 24 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, shares of troubled Conversion Industries, suspended 
on the Amex, resumed trading in the so-called third market and dove 1 1/16 to 
5/16. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks closed mostly lower in overseas trading. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei 
average ended off 159.03 points at 19,264.85. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, the Frankfurt DAX 30-share average closed at 2,082.40, down 14.07 
points, while London's Financial Times 100-share average gained 3.9 points to 
finish at 3,103.5. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency markets, the dollar finished higher against most major currencies 
for a second day, closing at 1.530 German marks in New York, up from 1.527 on 
Wednesday. But it eased to 97.78 Japanese yen from 97.81.

 Mexico's key stock market index on Thursday plunged 4.8%, its fourth-steepest 
fall of 1994, as investors piled out of Telefonos de Mexico, the telephone 
monopoly also known as Telmex. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-share Bolsa index plummeted 126.62 points to 2,492.32 as Telmex stock 
dove, responding to AT&T Corp.'s announcement Wednesday of a $1-billion joint 
venture with Mexican conglomerate Grupo Industrial Alfa, to compete with Telmex 
in phone service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Telmex is Mexico's benchmark stock," said Claudio Brocado, head of equity 
research at Valores Finamex. "When its price comes down, every other Mexican 
stock seems more expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Volume was 86.21 million shares, with Telmex accounting for almost 57 million. 
Declining stocks outnumbered gainers by 70 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, Telmex American depository shares tracked the 
stock's fall in Mexico, sliding $4.75 to $51.25. It was the most active stock, 
with nearly 11 million shares trading. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Nasdaq market, another issue of Telmex stock plunged 28 cents to $2.53. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the selling is coming from foreigners. The (Bolsa) lost its most 
important support level of 2,500 and, at that point, it triggered further 
selling," one trader said. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T and Grupo Alfa's venture will rival Telmex in long-distance telephone 
services when the Mexican market is opened to competition in 1997. Analysts 
said the alliance leaves Telmex without a partner among the major long-distance 
telephone companies in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the market's sharp decline was made worse by fears of further 
political unrest stirred by rumors of fresh attacks from Zapatista rebels in 
the southern state of Chiapas, site of a surprise uprising last January.

longer. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi attacked Janavs' 
action as illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think she has the authority to stay a Supreme Court order," said 
attorney Michael J. Strumwasser, who represents Garamendi on Proposition 103 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has not decided how to respond, Strumwasser said, but one option is 
petitioning the state Supreme Court to quash the stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield accused Janavs of "thumbing her nose 
at the public" and said she should be barred from cases involving the 1988 
insurance rate-cutting initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court, in its Aug. 18 decision, unanimously reversed a 
ruling by Janavs and rejected 20th Century's challenge to Garamendi's 
Proposition 103 regulations.

IRS TO GRADE ON APPEARANCE; AGENCY WILL LOOK BEYOND RETURN FOR OTHER INCOME 
CLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALBERT B. CRENSHAW, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 After years of checking W-2s and 1099s and making sure taxpayers have receipts 
for their deductions, the Internal Revenue Service is adding a new weapon to 
its audit arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called "economic reality," and it means that IRS agents will start 
looking beyond the numbers of the return to make sure the report fits with the 
taxpayer's assets and lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a big house and a couple of fancy cars but your return shows, say, 
$25,000 in taxable income, the IRS will be asking you to explain how you make 
ends meet. If you suddenly start reporting a lot of investment or interest 
income after years of reporting none, agents will want to know about those 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, they'll be looking at your finances and asking, in effect, 
"What's wrong with this picture?" 
</P>
<P>
 The program stems in part from the agency's realization that unreported income 
is the fastest-growing segment of the "tax gap" -- the $100 million or so in 
uncollected taxes that escapes the IRS each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of examination activity was based on verification of deductions and 
known income," said Phil Brand, IRS chief compliance officer, but that method 
is "not the best, in our judgment," in dealing with cash transactions and other 
unreported income. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has begun training auditors in "economic reality" techniques, and 
agents will be expected to implement them as soon as they complete the course. 
</P>
<P>
 The techniques will be applied to both garden-variety audits and to 
all-encompassing "taxpayer compliance measurement program" audits, in which a 
small number of randomly chosen taxpayers are audited in excruciating detail to 
help the agency gauge the overall extent of cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program will involve checking sources such as motor vehicle records, 
real estate transfers and other documents that might show assets that seem 
greater than what the taxpayer could acquire with the income he or she is 
reporting. A taxpayer such as Soviet spy Aldrich Ames, for example, might have 
attracted IRS attention under this program, even if the CIA didn't notice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If a taxpayer reports $2,000 in interest income from a bank account this year 
but none in previous years and his or her income hasn't changed, "we would ask 
what amount of money earns $2,000 in interest" and where did it come from, said 
John Monaco, who is assistant commissioner for examinations at the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Monaco acknowledged that there are certainly many legitimate explanations -- 
inheritance, for example -- and said that if the taxpayer can show where the 
money came from, that will be that. 
</P>
<P>
 Monaco also said the training includes a heavy emphasis on matters of privacy 
and ethics designed to make sure taxpayers' rights are protected. Nonetheless, 
some experts and a number of the agency's regular critics are voicing concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are major privacy issues here," said Pete Sepp of the National 
Taxpayers Union, a nonprofit group that often takes issue with IRS practices. 
"This represents a fundamental shift in the philosophy behind audits. Before, 
the IRS was concerned about information that appeared on the return. Now an 
agent could conceivably delve into many, many other portions of your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Alexander, a former IRS commissioner who is now a lawyer in private 
practice, said, "I think that for individual examinations it's a good idea if 
not carried too far." 
</P>
<P>
 If a taxpayer is in a business in which cash payments are common, reports 
$12,000 in income and has four Mercedes-Benzes parked outside, "the IRS agent 
knows full well there is a problem and should seek it out," Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, the program "should be strictly limited," Alexander said. "The IRS 
doesn't have the time to run net worth examinations on many taxpayers, nor 
should it."  
</P>
<P>
 IRS officials said "economic reality" checks will not be applied 
indiscriminately. Returns will continue to be selected for audit by computer 
and then reviewed by IRS workers. Only those that seem suspicious will get the 
full treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this program is new, the techniques of "economic reality" audits have 
been around for many years. Until now, their most common use was in estimating 
incomes of individuals who have failed to file returns, not those who have 
filed. In such cases, which often involve criminal activity such as drug 
dealing, IRS agents track down the individual's assets, examine his or her 
spending habits and lifestyle, then calculate the income necessary to support 
them. The agency then taxes the person on that income. The results in such 
cases have been tested in court and widely upheld. 
</P>
<P>
 A key spur for the new program is the widespread computerization of the kinds 
of records the IRS needs to see. In the past, Brand noted, checking car 
licenses and the like meant laborious manual searches. Now they can be done 
quickly and cheaply by computer.

HEALTH; REGULATORS BLOCK SALE OF 6 NME HOSPITALS TO CHARTER MEDICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.D. STRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday blocked, for antitrust reasons, 
National Medical Enterprises' proposed sale of six psychiatric hospitals to 
Charter Medical Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC said the sale would have an anti-competitive effect because Macon, 
Ga.-based Charter, the nation's largest operator of psychiatric hospitals, 
would control too large a share of the market in the cities where the hospitals 
are located. 
</P>
<P>
 The six hospitals are in Atlanta; Memphis, Tenn.; Orlando, Fla., and Richmond, 
Va. Both Charter and NME have substantial shares of the market in those cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter acquisition of the hospitals, the FTC said, would "increase the 
likelihood that Charter would unilaterally exercise market power in the 
relevant markets . . . (denying) patients, physicians, third-party payers and 
other consumers the benefits of free and open competition based on price, 
quality and service." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica-based National Medical agreed in March to sell 47 psychiatric 
hospitals to Charter for $200 million. Thirty of those hospitals have already 
changed hands, and National Medical is in the final transferring stages of 11 
more that already have FTC approval, company spokeswoman Diana Takvam said. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical must find another buyer for the remaining six because it is 
required to get out of the psychiatric hospital business in its June agreement 
with the Justice Department. The firm, which remains one of the nation's 
largest operators of acute-care hospitals, agreed to pay $380 million to settle 
fraud charges related to the operation of its psychiatric business. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the federal inquiry, the company had also been the target of 
several lawsuits filed by insurers and claims by 150 to 200 patients of fraud 
and abuse. Most have been settled. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical had operated 61 psychiatric hospitals. It is now actively 
seeking buyers for 20 facilities, Takvam said.

FINAL STANDARDS ISSUED ON CARE AT NATION'S NURSING HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SPENCER RICH, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven years after Congress acted to clean up abuses and substandard care in 
the nation's nursing homes, the Department of Health and Human Services 
released final regulations Thursday on how to carry out the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Nursing homes can be fined up to $10,000 a day for serious violations that 
endanger the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Fines of $2,000 would be imposed on anyone who tips off a nursing home about 
the date of a surprise inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 And penalties are graduated, with minor infractions punishable by fines of 
$50. Previously, the main enforcement tool available to the federal government 
was the complete withholding of Medicare funds, which was so severe it was 
rarely used. 
</P>
<P>
 "We insist that nursing homes not only meet residents' physical needs, but 
must also offer a quality of life that respects their rights and humanity," HHS 
Secretary Donna E. Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1987 law laid out health, safety and quality standards for nursing homes. 
These included rules on nutrition and cleanliness, assurance of a patient's 
right to refuse physical and chemical restraints, and guarantees against 
involuntary discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new regulations -- affecting 16,700 nursing homes that care for 1.5 
million Medicare and Medicaid patients at a cost to the government of $31 
billion a year -- surprise inspections of nursing homes are to be conducted an 
average of once a year but no less than once every 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the whole, the regulations represent a step forward in improving quality," 
said Paul Willging, executive vice president of the American Health Care Assn., 
a major trade group for the nursing home industry. He said the regulations will 
allow enforcement to focus on chronically faulty facilities rather than those 
with only minor problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Keegan, an AHCA official, said this is an improvement over the earlier, 
tentative version of the regulations, published two years ago, which would have 
allowed an inspector to cite a home for a violation "if he saw a single cracked 
egg in a refrigerator," even if it did not represent a pattern or repeated 
occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 A third major feature of the new rules is the graded system of penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules announced Thursday are designed to match the punishment or 
corrective action with the severity of the violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicare-Medicaid administrator Bruce C. Vladeck said 10 different penalties 
start with simply giving the nursing home a detailed plan to correct 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 More severe violations could be met with denials of payments, civil fines of 
$50 to $3,000 a day, state or HHS management of the facility, fines of $3,050 
to $10,000 a day, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid and shutting down the 
home altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules are to take effect July 1.

HEALTH; GOVERNMENT IS SET TO APPROVE PROZAC FOR BULIMIA TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prozac, praised as a wonder drug to treat depression and reviled by critics 
who say it causes violent and suicidal urges, is about to get approval for 
another high-profile affliction: the eating disorder bulimia. 
</P>
<P>
 Eli Lilly & Co., which introduced Prozac in 1987, said Thursday that the Food 
and Drug Administration has issued what is known as an approvable letter in 
support of using the drug for bulimics. 
</P>
<P>
 That is generally the final step before the FDA grants approval for a new drug 
or for a new use of an existing product, said Victoria Murphy, spokeswoman for 
the Indianapolis-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrists said Thursday that many doctors are already prescribing Prozac 
for bulimia. 
</P>
<P>
 Prozac, which costs about $75 a month for a once-a-day pill, is the world's 
biggest-selling antidepressant. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug was considered revolutionary when approved because, unlike its 
predecessors, overdoses weren't considered dangerous, and it didn't have 
persistent side effects such as dizziness, sleepiness and memory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 It has successfully weathered blistering criticism and a bevy of lawsuits 
starting in 1991, when some scientists and the Church of Scientology said it 
prompted homicidal and suicidal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Prozac's sales have soared about 40% this year, prompting industry analyst 
Neil Sweig of Ladenburg, Thalman & Co. to estimate they will reach $1.7 billion 
for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilly shares rose 37.5 cents Thursday to $64.75 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Prozac was approved for treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
a condition in which a person has a sometimes uncontrollable need to perform 
rituals such as changing clothes or cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Nordmann, drug industry analyst for money manager Deerfield Management 
Inc., said current trends indicate that within a year, the drug could be the 
country's No. 1 seller, surpassing the ulcer drug Zantac, which had $1.9 
billion in 1993 sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the likely approval, Lilly also announced a setback. The company 
said it has withdrawn its application for the obesity drug Lovan, which 
includes the same active ingredient as Prozac. The FDA wants all obesity drugs 
to undergo two-year human studies to make sure they work, and Lilly said such 
tests aren't worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some doctors now prescribe Prozac for obesity because it suppresses the 
appetite, though its cost has kept such use relatively low.

 Microsoft Announces $100-Million Ad Campaign: The company said the 
international advertising effort aims to make the company's brand name known in 
the rapidly growing consumer side of the computer market. While Microsoft Corp. 
is the dominant maker of software for personal computers, executives say the 
company is rarely identified when consumers are asked about their impressions 
of the industry. The new advertisements, including television commercials that 
will begin airing Monday, are intended to build interest in the company and its 
products, including its Windows 95 operating system and planned on-line service 
-- both expected out by mid-1995.

 A New Twist to Pop Fashion: Sun Apparel Inc., one of the world's largest 
jeanswear manufacturers, is launching Code Bleu, a line of jeans made from what 
it calls Soda Pop Denim -- cotton and synthetic fibers spun from recycled 
plastic.Fibers used to weave the fabric come from soda bottles that have been 
sorted by color, cleaned and melted into solid pellets. The pellets are then 
re-melted, spun into fiber, drawn, cut and blended with cotton. The El Paso, 
Tex.-based company says two soda bottles go into the making of every pair of 
jeans.

 Maybe If They Switched to Soda Pop: Oshkosh B'Gosh Inc. said it will close its 
Dover, Tenn., plant because of falling demand for denim garments.Cutting and 
sewing will be consolidated at two plants in Columbia, Ky. About 270 jobs will 
be eliminated in Tennessee. "As we see our consumer demand shift toward 
comfortable knit tops, bottoms and dresses, we are faced with the challenge of 
further realigning our manufacturing resources to meet these needs," said 
Michael Wachtel, chief operating officer. The Oshkosh, Wis., firm makes 
children's and menswear.

 They're Back: Kewpie dolls, long available only in flea markets and antique 
fairs, are returning to toy store shelves.Rose Art Industries of Livingston, 
N.J., is making soft-body versions of the dolls, known for their topknots of 
hair, chubby features and protruding bellies. The new Kewpie comes in an 
African American or European American version and wears a variety of outfits. 
You can even choose a belly button for your doll: a heart, star or cloud. 
Kewpies first appeared in drawings in the Ladies Home Journal in 1909, but the 
doll wasn't made until 1912. The dolls and related merchandise, such as sheets, 
jewelry, books and dishes, were sold from the 1920s into the 1970s.

 The World Pog Federation of Costa Mesa has won exclusive rights to use the 
word pog on its disks and other game products under an agreement announced this 
week, after a months-long legal dispute. The Huntington Beach-based Universal 
Pogs Assn., which had claimed pog was a generic term for the wafer-like game 
pieces, will change its name to Universal Slammers Inc. and will no longer call 
its caps pogs.The Hawaiian sidewalk game has caught on in California and other 
states and is growing into a multimillion-dollar industry. In the game, players 
hit lightweight cardboard disks with a metal or plastic "slammer." A player 
gets a point for each opponents' piece that is flipped over, or gets to keep 
the piece. The WPF had claimed exclusive rights to pog because of an agreement 
with Haleakala Dairy on Maui, which owns 14% of the federation. The dairy 
coined the term when it began stamping POG on the caps of bottles containing 
its blend of passion fruit, orange and guava juices. Terms of the deal were 
confidential. The agreement makes permanent a temporary injunction issued by 
Superior Court.

MUNI BOND BUYERS TO GET MORE PRICING INFO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday set new rules intended to 
help municipal bond investors get prices and financial information about their 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Under SEC prodding, the municipal bond industry unveiled plans to distribute 
information so investors can price their bonds more accurately. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiatives mark the latest far-reaching municipal bond market reforms 
pushed by SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. and Commissioner Richard Roberts. The 
SEC approved new political campaign contribution restrictions in the municipal 
bond market earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal bonds have emerged as popular investment alternatives for individual 
investors because many are tax-exempt. The $1.2-trillion muni bond market helps 
finance construction of public schools, bridges, roads and other public 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, a key problem for individual investors has been getting accurate 
information about their bonds. There is no central marketplace where municipal 
bonds are traded. Wall Street brokerages and regional bond dealers trade among 
themselves, as well as with customers and agencies that issue munis. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating matters are munis' sparse trading patterns. Individual 
investors tend to hold on to munis for extended periods, so the lack of steady 
turnover makes them difficult to price. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors have simply had to rely on their brokers to quote an accurate 
price. The SEC pushed for greater price disclosure to deter possible 
manipulation or fraud by brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, a self-regulatory 
agency that oversees the muni market, has advanced a pilot program to provide 
investors with last-sale price information so they can determine the value of 
their bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 By January, prices for trades between bond dealers will be reported to the 
rule-making board, with institutional and retail trades to follow by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Public Securities Assn., the industry's main trade group, is 
planning to start 900-number telephone service that will provide investors with 
prices and other trade information. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC also approved rules requiring local government agencies that issue 
muni bonds to update their financial statements when something happens that 
could affect the agency's financial outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules and industry proposals will be phased in through January, 1996, to 
give the industry time to adjust computer systems and implement reporting 
practices.

 Despite a red-hot year on the charts, industry insiders say, things aren't so 
rosy within the executive ranks of Virgin Records. Virgin Worldwide Executive 
Vice President Nancy Berry's newly assumed hands-on management style has many 
wondering who's in charge at the label's Los Angeles headquarters.Apparently, 
one person also asking that question is Virgin U.S. President Phil Quartararo, 
who flew to London this week for a showdown with Virgin Music Group Worldwide 
Chairman Ken Berry -- Nancy Berry's husband.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; WHY THE DEAL-MAKING FERVOR FIZZLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After launching a series of discussions that could have transformed the 
entertainment landscape, the industry has recently adopted a new and different 
slogan: "Let's Not Make a Deal . . . at Least Not Right Away." 
</P>
<P>
 All the heady talk of network reconfigurations, public offerings and even the 
sale of one entertainment conglomerate has faded faster than a low-rated 
series. That includes discussions on NBC and CBS described as "heated" only 
months ago. Expectations have also dimmed on the studio front, where some had 
looked for the Japanese owners to make a move. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of talk, but everything fizzled," said one deal maker. "It's 
quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources blame the rancid deal environment on everything from inflated 
network values to nettlesome government regulations and complex 
cross-ownerships. Time Warner Inc.'s talks with NBC, for example, were partly 
undone by federal roadblocks. Even with a more business-friendly GOP poised to 
take over Congress, no one sees an immediate resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the current deal discussions are more modest. Three companies, 
including Time Warner, are said to be engaged in talks with Cablevision 
Industries Inc. Viacom Inc. is also said to be exploring ways to unload its 
cable TV systems and some of its stations. And Tele-Communications Inc. and 
Comcast Corp. are still seeking federal approval for their $1.42-billion 
purchase of QVC Inc., the home shopping channel.  
</P>
<P>
 The environment for media and entertainment deals caught fire last year, with 
Viacom and QVC's $10-billion battle for Paramount Communications. Other 
agreements that would have hastened the arrival of the information 
superhighway, such as the merger of TCI and Bell Atlantic Corp., later 
collapsed. But the momentum picked up again this summer, with QVC Chairman 
Barry Diller's merger deal with CBS and the news that Time Warner, Walt Disney 
Co., Turner Broadcasting, ITT, Dow Jones and MCA were eyeing General Electric 
Co.'s NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ballyhooed CBS-QVC deal died when unexpected competition for QVC emerged. 
Chairman Laurence A. Tisch denies that he's interested in doing another deal, 
despite periodic reports that a bid could be mounted by Diller or New World 
Chairman Ronald Perelman. Instead, sources say Tisch is more interested in 
finding a new manager for the troubled network. 
</P>
<P>
 Deal discussions involving NBC are also on the back burner. Sources say Disney 
Chairman Michael D. Eisner was unwilling to pay GE's asking price of more than 
$5 billion. Time Warner and other suitors were also said to be put off by GE's 
expectations, as well as regulatory issues. 
</P>
<P>
 One would-be buyer who remains in the game is cable mogul Ted Turner, but 
sources say he's still frustrated by complications involving his partners, Time 
Warner and TCI. Disney is also said to be poised for another network bid if and 
when prices become more reasonable. And Viacom could always enter the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The sellers had a variety of motivations and expectations, and the buyers 
came in with a different set of motivations and expectations," said analyst 
Jeffrey Logsdon of Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles. "In the case of GE and NBC, one 
perception on Wall Street was that they would get out if they could get their 
investment back. But then the station ownership and advertising environment got 
better, their cash flow ballooned and the price went up." 
</P>
<P>
 Another executive put it more directly: "The reason the networks haven't been 
sold is simple: They're overpriced." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Hollywood front it's a different story. Sony of America is said to 
still be looking for a minority investor in Sony Pictures Entertainment. The 
hang-up, sources say, is that no one wants a passive position in the troubled 
company. Sony has tabled one-time consideration of a public stock offering in 
its U.S. entertainment operations, according to executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. was also said to be considering a U.S. 
share offering in MCA Inc. earlier this year. Then came word that that Japanese 
conglomerate might unload MCA altogether, partly to resolve a widening rift 
with MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman and President Sidney J. Sheinberg. 
Matsushita denied the report, though some expect the new team of Jeffrey 
Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen to eventually lead a bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch analyst Harold Vogel is skeptical of many of the deals that were 
once highly touted. "The well has run dry," he says. "All the possible 
alliances have been explored and abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
 But Porter Bibb, managing director of Ladenburg Tahlmann & Co. in New York, 
sees merely a lull in the storm. Speaking about the sales of NBC and CBS, he 
said: "They're both going to happen, just not today. What we're seeing now is a 
case where the media-driven public perceptions have gotten ahead of the 
transactions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Publish or perish: PolyGram Music Publishing Group is getting more aggressive 
when it comes to promoting its artists. Publishing Group President David Simone 
hosted a party Wednesday night at the trendy Westside restaurant Cicada, and 
three of its artists performed live. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching Jules Shear, Brian McKnight and Eddie Chacon entertain the crowd was 
another well-known music figure: Bernie Taupin. The writer of countless hit 
songs with Elton John wasn't looking for exposure. He is an owner of Cicada.

NEW CONSTRUCTION TO START NEXT MONTH AT IRVINE SPECTRUM; REAL ESTATE: 
ECONOMISTS HAIL REVIVAL OF COMMERCIAL BUILDING ACTIVITY AS BUSINESS PARK PLANS 
FIRST EXPANSION IN FIVE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in five years, new construction is pending at Irvine 
Spectrum -- a signal that Orange County's ailing commercial real estate market 
is on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
 Work is scheduled to begin in December on the first phase of an office and 
industrial development projected to cost $52 million. The first building will 
accommodate an expansion by Beech Street Corp., a managed-health-care provider 
already based at the Spectrum, Irvine Co.'s landmark 3,600-acre business park.  
</P>
<P>
 Economists on Thursday hailed news of the project as an indication that the 
Orange County office market is showing signs of new vitality. After demand for 
commercial office and industrial space dried up in the late 1980s, the Irvine 
Co., Orange County's largest landowner, halted construction at the Spectrum. 
The company put up 90 buildings there from 1984 to 1989 but has constructed 
nothing there since. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spectrum is home to about 2,000 companies and the workplace for more than 
33,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co.'s return to the commercial construction market is "a vote of 
confidence in the growth of businesses and jobs in Orange County," said Anil 
Puri, head of the economics department at Cal State Fullerton. "It's very 
encouraging when a large developer like the Irvine Co. believes they can fill 
new space in 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 In another boost to the local economy, Beech Street also plans to nearly 
double the number of workers it has at its headquarters to 600 from about 360 
now.  
</P>
<P>
 Under a $3.7-million, five-year lease, Beech Street will occupy the first of 
12 buildings planned for the new development. The company also has options to 
lease a second building. The new development, to total 525,000 square feet when 
completed, is being designed as flexible space to accommodate the needs of 
growing companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as a fundamental change," said Richard G. Sim, president of the 
Irvine Co.'s investment properties group. "We think the economy has turned and 
is moving forward. The Irvine Co. is preparing for two to three years of 
growth." 
</P>
<P>
 If the demand is there, the entire development could be completed in the next 
two years, Sim said, adding that buildings will not be erected until companies 
are found to lease them. O'Donnell Properties Services Inc. will be the 
construction manager, and LPA Inc. of Irvine will be the designer. 
</P>
<P>
 Esmael Adibi, director of the center for economic research at Chapman 
University in Orange, hailed the Spectrum expansion as the "end of an era" of 
stagnation and the beginning of a period of growth for the county. He said 
significant commercial construction by the Irvine Co. signals a "turning point 
in the local economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1951 in Phoenix, Beech Street moved its corporate headquarters to 
the Spectrum in 1986. Through its Beech Street National Network, the company 
operates a health care preferred provider network with more than 2,300 
hospitals and 150,000 doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Karro, Beech Street's president, said the health-care firm decided to 
expand in the Spectrum because of its central location near major freeways and 
John Wayne Airport, as well as the quality and flexibility of the buildings. 
The company, which now occupies 46,000 square feet in the Spectrum, will add 
100,000 square feet when it moves into its two new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "With what we expect to happen in health care in the next five years and into 
the next century, we are going to make sure we are here for the future," Karro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development this week, the Irvine Co. began construction on its 
entertainment center in the Spectrum, which includes what will be one of the 
largest movie theater complexes in the United States, a 21-screen Edwards 
Theatre.

ST. JOHN KNITS FINDS NEW PLACE TO CALL HOME; HEADQUARTERS: THE WOMEN'S CLOTHING 
MANUFACTURER DECIDES TO STAY IN IRVINE AND WILL CONSOLIDATE HALF OF ITS 
OPERATIONS INTO A 161,000-SQUARE-FOOT BUILDING ON MICHELSON DRIVE.

<P>
 After searching for more than a year for a new headquarters building, St. John 
Knits Inc. said Thursday it has found one across town. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based manufacturer of women's clothing said it will consolidate 
about half of its existing Orange County operations into a large one-story 
building at the corner of Michelson Drive and Jamboree Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to stay in Irvine. We've been here for more than 15 years, and our 
employees all love the area. We're just moving down the road," said Bob Gray, 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 In its search for a new home, the company had considered constructing a 
building on several Southern California sites, including one in Costa Mesa. 
Instead, St. John said, it has signed an agreement with Varian Associates, an 
Irvine investor group that owns real estate across Orange County, for a 
161,000-square-foot building at 2722 Michelson Drive. The property is valued at 
about $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John Knits and the investor group will own and manage the property as 
partners. Varian Associates will also contribute about $500,000 in cash for the 
project, St. John Knits said, and the clothing company will contribute $3.5 
million for building improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Now occupied by computer hardware maker AmeriQuest Technologies Inc., the 
building will be remodeled to house St. John's corporate headquarters, design 
center and manufacturing operations. After extensive modifications, St. John 
Knits expects to move in by mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 AmeriQuest officials could not be reached Thursday to comment on their 
company's plans or confirm when its lease expires. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a high-visibility corner, and we're a high-visibility firm. We want the 
people here to see where we make our product," Gray said. "Hopefully this will 
hold us for the next 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 St. John Knits said it has also signed a letter of intent to lease an 
adjoining property that includes 120,000 square feet of industrial and storage 
space. St. John will convert facilities at its current 71,000-square-foot 
headquarters at 17422 Darian into manufacturing space. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John Knits has had healthy returns this year. For the quarter ended July 
31, the company reported a profit of $3.5 million, or 43 cents a share, up 40% 
from earnings of $2.5 million, or 31 cents a share, for the same period a year 
earlier. Revenue for the quarter increased 19% to $29.7 million from $25 
million. For the first nine months of its fiscal year, the company's profit was 
up 38% to $9.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock was up 12 1/2 cents to close at $30.87 a share in New York 
Stock Exchange trading Thursday.

KOLL MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO SETTLE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Koll Management Services Inc. has agreed to settle shareholder litigation 
stemming from a possible acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the Newport Beach-based property management company said that Freeman 
Spogli & Co., a Los Angeles investment firm, had offered to buy a nearly 50% 
stake in the company for about $24 million.As part of the original proposal, 
company Chairman Donald Koll said he would sell about 14% of the indirect stake 
he owns in the company and public investors would sell their 36% stake for 
about $17 million, or $16 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, an understanding was reached between Koll management and those 
filing the lawsuit that would give plaintiffs an additional 50 cents for each 
share of company stock they own, boosting the purchase price to $16.50 a share. 
The class members include all holders of KMS common stock between June 2, 1994, 
and the date that the acquisition is consummated. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders are to vote on the merger agreement on Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nasdaq trading Thursday, the company's stock was down 12.5 cents, closing 
at $15.50 a share.

 Banking on SBA Loans: The surge in Small Business Administration loans is 
keeping a lot of banks happy. And wearing the biggest smiles in Orange County 
are the folks at the Money Store and the Bank of Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures released this week show that the Money Store, a financial services 
firm that specializes in SBA loans, maintained its lead in Orange County by 
making 69 loans for $32.7 million in the 12 months ended Sept. 30. That was up 
from 56 loans for $25.7 million in the previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among traditional banks, the Bank of Yorba Linda was No. 1 -- jumping from the 
10th spot a year earlier. With SBA offices in Laguna Niguel and Yorba Linda, 
the bank made 56 SBA loans for $20.9 million in the last fiscal year. That was 
up from just 12 loans for $5.6 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's word of mouth," says Al Thielemann, vice president of sales at the Bank 
of Yorba Linda. Whose mouths? Mainly commercial brokers, according to 
Thielemann. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of the SBA's general loans these days going to businesses buying new 
offices or warehouses, it is the commercial broker who can often sway or lead 
the business owner to a particular bank. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA loans are highly profitable for banks because they can sell them to the 
secondary market for an immediate profit. Plus, they are safer than most other 
loans because the SBA guarantees 70% to 90% of them.

FREEDOM COMMUNICATIONS ELECTS THREE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Freedom Communications Inc., the holding company for a chain of newspapers 
including the Orange County Register, has elected three outside executives to 
its board of directors as part of a planned restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization calls for adding outside members to the board and reducing 
the number of board members from the Hoiles family, which owns the 
company.Family members and their representatives held 12 of 13 seats before 
Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Robert C. Hardie -- a son-in-law of Freedom founder R.C. Hoiles -- 
said the company's board increased to 16 members with the election of J. 
Michael Hagan, chairman and chief executive of the Furon Corp., a Laguna Niguel 
manufacturer of seals, tubing and related products; John F. Bitzer Jr., 
president and chief executive officer of Abarta Inc., a Pennsylvania 
conglomerate with media holdings, and Richard G. Capen Jr., former chairman and 
publisher of the Miami Herald. 
</P>
<P>
 The three executives join James N. Rosse, Freedom's president and chief 
executive; D.R. Segal, Freedom's president emeritus, and Abraham Zaleznik, a 
Harvard business professor emeritus, as non-family members of the board. Segal 
and Zaleznik, however, represent Hoiles family groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Business specialists say that the active involvement of independent directors 
helps family-owned businesses survive as they are passed from generation to 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the planned reorganization, a 13-member board could be composed of six 
independent directors, six family representatives and the company president and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for three family members to drop off the board in November, 
1995. In 1998, the board would be modified again with the election of three 
additional outside directors and the removal of three more family members or 
representatives. A company spokesman said the board members have not yet 
decided which family seats would be eliminated.

ROCKWELL SECURES CREDIT FOR BUYOUT OF BALKING RELIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rockwell International Corp. said Thursday it has lined up $2.5 billion in new 
credit, removing the last barrier to its proposed buyout of Reliance Electric 
Co. -- except for Reliance's refusal to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell said it has arranged two revolving credit lines with a group of 27 
banks led by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.: one for $1.5 billion, with a term of 
five years, and one for $1 billion, with a term of 364 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach-based Rockwell last month offered $30 a share in cash to Reliance 
stockholders, valuing the Cleveland company at $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliance had already agreed to a $1.4-billion takeover by General Signal Corp. 
in which Reliance shareholders would receive shares in General Signal. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliance remained standoffish Thursday about the Rockwell offer, issuing a 
statement saying that the offer contains too many uncertainties for Reliance's 
directors to recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Stephen A. Van Oss said the board is concerned about a $50-million 
fee it might have to pay to General Signal for canceling that deal, combined 
with the number of conditions under which Rockwell would be able to call off 
its proposed takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible that we would have to pay the $50 million to General Signal and 
wind up with no deal because Rockwell walked away," Van Oss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, which announced last week that federal antitrust regulators were 
satisfied with its proposal, said it would extend its offer past the current 
expiration date of Nov. 18 if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, a conglomerate best known for defense and aerospace products such as 
the B-1 bomber and the space shuttle, makes parts for automated assembly lines 
through its Allen-Bradley operations. It is interested in merging those with 
Reliance's complementary line of industrial automation products.

 The Fieldstone Group of Cos.: The largest private home builder in Southern 
California sold 274 homes during its third quarter, posting sales of $68.4 
million, a very slight increase from the same period last year when 282 homes 
were sold for $68.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our strongest quarter by far this year and it's very encouraging," 
said Keith Johnson, chief executive officer of Fieldstone. For the first nine 
months, the company sold 642 homes for $152 million, a drop from the 743 homes 
sold for revenue of $178.5 million for the same time last year. The Newport 
Beach-based company does not reveal its level of profits.

 Regency Health Services Inc.: The Tustin operator of specialty health care 
facilities posted third-quarter profit of $561,000, or 3 cents a share, which 
included merger and restructuring charges of $2.4 million. That compares to 
profit of $3.3 million, or 19 cents a share, for the 1993 third quarter.In 
April the company completed its merger with Care Enterprises Inc., and 
financial results for the comparable periods of 1993 have been restated. 
Revenue was increased to $93.6 million from $89.4 million. For the nine-month 
period, the company reported a net loss of nearly $4 million, or 24 cents a 
share, which included merger and restructuring expenses of $10.6 million. That 
contrasts with profit of $8.5 million, or 51 cents a share, for the same period 
last year. Revenue rose 15%, to $284.7 million from $248.3 million.

FORD, CHRYSLER TO CLINTON: DON'T RECALL GM TRUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chairmen of Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. sent a letter to President 
Clinton stating their opposition to a government-ordered recall of rival 
General Motors Corp.'s older pickup trucks, the companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, which argues that a recall of GM's 1973-87 pickup trucks with 
side-mounted fuel tanks would threaten the entire automotive industry, was 
signed by Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton, Ford Chairman Alex Trotman and GM 
President John Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, the executives said Transportation Secretary Federico Pena's 
decision that a defect exists in the full-size trucks will create "needless, 
unreasonable regulatory confusion" that will hurt the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the trucks are vulnerable to fires in side-impact crashes, but GM 
has argued that the trucks are safe and met all federal impact standards in 
place at the time they were built. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pena is allowed to order a recall, the Big Three executives said, all 
federal standards would be subject to arbitrary revisions years later and 
therefore be irrelevant.GENERAL MOTORS CO

FIRST INTERSTATE TO SCALE BACK IN VENTURA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First Interstate Bank, trying to digest its August purchase of Bank of A. Levy 
in Ventura County, said Thursday that it will close six branch offices in the 
county, eliminate up to 100 jobs and sell Levy's headquarters building in the 
city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The two banks combined now have 25 offices and employ about 350 people in 
Ventura County.First Interstate said those workers may reapply for the 250 jobs 
in the 19 branches that First Interstate will own in the area after the 
consolidation is completed next April. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate said current employees at both banks will also be given a 
chance to apply for jobs elsewhere in First Interstate's 13-state system, 
although an undetermined number will have to be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate also said it will sell A. Levy's 10-acre headquarters complex 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Levy, founded 112 years ago, played a major role in transforming the 
once-rural region into a budding metropolis. First Interstate has more than 400 
offices and $25 billion in assets in California alone. DAVID W. MYERS

WHERE WILL SALE LEAVE BUYERS, INVESTORS?; INSURANCE: ALLSTATE POLICYHOLDERS 
PROBABLY WON'T BE AFFECTED, BUT SHAREHOLDERS COULD BE HURT, ANALYSTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Allstate Corp., the "good hands" insurer that Sears, Roebuck & Co. founded in 
1931, taking the name from a brand of Sears tires, will be completely on its 
own after the huge spinoff Sears announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 For Allstate policyholders, that probably won't make much difference, because 
the Northbrook, Ill.-based insurer has been operating independently since Sears 
sold a 19.9% stake to the public last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For Allstate investors, however, analysts said the effect may be negative, at 
least in the short term, as Sears' remaining Allstate stake -- 360 million 
shares -- will be distributed to Sears shareholders, many of whom don't 
particularly want an insurance stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate, California's second-largest auto and homeowners insurer, faces 
estimated gross claims of $1.3 billion from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
Disasters can make earnings fluctuate sharply, distressing investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some institutions have been pressuring Sears to get rid of Allstate because 
they don't like the volatility of an insurance company," Merrill Lynch analyst 
Gerald Lewinsohn said. Such investors may want to sell their new Allstate 
shares, depressing the price, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate stock dropped 75 cents to $24.125 in trading Thursday on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate will also lose some of the tax advantages that came with 
consolidating its results with those of its retailer parent. For example, 
Lewinsohn said, Sears could use Allstate catastrophe losses to reduce its own 
tax liability and Allstate would get cash in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, in announcing the spinoff, said the loss of tax consolidation will 
reduce Allstate's 1995 earnings by 5 cents to 10 cents a share, depending on 
the date the transaction is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some analysts said they think that having no corporate parent looking 
over its shoulder will let Allstate be quicker on its feet. "They can make more 
aggressive moves because they don't have to filter them through Sears," said 
analyst John A. Hall of Northington Partners in Avon, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're extremely pleased by this," Allstate spokeswoman Kathleen Hogan told 
Bloomberg Business News. "In the past, when we've made decisions for insurance 
reasons, we had to be concerned with its effect on Sears customers."

ISOLATED INCIDENTS; RECENT VIOLENCE HAS ROCKED COTO DE CAZA, WHERE THE BUCOLIC 
SETTING ATTRACTS ADULTS BUT LEAVES KIDS WITH LITTLE TO DO. COMMUNITY LEADERS 
SAY YOUTH-ORIENTED ACTIVITIES LOWER THE CRIME RATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bernie Moran says he and his wife moved to this upscale South County gated 
community for two reasons: They liked the house -- a two-story, five bedroom 
"family home" -- and they liked the location. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that it is one of the safest places in the county was a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 But the security the 45-year-old attorney felt living behind the guarded gates 
of Coto de Caza was shattered Halloween night. 
</P>
<P>
 He and another Coto de Caza man were badly beaten by a mob of teen-agers while 
returning from trick-or-treating with their young sons. Moran suffered a broken 
rib, a fractured ankle and facial bruises from being pummeled by fists and 
rocks after he got out of his car to ask the scores of unruly teen-agers 
blocking the road to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that may have been a little deceptive," he concedes, "is I believed 
because I was in such a safe community that I could approach these kids because 
they were the kids of my neighbors. But obviously the little darlings didn't 
have that sentiment." 
</P>
<P>
 The separate beatings of Moran and race-car driver Rocky Moran (no relation) 
sent shock waves throughout a community that considers itself largely immune to 
the crime and violence that afflicts communities outside its guarded gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, who have vowed to prosecute the perpetrators to the fullest extent 
of the law, met this week to discuss the incident, their security and possible 
preventive measures. About half of the more than 40 high-school-age suspects 
and witnesses so far interviewed by Sheriff's Department investigators live 
outside Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though it's a closed community, it's a large community, and you're going 
to have all the problems that any community has, and keeping a fence around it 
isn't going to keep it away," says Sheriff's Department Sgt. Larry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Halloween night beatings, however, were a rarity on the police log. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones says crime statistics are not broken down specifically for Coto de Caza, 
but it retains one of the county's lowest crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've had some thefts from the general store, and they've had a fair amount 
of juvenile vandalism," Jones says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he adds, "juvenile vandalism is their main problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, youthful vandals have broken street-light bulbs, spray-painted 
buildings and signs with graffiti, knocked over golf course structures and 
driven four-wheel-drive vehicles onto the well-manicured greens. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine urban sociologist Mark Baldassare, who conducted a Times Orange 
County Poll earlier this year on Coto de Caza and five other foothill 
communities, says that in order to help keep teens out of trouble, isolated 
communities such as Coto de Caza need to find more activities to involve young 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've come up with a tremendous package of country clubs and golf courses 
and tennis courts, which mostly appeal to the adult population and leave teens 
out of the picture," he says. "The plans that are put in place are in a sense a 
sign for trouble from the teen population. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't find something worthwhile for teens to do, violence and gangs in 
today's society are what seem to be the alternative all too often." 
</P>
<P>
 What the Halloween night beatings really point out, Baldassare says, "is that 
no city or community is immune to the problems of gangs and teen violence, and 
when that occurs in one of the most affluent and prestigious communities in 
Orange County it tells us you can run, but you can't hide from the problem of 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime is so rare in Coto de Caza that the beatings thrust the local 
media spotlight onto this bucolic community known for its million-dollar 
estates, country club and miles of equestrian trails. 
</P>
<P>
 But the image of Coto de Caza as strictly an enclave of the wealthy whose 
spoiled children drive expensive cars and give no thought to the consequences 
of their actions is a gross exaggeration, many residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got the capacity for newsworthiness because you can play off this 
'trouble in paradise' theme. I don't see that," says resident Brian Gentner, 
senior counsel for Coto de Caza Ltd., the community's developer. "There are a 
lot of middle class (people) here -- like me, for instance. I don't live in one 
of those mansions." 
</P>
<P>
 Coto de Caza, which is Southern California's lowest-density master-planned 
community, does indeed boast sprawling estates selling for up to $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A secluded valley surrounded by low hills, Coto de Caza was first opened in 
the late '60s as an equestrian and hunting resort. By the late '70s, about 200 
custom homes dotted the pastoral landscape where deer drank in the stream that 
twisted along the valley floor and quail and doves perched in the 
1,000-year-old oaks and massive sycamores that dotted the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the first upscale tract houses were built in 1987, the 5,000-acre 
community of 4,000 residents has become a far more diverse mix of homes and 
income levels: The average tract house sells for about $400,000. The 
community's two condominium complexes also offer homes for as little as 
$140,000, and townhouses are available in the $200,000 to $350,000 range.  
</P>
<P>
 As the Times poll indicated, the same rural isolation that their parents 
relish is, for some teens, one of the major drawbacks to living in Coto de 
Caza. "It would be nice if there was more stuff for kids to do, but the kids 
are used to it," says Lindsay Martin, 13. "You can play out in the street. 
That's just how it is, that's how it's always been." 
</P>
<P>
 She says that some Coto de Caza young people may get in trouble because they 
are bored. "They're just looking for something to do, and a lot of times it's 
the wrong thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Vallez, 17, whose family moved to Coto de Caza from Mission Viejo five 
years ago, doesn't think Coto de Caza teens are any more bored than those 
living in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just that they have the opportunity, I think, out here to do pretty much 
what they want. There's really no law in here. They have the security guards, 
but they don't do anything," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coto Valley Country Club has seen the worst of the teen-age vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Kent Fitch leased the facilities in June, he says, "this place used to 
just get trashed every weekend and two or three times during the week." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates would be broken or bent, he says. The outdoor furniture -- and even 
paint -- was thrown into the pool. And kids would egg the buildings, which have 
been broken into and ransacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the nearby Vic Braden Tennis College where teen-agers have used the 
deck as an after-hours hangout, the pro shop has been broken into and hit with 
graffiti and the Coke machine has been kicked in and robbed. 
</P>
<P>
 But both Fitch and Braden have seen vandalism virtually cease in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 They attribute the drop to Fitch converting three tennis courts to roller 
hockey rinks and creating a roller hockey league in June. The league now 
numbers 230 boys and girls, ages 5 to 17, from Coto de Caza and the surrounding 
foothill communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The decrease in vandalism, Fitch believes, is simply a matter of changing the 
club's approach to dealing with the community's young people. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he took over the country club, he says, the response from management 
"was like, 'kids are vandalizing, let's make rules, let's get the kids out,' 
and there were signs all over: 'No kids allowed without adults.' So they kind 
of ran the kids out of everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Doing that, he believes, only antagonized them. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, I'm a kid raised in the streets in Arizona, and I understand it. It's 
like, 'You don't want us here, we'll come back at night after it's closed.' I 
said, 'Do you know what we need to do? We need to invite the kids in,' and so I 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch not only started the roller hockey league, but he welcomed kids back 
into the club by taking down the "No kids without adults" signs and adding 
adult supervision in the basketball courts, the pool and gym and fitness areas. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He also installed a video arcade and plans to initiate some type of supervised 
activity on Friday and Saturday nights for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun place to hang out," Tyler Norman, 15, says of the country club. 
Kids used to hang out at the bus stop or at the general store and some still 
do, he says, "but mostly this is the fun place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's got to be a place for them to go," agrees Lindsay Martin, a member of 
the roller hockey league. "The kids really like it. It's something for them to 
release all the tension they all have inside of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch believes a couple of things are helping in the reduction of vandalism.  
</P>
<P>
 "One thing they know if they're caught messing around here, they're kicked out 
of the (roller hockey) league." It's a private, for-profit league, "so I can 
kick anybody out I want. If they're caught vandalizing or screwing up at Vic's 
place or anywhere around the facilities they're kicked out of the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other thing is we think they're just so busy practicing they're just 
burning off a lot of energy." Instead of idle time, he says, "there's something 
to do, someplace to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Braden, who also has reactivated a junior tennis program, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that most of the energy that we saw exhibited on any vandalism is now 
going on in the roller hockey court," he says. "That's what we like to see. 
That's where it should be anyway."  
</P>
<P>
 As Fitch sees it, that's the best answer to teen-age problems in Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that they're all bad kids who live in Coto de Caza. That's not 
true," he says. "They're just kids like (anywhere else), but they don't have 
enough to do, and they've kind of been excluded from too many things, and it 
does something to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, there's a few guys that just get in trouble no matter what. But if you 
get the majority heading in the right direction, I think they can kind of push 
those guys to do the right thing, and that's what we're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he's had his share of problems with teen-agers, Braden says his 
"biggest disappointment" is not with the children, but with a few parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we've caught the children, some of the parents have almost been offended 
that we would even dream of accusing their child of something. But the majority 
of parents are still old-fashioned. If their kid gets in trouble, they want to 
know about it and want to take action." 
</P>
<P>
 Braden, a former school psychologist, believes the number of Coto de Caza 
youngsters whose parents have not set limits on their children's behavior is 
about the same as other communities.  
</P>
<P>
 Fitch agrees with Braden on the bottom line with teen-agers who get in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lack of parental guidance," he says. "I know where both my kids are 
right now, and I will always know where they are. They will check in, and they 
can't go past this (certain) time. I'm not mean, but I know where they are, and 
I care where they are."

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; FAST TRACK; THE CLASSES ARE CHALLENGING, AND 
THE TESTS ARE GRUELING AND EXPENSIVE. BUT IN THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT PROGRAM, 
STUDENTS CAN GET COLLEGE CREDIT EVEN BEFORE THEY GRADUATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSLIN GEMSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Joslin Gemsch is a senior at Capistrano 
Valley High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On high school campuses, the letters AP stand for: 1) Adventurous Pachyderms; 
2) Air-cooled Pajamas; 3) Advanced Placement. 
</P>
<P>
 While less fanciful, the correct answer is Advanced Placement, a program at 
many high schools that allows teen-agers to take college-level courses.  
</P>
<P>
 AP program courses are offered in 16 subjects, from art and music to German 
and calculus. In addition to providing challenging course work, the program 
gives students the opportunity to earn college credits. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a catch: To get the college credits, at the end of the course 
students have to pass a standardized national test given in May. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easier said than done. The test generally consists of three hours of 
multiple choice and free-response questions. It is a mind-boggling cumulative 
exam of material covered in the yearlong AP course. 
</P>
<P>
 The examination is graded on a five-point scale: 5 being the most qualified 
and equivalent to an "A" in most college courses. Students must earn a 3 to 
pass the test and get college credit. 
</P>
<P>
 The AP program has not been established at all schools, so it is not an option 
for all students. Also, at some schools, demand for AP classes is greater than 
the number of openings. When that happens, some schools require students to 
compete for spots by filling out applications disclosing GPA, previous classes 
and extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Advance Placement program," according to the College Board, "is based on 
the premise that college-level material can be taught successfully to able and 
well-prepared secondary school students." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers for AP courses are trained at special seminars, and the curriculum 
concentrates on specific concepts that will be included in the May AP exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Homework is also a bit different than in regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homework may not be due as often, but when it is, it is a major assignment," 
said Mojgan Vakili, a senior and veteran of four AP classes at Capistrano 
Valley High School in Mission Viejo. "There are not as many tests, but the 
tests are bigger, in order to prepare you for the AP test." 
</P>
<P>
 AP classes can also boost grade-point averages. Most schools award one more 
point for AP courses than regular classes. For example, an A in an AP course is 
worth five points; in a regular class it is only worth four. Letter grades are 
based on class work, not performance on the AP test. 
</P>
<P>
 By April, most students are accustomed to the rigorous AP curriculum. However, 
the month creates stress for a different reason -- money. Fees for the upcoming 
AP tests are due, and each exam costs $72. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like a lot, especially because it's around prom (time)," said Jen 
Jordan, a Capistrano senior who passed the AP chemistry test last spring. But, 
if "you really prepare for it and pass, you save money" because you don't have 
to take that course in college. 
</P>
<P>
 Test fees can really add up. Vakili says her family will pay about $580 for 
the eight AP tests that she and her brother will take this year. Students with 
financial need can get a $22 fee reduction from the College Board and a $7 fee 
waiver from their high schools. Eight states -- but California is not among 
them -- pay for some or all of the AP exam fees, regardless of student need. 
</P>
<P>
 The College Board estimates that passing one AP test can save $2,500 in 
college expenses. However, the value of AP tests varies by college. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a high school student who earns four or five points on the AP 
chemistry test can earn eight units of elective credit at UCLA. At UCI, it is 
worth four units of elective credit, and it also fulfills the Chemistry IA 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewing for the tests begins in late April. For some, that means cramming in 
earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went into a bookstore three days before the test and got whatever AP review 
book was there," recalls senior Monica Hanny. 
</P>
<P>
 Vakili discovered that cramming was too stressful. "I was studying for tests 
at stoplights. I burned out to a point that I didn't want to see the test 
questions." 
</P>

 Capistrano student Ahmad Edris found a study method that worked perfectly -- 
he earned a 5 on the U.S. history exam. "I read the chapters twice. I wrote 
summaries of the main points of each chapter and reviewed them. I prayed and 
hoped I'd pass."

 When testing begins in mid-May, about 400,000 nervous students worldwide are 
ushered into designated rooms. Schools that offer AP classes usually have a 
test center on campus. The tests, monitored by proctors, begin at 8 a.m. and 1 
p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Exams follow the same basic format, but there can be subtle differences, as 
Vakili and Edris discovered on the French test. The foreign language exams 
involve listening to tape recordings of the language. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start with the listening comprehension. Different people speak on the 
tape with different accents. There are questions, a monologue and a news clip," 
recalled Edris. 
</P>
<P>
 "You either heard the tape or you didn't," Vakili added. "If someone sneezes, 
(test givers) won't play it over." 
</P>
<P>
 Students also must record themselves speaking the foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are in a room with other people, and you can hear everyone else. You have 
to speak loudly because your recorder will sometimes pick up the background 
noise," Vakili said. 
</P>
<P>
 The AP language and composition test includes three essay questions based on 
diction, structure and style of passages printed in the test booklets. Hanny 
found this the most "challenging" test. 
</P>
<P>
 "The essays were stupid. The subject matters were way out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The AP chemistry test also discouraged some. "You have to remember all the 
formulas. There's about 4 billion of them. The first problem on the test was 
impossible," Vakili said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guessing poses a dilemma. Each incorrect answer subtracts a fraction of a 
point from your score, while unanswered questions neither add nor subtract from 
your score. To pass the exam, about 50% of the multiple choice questions must 
be correct, and the essays must be acceptable. Students are advised to guess if 
they can eliminate choices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most students are relieved, but drained, after the exam. "My brain almost 
exploded! I had the worst headache ever. I was dying," said Edris, who 
completed two AP exams on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 The stress dissipates, but the anxiety remains. Students have to wait until 
July to receive their scores. The multiple-choice portion is graded by 
computer, but essays are scored by college professors and AP teachers on a 
weekend in June. The process means test scores aren't mailed until mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was anxious to get the scores, but when I got the envelope, I was scared to 
look at it. I just took a deep breath and opened it," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans of AP courses as juniors, Vakili, Edris, Jordan and Hanny have chosen 
to relive the AP experience this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite mounds of homework, stress headaches and the pressure of the test, 
each found it to be a worthwhile venture. California Advanced Placement Test

credits while still in high school. The test is scored on a 5-point scale; a

 When a congressional candidate in Nebraska campaigned at an Omaha high school, 
students assumed they could ask whatever they wanted and get straight answers. 
They were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students working on the candidate's campaign had been given prepared 
questions to ask and were told to hold pens when they raised their hands so the 
candidate would know to call on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan backfired when a teacher and some other students found out. Those 
students also clutched pens when they raised their hands to confuse the 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he can't stand up to a roomful of 17-year-olds, how is he going to stand 
up to the U.S. Congress?" one student asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign officials said they planted the questions to prepare the candidate 
for his first debate.

RSVP / ORANGE COUNTY; SILVER: ELEMENT OF ROMANCE; ALL THAT GLITTERS IS GALA 
APPAREL AT A LE MERIDIEN BALL SALUTING CHAPMAN GENERAL HOSPITAL.

 Tradition calls for silver on a 25th anniversary and so out came silver bow 
ties, brooches and mesh bags Saturday for the Silvery Moon gala at Le 
Meridien's ballroom in Newport Beach saluting Chapman General Hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 The 400 guests attending the event -- many doctors, technicians and nurses 
from CGH -- were encouraged to don something silver at the black-tie 
event.Most, however, shunned the stunning silver fashions in season and opted 
instead for minimal touches, such as cuff links or earrings against customary 
black attire. 
</P>
<P>
 A few dared to sparkle with sterling knit or lace dresses and pantsuits. 
Others proved more stylistically daring in metallic sequins or beads. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner, revelers danced to Bill Medley of the Righteous Brothers, who 
certainly wooed the guests with his soulful voice and good humor. The mood 
couldn't have been more romantic with the glittery moons, silver stars and 
white lights decorating the room. 
</P>
<P>
 And as typical of professionals who have dedicated their lives to helping 
others, proceeds from the event will benefit the nonprofit Chapman/Orange 
Community Health Foundation, which provides health education programs to the 
community. The event netted $25,000. ROSE APODACA JONES

FILMMAKERS DOUBT GOP VICTORY WILL AFFECT WORK; MOVIES: MOST INDUSTRY INSIDERS 
SAY SUBJECT MATTER IS IMMUNE TO POLITICAL LANDSCAPE. STILL, MUCH OF HOLLYWOOD 
IS CASTING A WARY EYE TOWARD THE RISE IN CONSERVATIVES' POWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Though Hollywood and Republicans have never been comfortable bedfellows, few 
in the film business expect that the GOP landslide Tuesday will create negative 
ripples on the movie-making front. Family values and excessive violence -- on 
the streets and on the screen -- may be dominating the national debate, 
industry insiders say, but -- as the popularity of "Natural Born Killers" and 
"Pulp Fiction" point out -- politics and entertainment are two different 
realms. 
</P>
<P>
 While many in the creative community are reeling at the magnitude of the 
Republican victory, interviews with studio executives, producers and political 
analysts suggest that the impact on the movie industry may, in fact, be 
negligible.  
</P>
<P>
 "Movies are ruled by the Movie God, not by the ballot box," observed former 
Sony CEO Peter Guber, a lifelong Republican who threw his weight behind 
President Clinton in 1992. "Subject matter, casting, distribution plans won't 
be altered by alterations in the country's political landscape." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Hollywood is unlikely to undergo a sea change, few doubt that the 
messages of this year's election will eventually find their way into movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Filmmakers will be dealing with stories about illegal immigration or the way 
society is dividing into one of 'haves' and 'have-nots' -- just as they did 
with stories about AIDS and the Vietnam War," suggested TriStar Pictures 
President Marc Platt. "This morning I was pulled over for running a red light 
and a policeman asked to see my license. 'My passport, as well?' I asked -- in 
anger over the passage of Proposition 187 (which denies public services to 
undocumented immigrants). Others feel as I do. . . . and attitudes find their 
way into art." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America who formerly 
served as President Lyndon B. Johnson's press secretary, insisted that the 
industry's critical issues will not be adversely affected by the first 
Republican-controlled Congress in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Movie piracy, family values, open trade of movies and TV shows are bipartisan 
issues -- not the preserve of a particular party," he says. "Republican 
senators ranging from Oregon's Bob Packwood to North Carolina's Jesse Helms are 
big supporters of filmmaking . . . and I have a good relationship with 
(probable Senate Majority Leader) Bob Dole." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Valenti -- and his TV counterparts -- will have a new roster of committee 
leaders to deal with in their D.C. lobbying efforts. Sen. Larry Pressler 
(R-S.D.) will probably replace Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) as chair of the 
all-important Senate Commerce Committee, which, under the Democrats, was 
expected to write new Information Highway legislation in 1995. Packwood -- a 
friend of the cable industry -- will likely become head of the Senate 
communications subcommittee now chaired by Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii). 
And Rep. Jack Fields (R-Texas) is the leading contender to chair the 
influential House telecommunications subcommittee currently headed by Rep. 
Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) 
</P>
<P>
 TriStar's Platt, who calls himself a liberal Democrat, suggested that the 
business side of Hollywood may find the new terrain to its liking. "Lower 
corporate taxes and less governmental regulation will be viewed by some as good 
for any big corporation -- including entertainment conglomerates," he said. 
"The Time-Warner merger, after all, occurred in the (President) Bush era, when 
there was little antitrust enforcement. The strong are likely to become 
stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 One highly placed industry executive observed that the Republican debt to the 
Christian right could be problematic for Hollywood if the party becomes a bully 
pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most issues affecting the business are neither Republican nor Democratic," he 
said, noting that conservative Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) is one of the 
strongest advocates of protection of copyright -- the most important issue 
facing Hollywood today. "Still, censorship is one of the foundations of the 
agenda of the Christian right, to whom the Republicans are now more beholden. 
That instills fear in the hearts of artists everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Movie producer Frank Price, a registered Republican who has supported such 
Democrats as senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Edward M. Kennedy of 
Massachusetts as well as California Gov. Pete Wilson and senatorial candidate 
Michael Huffington, said that the Clinton Administration has also weighed in as 
a critic of media violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last I looked, it was (U.S. Atty. Gen.) Janet Reno coming down on the 
networks," he says. "Censorship is not particular to either party. It's just 
that liberals are OK with sex while conservatives are OK with violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, President Clinton himself attended a fund-raiser at Hollywood's 
Creative Artists Agency and challenged a high-powered media crowd to consider 
the impact of film and TV violence on impoverished youngsters who lack family 
and community support. 
</P>
<P>
 Though this fall's network programming has generated fewer complaints in that 
area than in years past, feature films are still ridden with blood and gore. 
Films such as "The Crow" scored big last summer and "Frankenstein," "Interview 
With the Vampire" and "The Professional" are being served up. Many have charged 
that the Classification and Rating Administration -- the film industry's 
controversial ratings board -- is much softer on violence than on sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the industry say that the success of two recent studio releases 
reflect the electorate's hunger for morality and decency.  
</P>
<P>
 " 'Forrest Gump' was a feel-good movie of the first order -- one that said 
that despite all the pain of 30 years of American history, life can still be 
good," said one studio executive. Others contend that it's counterproductive 
for studios to test the political waters before deciding what movies to make. 
According to the National Assn. of Theater Owners, the average consumer only 
sees six movies a year. And their entertainment choices are not always linked 
to their politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that the public doesn't speak with one voice," said Kathy 
Garmezy, executive director of the Hollywood Policy Center -- a nonprofit 
entertainment industry group. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she added, the Republicans may try to use their newfound power as a 
mandate to dredge up issues on which Hollywood has already been raked over the 
coals.  
</P>
<P>
 Producer Sean Daniel ("Tombstone") said that while Washington is unlikely to 
intercede in Hollywood affairs, the scenario is not unprecedented. "The last 
time a Republican majority swept both houses of Congress during a midterm 
election, it was 1946, and it kicked off the McCarthy era and Hollywood 
blacklisting," he said. "I'm not saying that historical conditions are the 
same, but we'll be watching carefully for any rumblings." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Optimists suggest that the current situation is no different from the 
Bush-Quayle years when Republicans occupied the White House and Democrats 
controlled Capitol Hill. And the election, they note, contained a smidgen of 
good news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Led by the Motion Picture Assn., voters decisively rejected radical 
right-inspired bills in Colorado and Oregon," one industry insider said. "If 
the legislation had passed, it would have permitted local authorities to impose 
their own standards of what constitutes obscenity." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, however, is far from old news as far as Hollywood is concerned. On 
Dec. 3, some of Hollywood's biggest power brokers will fork out between $50,000 
and $100,000 per couple at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser hosted 
by Steven Spielberg and his actress-wife, Kate Capshaw. Attended by the 
President and Mrs. Clinton, the event -- to be co-chaired by David Geffen, 
Jeffrey Katzenberg and supermarket magnate Ron Burkle -- will be held at the 
Spielbergs' home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question on the table," said one political analyst, "is whether this 
election will discourage Hollywood's Democrats or give them even more reason to 
fight back."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; 90 MINUTES OF SOUL-BARING, ELECTRIFYING LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>

<P>
 When you leave most rock concerts, curious fans who didn't make it in want to 
know if the show was any good. But the main question one fan had after Courtney 
Love's concert Wednesday night at the sold-out Hollywood Palladium was whether 
Love made it through all right. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitting. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Love's first Los Angeles appearance with her band, Hole, since twin 
tragedies earlier this year: the suicide of her husband, Kurt Cobain, and the 
fatal overdose of Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier stops on her first tour since the deaths generated endless tales for 
the rock 'n' roll grapevine -- stories of a fragile victim stumbling through 
songs, exposing her breasts and . . . well, you know how rock 'n' roll 
imagination works. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's just say that some fans felt that Love -- whose mercurial reputation has 
been colored over the years by drug use and erratic behavior -- might not 
survive long enough to reach Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But, yes, Love and her band did make it to the Palladium and through the 
concert -- splendidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Part rock performer, part sideshow attraction, Love is a captivating mix of 
the frightening emotional abandon of Janis Joplin with the exhilarating 
artistic daring of Patti Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cobain died, many observers predicted that Love's career was over. Even 
though her band had just released one of the year's most acclaimed albums, 
"Live Through This," the thinking was that the rock audience would see a tour 
as exploitation -- taking advantage of her late husband's notoriety and fame. 
Even if she did continue, the strain would be so great that Love could end up 
as a fragile victim. 
</P>
<P>
 But, following a surprisingly tepid set by Veruca Salt -- a highly touted new 
alternative rock group from Chicago -- Love was anything but fragile or 
tentative as she took the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in her trademark baby-doll dress and white stockings, Love attacked 
the music with a cocksure, liberating attitude that electrified the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Planting her left foot defiantly on a stage monitor much of the time, she went 
through songs, from the old "Teenage Whore" through "Violet" and "Miss World," 
that are filled with dark, sobering reflections on obsession and betrayal and 
that have decidedly unhappy endings. 
</P>
<P>
 There is reason for her confidence. Hole -- Eric Erlandson on guitar, Patty 
Schemel on drums and Melissa Auf der Maur on bass -- is a splendid band, able 
to convey equally the explosiveness and vulnerability of the music. 
</P>
<P>
 As Love sometimes sang with primal force, both she and the crowd seemed wound 
so tight emotionally that you felt the raw punk electricity of old Sex Pistols 
or Clash shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The most gripping moment was in "Doll Parts," a song from the album that was 
written before Cobain's death, but seems to summarize the burdens associated 
with her since then. 
</P>
<P>
 The key phrase was mesmerizing as she repeated it six, eight, 10 times, each 
with a slightly different coloring, "Someday . . . you will ache like I ache." 
</P>
<P>
 When she returned for the encore, dressed only in a black slip, it was time to 
celebrate, and she brought her and Cobain's 2-year-old daughter, Frances, with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if I'm exploiting my child," she said in a cocky but 
good-natured way. "It's the only successful thing that I've done in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 She later capped the show by trying to establish a bond with the audience the 
same way many male performers, including Cobain, have done over the years: She 
dove headfirst into the crowd pressed against the front of the stage. 
Inevitably, Love's slip was pulled down as she was held aloft by the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Security guards brought her a towel to cover up with as they helped her back 
on stage, but neither she nor the crowd acted as if it were that big a deal. 
After you've seen Love bare her soul for 90 minutes, breasts don't seem all 
that shocking.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: FRANKLY, 'SCARLETT,' I HAD A BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I have a tendency to overdo things," Scarlett O'Hara reflects after forking 
over the coins to finance a band of Irish revolutionaries in CBS' four-part 
sequel to "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 That and resourcefulness are about the only traits linking the heroic, 
generous, business-shrewd new Scarlett (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer) to her petty, 
frivolous, self-obsessed, fiddle-dee-deeing twit of a predecessor, memorably 
played by Vivien Leigh in the famed 1939 movie that earned Oscars galore and a 
reputation as arguably the big screen's best historical soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the only way to enjoy "Scarlett" for what it is -- tremorously 
mounted fun and fluff based on a popular novel by Alexandra Ripley -- is to 
mentally sever it from the original story and think of it as unrelated, lovable 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly eight hours of illogically intersecting each other's lives in the 
unlikeliest places, Scarlett and Rhett Butler (Timothy Dalton) ultimately 
settle into a monotonous humdrum more reminiscent of Ozzie and Harriet than the 
ill-suited tumultuous lovers created by novelist Margaret Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to that, though, the earth shakes beneath these characters. 
</P>
<P>
 When we last checked in on these kids in the waning moments of "Gone With the 
Wind," Rhett frankly didn't give a damn and Scarlett was dearly counting on 
tomorrow being another day. Is it ever. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath depicted by the sequel, Scarlett and Rhett remain a bitterly 
estranged married couple, but she has acquired a halo and he a courtly Southern 
accent that he uses to charm local belles and soothe the dying Mammy (Esther 
Rolle). Tara, the graceful O'Hara estate, is now pretty much a fixer-upper. And 
after burying his beloved-but-boring Melanie, the grieving, liquored-up new 
Ashley Wilkes (Stephen Collins) is making a smashing comeback (with Scarlett's 
cash) as an Atlanta real estate baron specializing in affordable, split-level 
antebellums. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid shocking displays of integrity, the new Scarlett continues to chase after 
her cynical husband, who continues to resist, mistakenly believing she's still 
the infantile schemer who sank her claws into Clark Gable. "She's heartless, 
she's selfish," Rhett says. "She's like a child who cries for a toy and breaks 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 His cigar-smoking friend, Sally (Jean Smart), suggests that Scarlett could 
change. "When pigs can fly," Rhett retorts, sourly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Set during the Civil War and the ashen chaos that immediately followed it, 
"Gone With the Wind" had a sweeping, panoramic backdrop that resonated the 
fortissimo of symphonic melodrama. The sequel has no such backdrop. What it 
does have, though, is a world-class hellion with a golden heart in British 
Whalley-Kilmer's formidable Scarlett, a plucky, sexy, man-conquering nymph who 
could torch Atlanta herself with a single laser beam of her blazing black eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the war an asterisk in the mid-1870s, "Scarlett" creates its own 
thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Episode 1 is an Architectural Digest tour of Atlanta, Savannah and 
Charleston. But in a brief encounter near the end of the first two hours, Rhett 
and Scarlett have a stormy boating adventure that sweeps them toward Episode 2 
on a sea of soapsuds, ultimately carrying him toward a divorce lawyer and a new 
wife (Annabeth Gish) and her all the way to Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 It's here, amid the history-encrusted, spectacularly filmed lushness of 
Ireland's County Meath, that Scarlett and this William Hanley-written, John 
Erman-directed story reach their exquisitely overwrought potential. Television 
needs more just like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking to Ireland and her freshly acquired Ballyhara estate the way Leigh's 
Scarlett did to Tara, Whalley-Kilmer's Scarlett explores her O'Hara roots with 
a saucy vigor, shedding her decadence and spreading her philanthropy while 
moving with ease among the local potatoheads and such anti-British plotters as 
her cousin Colum (Colm Meaney). 
</P>
<P>
 Things really energize with the emergence of the twisted, demonic, monstrously 
vile Richard, Earl of Fenton (Sean Bean). Later, of course, come the murder, 
the rape, the second murder, the trial, the missing witness and the gallows 
that threaten to tragically put a noose on the off-again, on-again love epic of 
Rhett and Scarlett. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure. When pigs can fly. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Scarlett" airs Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 9 p.m. on CBS 
(Channels 2 and 8).

MOVIE REVIEW; 'VAMPIRE': UNDEAD ON ARRIVAL; TOM CRUISE AND BRAD PITT TRY TO 
INFUSE THE CHARACTERS OF ANNE RICE'S BESTSELLER WITH THE AGE-WITHIN-BEAUTY 
QUALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Interview With the Vampire" is half alive, which for a movie about the undead 
is not as bad as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by "The Crying Game's" Neil Jordan from the brooding, sweepingly 
popular book about how "the dark gift" of eternal life is passed on from the 
vampire Lestat to a handsome young aristocrat named Louis, "Interview" has been 
the subject of considerable speculation because of the divergent public 
positions author Anne Rice has taken about the film version. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice broke with protocol more than a year ago to lambaste the selection of Tom 
Cruise as Lestat and Brad Pitt as Louis, scathingly comparing it to "casting 
Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer" and reserving special scorn for Cruise, "who is no 
more my Vampire Lestat than Edward G. Robinson is Rhett Butler." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, about a month ago, Rice appeared to reverse herself, saying the finished 
product "surpassed my maddest expectations" and stunned her with how faithful 
it was "to the spirit, the content and the ambience of the novel." Now that the 
film is here, these seemingly contradictory positions turn out to be both 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
 For director Jordan, whose elegantly gory 1984 version of Angela Carter's "The 
Company of Wolves" can be seen as a dress rehearsal for "Interview," has a feel 
for the supernatural and a gift for establishing creepy mood and atmosphere 
that this film fully exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever else it lacks, "Interview" does a gorgeous job of re-creating not 
only 18th-Century New Orleans and 19th-Century Paris but also the book's 
genuinely weird, disturbing, almost unimaginable world of those who can never 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 Put together by a superior team, including Oscar-winning "A River Runs Through 
It" cinematographer Philippe Rousselot (who lit the film with Chinese paper 
lanterns), "The Age of Innocence" production designer Dante Ferretti and 
"Orlando" costume designer Sandy Powell, "Interview's" visual strength does all 
that can be done to convincingly set the stage for drama. That element, 
however, almost never arrives because "Interview With the Vampire" is fatally 
anemic in terms of emotional weight and attachment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the book was originally written out of Rice's agony at having lost a 
young daughter and consequently has a powerful air of despairing melancholy 
about it, the movie version (with a script credited to Rice alone, although 
Jordan is known to have contributed) has little sense of love or loss for an 
audience to connect with. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is the casting, where the filmmakers made a pact with the devil and 
have paid the price. After Daniel Day-Lewis, who would have made a memorable 
Lestat, turned the role down, it went to Tom Cruise, he of the $2-billion and 
counting worldwide gross, while Louis' part went to the equally photogenic 
Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? Jordan and company insisted as the outrage mounted. The vampires 
were young and handsome and the actors playing them should be likewise. The 
dramatic reality, however, is subtler than that. What makes Lestat and Louis 
such involving characters is that they have ancient minds and souls in their 
lithe bodies, and neither Pitt nor Cruise has the persona or the acting range 
to convey that critical age-within-beauty quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitt has an easier time of it with Louis, the young Louisiana plantation owner 
turned vampire with a conscience who despairs at having to take human life to 
live. As he tells his story in today's San Francisco to a young journalist 
(Christian Slater, who replaced River Phoenix), Louis remembers back to 
Louisiana in 1791, when he was a 24-year-old widower who longed to be gone 
himself because of his wife's recent death. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of expiring, Louis is turned into one of the brotherhood of darkness 
by the sinister Lestat, the cold and hateful vampire's vampire who kills for 
revenge against life and whom the book describes as "masterfully clever and 
utterly vicious." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he works his hardest at the part and doesn't embarrass himself, even 
with the help of Stan Winston's vampire makeup Tom Cruise is plainly miscast as 
Lestat. He is determined and has his moments, but it is simply too much of a 
stretch even from his Oscar-nominated role in "Born on the Fourth of July" to 
play a hateful 18th-Century French fop with the fey habit of bringing his 
handkerchief to his mouth. And with Lestat softened, the fury Louis and 
Claudia, the 5-year-old turned into a vampire by Lestat's whim, come to feel 
toward him makes less emotional sense. 
</P>
<P>
 While the movie eliminates several of the book's characters, it wouldn't dare 
do without Claudia and Armand, a Parisian vampire met during the next century 
when Louis goes abroad on a kind of fact-finding mission. Both 12-year-old 
Kirsten Dunst and the magnetic Antonio Banderas bring the kind of delicately 
eroticized menace to their parts that Cruise and Pitt ought to be conveying but 
can't manage, and "Interview" is better for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hollywood will never lose its lust to turn bestsellers into film, 
"Interview" demonstrates why they can be tricky. Some things are better 
imagined than seen, and while it's one thing to read "the blood flowed like 
water," it is quite another to actually sit through as much bloodletting (much 
of it inflicted on women) as the film puts on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Another place where actually seeing things changes the emphasis is in 
"Interview's" homoerotic qualities. Although the men mad about men subtext is 
in Rice's book (where Louis mourns his brother, not his wife), scenes like a 
frenzied Cruise passionately burying his head in Pitt's neck give parts of this 
film as much male-male sexual energy as Hollywood has ever allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 But for every part of "Interview" that is effective, there are others that are 
not; witness the gimmicky ending and the campy humor that sporadically comes 
out of nowhere. Like the vampires themselves, the film occupies a kind of 
nether world, sporadically coming alive just when you think it has gone away 
for good. Perhaps that is appropriate, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for vampire violence and gore, and for sexuality. Times 
guidelines: It includes considerable shedding of blood, a body chopped in half, 
other bodies consumed by fire and a general air of decadence. 'Interview With

 Here Comes the Judge: Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, who has roundly 
criticized the media for its coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder case, is about 
to hop into the spotlight himself. Ito, who is presiding over the Simpson 
trial, will be interviewed by KCBS Channel 2 Action News anchor Tritia Toyota 
in a six-part series, "Lance Ito: Face to Face," beginning Sunday at 11 p.m. 
and running all week on the same news hour. KCBS said Ito will talk about his 
life, jury selection and the public interest in the Simpson trial.

 Denying Discord: Contrary to a published report, CBS News President Eric Ober 
said that Connie Chung did not complain to CBS management about her secondary 
role to Dan Rather on the network's election-night coverage. "That is not 
true," Ober said. "We have planned all along that Dan would be essentially the 
lead person on our special-events coverage. Would Connie like to do more (on 
the CBS evening newscast)? I'm sure that she would, and we will look for 
opportunities for her such as (Chung's recent trip to the Middle East)." 
Rather, however, is expected to do the bulk of future foreign assignments and 
to lead upcoming special-events live coverage. MOVIES

 Restraining Order: Beverly Hills optician Cheryl Shuman has obtained a 
temporary restraining order against actor Steven Seagal, after claiming in 
papers filed in Santa Monica Superior Court that one of Seagal's bodyguards 
"attacked" her in the parking garage of her residence last week after Shuman 
told a television reporter that she had seen bruises on the face of Seagal's 
estranged wife, Kelly Le Brock. (La Brock filed for divorce from the actor last 
week.) Shuman, who claims that she was the family's optician and was also 
romantically involved with Seagal for four months, alleges in the court papers 
that Seagal has repeatedly harassed and threatened her, and that she ended 
their romantic involvement, in part, because she was afraid of him. A hearing 
on the temporary order is scheduled for Nov. 28.

 More Auction News: A Toulouse-Lautrec painting of a ballet dancer adjusting 
her tights sold for $4.8 million in New York Wednesday night, the top sale in 
Christie's New York auction of Impressionist and modern art. As with last 
week's contemporary art sales, Christie's fared much better than its rival New 
York auctioneer, Sotheby's, which had a disappointing showing Tuesday night. 
However, Christie's total $37.5-million take Wednesday was still $5 million 
below the auction house's low pre-sale estimate. And although 11 lots went for 
more than $1 million, 13 of the 57 works offered went begging. And while three 
of the evening's sales -- including the Toulouse-Lautrec dancer -- garnered 
twice their high estimates, one of the night's expected stars, Claude Monet's 
1907 circular painting "Waterlilies," went for only $3.3 million, below its 
pre-sale estimate of $4 million to $6 million. QUICK TAKES

MOVIE REVIEW; 'PONTIAC MOON': SO MANY MILES FOR SYMBOLIC JOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Pontiac Moon" is one of those movies in which every action is meant to be 
symbolic. It's so symbolic -- make that Symbolic -- that it never really makes 
you care about what it's symbolizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Danson plays Washington Bellamy, an oddball high school English teacher 
who, on the eve of the 1969 Apollo moon landing, drives his 1949 Pontiac Chief 
1,776 miles -- as in 1776, the year of the Declaration of Independence -- in 
order to run the mileage up to 238,857 -- the distance between the Earth and 
the moon. He's a big believer in the "one perfect act," and he's gotten it into 
his harebrained noggin that this odyssey will turn his life around. 
</P>
<P>
 His son Andy (Ryan Todd), a moon-shot buff, is along for the trip, and there 
is lots of father-son bonding and unbonding and rebonding going on in that 
Pontiac. Washington's wife, Katherine (at least she's not named Martha), is 
played by Mary Steenburgen in a role that's perhaps too jarring for this frail 
falderal. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine is intensely phobic about leaving her home -- she hasn't set foot 
outside in seven years. But when her husband and son set off on their trek, she 
muscles up the courage to follow them. Her pursuit is comical -- her vehicle is 
one of those '60s amphibious cars that floats -- but it's also touching. Her 
fears are motivated by a past family tragedy, and only her love for her son 
keeps her from seizing up in terror. Steenburgen gives Katherine an addled 
pluckiness that makes her the movie's true hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, most of the time we're on the road with Washington and Andy, 
and their roadside encounters with rednecks and hard-scrabble law officers as 
they move through Utah and Arizona and New Mexico are enough to make similar 
scenes from "Easy Rider" seem almost egalitarian. For a movie that's so preachy 
about virtue and "perfect acts," "Pontiac Moon," directed by Peter Medak from a 
Finn Taylor and Jeffrey Brown script, goes in for some really crass common man 
caricature. Is this really the spirit of '76? 
</P>
<P>
 Danson is so intent on playing a kookie (yet wise) eccentric that he's not 
believable for a moment. He mugs and prances and tries to work up a vaudeville 
rhythm with Ryan Todd. They keep getting upstaged by the scenery: Monument 
Valley once again lights up a movie. (Shouldn't it be getting a special Oscar 
by now? Or maybe the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award?) There are some nice 
bits from Cathy Moriarty as a seen-it-all waitress, and Eric Shweig plays a 
Vietnam vet Native American with a minimum of hokum. But by the time we get to 
the inevitable desert-walk/moonwalk parallels, you may want to start your own 
trek up the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG-13, for language. It includes descriptions of a family auto 
accident and depiction of phobic behavior.

ART REVIEW; ANGIE BRAY'S WISPS OF ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angie Bray's wispy drawings, slight sculptures and nearly intangible kinetic 
devices at Sue Spaid Fine Art teeter on the precipice of insubstantiality. 
Meticulously made of egg shells, feathers, smoke, pins, lead and vellum, her 
works aspire to disappear into nothingness, like exhaled breaths on cold winter 
mornings or fond memories that vanish amid the pressures of everyday living. 
</P>
<P>
 This delicate territory is difficult to tread, like steering between the 
Scylla of invisibility and the Charybdis of insignificance. Unfortunately, 
Bray's fragile pieces are too straightforward and unambiguous to trigger the 
quivering, emotional responses they seem to be after. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist's intentionally tenuous objects too closely resemble simplified 
versions of Rebecca Horn's double-edged sculptures. Where Horn's elaborate 
pieces of kinetic theater embrace dread and malignancy as well as light-handed 
elegance, Bray's works focus exclusively on the warm, touching side of 
experience. Often overly precious, her naive art doesn't account for the 
ambivalence with which desire, at its most captivating, is always charged.

MOVIE REVIEW; POWERFUL 'BADGE': SOUTH KOREAN BITTERNESS ABOUT VIETNAM WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "White Badge," the first Korean film to receive a regular run at a major 
Westside theater, confronts American audiences with the little-known role of 
the South Koreans in the Vietnam War. Chung Ji-Young's prize-laden, 
unswervingly powerful film, from Ahn Jung-Hyo's novel, unfolds much like our 
best films on Vietnam as we watch Korean soldiers caught up in a war that 
became to them as treacherous and meaningless as it did for so many of their 
American counterparts. The tone of the film is especially bitter, for it is a 
condemnation of the South Korean government for sending 300,000 soldiers to 
Vietnam as mercenaries merely to curry favor with the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 The film opens with the 1979 assassination of dictatorial President Park Chung 
Hee. Now at last South Korea's experience in Vietnam can be discussed in print. 
A hard-drinking writer Han Kiju ("Two Cops' " Ahn Sung-Ki), a disaffected 
Vietnam vet, agrees to write an autobiographical novel for a journal, where it 
will appear in weekly installments.  
</P>
<P>
 It is an immediate sensation, but writing it swiftly becomes a nightmare 
rather than a catharsis for Han, who is contacted by his long-lost war buddy, 
Pyon Chinsoo (Lee Kyung-Young), still deeply traumatized by his war 
experiences.  
</P>
<P>
 We are soon caught up in a series of battlefield flashbacks, which culminate 
in the specific incident that explains why these two men are so haunted by 
their pasts. Moving to the present, where anti-American, anti-martial law 
sentiment, especially among students, is boiling over in the wake of Park's 
death, this extraordinary film proceeds to its devastating finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: Unrated. Times guidelines: It includes graphic battlefield 
violence and bleak, complex adult themes.

JAZZ NOTES: ROGERS LEFT HIS MARK ON WEST COAST SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shorty Rogers, a man whose shy stage demeanor and gentle fluegelhorn sound 
were in stark contrast to some of his hearty, swinging compositions, was one of 
the major figures of the West Coast jazz scene of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, who died Monday at age 70, had already achieved a degree of fame 
playing trumpet as well as composing and arranging for Woody Herman and Stan 
Kenton by the time he landed in Southern California in the early '50s from 
Massachusetts. Here, his fame soared, first as a member of Howard Rumsey's 
Lighthouse All-Stars, and then, beginning in 1954, as leader of a big band, and 
a small group known as Shorty Rogers and His Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers soon was writing film scores, including the jazz band arrangements for 
"The Wild One," starring Marlon Brando, and "The Man With the Golden Arm," 
which starred Frank Sinatra. Then in the '60s, he focused on writing for TV, 
composing scores to numerous shows. In the mid-'80s, he re-emerged as a player, 
resurrecting his Giants, and starting in 1990, he co-led a new version of the 
Lighthouse All-Stars with saxman Bud Shank. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Rogers was a solid soloist on both trumpet and flugelhorn, he will 
be best remembered as a lyrical, forward-looking composer and arranger who said 
his chief inspiration was Count Basie's late-'30s band. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those things he did for Woody, like 'Keen and Peachy,' and his pieces for 
Stan Kenton such as 'Art Pepper' and 'Maynard Ferguson' for the Innovations in 
Modern Music Orchestra are classics," said Bill Holman, considered by many to 
be the dean of West Coast composer-arrangers. "He was a very big early 
influence on me. I found out what you could do in the area of swinging 
partially from him. His main consideration was rhythm, as was mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers' work is available on numerous CDs with Herman; Kenton; Rogers' big 
band, the Giants; and the Lighthouse All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 What's in a Name?: The Elders, who play tonight and Saturday at the Club 
Brasserie, didn't name their group by chance: Each of the members -- Phil 
Wright (piano), Herman Riley (saxes), John Heard (bass) and Albert (Tootie) 
Heath (drums) -- have been professionals for close to 40 years and have played 
with such greats as Sonny Rollins, Oscar Peterson, Jimmy Smith, Nelson Riddle 
and Abbey Lincoln. And, as with most seasoned musicians, it's not the number of 
notes they play, but how they play them, that counts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to play with a feeling, with a sound, as opposed to bashing out a 
whole lot of notes," said Wright, a native New Yorker who produced four Capitol 
Records albums for Peggy Lee in the '50s.  
</P>
<P>
 The band first formed at the now-defunct Tra Fiori restaurant in Pasadena, 
where Wright worked solo, then added Heard to become a duo. Eventually Riley 
and Heath joined to form a quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Elders offer a wide and pleasing range of material, from Monk's "Off 
Minor" to the rarely heard standard "You're Blase." "And we can get funky, 
too," said Wright. "We all play the blues." Information: (310) 854-1111. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz at Segerstrom Hall: The Orange County Performing Arts Center's new jazz 
society is geared to increase enthusiasm for the art form. Members can attend 
private receptions with featured artists, such as trumpeter Roy Hargrove and 
singer Dianne Reeves, who appear tonight, as well as obtain priority ordering 
of tickets. Membership, which costs $45, also includes memorabilia such as a 
T-shirt and a pin. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's jazz schedule includes three concerts this season -- in addition 
to Hargrove and Reeves, Tito Puente played last month and Dave Brubeck appears 
in February. The center is looking to expand its lineup, and that will happen 
as more people attend, said Greg Patterson, the center's press representative. 
Puente's concert, which also featured Poncho Sanchez, was sold out. Good 
tickets for Hargrove's performance in the center's Segerstrom Hall -- priced 
from $9 to $32 -- are still available. Information: (714) 556-2121.

THEATER REVIEW; 'AMERICAN VALUES' MISSES ITS TARGETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the 1992 election campaign, the Rough Theater produced a vigorous dash 
of unbuffed political satire called "Spin." This election year, it tried again, 
with "Traditional American Values," at the Hudson BackStage.And failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Values" is scattershot where "Spin" was precise. In its tale of rampant 
corruption and hypocrisy beneath the surface of Single Valley, USA, it's 
treading territory that has been savaged much more effectively elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-director Eric Diamond threw in a couple of scenes intended to be 
purposefully shocking, including one that appears to have been inspired by the 
Bobbitt saga. But everything is so over the top that the actual shock value is 
slight. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the scenes are short, yet separated by unduly long blackouts. Any 
comic momentum -- and any political points that Diamond may be trying to make 
-- are frittered away. Perhaps, like the losers in Tuesday's election, Diamond 
should start pondering how to make a more successful comeback in 1996. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; LENGTHY 'P.O.W.' A CAUTIONARY, TOPICAL TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Theatre Rascals, a company of actors who range in age from 12 to 21, is dead 
serious about a deadly issue in its drama "P.O.W. (People Over Weapons)," a 
lengthy, cautionary tale about kids and guns, at the Richard Pryor Theatre in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanie Pleasant plays Trina, a sensitive teen-age girl who is worried about 
her older brother Bootknee (Al Garrett), a gang initiate who's begun 
drug-dealing, and about her insecure little brother Jeremy (Jamil Smith). 
</P>
<P>
 Bootknee, told by sinister gang member Train (Edwin Rideau Fauria) to prove 
himself with a killing but reluctant to do so, hides the gun in Jeremy's room. 
Tragedy results when Jeremy finds the gun and takes it to school to keep from 
being picked on by the school bully, Darren (Rashaan Nall). 
</P>
<P>
 The young lead actors, members of the Faith Acting Studios performing arts 
school -- many of whom have extensive TV credits -- are mature and appealing in 
their roles, even in the face of inappropriate laughter from a group of 
schoolchildren in Saturday's audience, either uncomfortable with, or unmoved 
by, the play's serious side. 
</P>
<P>
 What dilutes the play's heartfelt message -- what it means to be a man, what 
it means to be a family -- is its length. 
</P>
<P>
 At two hours and 20 minutes, the play needs some judicious trimming and 
editing by writer-director Deirdre Weston. An anticlimactic, expository wrap-up 
that never rings true could be dropped almost in toto. It drains the impact of 
the play's most telling scene -- Bootknee's moment of truth when he must choose 
between his two "families" -- and nearly obscures the loss of the shooting 
victim with concern over Jeremy and Bootknee's fates. 
</P>

MUSIC REVIEW; PAUL CROSSLEY SURVEYS DEBUSSY PRELUDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does it take a character to perform a character piece? 
</P>
<P>
 The question arose when British pianist Paul Crossley -- gainfully employed in 
our parts of late -- surveyed the 24 Preludes of Claude Debussy Wednesday at 
Gindi Auditorium, in a Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these Preludes, you may remember, bears a descriptive title -- 
sometimes a mood or a poetic thought, or the name of a person or place -- which 
Debussy captures with swift, Impressionistic brush strokes. Much of a 
listener's enjoyment comes from the recognition of how fitting Debussy's music 
is in evoking "Mists" or "Footprints in the Snow" or "General Lavine -- 
eccentric." 
</P>
<P>
 Crossley, on this occasion, proved a bit clerkish for the job. He used such 
large gobs of sustaining pedal (not sanctioned by the composer), blurring 
details, muddying harmonies, that it came as a relief when he let up. His 
dynamic range and coloristic palette seemed smallish, his attacks not 
sufficiently varied, his phrasing lumpish when it should have been singing. 
Certain technical passages sounded more approximated than nailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgivable faults, perhaps, had the magic been conjured. But one missed the 
Spanish swagger necessary to "La Puerta del Vino," and the arching grandeur of 
"La cathedrale engloutie" rising from the sea. Debussy's "Dead Leaves" (to be 
played "slow and melancholy") became merely Crossley's "Plants That Need 
Watering" (medium tempo). Was that "General Lavine -- eccentric" or was he just 
mildly amusing? In the pianist's hands the exquisitely dancing fairies sounded 
as if they had eaten a heavy dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossley had his successes -- "Hommage a S. Pickwick, Esq." and "Minstrels" 
both had quirkiness and edge -- but these were sporadic. Mostly, he seemed the 
wrong character for the part. TIMOTHY MANGAN

COLLABORATION GETS A WHOLE NEW MEANING; MUSIC: 'TELECONCERT' WILL 
ELECTRONICALLY LINK PERFORMERS IN SANTA MONICA, NEW YORK AND NEW MEXICO 
SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before the Internet became a household word to be feared and respected, 
multimedia artists and techno-pioneers were busy trying to connect the dots. In 
the past, such wide-eyed experimentalists have been the recipients of polite 
tolerance, if not outright sneers. No one is laughing anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive collaboration is the bottom line with Saturday night's 
"Teleconcert," a project of CalArts being presented locally at the Electronic 
Cafe International in Santa Monica at 7 p.m. Simultaneously, performers at the 
Kitchen, a New York performance space, and at Studio X in Santa Fe, N.M., will 
be linked electronically to create a real-time, tri-city concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The event's co-organizer, David Rosenboom, is dean of music at CalArts, and he 
spoke last week from his office on campus. Books, assorted electronic gadgetry 
and a grand piano were strewn about the large room, and he apologized for its 
cluttered appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the disarray can be explained by the Valencia-based school's upheaval 
in last January's earthquake, which necessitated moving operations elsewhere 
until just before the current school year began. Yet clutter appears also to be 
characteristic of Rosenboom, a gifted pianist as well as a composer, software 
creator and pedagogue with an eye on interactivity. 
</P>
<P>
 This project, Rosenboom asserted, is not really new, however advanced it may 
seem to more conventional music audiences. "Experiments with telecommunications 
in the arts go back a long way, at least into the '60s and beyond," he said, 
including the work of his pioneering CalArts colleague Morton Subotnick. "Now, 
the technology is beginning to make some of the dreams possible, but many of 
the dreams are very old." 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming performance will be the most elaborate but hardly the first 
public display of the kind of work going on at CalArts' Center for Experiments 
in Art, Information and Technology, as well as at other institutions around the 
world. Several of these events have taken place at the Electronic Cafe, with 
electronic tentacles to other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 This Saturday, Subotnick will perform part of his work-in-progress, "Angel 
Concerto." He will be stationed in Santa Monica, and the motions of his body, 
hooked up to sensors, will be transformed into signals that will then trigger 
an instrument in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenboom will be one element in a four-part loop in which his performance on 
a Yamaha Disklavier -- a digitally controlled piano -- will prompt the playing 
of another instrument in New York. There, pianist J.B. Floyd will also be 
sending back digital info that will, in turn, trigger music in Santa Monica. 
Rosenboom said, "I will use software I've created that will listen to the three 
of us playing and create responses. We'll build up to a more wild and rich 
musical experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpeter Leo Smith, another CalArts-based musician, will be in New York, 
lending his improvisational input to the mix. In addition, computer graphic 
specialist Eric Martin, also a CalArts faculty member, will narrate the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenboom is not one to shy away from the constantly evolving state of 
technology available to musicians. He speculated that "certain kinds of 
artworks could just live out there in this space. That allows for the idea of 
collective participation and contribution to a work where the thing itself 
loses its particular attachment to an individual but yet becomes an organic 
thing that evolves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the arts are the most alive when we have a healthy experimental 
community and sphere of activity going on. I'm optimistic that we're entering a 
new era of experimental thinking." 
</P>

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; HENSON, MUPPETS TAKE ON FAIRY TALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Henson, son of the late Jim Henson, was looking for new territory for 
the Muppets to conquer. They'd done TV and movies but never a production geared 
strictly to video. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So "Muppet Classic Theater" was born, the direct-to-video debut of Kermit the 
Frog, Miss Piggy and the gang. The tape, on Jim Henson Video and priced at $20, 
is just out, featuring lively Muppet spoofs of six fairy tales: 
"Rumpelstiltskin," "King Midas," "The Emperor's New Clothes," "The Elves and 
the Shoemaker," "Three Little Pigs" and "The Boy Who Cried Wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 "The nice thing about direct-to-video is that it's so new that the rules 
aren't set yet," said Henson, who heads Jim Henson Productions and is also the 
executive producer of the video. "People don't realize there's a real structure 
to a feature film -- a tight, three-act structure, making certain plot points. 
In making shows for TV, you need a sitcom quality. Saturday morning TV has its 
own rules too. But on direct-to-video, you have the freedom to virtually do 
anything you want, any kind of structure. In fact, future advances in kids' 
entertainment may come in the direct-to-video format." 
</P>
<P>
 These are elaborate productions, each featuring a new musical number, and they 
look different from the usual Muppets TV and film fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is experimental for the Muppets -- making fun of the classic fairy 
tales," Henson said. "The production has a look that makes it seem like it's 
for younger kids but the material plays a lot older. So you have something for 
the 3-year-old but hopefully something for the 14-year-old too." 
</P>
<P>
 Henson's company already is planning its next feature film, "Muppet Treasure 
Island" for Disney. Is there another video project in the works? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not set yet but we're talking about doing another Muppets tape," Henson 
replied. "We're thinking of redoing some kind of story -- something we can 
bring absurdist humor to. We're not sure of the subject matter. It could be 
anything from fairy tales to Shakespeare -- but something we can have fun 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 Satellite Update: Digital Satellite System (DSS), RCA's mini-satellite dish, 
is easily the hottest new item in consumer electronics. Priced at $700, it 
would be even hotter except for one drawback: You can't see your local TV 
stations with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that local stations won't ever be part of DSS. Explained 
Stanley E. Hubbard, president of USSB, which provides programming for DSS along 
with DirecTV: "For one thing, there are exclusive agreements between the 
networks and TV stations in each market that make it impossible for us to also 
show that programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, there are more than a thousand local stations. To send them via our 
system would require more than 1,000 channels. Obviously the system doesn't 
have that many channels." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news from DSS is that a National Football League deal was set up 
sooner than expected. On Nov. 27, for $50, DSS customers can get all the NFL 
regular-season Sunday games through DirecTV -- except for those blacked-out in 
their city. For instance, if the Raiders game is not shown on local TV, DSS 
owners in this area won't see it either. 
</P>
<P>
 Special-Interest Videos: "Silverlake Life: The View From Here" is a graphic, 
heart-wrenching documentary about two gay men in Los Angeles who are dying of 
AIDS. Their courage and humor are a revelation. Arguably the best AIDS-themed 
film ever made. From New Video, the 99-minute documentary is priced at $40; 
(800) 314-8822. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some very amusing moments in "NBA Rewind: The Funniest & Finest 
Plays," particularly the interview blunders. From CBS-Fox at $15. 
</P>
<P>
 With the holiday season just around the corner, "Learn to Make Beautiful Bows" 
is invaluable. This very well-designed instructional video is available through 
Picture Perfect Productions; (800) 395-2546. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New on Video: "City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold" (Columbia 
TriStar): In this lame sequel, the urban heroes of the original, Billy Crystal 
and Daniel Stern, go West again, this time to follow a treasure map in search 
of lost gold. Jack Palance, who won an Oscar for playing the cantankerous Curly 
in the first one, is back, but as Curly's twin -- a ludicrous touch. Very 
disappointing, with hardly any of the charm or humor of the original. Jon 
Lovitz co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black Beauty" (Warner, $25): This classic horse tale is told from the point 
of view of the horse, with a narrator voicing the horse's thoughts. Bounced 
from owner to owner, he gets treated cruelly by snooty rich folks but lovingly 
by a farmer (Sean Bean) and a cab driver (David Thewlis). Viewers older than 10 
may be totally turned off by the horse's narration (shades of Mr. Ed). But if 
you can tolerate the voice-over, this is an entertaining -- and very 
sentimental -- family adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sirens" (Miramax): At a fancy country mansion in 1930s Australia, a prim 
preacher (Hugh Grant) and his staid wife (Tara Fitzgerald) visit an 
unconventional painter (Sam Neill) who works with three racy models -- one 
played by Elle MacPherson. The fun is watching the stuffy couple loosen up in 
this sex-charged atmosphere. This modestly enjoyable comedy is better known for 
its extensive nudity rather than for its humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hudsucker Proxy" (Warner): Directed by Joel Coen and set in the late 
1950s, it's a version of one of those frantic '30s screwball comedies. The 
Capraesque hero is a naive mail-room worker (Tim Robbins) who's installed as a 
corporate president by a scheming executive (Paul Newman) in a stock 
manipulation scam. Expected to be a dunce, the mail-room worker, of course, 
makes one really shrewd move. Occasionally clever comedy but basically just 
so-so. Co-starring Jennifer Jason Leigh as a fast-talking reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brainscan" (Columbia TriStar): Brainscan is an interactive CD-ROM game that 
lets you know what it feels like to commit murder. But virtual reality gets out 
of hand when a high school horror addict (Edward Furlong) tunes into a real 
Freddy Krueger-type slasher (T. Ryder Smith). After some riveting early 
sequences, this turns into a plain old slasher flick that's saddled with an 
unsatisfying quirky ending. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Honors" (Warner): Another bad movie starring Joe Pesci, whose awful 
"Jimmy Hollywood" is also just out on video. In "With Honors," he plays a 
sharp, spunky homeless man who develops a sort of father-son relationship with 
a Harvard student (Brendan Fraser). The character is only a little less 
irritating than the grating actor he plays in "Jimmy Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" (New Line): An incoherent mess of a movie, 
starring Uma Thurman as a drifter who wanders into a desert resort where 
lesbian cowgirls revolt against a transvestite boss (John Hurt). Cameos by the 
likes of Roseanne and Sean Young don't make director Gus Van Sant's far-out 
satirical tale any more entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Big League" (Columbia TriStar): A 12-year-old boy (Luke Edwards) 
inherits the Minnesota Twins, takes over as manager and -- of course -- turns a 
bunch of losers into winners. If you're mourning the cancellation of the 
baseball season, you won't find much comfort in this predictable, corny, 
feel-good movie.

RETAILERS GAMBLE ON VIDEO WINNERS; MOVIES: WITH A PLETHORA OF HOLIDAY RELEASES

 "Jurassic Park," "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and "The Flintstones" are 
already in stores. "Speed," "Maverick" and other box-office giants are about to 
be released. With the holiday buying season coming, it's video overload time 
for consumers. But it's also overload time for retailers, who find their 
marketing pressures heightened during such a critical period. 
</P>
<P>
 Both mom-and-pop retailers and the biggest chains have their own strategies 
for deciding how to stock up on videos. 
</P>
<P>
 At Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., video-purchasing executives review every 
video submission before making a decision. "We personally go through 200 to 250 
new releases on a monthly basis," said Tom Szwak, vice president of purchasing. 
"It's an enormous amount of product to go through in a month, but we don't feel 
we do the supplier justice if we don't sit there and watch the film." 
</P>
<P>
 Szwak said that 51% of his decision is based on such raw data as box-office 
performance and how videos fared of movies with the same stars or similar 
subject matter. "Sure, we use the scan button, and there are many of what we 
call 'Man With a Gun' movies," Szwak said, "but we have to ask ourselves how 
many of these movies we can have come out within a given month, look at the 
production values of the film and pick something that is not too cheesy." 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 49% of Szwak's decision is based on his gut feeling as he 
watches the film. But problems arise when personal preferences enter into the 
picture. "The biggest pitfall of this business is being too subjective, rather 
than objective, and the worst thing is to be a critic," Szwak said, describing 
how being too subjective got him in trouble. At one point he and his staff felt 
they had too many science-fiction movies, so they ordered less. "But then the 
customer base would say, 'We want more sci-fi,' and we'd under-bought it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to remember that there is an audience, and we have to give the 
customer what they want to see," he continued. "Another dilemma we face is 
balancing the depth of a film with its breadth, and we continue to try to walk 
on that tightrope. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do have customers that walk into the store and say, 'Give me something 
different.' They want the hits as well as something different." 
</P>
<P>
 John Thrasher, vice president of video purchasing at Tower Records, said a 
number of factors influence video purchases. "How the movie did at the box 
office is a key indicator," Thrasher said. "Its 'star power' or who is in the 
film matters, plus the history of other films of that type." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is another factor: the video distributors' willingness to 
advertise and market their movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before a video hits the shelves at your local video store, it is widely 
promoted. Thrasher cites Disney's TV blitz for Tim Burton's "The Nightmare 
Before Christmas," which was released on video Sept. 27, as a prime example of 
effective promotion. "A lot of (customers) are more comfortable with a Disney 
product," Thrasher said. "The advertising really drives consumers into their 
local outlet to buy or rent the video." 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of the Oct. 28 videocassette release of Disney's "Snow White 
and the Seven Dwarfs," consumer incentives from Walt Disney Home Video included 
a promotion offering savings of up to $15 with additional purchases, a coupon 
book and a rebate offer with Pillsbury, as well as merchandising packages 
through Disney licensees and the Disney Store. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a distribution spokesman with Disney, as of Nov. 4, retailers had 
placed a record 27 million video orders for "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."  
</P>
<P>
 MCA/Universal Home Video and its promotional partners spent more than $65 
million in marketing and promotional support for "Jurassic Park." Consumer 
incentives for the movie, which was released Oct. 4, included a 
gift-with-reservation program, urging customers to "reserve a copy," mail-in 
rebate programs in conjunction with partners Kraft, General Foods, Jell-O brand 
and McDonald's, a national "Escape to Kauai" Jurassic Park Sweepstakes and 
videocassette mail-in rebate inserts. Maria LaMagra, vice president for 
publicity at MCA/Universal, would only reveal that 22 million units of 
"Jurassic Park" have been shipped as of this date.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, retailers aren't only lured to blockbusters. It is not uncommon for a 
film to fail at the box office and do well on video. "Reservoir Dogs" by 
Miramax Films drew just $1.9 million in theaters, but the videocassette sold 
more than 100,000 units. "It is well documented that films that didn't perform 
well at the box office often enjoy a second and better life on video," Szwak 
said. "People are willing to gamble a couple bucks at the video store because 
paying a sitter in order to go out to dinner and a movie can be costly." 
</P>
<P>
 "The lion's share of revenues comes more from videos rather than theatrical 
productions," Thrasher said. "Even in the beginning, when they're making the 
movie, deals are being made for its release on video."  
</P>
<P>
 At Tower, video selections are also based in part on the revenue of a 
particular store and its demographics. "There might be really small films, and 
one might be shot locally," Thrasher said. "It wouldn't be heard of around the 
rest of the country, but would do real well in the town where it was made." 
</P>
<P>
 Local suppliers go about video buying differently. Tony Yang, manager of Video 
One in Hollywood, normally buys from a distributor. Videos must be pre-ordered 
at least one month in advance of the date it is wanted. The distributor 
provides retailers the opportunity to order all videos in advance, usually four 
to six weeks before the movie is due to be released to the public. The 
distributor places the order with the manufacturer to bring in the videos, 
which usually arrive a couple days before the release date. 
</P>
<P>
 Yang comparison-shops for videos. He has found that rather than always using 
retailers, "some places like warehouses, or Price Club, have the movie for a 
better price," Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some retailers rely upon recommendations from distribution-center sales 
representatives. "Our rep knows how many videos to buy and does all the 
ordering," said James Lee, manager of Hollywood's Hollyhills Video. 
</P>
<P>
 Incentives are sometimes offered to video retailers in an attempt to encourage 
them to purchase larger quantities.  
</P>
<P>
 LaMagra said the number of "Jurassic Park" units a store ordered determined 
the kind of displays the company provided retailers. The more you order, the 
bigger the display. 
</P>
<P>
 Other kinds of incentives include gifts for the retailers. For example, for 
each five-unit pre-pack order of Spike Lee's "Crooklyn" video, MCA/Universal 
gave a "Crooklyn Funky Tunes" personal cassette player with stereo headphones 
plus the "Crooklyn" soundtrack cassette. Video buying is a complicated, highly 
competitive process and involves much more than luck to be successful. "Ten to 
12 years in this business gives you the reality check you need to make the 
right decisions," said Szwak.

ART REVIEW; 'SPIRITS': HOW BAULE SOLVE MARITAL WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Half the world's heartaches are probably caused by a universal conviction 
that, somewhere out there, our perfect lover exists. Life would be bliss if we 
could just find this imagined partner. Many folks just languish over this 
dilemma. The Baule people of Africa do something about it. All that is 
currently the subject of an enchanting small exhibition at UCLA's Fowler Museum 
of Cultural History. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Spirits as People: Figurative Sculpture of the Baule Peoples, Cote 
d'Ivoire, West Africa," the show is the brainchild of Philip Ravenhill, chief 
curator of the National Museum of African Art in Washington. The exhibition 
comes with a slender but indispensable catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 It, along with about 40 carved wooden figures, explains how the Baule confront 
the timeless problem of connubial bliss. They believe that everybody has an 
essence or soul that lives in a splendid spirit realm before birth and returns 
after death. Each individual spirit has an ideal spirit lover of the opposite 
sex dwelling in the great beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in the pedestrian precincts of reality, people get married. 
Sometimes they believe their real partner is identical with their ideal 
partner, only to be disenchanted. Others, disillusioned beforehand, make a 
sensible choice, then become doubly disenchanted. In either case, when things 
go sour, a village diviner is called in to sort it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Diviners are special people on whom powers of clairvoyance are bestowed by the 
bush spirits. These are shadows that inhabit the wild world beyond the village 
and interfere with individual lives. They are as likely to bring the curse of 
madness as the gift of insight. Both diviners and bush spirits are represented. 
Carved in traditional fashion, they are nude, with large, elaborately coiffed 
heads, slender scar-tattooed torsos and thick sturdy legs. 
</P>
<P>
 When the diviner arrives to counsel a troubled couple, he or she often 
ascribes the problem to machinations of the spirit lover. The prescription for 
cure calls for a carver to fashion a figure of the invisible rival. This done, 
the recipient sleeps separately at least one night a week lavishing attention 
on the spirit effigy. Often both husband and wife posses these votive figures. 
In one case, a carving with the poetic name "Monday's Dark Girl" was the sole 
companion of a widower for more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the diviner and bush spirit figures, most imaginary lovers are 
depicted clothed in Western garb, an inheritance of the Ivory Coast's days as a 
French colony. It makes them appear touchingly familiar to Western viewers. 
They are, not surprisingly, similar to fantasy-perfect lovers admired 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 All of them displayed here appear young. Boys tend to run to social types. 
There's a stiffly square youth in an immaculate suit, a dashing but gentle 
adventurer in khaki Bermuda shorts and bright yellow socks. The inevitable 
attraction to outlaws that Mom would hate seeps out in a couple of Elvis types 
with pompadours, black T-shirts and high-draped pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Girl figures are more enigmatic in character probably reflecting timeless 
masculine indecision between sweet-and-innocent and tough-and-sexy. There's a 
bit of each in a zaftig , sloe-eyed girl wearing a virginal blue polka-dot 
frock. The bossy matron lurking behind one Miss-Manners-correct figure would 
drive most men to bachelorhood, but there's no accounting for taste. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baule solution reflects great wisdom. It probably protects conventional 
social mores by heading off fantasies of homosexual or polygamous bent. Instead 
of agonizing about whether individual dreams of a fantasy lover are idiotic 
illusions or high ideals, it acknowledges their de facto existence. Given a 
respected place in the private realities of both partners, the figures preempt 
those awful rows that ensue when one partner catches the other thinking about 
someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Freud didn't believe in thought crime either. Neither did he hold that 
fetishism is weird or that there is anything wrong with a good, clean act of 
sublimation. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition finds the Baule taking a straight-ahead stand about the 
function of art. This work doesn't dither on about formal solutions, semiotics 
or deconstruction. It says that beauty in art is that which most closely 
resembles beauty in nature. It says the purpose of art is to solve problems.

THEATER; PLENTY OF 'ICEBERGS' BUT NO OBSTACLES; FROM HIS EARLIEST ACTING FORAYS 
TO HIS CURRENT SCR ROLE, ROBERT CURTIS-BROWN HAS BEEN A CRITICAL SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Will somebody please pinch Robert Curtis-Brown? He can't seem to get a bad 
notice, whatever the role. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last season at South Coast Repertory, a Times reviewer singled out his 
"dynamic performance" as a sharp congressional investigator in "Night and Her 
Stars." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Matrix Theatre in West Hollywood two seasons ago, "his charm and comic 
timing make the evening," another Times reviewer wrote of his inarticulate 
Everyman in "One of Those Days." 
</P>
<P>
 Four seasons ago at Hollywood's Doolittle Theatre, still another noted that 
his gay pediatrician in "The Heidi Chronicles" was "the most whole" of the 
play's chief characters." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's bringing down the house in "Green Icebergs," a fascinating new play 
on the SCR Mainstage, as a glib, facetious sports addict whose wife jilts him 
during their Italian vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read the script and thought, 'Wow! I love this character,' " the 
Yale-trained actor said in a recent interview at the Costa Mesa theater. "My 
hit on Claude was immediate." 
</P>
<P>
 What appealed to him was the character's combination of sardonic intelligence 
and emotional vulnerability and, not least, his flippant repartee. (Claude's 
take on life in Southern California? "Sun, space, lots of lane changes.") 
</P>
<P>
 "He's full of wonderful remarks," Curtis-Brown continued. "I think of them as 
'Claudisms.' But you have to remember, all that funny stuff of his comes from a 
very real insecurity." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, serious issues emerge between bright shafts of laughter throughout 
"Green Icebergs." The play as a whole treats questions of marriage, loyalty, 
love and betrayal with beguiling wit, like a Noel Coward comedy for the nasty 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many California plays are about trashing Hollywood and the shallowness of 
the movie industry," Curtis-Brown said. "It's nice that this play does not do 
that. It deals with some pretty substantive subjects." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis-Brown, 37, was not supposed to become an actor. Born and raised in the 
Philadelphia suburbs, he loved doing theater in high school and ran the drama 
club. But he went off to Yale thinking he'd become a lawyer because "that was 
the sensible thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his freshman year, however, he played the budding poet in an 
extracurricular production of "Ah! Wilderness." Even then his notices were 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 "The director thought I should be introduced to some professional people," he 
recalled. "So I auditioned for 'Equus' in New York and had five callbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 This was to play the role of the disturbed adolescent opposite Richard Burton 
as the psychiatrist.  
</P>
<P>
 "They sent me for voice lessons with a coach from the Metropolitan Opera. I 
started fantasizing: 'Do I leave Yale and move to New York to become an actor 
at 18? Or do I stay in school?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis-Brown's dilemma was solved when the director finally cut him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They decided I was too tall for Burton." 
</P>
<P>
 But by then it had dawned on him that acting might be more than a hobby. He 
switched from pre-law to theater studies and literature and on graduation was 
accepted at the Yale School of Drama. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Again, good notices changed his life -- this time at Yale Repertory as the 
male ingenue in "Mrs. Warren's Profession," one of the play's two major roles 
for young actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my third year in drama school and the first production of the season," 
Curtis-Brown said. "So right out of the gate I had this showcase, and I decided 
to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 He sent letters to a dozen agents inviting them to the show. Three wanted to 
sign him after seeing his performance. Before he finished school he not only 
had representation, he had his first professional job playing Lysander in "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Pittsburgh Public Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks after moving to New York he landed a role in "Plenty" at the New 
York Shakespeare Festival. Two days after Curtis-Brown joined the company, the 
producers announced that "Plenty" was moving to Broadway. On top of that, he 
landed his first movie, "Trading Places," playing the preppy stockbroker who 
gets Dan Aykroyd's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I had two jobs," he said. "I shot the movie during the day with Dan 
Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy and worked in the theater at night with Kate Nelligan 
and Ed Herrmann. Actors struggle so hard to distinguish themselves from the 
pack. When I look back at what came my way, I feel incredibly lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 The catch, of course, is that even a lucky start right out of the gate doesn't 
make you a household name. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of fame just floats along," said Curtis-Brown, who moved to Los 
Angeles "for the TV and movie possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Great notices, however, don't guarantee steady work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes in streaks," he said. "There was a period a year or so ago when I did 
something like 11 TV shows in 13 weeks -- 'L.A. Law,' 'Sisters,' 'Murphy 
Brown,' 'Love and War.' Then there are times when things seem to hit a brick 
wall, and you feel it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps him coming back to the theater? The intellectual challenge of the 
stage draws him, he said, and the visceral kick of live performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Movies and television are all about images. Theater is about language and 
ideas. I get a thrill from doing 'Green Icebergs.' It's so funny and so smart." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Green Icebergs," by Cecilia Fannon, continues through Nov. 20 on the 
Mainstage at South Coast Repertory, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa.

THEATER REVIEW; DIRECTION MURDERS 'MUSICAL COMEDY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The essence of good comedy, that is, classy comedy, is the dead serious 
reality with which it is performed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Bishop's "The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940," at Saddleback College's 
McKinney Theatre, is such a classy comedy. It was hilarious when first produced 
at Manhattan's Circle Repertory, a production that soon moved to Broadway. 
Bishop's sendup of all those murder-mystery comedies of the late '30s and early 
'40s is impeccably written, like a piece of music requiring fine timing and 
honest characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot is simple. Theatrical angel Elsa Von Grossenknueten is holding a 
backers' audition in her home at Chappaqua, N.Y., for a new musical. Those she 
has gathered include people involved in a prior show, during which three chorus 
girls were murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 The audition is a sham, actually an attempt to lure the killer into the open. 
The action is fast and furious, and no one turns out to be who we think they 
are. Spies lurk with incognito cops and, of course, the actual killer. 
Theatrical inside jokes abound, including slams at the locale, where in real 
life playwright Bishop lives. 
</P>
<P>
 It all goes way over the head of director Patrick J. Fennell, from the style 
of the genre to the sense of reality required to a recognition of where the 
laughs are. Fennell has a gorgeously spooky period set, designed by Walter B. 
Huntoon, excellent lighting and sound design by Kevin A. Cook and fairly 
appropriate costumes by Charles M. Castagno. But that's all he has. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the cast might look better under other direction. A few look and act 
as though they're human and have some sense: Mike Jensen, as a New York City 
cop who is in on the sham; Gary Halbert, as an Irish actor; Anne Jensen as an 
ambitious chorine; Stephen Flores as a struggling comic; Ana Santos as the 
hostess, and substitute James Gilson as the German maid. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the cast is a mess. They overact outrageously, have no restraint 
and have a juvenile sense of what comedy should be. Thomas Baba gives a 
particularly offensive impression of a mincing homosexual as one half of the 
writing team. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only rare laughs in this production. At Sunday's matinee, a voice 
from behind noted one couple leaving during the first act. "Well, there go the 
first two." About one-third of the remaining audience walked sullenly to its 
cars during intermission. 
</P>

DRIVE KEEPS JOE ELY ALL OVER THE MAP; POP MUSIC: TOUGH TO CATEGORIZE, THE 
SINGER-SONGWRITER IS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A NEW ROAD -- BUT NOT SHORTCUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Ely gave the title "Lord of the Highway" to the album he released in 1987, 
but it's a mantle he might more easily keep for himself. Since leaving his 
Lubbock, Tex., home in his teens to do the Kerouac bit, the 46-year-old 
singer-songwriter's odometer has turned over more times than the most 
road-weary Greyhound bus.  
</P>
<P>
 In Ely's world, the highway is as familiar and well-worn as the route to the 
kitchen. When you read of Lubbock's Buddy Holly having recorded in "nearby 
Clovis, New Mexico," that "nearby" covers a distance of 104 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The town's other neighbors are equally removed: Amarillo (122 miles); Vernon 
(181); Odessa (142), and the nearest big city, Dallas (348). These are long, 
flat, featureless miles, vistas Ely has described as "psychedelic" in their 
spareness. Contemplating them through a windshield has inspired more than a few 
of his songs. 
</P>
<P>
 His meager level of commercial success has kept him on the road steadily for 
nearly two decades. Ely's lightning-fired mix of rock and country music just 
came along too early, some have said. He's too country for rock fans, too rock 
for country and too damn good anyway to warrant much notice from the slick 'n' 
light music Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some folks have been rightly peeved that Ely never hit the big time while 
lesser talents are driving their big rigs down the road he blazed. Ely, 
however, isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never considered 'success' as a real gauge of anything. Just last night 
backstage at this place in Davis, I guess some musician had drawn a picture of 
this scared musician with great big eyes looking at this signpost between 
'fame' and 'obscurity.' And I thought, 'Man, what does that have to do with 
music ?' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's thinking like a businessman or a marketing engineer or something, if 
he was afraid of some crossroads like that. I love taking different roads. 
Every time I put a new record together or attempt something, it's a different 
road," Ely said. 
</P>
<P>
 True to form, he was calling from a pay phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where am I? Hell if I know," he said. "We're on Interstate 5, somewhere 
between San Francisco and Bakersfield. It's not even a city, just one of those 
complexes that only has gas stations and fast-food joints. The city of the 
future! I'm in some Nathan's, I guess descended from the Coney Island place 
that invented hot dogs. Now they have them looking just like 7-Eleven gas 
stations and stuff. Boy, this place is too clean and too well lit for me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ely played 180 cities last year, somewhat less this year due to some side 
projects. The gigs are a varied lot. 
</P>

 "In this last year I've played with Springsteen at Madison Square Garden and 
then last night in a tiny little room in Davis, Calif.," he said. "That's kind 
of been my life, jumping between all kinds of places. And the thing that keeps 
me going is the whole variety of everything, how everything changes, records 
and songs, people, places and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Among his changes of late are an all-acoustic album due in the spring and his 
work on a musical, "Chippy," a recent collaboration with some of his old West 
Texas friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Ely is no stranger to playing acoustic at shows -- his Coach House 
performance tonight will be a solo acoustic outing -- this will be the first 
time he's done without the wattage in a studio since his first recording in 
1972 with the Flatlanders, which also was the first recording experience for 
Ely's friends Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Butch Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
 Another friend from that time is visual artist and musician Terry Allen. (His 
"Youth in Asia" was exhibited at Newport Harbor Art Museum in 1993). Ely, 
Hancock, Allen and his playwright wife, Jo Harvey Allen, got together to do 
"Chippy" after Jo Harvey had come across the dust-bowl-era diaries of a West 
Texas prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting musical has been staged this year in Philadelphia at the 
American Music Theater Festival and at New York's Lincoln Center. The music, 
released on Hollywood Records, has garnered rave reviews, though the production 
on whole has been less well received. Ely doesn't expect it's headed for 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The actual reviews of the play were pretty mixed, you know," Ely said with a 
chuckle. "It's not a real popular subject, not really Broadway material, not a 
light little comedy like 'Best Little Whorehouse. . .' was. Although it is a 
musical, it was a very heavy piece, and made Chippy into a real complex 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 Doing the music was a departure from the way Ely usually approaches a song. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually I don't have subject matter sitting there in front of me and then 
write a song around it. Instead, I'll start a song because it's something 
personal, not just some outside subject or person. It's rather something that 
happens to me or something that comes into my gut and my consciousness, and 
I'll write a song about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Chippy's case, she'd died years ago and the only thing I had to go by was 
piecing together these diaries we had gotten from this lady that knew her on 
her death bed. We got to look through those, but you could tell that Chippy 
didn't really bare her soul, even in the diaries. You had to read in things 
that she was afraid to write down.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes she'd just say, 'I feel like hell -- maybe I shouldn't have done 
that,' and never state what it was that she did. There were certain things 
going on in her life that were upsetting her tremendously, but we'd have to 
guess what they were. But all of us knew the area, that part of the country, 
and we were real familiar with stories from the Depression era because all of 
our parents had told us of it."  
</P>
<P>
 As serious a work as "Chippy" turned out to be, Ely confessed, "the whole 
thing came down more as an excuse for all of us to work together than for any 
other reason. When I look at how Butch, Terry, Jimmie and I have been friends, 
I think it's amazing that we all actually found each other in such a dusty, 
desolate part of the world and have stayed friends for all these years." 
</P>
<P>
 Ely is doing a few of the "Chippy" songs in his show, adding that others don't 
work outside the context of the play, which may be toured next year as a 
musical revue. He also is doing some songs likely to be on the acoustic album. 
Though he's done recording, he has more songs in the can than will be on the 
finished product. He's now in the process of selecting which ones will make it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said the album is developing a tone, and to hear Ely describe it, it 
resembles a Cormac McCarthy novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it could be a bit like that," he said. "There seems to be a theme to 
the record where it's all real close to the border, and sometimes it jumps back 
and forth from either side. There's one song I've wanted to record for years 
that Tom Russell wrote about a chicken fight called 'Gallo del Cielo,' which 
means 'Rooster From Heaven.' A new song of mine I feel real good about is 
called 'Ranches and Rivers,' which hangs right there by the border. One is 
about stealing a rooster, and one is stealing a girl in a work camp." 
</P>
<P>
 The album will feature Ely's usual rhythm section of Davis McLarty on drums 
and Glenn Fukenaga on bass, with help from longtime associates David Grissom 
(usually with John Mellencamp these days) on acoustic guitar and Lloyd Maines 
on slide guitar. Much of the album will also feature Dutch musician Teye 
Wijenterp on flamenco guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who can't wait until spring for some new recorded Ely, he does a 
superlative version of Merle Haggard's "White Line Fever" on the just-released 
Hag tribute album, "Tulare Dust." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Haggard," Ely declared. "After my first MCA record in the mid-'70s, 
one of the first big tours I went on was in Western Europe with Merle & the 
Strangers. We played some really fun shows, and I got to know him really well. 
We'd sit up just tossing songs back and forth. That was a huge thrill for me 
because I had really loved his stuff when I was growing up. So I jumped at 
being part of this project." 
</P>
<P>
 Ely always has appreciated other writers, and, along with his own solid 
originals, his albums and shows typically feature songs by others "that I just 
have to do." Among the current writers Ely likes are Dave Alvin -- whose "Every 
Night About This Time" Ely covered on his "Love and Danger" album -- Texas 
writer Wayne Hancock and O.C. honky-tonker Chris Gaffney. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with spending two-thirds of his year on the road, Ely also holds down a 
family life -- he lives with his wife and daughter outside Austin. He has also 
recently branched into the art world, with a hometown show of computer-enhanced 
photo art titled "How to Make Jail Hot Chocolate" and a Philadelphia exhibit of 
"Chippy"-related art. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's that different from doing music, because when I write 
songs I think real visually anyway," he said. "I never let it out in public 
before last year, but for my whole life I've carried a notebook and drawn 
sketches in between the songwriting, keeping drawings of the places I'd been 
and people I'd met." 
</P>

IT'S A DANGEROUS STRETCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One advantage of being "Lord of the Highway" is that Joe Ely's road stories 
tend to be richer than others'. Here are two from the veteran Texas country 
rocker: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was onstage playing in some old bar in West Texas once, and I guess I was 
the first person to notice this: It was real dark in the club, but it was the 
middle of the afternoon, and this door opened and I saw the silhouette of this 
guy in the door with a shotgun and I watched his hand cock it -- pump it one 
time -- and come inside the club. And I just kind of backed straight backward, 
dropped my guitar, dove over my amplifier and hid there. 
</P>
<P>
 "And all the rest of the band looked at me like, 'What in the hell is he 
doin'?' They didn't notice this guy. Then one by one they saw him walking 
around the club with this gun looking for somebody, so the bass player jumped 
over. So pretty soon it was just the drummer left, looking all around like, 
'Why is everybody hiding and how long is this drum solo going to be?' and he 
never even saw the guy. The rest of us were literally hiding behind our amps. I 
guess the guy didn't see who he was looking for and left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then once we were playing in Clovis and we had a little open-air trailer 
behind the van and we were coming back home about 4 in the morning totally 
beat. And the drummer had lit a cigarette, smoked it and then thrown it out the 
window.  
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up later in the back seat, noticing there was kind of an orange glow 
on the inside of the van, and looked back to see the cigarette had gone into 
our equipment trailer, and the whole trailer was like this blazing fireball 
three feet behind the van. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pulled over and, all our stuff, we just watched every single bit of it 
burn to a crisp there on the side of the road by the middle of a cotton field." 
</P>
<P>

THEATER BEAT: 1930S COME TO LIFE IN 'COUNSELLOR-AT-LAW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before attorney George Simon takes the stage, the awe and reverence 
extended by the loyal staff, hopeful supplicants and respectful adversaries 
alike who populate his swank New York law offices herald the magnetic appeal of 
the title character in Elmer Rice's 1931 drama "Counsellor-at-Law." 
</P>
<P>
 John Rubinstein does more than justice to the build-up in Interact Theatre 
Company's gripping revival, with his performance as the charismatic but flawed 
Simon. 
</P>
<P>
 A street fighter by nature who has clawed his way to the peak of his 
profession, Simon is still haunted by his immigrant origins, and Rubinstein 
keeps all the lawyer's diverse facets -- suave manipulator, henpecked husband, 
bellowing crusader and embarrassed mother's boy -- in fascinating flux as the 
revelation of a long-buried secret threatens to destroy his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubinstein, who co-directed (along with Anita Khanzadian), situates Simon's 
increasingly desperate tight-rope act neck-deep in sterling ensemble 
performances that evoke the snappy, sophisticated mindset of the 1930s. 
Stand-outs include Jane Lanier as the gum-chewing, tough-talking receptionist, 
James Gleason as the ex-con turned "legitimate" snoop, and Marilyn McIntyre as 
Simon's devoted secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even the occasional overwritten characters -- Simon's relentlessly selfish 
socialite wife (Leslie Hicks) or the fiery young socialist (Josh Adell) -- are 
redeemed by finely tuned portrayals. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with Rice's always sharp, revelatory dialogue (a far cry from the 
platitudes that pass for conversation today), and an involving story with 
unexpected turns, the Interact cast brings to life an era in which survival 
went hand in hand with moral ambiguity -- a reminder that however congruent law 
and morality may be in their ultimate objectives, they sometimes travel very 
different paths. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Counsellor-at-Law," Interact Theatre, 11855 Hart St., North Hollywood. 
Fridays, Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends Dec. 18. $12-$15. (213) 
660-TKTS. Running time: 3 hours, 10 minutes. This 'Frankenstein' Is One for the 
Ages 
</P>
<P>
 Glorious Repertory Company productions at the Odyssey target an under-served 
niche with material calculated to engage adults while remaining accessible to 
children aged 10 and up. 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe's latest foray into substantive yet wholesome territory is -- um, 
"Frankenstein." But set aside the baggage of lurid horror flicks -- this 
thoughtful original adaptation emphasizes the philosophical rather than the 
gruesome elements of Mary Shelley's tale. 
</P>
<P>
 In director Debbie Devine's vision, the story becomes an implicit meditation 
on the responsibilities a society incurs for the monsters it creates. The play 
couches a plea for human compassion in stark and commendably unsentimental 
terms, as the vengeful monster confronts his creator (Michael David Edwards), a 
social crusader ignorant of the needs of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't mistake this for children's theater -- no concessions to age are made in 
the professional-caliber performances and staging. In fact, some elements are 
downright challenging, like the characters' flashbacks that share the stage 
with their later selves or Barbara Ayers' symbolic costuming that leaves the 
underprivileged parading around in their bloomers (sometimes with distinctly 
unflattering results).  
</P>
<P>
 Particularly daring is the representation of the monster using two actors -- 
Erick Melton as the lumbering, brooding human patchwork and Alan Hendrick as 
the eloquent sensibility trapped within -- an inspired choice that poignantly 
illuminates his divided nature. Fortunately, adults confused by the staging can 
ask their kids to explain it to them. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Frankenstein," Odyssey Theatre , 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., West Los Angeles 
. This Sunday, 7 p.m.; Mondays, 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays, 2 p.m., Sundays, 1 & 4 
p.m. Ends Dec. 4. $12.50. (310) 477-2055. Running time: 1 hour, 35 minutes. 
Pragmatic 'Macbeth' at Gascon Center 
</P>
<P>
 True to the company name, Pragmatic Productions make the most of limited 
resources in a visually inventive staging of "Macbeth" at the Gascon Center 
Theatre in the atmospheric recesses of the historic Helms Bakery Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Technical director Ginger Roberts and lighting designer John Palmer have 
transformed the high-ceilinged performance space into a murky fun house dungeon 
-- an appropriate environment for the weird machinations of Shakespeare's 
creepiest drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Brick's Macbeth signals his cunning and ambition out of the starting 
gate, and cuts his determination with only token qualms in this quick-paced 
rendition; Susan Brindley-Jessop is particularly heartless and lusty as his 
Lady and partner in crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Gregg Alden Koski employs an imaginative blend of contemporary and 
classical elements, including cigarette-puffing witches and a chiding "naughty, 
naughty" gesture in his ghostly appearance as the murdered Banquo. In the mad 
dash to the finish line, nuance and scansion are sometimes casualties, but it 
still makes a bloody good evening of murder and mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Macbeth," Gascon Center Theatre, 8735 Washington Blvd., Culver City . 
Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Dark Nov. 23-27. Ends Dec. 17.

THEATER BEAT: 'STUMPY'S GANG' IS A COMIC MUTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Take a children's TV show, add an obsession with bodily fluids, Twinkies and 
Wagnerian opera and what do you get? "Stumpy's Gang: A Comic Mutation," the 
bizarre "adult comedy" at the Zephyr Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chicago troupe named White Noise takes the credit -- or blame -- for this 
often repellent one-act about Frank Bubman (Jim O'Heir), a deranged janitor at 
GenetiCo, an evil research and development firm. The child-like Bubman gets his 
kicks by rescuing deformed animals after genetics experiments and then casting 
them in a secret kiddie show he pretends is televised. His dream is to teach 
the mutants to perform sections from Wagner's "Ring" cycle. The mutants respond 
to this pressure by screaming and spitting up blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, watching "Stumpy's Gang" can be a disturbing experience -- 
kind of like "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" on a bad acid trip. Writer and co-director 
Jim Cannon takes satiric aim at the military-industrial complex -- the GenetiCo 
logo, for instance, eerily resembles a Nazi swastika -- but by the end the 
viewer may be too grossed out to care. 
</P>
<P>
 The creators deserve plaudits for special effects. The mutant puppets -- 
especially Gristle, a rotting dog -- are convincingly repulsive. Some video 
segments played over a stage monitor have been nicely done, and the buckets of 
stage blood put Quentin Tarantino to shame. Sitting in the front row is not 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Stumpy's Gang: A Comic Mutation," Zephyr Theatre, 7456 Melrose Ave., Los 
Angeles. Thursdays-Fridays, 8 p.m., Saturdays, 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., 
Sundays 7 p.m. Ends Dec. 4. Free-$15 (price determined by spinning a giant 
Twinkie). (213) 660-8587. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. 'Call Waiting' a 
Thin If Amusing Debut 
</P>
<P>
 "Call Waiting," at the Odyssey, is the first play by Dori Fram, a local 
housewife who says she has been scribbling away in private for years. The 
script still needs a lot of work, but it's a fairly promising comedy debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Fram has evidently minded the oft-stated stricture to neophyte writers 
everywhere: Write what you know. Judy Baxter (a superbly ironic Caroline Aaron, 
last seen in "The Sisters Rosensweig"), is a Westside housewife sidelined in 
bed with a painful urinary condition. She bides time by talking -- and talking, 
and talking -- with friends and family on the phone. The long-distance 
companies must love her. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the subjects: nose jobs, cats, weddings, yoga and New Age guru Marianne 
Williamson. Yet Baxter's chief preoccupation is her husband, George, whom she 
suspects is having an affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all this talking, Fram doesn't seem to have much to say. She knows how 
to write clever one-liners, but the piece as a whole lacks the sort of insight 
or perspective that could make it really involving. The viewer never figures 
out whether Fram means to ridicule or flatter women like Fram. And an attempt 
to link Baxter's suffering to the Holocaust is really a wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Call Waiting," Odyssey Theatre, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., West Los Angeles. 
Mondays-Tuesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Nov. 29. $17.50. (310) 477-2055. Running time: 1

TRUMPETER HARGROVE IS ALL BRASS, NO SASS; JAZZ: IN HIGH SCHOOL, HE SAT IN WITH 
WYNTON MARSALIS, AND HIS CAREER TOOK OFF. BUT HE LETS HIS MUSIC SPEAK FOR HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heard this one before? Young jazz trumpeter with amazing technique is 
discovered by a famous mentor. He goes on to gain international acclaim, 
recording multiple albums a year and appearing around the world with some of 
the art form's biggest names. All this before reaching the age of 25. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Wynton Marsalis story, right? No, but, on the face of it, 25-year-old 
trumpeter Roy Hargrove's rapid rise to fame is remarkably similar to Marsalis' 
some 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Hargrove's story different is his propensity for letting his music 
speak for itself, unlike his friend Marsalis, who has become a brash spokesman 
for his chosen craft, expressing opinions freely and underscoring his music 
with words, words, words. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not into analyzing the music like he is," said Hargrove in a phone call 
from his New York home earlier this week. "I don't know how much can be said 
about it. I prefer to do my talking with the horn." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have seen Hargrove perform live, as he does tonight at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, know that, in this sense, he's well spoken 
indeed. The rhythmically minded trumpeter can turn a venue as big as the 
Hollywood Bowl into a raucous revival meeting (as he did a few years back at 
the Playboy Jazz Festival), or give such staid confines as Pasadena's 
Ambassador Auditorium, where he performed earlier this year, the feel of an 
intimate, after-hours club.  
</P>
<P>
 "Music has always been at the center of my life," said Hargrove, who was born 
in Waco, Tex., and raised in Dallas. "As a kid, I listened to rhythm and blues, 
Top 40, everything there was to be heard on the radio: hip-hop, reggae, 
basically every style that I could relate to, that I liked, that I could feel . 
It wasn't until I was 15 that I began to hear about people like (jazz 
trumpeters) Clifford Brown, Fats Navarro, Lee Morgan and Freddie Hubbard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a student at Dallas' Arts Magnet High School, Hargrove initially found a 
role model in bandleader and trumpeter Maynard Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the trumpet players in school with me were trying to play high notes; 
everybody wanted to screech, that was the consensus around me. And Maynard 
Ferguson could play the highest, as far as we knew. We hadn't heard about 
people like (Duke Ellington trumpeter) Cat Anderson; we had limited information 
and hadn't heard those (Ellington) albums. So, yeah, for a while, Maynard was 
my man. But then I heard about Clifford Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Hargrove said the opportunities, and the competition, at the Arts Magnet 
school were central to his success. "Being able to go there and be around all 
that talent was very important to me. The program had so many areas of music 
available -- classical, chamber music, brass ensemble, wind ensemble, 
orchestra, small group jazz, a group for singers -- I was surrounded by so much 
I didn't know where to start." 
</P>
<P>
 It was at the arts school where Hargrove met fellow trumpeter Marsalis in 
1987, an event that kicked his career into motion. "I was 17. He came to the 
school with his group, and I sat in," he said. "That's about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Marsalis was so impressed with Hargrove's style that he asked the teen-age 
trumpeter to sit in with him later that weekend at the Caravan of Dreams 
performance space in nearby Fort Worth.  
</P>
<P>
 Thereafter, Hargrove became a regular at the Caravan, sitting in with the 
likes of trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Freddie Hubbard, pianist Herbie Hancock 
and vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson. 
</P>
<P>
 Word about the new trumpet Wunderkind spread quickly, and that same summer he 
was invited to tour Europe, where he appeared with saxophonist Frank Morgan, 
among others. He graduated from high school the following year, then spent the 
summer playing with organist Jack McDuff and saxophonist Clifford Jordan's band 
and making a guest appearance with Art Blakey's big band at the Mt. Fuji Jazz 
Festival in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hargrove moved to New York in 1990, signed with RCA/Novus, and released four 
albums in quick succession. Earlier this year, he jumped to Verve, which 
recently released his debut recording on that label, "The Roy Hargrove Quintet 
With the Tenors of Our Time." 
</P>
<P>
 The collection finds the trumpeter and his combo teaming with saxophonists, 
including Stanley Turrentine, Johnny Griffin, Joe Henderson, Branford Marsalis 
and Joshua Redman. Hargrove said that working with all these different 
musicians proved to be a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd played with all of (the saxophonists) before in Europe and various places 
like the Caravan. They all play the same instrument, but they all have a 
different style. So the rhythm section had to play differently behind each cat. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a painting, you have all these different colors to deal with on the 
canvas. But you learn a lot playing with these different styles."  
</P>
<P>
 The group concept is important to Hargrove, who, unlike many young players 
being touted by major labels, prefers to keep the spotlight on the band rather 
than on himself. His five-member ensemble features drummer Gregory Hutchinson, 
who joined in 1991, and pianist Peter Martin, saxophonist Ron Blake and bassist 
Rodney Whitaker, who all came aboard in '92. They will appear as a unit at 
OCPAC.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the Miles Davis band of the '60s or the band before that with Miles 
and (John) Coltrane," explained Hargrove. "You spend time together, travel 
around Europe and Japan and being together in different places, and it starts 
to come together. You develop a group sound as you become familiar with each 
other musically and personally." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Hargrove said he's spending time writing more music, especially 
ballads, and considering what it would take to put together a large ensemble 
("the determining factor is money"). RCA just released a collection pulled from 
previous recordings, titled "Approaching Standards," that gives good insight 
into Hargrove's lyrical, considered, often blues-washed style. And he's going 
further back into the history of jazz.

 "Sure I'm listening to Miles, Cannonball Adderley, Art Blakey, Duke Ellington, 
Clifford Brown, all those cats. But I'm definitely moving toward Louis 
Armstrong, King Oliver, Cootie Williams, Ray Nance and Lester Young. There are 
so many different players, and I don't want to draw the line. I'll always be a 
student of the music. There's always something more to learn; you never have it 
all."

RESTAURANT NOTES: DESCANSO GETS A BIT OF CHANGE IN TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Caribbean food is a runaway hit in Florida. That's why veteran restaurateurs 
Michael Franks and Robert Bell got the idea it would work in the South Bay, 
which also has plenty of sand, sun and surf.  
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, South Bay residents followed the beat of the steel drums to 
Descanso, the partners' tropical-themed restaurant in Hermosa Beach. The 
entrepreneurs, who have a great track record with Chez Melange, Fino, Misto, 
Depot -- all in the South Bay -- checked out dozens of restaurants in Florida 
before hiring chef David Slatkin from Yuca, a hot Cuban restaurant in Coral 
Gables. Unfortunately, his cooking was too exotic for the laid-back beach 
community and Slatkin is no longer around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hermosa Beach is basically a bunch of guys and girls living in the suburbs, 
and that's the sort of operation we are," Franks says. "(Slatkin's) style of 
food was too much for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Brown, who previously cooked at the partners' Mediterranean bistro 
Fino in Torrance, has recently taken over Slatkin's kitchen duties. She's 
already changed the menu at the sprawling family restaurant, adding more 
Mediterranean and Mexican items and eliminating most of the Caribbean and 
Pacific Rim dishes. She's also added a "bambino menu." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the sorts of changes we wanted to make when David was here," Franks 
says. "But it wasn't going to happen. He wanted to go in his direction, and we 
needed to go in another." 
</P>
<P>
 Slatkin could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Winner Is. . .: Chef Jean-Francois Meteigner of La Cachette, best 
tarte tatin maker in Los Angeles. At the second annual tarte-off, held Saturday 
at Lunaria in Century City, 12 local French chefs vied for the title for the 
best upside-down carmelized apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteigner, who was disqualified last year for adding a layer of chocolate to 
his caramelized apple creation, had to leave before the judging was finished. 
"I'm cooking for the mayor tonight," Meteigner explained, hurrying out the 
door. "What's his name. . . . He called me from his car phone and said he was 
having some guests for dinner." Fortunately, Meteigner was still at his nearby 
restaurant when the winner was announced. So he was back in five minutes to 
collect his prize -- a gift certificate to the Beverly Hot Springs spa. 
</P>
<P>
 Runners-up were Catherine Duchemin of Les Halles, a Venice catering company, 
and Cruz Mateo of Ma Maison Sofitel hotel. Chef Camille Crochet of Moustache 
Cafe, last year's defending champion, took his tarte and went home. He was 
disqualified for showing up an hour late. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep Pockets: Could Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg be desperate to 
raise money for their new studio? The Hollywood honchos, who also own the 
successful submarine-themed restaurant DIVE! in the Century City Shopping 
Center, are rerouting customers to the bar to wait -- and wait -- for a table. 
"They give you a beeper that they say won't work outside," says one disgusted 
diner. "Then they send you over to wait in the bar, where the drinks are not 
exactly cheap. By the time you actually get to sit down, you've already spent a 
fortune." 
</P>
<P>
 "The beepers really don't work outside," confirms DIVE!'s Karina Grotz. 
"Diners have to stay near the bar area in the nose cone of the ship. If they 
walk outside into the shopping mall, the beeper won't transmit that far." 
</P>
<P>
 Press Release of the Month: "Come to Pasion (Pass-eon), and experience Juan 
Enchanted Evening with celebrity chef, Argentine-born Juan Carlos. For 
starters, the succulent Portobello porcini mushrooms sauteed in sizzling 
garlic, white wine and balsam (sic) vinegar in a promiscuous pomodoro sauce is 
enough to make a steak lover renounce the flesh. For fish aficionados, the 
mussels provencal are a mandatory must. In praise of avocados, there's a Pasion 
original plumbed to the nines with shrimps, mussels and scallops swimming in a 
sea of rare herbs garlic. . . . Couturier dressings are laced with garlic and 
Dijon mustard, zesty and delicious. Entrees par excellence include Salmon 
Rockefeller, richly char-broiled, butlered on a bed of spinach with Hollandaise 
sauce. Chicken a la Bared is not just more cluck for your buck but a breast of 
chicken in an aurora pink sauce with white wine, shallots and garlic in an 
inspired invention of T & A -- Taste and Artistry." The new supper club is in 
Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Relocating: Pine Tree, the popular Korean restaurant in Northridge that was 
smooshed in the January quake, has moved into the former Ga Ya space on the 
corner of Reseda and Roscoe boulevards. . . . Legends of Hollywood has 
relocated to Studio City. "We were lucky," says owner Bob Marks, who took over 
the St. Moritz space on Ventura Boulevard. (St. Moritz has moved to the Toluca 
Lake Tennis Club.) "Two months after we left Hollywood, the street we were on 
sunk 9 inches." Legends offers the same deli menu at lunch, but now specializes 
in prime rib at dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy Anniversary: Dan Tana's recently celebrated its 30th anniversary. Owner 
Tana, who borrowed $5,000 to open the West Hollywood restaurant, still offers 
the chicken Florentine, lasagna and mozzarella marinara items that were on the 
opening menu in 1964. . . . Lincoln Bay Cafe in Santa Monica celebrates its 
fourth anniversary with a three-course Sunset Supper menu from 5:30 to 6:30 
p.m. Tuesday through Sunday for $15. Entrees include choice of lemon marinated 
chicken, trout, pork chop or fettuccine with spicy chicken sausage. . . .Big 
eaters can score at Vitello's in Studio City. In honor of its eighth 
anniversary, the Italian restaurant is offering an all-you-can-eat pasta dinner 
for $8. The offer is good any time during the month and includes choice of soup 
or salad.

FIRST IMPRESSION : PAPASHON'S FUSION CUISINE WORTH A DETOUR IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colorado Boulevard in Old Town Pasadena sometimes feels as if a director had 
assembled hundreds of extras and told them to stroll down the street, peering 
into shop windows, cafes and restaurants. "Make it look natural," she adds."And 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 The actors walk, linger, move on, but never wander off Colorado. It's not in 
the script. Too bad, because just around the corner is Pasadena's serious 
restaurant row, where Papashon has just joined longtime residents Yujean Kang 
and Xiomara. Ramon Papa's savvy new restaurant on North Raymond Avenue explores 
eclectic culinary territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Fusion cuisine is the buzzword in restaurant circles and it's fusion galore on 
Sean Sheridan's quirky, appealing menu. He's got elements of Chinese, Indian, 
Japanese and Thai cuisines meeting the Mediterranean head on. It's hard to know 
how to take names like "Bifteck Classic With Pomme Frit" or "Pasadena Kam Pao 
Shrimp and Ravioli" or "Crispy Fish Toast With Persimmon Dipping Sauce." Are 
these typos or is the chef pulling a Fred Eric, playing at whimsical titles the 
way Vida's chef does? 
</P>
<P>
 The comfortable room is relentlessly up to date. (The old Tra Fiori has been 
completely remodeled.) The service is swell, the desserts hard-to-resist. I'd 
say it's definitely worth walking around the corner to check it out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Papashon Restaurant, 91 N. Raymond Ave., Pasadena. (818) 792-6060. Open for 
dinner daily; for lunch Monday through Friday starting next week. All major 
credit cards accepted. Valet parking. Appetizers $5.50-$9; entrees $14-$19. S.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; PROVENCIA: WAIT UNTIL THE ENTREE 
</P>

 "Have fun, smile and relax. Remember this is your home." So reads No. 1 of the 
House Rules on the back of Provencia's bright yellow menu. Such mandatory, 
forced cheeriness pervades this young, promising West Hollywood restaurant now 
inhabiting the former Tutto Bene space. The staff all but swarms you. The air 
is thick with high hopes. Pasta of the day is said to be "created with love 
everyday." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a little much. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the crudites, huge chunks and slices of fresh vegetables in a plastic 
flowerpot. Whole stalks of celery. A quarter of a fat, 10-inch cucumber. 
Fist-sized broccoli florets. These are to be dipped in honey mustard dressing 
or an anchovy-flecked mayonnaise that, fish notwithstanding, tastes freshly 
decanted from the Best Foods jar. What to do with a huge, soft beefsteak-type 
tomato? 
</P>
<P>
 "Use your knives, cut it up," urges the waitress. "It's great." 
</P>
<P>
 It'd be more fun to throw it at something. 
</P>
<P>
 Provencia's owners have painted the dining room ceiling green, dressed the 
tables in blue and white checks, and filled almost every inch of wall and 
counter space with plates, pictures, posters, paintings, pots, pans, plants and 
all other clutter once common in old line French restaurants -- one thinks of 
Le Petit Chateau, that bastion of anachronism and expense-account lunches, in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu is small: 10 starters, 10 main courses, a couple of nightly specials, 
a handful of desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1 rule for eating here seems to be: Starters stumble, main courses 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Onion soup is unpleasantly sweet and murky with dried herbs. The Provencia 
salad, with limp, heavily marinated string beans, mushrooms and endive 
resembles something out of a can. One finely ground liver pate is all right, 
but the other, hot dog pink and studded with olives, tastes as if it were made 
by someone who'd never actually seen or eaten real French pate. 
</P>
<P>
 No Franco-American restaurant is complete without escargots, and here at 
Provencia, the little black snails are served in an upright baked potato that 
looks like a Stonehenge souvenir, swims in butter and is topped with something 
like a parsley pesto enriched with hazelnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Our waitress makes a pitch for the appetizer tarts. Puff pastry made in New 
Zealand is the secret, she says: The kind of butter used down under creates a 
different kind of puffiness. The goat cheese tart, however, is dreadful: too 
many toppings piled on and, yawn, too many herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the only fully acceptable starter I taste is a plain plate of smoked 
salmon, served traditionally with capers and chopped onion. 
</P>
<P>
 The starters are not only disheartening, one can scarcely have a conversation: 
From managers to buspersons, the staff is so overzealous, their constant 
attentions form an ongoing interruption. Our bright-eyed waiter asks, "Is 
everything fabulous?" 
</P>
<P>
 We mutter into our undevoured food. I'm tempted to start biting. 
</P>
<P>
 To our general surprise, entrees could soothe any savage beast. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaghetti Bolognese, a pasta of the day, suffers not from a surfeit of love, 
but of salt. Otherwise, every entree is unexpectedly good: meats and vegetables 
expertly grilled, portions generous but not overwhelming, prices downright 
reasonable. Risotto is not as creamy and soupy as I like it, but the rice 
cooked with chewy pancetta and compellingly bitter radicchio is nevertheless 
quite delicious. A tasty rib-eye steak is served sliced; lamb chops have a 
good, crusty exterior; inside, they're tender and juicy. Half a plump, juicy 
chicken is cooked on the rotisserie until it acquires a caramelized stickiness 
and tempting golden hue. Fresh, moist striped bass is also long on smoky, 
grilled flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a short, well-written wine list, and each bottle is just $16. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid more New Zealand puff pastry creations, creme caramel and white chocolate 
mousse, the only notable dessert is Neal's French Toast: four small 
egg-battered, cinnamon-encrusted bread slices, fried and served hot with ice 
cream and chocolate syrup, and, according to House Rule No. 2, it must be eaten 
with your fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provencia, 945 N. Fairfax Ave., West Hollywood . (213) 654-4594 . Open 
Monday-Friday for lunch, Monday-Saturday for dinner. Beer and wine served. 
Major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only $35-$60.

ORCHESTRA OFF OWN PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cash-flow problems have forced the Orange County Chamber Orchestra off its own 
program Sunday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre.Instead, only pianist William 
Wolfram and violinist Diana Halprin, the orchestra's music director, will play. 
Wolfram will play Liszt's transcription of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, and 
Halprin will play works for solo violin, the Chaconne in D minor from Bach's 
Partita No. 2 and several etudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Halprin said the organization remains financially sound, and she expects the 
full orchestra to play its remaining three concerts of the season as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert will begin at 2:30 p.m. (714) 839-6569.

MOTHER GUILTY OF KILLING CHILDREN CAN'T FIND HOME; TRANSITION: REJECTED BY 
HALFWAY HOUSES, WOMAN MUST GO BACK TO STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN MARQUEZ OWEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Laguna Niguel woman who was declared insane after she shot and killed her 
two daughters in 1991 will be sent back to a state mental hospital as early as 
next week because Orange County halfway houses have refused to accept her, a 
state official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half a dozen local board-and-care homes for court-committed mental 
health patients rejected Kristine Marie Cushing, a former Sunday school 
teacher, because of the nature of her crimes and community reaction to the 
prospect of having her housed in any neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The placement was blown out of the water because of the community outcry," 
said Thomas G. Najdowski, coordinator of the Conditional Release Program in 
Orange County. "The board-and-care facilities got gun-shy." 
</P>
<P>
 Cushing has been held at the Orange County Central Women's Jail awaiting 
placement since Orange County Superior Court Judge James A. Jackman agreed to 
the move last month. She will be sent back to Patton State Hospital, Najdowski 
said, until authorities can find a home that will accept her. Authorities are 
considering trying to move her to a home outside the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County residents first got wind of Cushing's return when authorities 
proposed transferring her to a Costa Mesa home. After neighbors, business 
owners and a local homeowners association called the facility to complain, the 
home decided against accepting her. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicity about her rejection and the neighborhood's alarm made other 
facilities equally reluctant to take her in, Najdowski said. Board-and-care 
homes are privately run, he said, and can choose who they accept or reject. 
Owners often must consider their standing in the community when making those 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Najdowski said he believed that Cushing, who was examined by three different 
groups of psychologists and psychiatrists before the move was approved, was 
ready for the change. Her attorney, Michael J. Cassidy, had argued for the 
transfer as a step toward her becoming a productive citizen instead of spending 
her life in the restrictive environment of a state mental hospital, where an 
extended stay could strip her of any ability to be self-reliant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not just a slam-dunk process -- a lot of thought went into it," 
Najdowski said. "These homes offer comprehensive treatment and supervision." 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors opposed the move as a premature step for Cushing. She was 
previously released to an outpatient program in Ventura County but was sent 
back to a state mental hospital after she began suffering delusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Glazier could not be reached for comment, but he has 
noted that one psychiatrist who evaluated Cushing for the prosecution also felt 
the move was premature. 
</P>
<P>
 Cushing was a Brownie troop leader, a Sunday school teacher and a seemingly 
devoted mother when she "snapped" in October, 1991, under the stress of a 
severe heart condition, depression and a pending divorce from her husband of 17 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare concurrence, prosecuting and defense attorneys agreed that Cushing 
was not guilty by reason of insanity of killing her daughters, ages 8 and 4. 
She was remanded to Patton State Hospital in February, 1992.

SEX-HARASSMENT SETTLEMENT BRINGS SIGHS OF RELIEF; LAWSUIT: FEMALE PLAINTIFFS, 
DEFENDERS OF NEWPORT BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT SAY AGREEMENT SIGNALS FRESH START. 
THE $1.2-MILLION PACT ENDS TURMOIL THAT TOPPLED CHIEF AND A CAPTAIN AND 
TARNISHED CITY'S IMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The women who accused the Newport Beach Police Department of sexual harassment 
and the people who defended the department as the bitter case dragged on for 
more than two years said Thursday they felt the same thing: Glad it's over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just looking forward to getting on with the next chapter of my life," 
said Margaret McInnis, 41, a former communications supervisor who will receive 
$100,000 as part of a $1.2-million out-of-court settlement announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a nice sense of relief that we don't have to get dragged through 
this anymore," echoed Capt. Jim Jacobs, a 26-year veteran of the embattled 
department who was acting chief for a year after the harassment suit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
 And City Manager Kevin J. Murphy, who was embroiled in the controversy just 
months after stepping into the job, was thrilled to realize that all he has 
left of the case is a scrapbook stuffed with newspaper clippings and the 
"chauvinist pig" award the National Organization for Women gave him during one 
of many protests at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a huge stack of bills: the city has spent $3.3 million on the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow I just don't have that sense of feeling good about it (being over). . 
. . It isn't something I'd recommend to anyone," Murphy said. "It's an obscene 
amount of money, but the time and the energy that has gone into this thing . . 
. is really amazing. It's time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the legacy of the lawsuit remains. 
</P>
<P>
 A new chief now runs the Police Department with a more laid-back, softer 
style, and every city employee will undergo a three-hour sensitivity training 
workshop annually at a cost of about $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, a city known mostly for its beaches and glitzy shopping center 
was plagued by publicity about its dirty laundry, with CBS' television 
newsmagazine, "48 Hours," making Newport Beach the centerpiece of a show on 
sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The saga began in September, 1992, when four women filed suit against the 
city, Chief Arb Campbell and Capt. Anthony Villa. They alleged that the 
department was "a hotbed of sexually offensive behavior" and complained of 
being fondled and propositioned at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven more women filed lawsuits, including a former dispatcher who charged 
that Campbell and Villa had raped her after a police party in 1981. Four police 
officers and an animal control officer were among the plaintiffs. Another eight 
female employees of the department were given cash settlements to ward off 
further legal battles; many of them remain on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the money the city has spent, about $1 million went for settlements with 
female employees. Another $400,000 was for worker's compensation claims to them 
and Campbell and Villa. The rest, some $1.9 million, went to attorneys and 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell and Villa were fired, then reinstated and forced to resign. Both have 
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I learned is when you enter the world of city politics and 
attorneys and economics, things like truth and justice -- they at best became 
abstract terms," Villa said in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm quite relieved that it's over. It's been two years of a lot of turmoil 
for a lot of people," he added. "Everybody has to get on with their lives, on 
both sides, and the Police Department has to get on with its job. And I'm 
retired." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the women involved in the lawsuit have moved out of state, hoping 
to escape rumors about the case. The latest settlement package heads off a 
trial scheduled to start in February and prevents the plaintiffs from returning 
to work at the department. 
</P>
<P>
 McInnis, a single mother of three, said Thursday she is considering going back 
to school to become a paralegal. Mary Jane Ruetz, a former records supervisor 
who spent more than two decades in police work, said she will likely head back 
to school for a degree and eventually move to Colorado to be with relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started as a $597-a-month dispatcher at age 21 and worked my way up, and 
that's not easy to do for a woman who doesn't have a degree," Ruetz said 
Thursday. "Now that's gone, and it hurts. It's real difficult to think about 
not having a career." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruetz, who will receive $360,000 -- the largest single payout -- in the 
settlement, said her only regret in regard to the case is that she didn't speak 
up sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned that probably you should say something right away instead of 
letting it fester inside of you and make yourself nuts," Ruetz said. "I think 
in the long run it's helped the department, sure. Because the two main 
instigators aren't there anymore. Things are a lot better than it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Department employees were briefed about the settlement Wednesday before 
it was made public. Though some officers groused about the size of the 
settlement, and others complained that the city was in effect conceding that 
Campbell and Villa are guilty, the overwhelming sentiment was the proverbial 
sigh of relief.

 "There are mixed feelings based on whomever you supported at the time," said 
Sgt. Trent Harris, who has been on the force 16 years. "There was more training 
done on the harassment issues, which made people more aware. But for the most 
part, people here were pretty aware anyway."

JUDGE FINDS NO WRONG IN LIMO RIDES; GOVERNMENT: HE REVIEWED CONDUCT OF TWO 
COLLEAGUES FOLLOWING REPORTS THAT ATTORNEY WHO HAS CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY 
PROVIDED THE SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Following a two-day review, Presiding Superior Court Judge James L. Smith said 
he found nothing wrong with his colleagues' free use of a limousine service 
provided by a local attorney and failure to report the travel as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Thursday that he based his conclusions on documents supplied by the 
attorney, William W. Stewart, whose law firm has long held the courthouse 
contract to provide legal defense of poor people accused of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to rationalize their behavior in all this," Smith said of fellow 
judges Myron S. Brown and Luis A. Cardenas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to nail anybody to the wall. But neither am I trying to cover 
anything up. . . . After all, they were all very close friends (of Stewart)" 
</P>
<P>
 The presiding judge began a review of the judges' conduct after it was 
disclosed that Brown, Cardenas and other Orange County public officials had 
used Stewart's limousine for travel to private dinners, fund-raisers and 
sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 15 years that Stewart has held the indigent defense contract, both 
judges have been in positions to influence the renewal or cancellation of the 
agreement, which has been valued at up to $1 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, Brown served as chairman of the county's Alternate Defense 
Committee, which makes recommendations on indigent defense policy for the 
county. The judge said that in addition to taking advantage of the limousine 
service Stewart provided, he also accepted use of Stewart's Las Vegas hotel 
suite near the end of his tenure on the committee, and did not report that as a 
gift as required by the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the FPPC, judges and other elected officials are required to 
report gifts valued at $50 or more, including limousine rides. The car cost $25 
per hour to operate, and events typically ran more than two hours, the 
limousine driver said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his review of Stewart's records, Smith said the judges typically traveled 
in the car with other passengers, and based on a prorated breakdown of 
expenses, the costs fell short of the reporting threshold. Smith also said 
Stewart indicated that the car cost $20 per hour to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was even close," Smith said in reference to the FPPC's 
annual reporting threshold. "But I know nothing about the (hotel) suite in Las 
Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 FPPC spokeswoman Linda Dougherty said the agency has never addressed the 
question of whether officials could prorate the costs of limousine expenses 
when traveling with other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, they will ask us about it," Dougherty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Brown and Cardenas have said they did not consider the limousine trips to 
be gifts since they were personal friends of Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas said he might have used the car more than once, but could only 
remember traveling to a charity event. Brown said he had used the car at least 
three times in the last three years to attend football games with Stewart at 
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

 FREE CLINICS FACE STRAIN; THEY COULD BE OVERWHELMED WITH PATIENTS IF PROP. 187 
IS ENFORCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 She is undocumented, she has six children and she is very confused. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old woman from Michoacan, Mexico, carried her 5-month-old baby and 
5-year-old son into the Lestonnac Free Clinic on Thursday to get flu medicine 
for her children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very worried," said the woman, who wanted to remain anonymous because of 
her immigration status. "I have six children -- that's a lot to be worried 
about. I can come here for help, but I'm not sure about much of anything else 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for her confusion: the passage of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Lestonnac is one of a handful of free clinics in Orange County that provide 
care to the poor and uninsured but do not receive government funding or ask 
patients for documents. Such clinics could be flooded with patients if the 
initiative to deny undocumented immigrants basic health care from public 
providers is implemented, health-care officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit filed in Sacramento on Wednesday blocked public health-care 
providers from denying undocumented immigrants care. But if Proposition 187 
survives legal challenges, centers such as Lestonnac could become undocumented 
immigrants' only lifeline to health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Forbath, a member of the board of directors of Share Our Selves, which 
also provides health care to the indigent but receives some public funding, 
said the clinic could be overwhelmed with patients if county medical clinics 
abide by the letter of the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic serves a significant Latino population but will not abide by the 
initiative, regardless of what the courts decide, Forbath said. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the clinic risks losing public funding from the state cigarette tax 
and other sources -- which amounted to about $185,000 last year. Forbath said 
the clinic hopes to receive volunteer services and donated money to make up the 
possible loss in government funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh Stallworth, the county's director of public health, said free clinics 
in the county "probably have limited capacity," but he is unsure how they will 
be affected by the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth awaits state directions on implementing the law at county clinics. 
The state may give instructions on enforcing the law after a court hearing 
Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Marie Therese Solomon, who started the Lestonnac clinic in 1979, said 
she has not seen an increase in patients since Tuesday's election and has not 
thought about whether more patients will seek services at her clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon, who has been with the Sisters of the Company of Mary for more than 50 
years, said she is concerned only about her patients' well-being and did not 
want to give an opinion of the new state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look after the poorest of the poor," Solomon said. "We don't ask them for 
papers. Neither do we intend to."  
</P>
<P>
 Her center gets money only from corporate donors and grants, as well as from 
the United Way -- not federal or state dollars, she said. About 50 doctors 
volunteer their services at Lestonnac. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Between 500 and 600 patients go to the clinic each month, Solomon said. Some 
sat in the clinic waiting room Thursday as a doctor called in patients one by 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 A Nicaraguan woman said she took three buses from her home in Fullerton, with 
three children, to get to Lestonnac. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who also asked that her name not be used because of her immigration 
status, said she cannot afford regular health care because she is uninsured. 
She and her husband obtained work permits when they applied for political 
asylum, but she was confused about how she could obtain urgent and costly 
health care without possessing a green card. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't give up our health care," the woman said. "If you're not healthy, 
you can't work." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman from Michoacan, sitting beside her, nodded as she gave her baby 
daughter a bottle of milk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Proposition 187) is terrible," she said, adding that she moved to 
California in 1986. "We can keep coming (to the clinic), but what about my 
children in school? Two of them were born in Mexico and the other four were 
born here. What will happen to them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Both women said they did not think the law's limitations on health and social 
service benefits would stop illegal immigration or force people to give up and 
go back to their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will leave if worse comes to worst," said the woman from Michoacan, with 
an uncertain smile. "But in that case, we wouldn't be leaving -- they'd be 
carrying us out in a truck."

BUDGET CUT BACKED FOR VENTURA BLVD.; PLANNING: REVERSING THEIR PREVIOUS 
POSITION, CITY OFFICIALS SUPPORT ELIMINATING 'TRIP FEES' FOR PROPERTY OWNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dramatically reversing a decade of designs for the San Fernando Valley's main 
street, Los Angeles city planners will now support a proposal to slash the 
budget to beautify Ventura Boulevard and abolish the unpopular "trip fee" on 
boulevard property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal accepted by the planners -- which must be approved by the 
city Planning Commission and the City Council -- the budget for the Ventura 
Boulevard Specific Plan would be cut in half. The trip fees -- based on the 
number of rush-hour car trips that city planners estimate each business 
generates -- would be replaced by much lower fees based on a property's square 
footage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a massive reworking" of the plan, said city planner Tom Rath. 
</P>
<P>
 Boulevard property owners have complained for years about having to pay the 
high trip fees. A city-appointed panel also has criticized the 20-year master 
plan, saying the trip fees are excessive, unfair to new property owners and 
discourage development on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 If the change is adopted, property owners who have paid trip fees since 1985 
will receive refunds for any amount they paid above what they would have owed 
under the new system, but will not receive interest on the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the planning staff has not released a new budget, Rath said it is 
proposing that it be cut to about half its current $222 million over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan provides for boulevard improvements, including street widening, 
landscaping, parking structures and shuttle buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission is scheduled to consider the staff recommendations, 
contained in a proposed plan amendment, at its meeting Dec. 8. If approved, the 
proposal will then be sent to the City Council, which probably will consider it 
within 90 days of the commission's decision, according to Rath. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brain, chairman of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan Review Board and 
an announced candidate for the City Council seat being vacated by Zev 
Yaroslavsky, characterized the staff's decision to recommend the changes as a 
major victory for his panel. Brain said the board submitted letters from every 
chamber of commerce and almost every homeowners group along the boulevard from 
Woodland Hills to Studio City, demanding that the plan be scaled back and the 
trip fees abolished. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very significant," Brain said. The Planning Department "coming out with 
this report now vindicates the direction that we've been heading toward (on the 
review board) for the last two years." The review board is made up of 20 
business and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Rath agreed, saluting the panel's contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (review board) is really the source of these major changes," he said. 
"They initiated virtually everything that we're looking at. . . . I don't think 
I have ever seen any board that has done more work than this group of people. 
They are exceptional." 
</P>
<P>
 Rath said that in addition to listening to the opinions of the review board, 
planners also took into account that the city had faced a legal challenge to 
the Specific Plan and that the city Department of Transportation favored 
changing the way the fees were calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Brain, if the new fee system is adopted, new property owners 
would pay about half of what they do now. The fees have been collected since 
1985 from developers of new commercial projects on the boulevard, but not from 
the owners of existing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, under the current plan, a landowner who built a 1,000-square-foot 
office building in Encino would be required to pay $14,100 in one-time fees. 
But under the new system, the owner would pay only $7,360. 
</P>
<P>
 The fees would be reduced even more if property owners agree to create a 
business improvement district, which would fund some of the plan's envisioned 
improvements. Such a district would spread costs to all property owners in the 
district -- not only new developers -- and over several years, not in a lump 
sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain said that his only disappointment with the proposed changes is that they 
do not discourage street widening, as the review board wanted. The board wants 
the boulevard to have a pedestrian-friendly character, which would mean 
building more sidewalks and maintaining current street widths, he said.

SEASON'S 1ST STORM HITS AREA; WEATHER: RAIN LEADS TO DOZENS OF TRAFFIC 
ACCIDENTS. SNOW CLOSES PART OF ANGELES FOREST HIGHWAY. SKIES ARE EXPECTED TO 
CLEAR TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The first major storm of the season rolled through Southern California on 
Thursday, dumping rain on the San Fernando and neighboring valleys, snow on 
mountain roads and gusts of cold air on everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters, however, said that by today the clouds will give way to mostly 
clear skies, as the storm continues to move east and dissipates. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures will continue to be cool for at least the next day or so though, 
from lows in the low 40s to highs in the low 60s, said Curtis Brack, a 
meteorologist for WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. "It 
looks like the start of the wet weather season," Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 As heavy rain led to dozens of traffic accidents at lower elevations during 
Thursday's morning commute, snow in the mountains forced the closure of a 
section of Angeles Forest Highway for about three hours between Sierra Highway 
and Mount Emma Road, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was snowing pretty heavily and the roads got real icy" at about 4,000 feet 
and higher, said CHP Officer Miguel Siordia. 
</P>
<P>
 There were several minor accidents as cars did a slip-and-slide along the 
roadway, but there were no serious injuries, Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the Grapevine in Frazier Park, those who weren't compelled to drive to 
work were happy taking in the panoramic views of mountains covered by light 
snow, frosting the peaks and running down the gullies to the 4,000-foot level. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Meyer, 26, of Frazier Park, spent part of his morning walking around the 
community atop Tejon Pass, snow crunching under his hiking boots, the area's 
wandering domestic geese honking loudly as he talked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The snow makes someplace you've seen dozens of times seem like it's someplace 
else," he said. "It's cold, but I get a kick out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, the snow on the ground was a little soggy, but got up to about a foot 
deep in some spots, just fine for making snowballs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Rotthen, 30, and her 3-year-old daughter, Sue, were outside their house on 
Frazier Mountain Park Road, throwing snowballs toward an upstairs bedroom 
window. "It's beautiful," said Rotthen. "Everything looks so clean and bright. 
The roads look dirty after a while, but the rest stays nice as long as (the 
snow) stays." 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing for a moment to take in the silence, she added: "It seems to make 
everything quieter, too." 
</P>
<P>
 On local roadways however, the going was rough. 
</P>
<P>
 Flooding in Glendale on the transition road from the westbound Ventura Freeway 
to the northbound Golden State Freeway led to slow going during the morning 
rush, as did an overturned vehicle on the southbound Hollywood Freeway. Neither 
tie-up caused any serious injuries, but both backed up traffic for miles, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The roads are a little wet, (and) not everyone slows down like they probably 
should," said Aaron Finley, who had braved the Grapevine during a commute from 
Bakersfield to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP reported there were more than 300 accidents on Los Angeles area 
freeways between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m., about 69% more than the normal level, which 
delayed some commutes by as much as 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of accidents, that's for sure," said CHP Officer Susan 
Gonzalez. "Every time it rains like this, our activity at least triples." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County was more fortunate -- rain there tapered off before daylight 
and the CHP reported that traffic was normal. "We just missed it," said an 
Oxnard CHP officer. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Orange County, it was messy. About 9 a.m. in Orange, mud cascaded down 
a steep embankment near the Santa Ana Freeway onto Chapman Avenue, closing a 
freeway on-ramp for about an hour until the mess was mopped up. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Antelope Valley, a flash of lightning shorted out the computer system 
that controls the telephones at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
station, a deputy said. "All of our regular incoming lines were down, so most 
of the calls came in on 911," said Deputy Mark Round. "They were not working 
all day." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the storm clouds had a silver lining. At Snow Summit ski resort in 
Big Bear, where raindrops turned to snowflakes, folks were rejoicing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the snow!" cried spokeswoman Bonnie Tregaskis, as the resort 
prepared to open this weekend. "We've had a couple of flakes before, but this 
is the first really good storm. It's beautiful!" 
</P>
<P>
 Snow was dropping in the San Bernardino Mountains above 6,000 feet, and six 
inches of powder was expected to accumulate by the end of the day. CHP officers 
were bracing for an influx of skiers to take advantage of the Veterans Day 
holiday today and head to resorts such as Snow Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain was an equally welcome sight at the Metropolitan Water District. 
California is under a drought watch, and while most of Southern California's 
water is drawn from the Colorado River or reservoirs in Northern California, 
some comes from ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more there is down here, it lessens the need to trade supplies with the 
north," said MWD spokesman Rob Hallwachs. "We never complain about rain."

STOLEN: ONE VOICE; MISSING KEYBOARD ALLOWED MAN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY TO 
COMMUNICATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of people have experienced losing their voice, but probably none like 
Glenn Gershan. 
</P>
<P>
 His was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Gershan -- who has cerebral palsy -- relies on a communication device to 
speak. The machine, a keyboard that helps him "speak" electronically, was taken 
Oct. 21 from the cafeteria at Valley College when he took off his backpack to 
eat lunch, said Los Angeles Police Officer Bob Mosley, who has befriended 
Gershan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need the machine for my class and for a messenger job I have applied for," 
Gershan said, using a telecommunications device for the deaf, or TDD, to type 
his responses during a recent telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say to anyone who knows me, please return it." 
</P>
<P>
 The replacement cost for the kind of machine Gershan uses, a 16-year-old 
prototype, is about $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Toppel, Gershan's mother, said the device had become like "his right arm" 
and enabled him to exert his independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is very good on this machine, but to someone else it would be a toy," she 
said. "Anyone else would think it was a computer, open it up, see it has no 
value, and probably trash it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gershan, 31, walks on his own, and although he has problems with motor control 
characteristic of the disease, he has shown abilities that doctors said he 
would never develop. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the voice machine, Gershan has always been independent, Toppel 
said. And though doctors told his mother he would never walk, he has learned to 
run, jump and drive a car and has lived on his own for the last three years, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His mental age is still that of about a 13-year-old, but he has never said 
'Poor me!' or 'Why me?' " said his father, Howard Gershan. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his voice device was stolen, Toppel said her conversations with her son 
have been reduced to his tapping once for yes, twice for no, or deciphering his 
grunts or his handwriting, which sometimes cannot be done because of his 
disability. 
</P>
<P>
 The voice machine -- a 9 1/2-by-11-inch keyboard that weighs about 4 1/2 
pounds -- allows Gershan to program and store phrases and words, spell out 
words and make new ones using a combination of 26 phonetic keys, said Rick 
Pimentel, the vice-president of Phonic Ear, the Petaluma company that 
manufactured it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gershan was one of the first people in the nation to use the device, Pimentel 
said. And he's used it to pry open a world that was closed to him before. 
</P>
<P>
 It has enabled him to use the telephone, a development that people at Phonic 
Ear said they learned about almost immediately -- when Gershan started burning 
up their toll-free service line. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has an aunt up here in the Bay Area, so he would come and visit people at 
our office," Pimentel said. "If he wasn't coming up, he was on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 He has demonstrated his expertise on the machine as a spokesman of sorts at 
conventions that Phonic Ear representatives have attended in Southern 
California, said Pimentel. 
</P>
<P>
 Gershan, by all accounts a gregarious man, also has appeared as a guest 
lecturer twice at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information 
Studies, said RaeLynne Rein, who taught the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students were overwhelmed, and they were totally moved and said so in an 
evaluation at the end of the quarter," said Rein. "It wasn't until he left the 
room that I explained to them that he went to the elementary school on the 
campus and that he did not hold a BA from here." 
</P>
<P>
 The theft of his voice machine is not the first crime to which Gershan has 
fallen victim. In the last month, thieves have twice broken into his Panorama 
City home and taken a VCR, a television and microwave oven, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Gershan's friendship with Mosley, the police officer, has become very 
important to both men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob is the most important guy to me," Gershan said. "His personality is just 
great, and when we work together, I forget he's a cop." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley, too, says he is honored to be Gershan's buddy. Mosley works as an 
off-duty security officer at the Hollywood Bowl and Greek Theatre, where 
Gershan works as a parking attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he pals around with us, no one makes fun of him," Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley said that other off-duty officers sometimes give Gershan a ride home 
when he misses his bus after late-night events. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the theft of his voice, Mosley and other off-duty officers who know 
Gershan from his work as a parking attendant have decided to pitch in to help 
defray the cost of another machine.

 "Another time, I goofed up a video camera that runs in our theater office, and

 The ease with which Gershan understands computer systems and things mechanical

<P>
 By the time they reach their 20s, most women will say they have kissed a pig 
at one time or another. But most are only talking about bad dating experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Brookhaven Elementary School Principal Paula Emry-Burtt kissed the 
real thing -- Lady Penelope. 
</P>
<P>
 Emry-Burtt promised her students early in the school year that if they raised 
$12,000 in an Oct. 21 jog-a-thon, she would kiss a pig. The students more than 
kept their end of the bargain, raising $18,000 by running an aggregate 9,600 
laps. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was Emry-Burtt's time to pay the piper. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was prickly. I kissed it sort of just above its nose. It had big jowls 
that hung down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, rain forced the school to hold two separate assemblies 
so all the students could witness the event, and the paparazzi made it 
necessary for Emry-Burtt to kiss Lady Penelope, a potbelly pig, several times. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lady P was no cute little piglet. 
</P>
<P>
 When the pledge drive started, Emry-Burtt said, PTA sponsors brought in "a 
small pig . . . just to show the kids what a pig was. Then at the jog-a-thon, 
they brought a little bigger pig," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then today, they brought Lady Penelope, a huge pig. They say she weighs 100 
pounds, but she looks like she weighs more." 
</P>
<P>
 Students were delighted with the spectacle -- yes, they squealed with laughter 
-- though they were told to hold down the noise lest they scare the pig during 
the assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just what I wanted to be known for," Emry-Burtt lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, she said, she would do it again for the cause. The PTA, which 
benefited from the jog-a-thon, uses the money for educational assemblies, 
student field trips and other education-enhancing items. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: Q & A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sherri Butterfield, Mission Viejo Library Foundation 
</P>
<P>
 Fed up with an undersized library that the community outgrew in the late 
1970s, Mission Viejo began searching for novel ways to fund a 
25,000-square-foot, $5-million library. 
</P>
<P>
 After paying $2.5 million for a site at Marguerite Parkway and La Paz Road, 
city officials began negotiating a land swap with a developer to help pay for 
library construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for a parcel of city-owned land in Mission Viejo and about $2 
million, the developer will build the library and grant the city a smaller 
piece of property next to the library site that could be used for a future City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also got the county to agree to turn over about $900,000 in annual 
tax revenues to pay for running the new library. Times correspondent Frank 
Messina recently discussed the project with Sherri Butterfield, chairwoman of 
the Mission Viejo Library Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the difference between the library services Mission Viejo receives 
now and what will be in the new library? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Right now, the library is so small, in order to add a volume, they have to 
take one off the shelves. They have between 60,000 to 80,000 books. We'd 
eventually like to have 160,000 to 180,000 books. They are open 31 hours per 
week, and frankly, it's hard to find a time when the library is open. Our first 
realistic target for the new library is 50 hours, and I'd like to see us get to 
60 hours. That will depend on money and demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What have been the biggest obstacles to building a new library? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A library isn't a fire department and it isn't a crime issue. For that 
reason, it's difficult to get people in a position of power to view this as an 
essential service. In surveys we've done, people in Mission Viejo rank library 
services in the same category as hospital, fire and police. But unfortunately, 
any time the state or county needed to cut their budget, the first place they 
looked was the library. Libraries have been the first to suffer budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will this library mean to Mission Viejo? 
</P>
<P>
 A: What this does for a community is provide a gathering place where people 
can get together for learning, knowledge and cultural enrichment. We have a 
large number of families in the city with children who need this library within 
the next six years or their children are grown and gone. That's why it's 
important for us to get this library built as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why has the library been so long in coming? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It has taken the city a while to realize that the county was not holding up 
its end of the bargain. For $900,000 in property taxes for library service 
(received from taxpayers), the county has been providing about $500,000 in 
actual delivered service. It took a while for the City Council to realize this.

 Tough Love Members Seeking Weekly Meeting Place 
</P>
<P>
 A group of 30 parents turned to Tough Love for support and hope in dealing 
with raising their troubled children. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the group faces another dilemma: the possibility of disbanding because 
it has no place to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Lutz, who founded the local group three years ago, said members are 
looking for another meeting place after losing the use of two classrooms -- one 
room for parents, the other for their children -- at Fountain Valley High 
School. Their last meeting there was Oct.26. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Diaz, a parent involved in Tough Love, said the group was put on 
probation last year by the school's principal, Gary Ernst, after a phone line 
was cut by a youngster. About two months ago, a youngster scribbled graffiti in 
a teacher's roll book, resulting in the grouplosing its meeting space, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lutz, Diaz and another parent, Ida Malloy, recently made impassioned pleas to 
the Fountain Valley School District board for a place to meet weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Ecker, the district's assistant superintendent of administration and 
business, said he will look into finding the group a place to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz said she has exhausted efforts to find another place where two rooms 
would be available at no charge or for a minimal fee. The group survives on 
parent donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopeful we'll find a place," Lutz said. "We've worked very hard in our 
community. These are parents helping parents." DEBRA CANO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; PEPPER SPRAY CLASS TAKES AIM AT FEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They crowded the back hallways of City Hall on their lunch hours Thursday, 
wrapped in raincoats, smiling sheepishly at each other and laughing at their 
latent boldness. 
</P>
<P>
 The mostly older group, about 60 strong, had come to learn how to use a kind 
of tear gas known as pepper spray, and to claim some peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two sessions of the $30 pepper spray training and certification 
courses, sponsored by the San Fernando Police Department and the local Chamber 
of Commerce, were packed, as citizens from all over the Valley came to learn 
how to use the debilitating agent -- a potent mixture of oil and cayenne pepper 
extract -- and earn laminated state permits allowing them to legally carry the 
substance, which can temporarily choke and blind an assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was evenly divided between men and women. Most who attended said 
they had either been victims of crime or felt seriously threatened on the 
streets.  
</P>
<P>
 "Three weeks ago, I was going to my office," said Edward Glover, 50, of North 
Hollywood, "when I was approached by a homeless man in a very aggressive way. I 
could tell he was going to do something to me. But I got inside and locked the 
gate before anything happened. I will feel better knowing I have something to 
use for protection."  
</P>
<P>
 After attending the training, where he was required to hit the face of a 
cardboard target at least three times using a pepper spray canister loaded with 
water, Glover vowed to send all six employees of his North Hollywood paper 
goods company to the class. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper spray became legal in California on March 1. To carry the substance -- 
which is contained in a fist-sized, pressurized canister that comes in only one 
color, bright yellow -- citizens must register with the state, undergo 
training, and score a 70% accuracy rate during target practice.  
</P>
<P>
 Trainees also received one canister of First Defense MK-6C pepper spray, the 
only brand approved by the state. Proceeds will go to the local Drug Abuse 
Resistance Education (D.A.R.E) and Police Explorer programs. 
</P>
<P>
 During the training, Jim Hein, owner of the Security Training Center in North 
Hollywood, explained that pepper spray should only be used as a last resort. 
"It's a last-ditch stand. Don't use it in search of glory."  
</P>
<P>
 A training video showed a man attempting to pick the pockets of a woman 
walking down the sidewalk. The woman turned and squirted the man in the eyes 
with her spray. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't do that," Hein warned. "It's illegal. That person is not being 
physically harmed." 
</P>
<P>
 Inappropriate use of the spray, which can cause the esophagus to constrict, 
the eyes to dilate, and the mucous membranes to swell, carries fines of up to 
$2,000 and three years in prison. It is a felony to carry the combustible 
canisters on planes or in secured airport areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Chenoweth, 58, of Tujunga, registered for the class after learning that 
his pepper spray wasn't legal in the state. "I bought mine six months ago from 
a catalogue. I'm not into guns, but I wanted something so I could feel safe. 
The way this city's gotten lately, I'm glad I came." 
</P>
<P>
 Helga Redondo, 30, of San Fernando, was recently victimized by a burglar, who 
broke in and stole her engagement ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened in broad daylight. I'll be ready if it happens again," Redondo 
said, looking at her new canister of spray, still in the packaging.  
</P>
<P>
 Glancing around the parking lot, she added: "I guess I should open this right 
away, eh?" TIM MAY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; PARK TO BE DEDICATED TO LATE RITCHIE VALENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans of the late rock 'n' roll legend Ritchie Valens are invited to Pacoima on 
Saturday to celebrate the dedication of the Ritchie Valens Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, to be held from 11:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., renames Paxton Park after 
Ritchie, a Pacoima native.The park is located at 10736 Laurel Canyon Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to appear at the ribbon-cutting ceremony are family members of 
Ritchie's, along with Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon, who proposed 
the name change in June. The Department of Parks and Recreation Board of 
Commissioners and the City Council later approved the change. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment will include the Ernie Valens band, Shaken and several other 
musical groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The name change is part of a community effort to inspire pride and 
self-esteem. Born Richard Valenzuela in Pacoima, Ritchie climbed out of this 
working-class neighborhood to become a rock icon in the late 1950s. His career 
and life were cut short, however, when he was killed at the age of 17 in a 1959 
plane crash along with Buddy Holly and J.P. (The Big Bopper) Richardson. JEFF

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; MORE VOTERS CASTING BALLOTS 
THROUGH MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A record number of California voters opted to cast their ballots by mail in 
Tuesday's election. According to California Field Poll estimates, more than 2 
million Californians, or about 23% of the 8.75 million people who voted, mailed 
in absentee ballots instead of reporting to their precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally intended to accommodate those who would be out of the state or 
those who could not vote in person because of disability, illness or economic 
hardship, absentee ballots have been embraced by an increasing segment of 
California voters during the last 15 years. Field Poll figures show that the 
percentage of voting Californians requesting absentee ballots went from 4.4% in 
1978 to 9% in 1986 to this year's record-breaking 23%. 
</P>
<P>
 With voter turnout at the polls continuing to decline, some see absentee 
ballots as a way to stimulate greater participation in the electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Will absentee ballots play a more significant role in future elections?  
</P>
<P>
 John Peschong, executive director, California Republican Party: 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always had an extensive absentee ballot program. We sent out absentee 
ballot applications to our constituents with a message on crimes occurring in 
their counties. Then, we mailed messages on illegal immigration, welfare and, 
finally, a letter from (former President) Ronald Reagan, all with a reminder to 
vote. We also followed those up with phone calls. Our program has been 
successful. It's been the marginal difference in some close campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Blad, chairwoman, Democratic Party, San Fernando Valley: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely the best thing in the world for voting. We need to increase 
voter participation, and the way to do that is by enabling people to vote in 
their own home and mail it out. So many things happen at the last minute that 
can prevent people from voting . . . like travel for business or a family 
emergency. It would be different if we had a local registrar of voters' office. 
But anyone in the Valley who wants to vote early has to go all the way to 
Downey. . . Now, people can be prepared and get an absentee ballot ahead of 
time in case of any last minute glitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Di Camillo, director of the California Field Poll: 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are exposed to voting by way of the absentee ballot tend to do it 
again. It's a growing phenomenon because it's an easy way to vote. You can do 
it over a long period of time at your own pace and at home. The fact that 
California ballots are generally long makes it especially becoming. Also, 
organizers of campaigns are now motivating people to vote absentee so they can 
get votes in the bank. If I were a community organizer and were trying to mine 
a particular vote, one of the tools I'd use would be absentee voting. It's a 
much lower hurdle for first-time voters to get over. They would feel less 
inhibited in voting by mail. It would provide greater organizational control. 
Whereas, traditionally you can only hope potential constituents will turn out 
at the polls, with absentees, you have several weeks to find out if they mailed 
in their ballots. Then, you can follow up with reminder phone calls. This is a 
great way to get more people in the voting mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Berg, director of Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics: 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't voted in a polling booth in years. This year, I voted two or three 
days after I received my absentee ballot in the mail. They could change the 
dynamics of a campaign. People may have already voted before the last three 
weeks of a campaign, which is when the heavy stuff usually shows up in the 
press. Back in the '60s, you had to have a valid reason to obtain an absentee 
ballot. Now, it's part of a trend to facilitate voting. Without these kinds of 
things in operation, voter turnout ratios would be worse than they already are. 
I only wonder why we couldn't count absentee ballots as soon as they come in. 
Then, we wouldn't have to wait so long to find out how many votes (a particular 
campaign) received."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: TEENS TURN TO RADIO FOR PROP. 187 VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many teen-agers who protested Proposition 187 by staging walkouts from school 
campuses also turned to radio stations like Burbank's POWER 106 to get their 
message across. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters who might be more likely to call a radio station to make a "shout 
out" to a friend instead telephoned popular music stations to express their 
opinions, both pro and con, and to educate themselves about Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed the kids were starting to find out about 187 and there was a spark 
in their minds," said POWER 106 disc jockey Dave Morales, who hosted a show on 
the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised at how educated they were," said the station's program 
director, Michelle Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
 A telephone poll was conducted by the station Monday night in which more than 
76,000 people voted for or against the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was also surprised at how polarized our audience was," said Mercer, who 
explained that POWER's listeners are about 60% Latino. The respondents favored 
Proposition 187 "by a slight margin," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales said he received several faxes and calls from students asking him to 
announce walkouts from schools that were scheduled, but he chose not to mention 
them on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the station set up a toll-free hot line, the Power Line, during the 
week before the election, where people could leave a message stating their 
views on Proposition 187. The station aired some of the recorded messages after 
screening them, Mercer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales said of the thousands of messages that were left, one was by a couple 
on two phones. The pair could be heard quarreling over the measure. MAKI BECKER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN OFFICER'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A La Mirada man pleaded not guilty Thursday to a charge of gross vehicular 
manslaughter in the killing of a La Habra police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Villegas Ramirez, 51, entered the plea Thursday in Municipal Court in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is upset about what has happened," said his attorney, Joseph A. Nappa. "He 
is very remorseful." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez is accused of being drunk when he allegedly ran a red light on 
Halloween night and smashed into La Habra Police Officer Michael Osornio's 
cruiser, demolishing it and pinning Osornio inside. Osornio, 26, died an hour 
after the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Police allege that Ramirez had been traveling at approximately 60 m.p.h. and 
his blood-alcohol level later registered at .18, more than twice the legal 
limit of .08. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez was arrested on suspicion of murder, but prosecutors later decided to 
charge Ramirez with the lesser offense of gross vehicular manslaughter. 
Evidence from the car crash did not indicate that Ramirez acted with malice, 
prosecutors said, which is a requirement for a murder charge. Police Capt. 
Terry M. Rammell has said he agrees that murder could not be proved.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Teresa Hicks called the killing tragic: "Not just because 
the officer is deceased now, but also because the defendant might be a 
perfectly good person at heart, but by his actions of drinking and driving and 
taking this young officer's life, he has ruined his own life." 
</P>
<P>
 A manslaughter conviction carries a sentence of four to 10 years in prison, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Osornio joined the Police Department 14 months ago and was engaged to be 
married. He was the first officer in the department to be killed on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's bail was set at $50,000. He is due to return to court on Nov. 29.

 Sipping Earl Grey tea and snacking on sandwiches, scones and nut bread, the 
more than 200 people attending a performance of author Beatrix Potter's story 
of Peter Rabbit on Saturday will be helping poor children, rape victims and 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our members are really enthusiastic about it," said Susan Baker, president of 
the Assistance League of San Fernando Valley, which is sponsoring its fourth 
annual "Tea 'n' Talk," the major annual fund-raising event for the 
all-volunteer group. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Judith Helton will portray Potter, author of "The Tale of Peter 
Rabbit." Helton will tell stories and conduct a question-and-answer period in 
character as Potter. The performance, at the First Presbyterian Church of 
Granada Hills, has sold out, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the event will be used to run programs such as Operation School 
Bell and a recreational seniors program, as well as to pay for rape victims' 
assistance kits and Bear Buddies, stuffed bears used by California Highway 
Patrol officers to console traumatized children. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Operation School Bell, the Assistance League provides shoes, clothing 
and school supplies for poor children at three Valley schools: Justice Street 
in Canoga Park and Capistrano Avenue Elementary and Hamlin Street Elementary in 
West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The rape victims' assistance kits, including toiletries and a change of 
clothes, are given out at Northridge Hospital Medical Center and West Hills 
Regional Medical Center. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; SUIT AGAINST GOLF OPERATOR DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge dismissed a lawsuit Thursday against the 
operators of a Studio City golf course, delivering a blow to owners of the land 
who wanted to renegotiate the lease or evict the operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm elated," said George McCallister, golf course manager.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that the rest of the neighborhood is happy they aren't going to lose 
their golf course," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute revolved around a 36-year-old lease that allows Studio City Golf 
and Tennis to pay just $1,000 a month to operate the nine-hole course -- 
located on 17.2 acres of prime real estate in the heart of Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Weddington Investment Partnership, which owns the site, learned that 
the facility's operating permit had expired in 1985.  
</P>
<P>
 This prompted Guy Weddington McCreary and his partners to attempt to 
renegotiate the lease, or to sell or lease the land to new tenants at what 
McCreary called a "fair market price." 
</P>
<P>
 To do this, the partnership filed a lawsuit this summer that claimed the cheap 
lease was nullified when the permit expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides met at least once to renegotiate the 50-year lease with no 
progress.  
</P>
<P>
 In September, Judge Joseph Kalin refused to dismiss the suit against Studio 
City Golf and Tennis, scheduling a trial that was to begin Tuesday. And on Nov. 
1, a city zoning official denied a conditional use permit to the course's 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, Kalin reversed himself and dismissed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Larry Iser, the Century City-based attorney for Studio City Golf 
and Tennis, Kalin's ruling reaffirmed that his client had acquired a vested 
right in the operation of the golf course, despite the lapsed conditional use 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased that the court understood and interpreted the lease in 
accordance with the reality of what has gone on in the last 36 years and did 
not allow the landlord to seize upon a purported loophole to deprive Studio 
City Golf of its business," Iser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although McCreary said as recently as last week that Weddington Partnership no 
longer has plans to develop the site, Jerald Gale, an attorney for the 
partnership, said the judge's decision may not end the struggle between owner 
and operator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously my client is disappointed," Gale said.  
</P>
<P>
 "My client has a right to appeal and we are presently considering other 
options," he said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two dozen volunteers with the Clinton Administration's AmeriCorps program will 
offer a health and safety fair in Santa Ana's beleaguered 3rd Street 
neighborhood Saturday and Sunday to offer free child immunizations and 
identification cards for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair marks the first project for the AmeriCorps volunteers, who came to 
Santa Ana's nonprofit Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp. last month under 
Clinton's version of a domestic Peace Corps.The youths will be working to 
develop social programs that improve health and education and crack down on 
crime, said Helen Brown, Civic Center Barrio president. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend fair will follow a neighborhood cleanup along 3rd Street, long 
dominated by a tough local gang and the recent focus of a five-month undercover 
police operation that landed many gang members in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The free event will take place in Flower Park on Flower and 3rd streets from 
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Orange County Health Services employees will be offering 
immunizations for rubella, polio and hepatitis B. There will also be free 
dental screening and other health services. Parents must be present for child 
immunizations.  
</P>
<P>
 The fair also will feature face painting, a mobile library and mobile museum, 
and "Barney," the talking police car. 
</P>

 County officials are converting a 12-acre bluff overlooking the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands into a regional park that is being renamed after Harriett M. Wieder, 
who is leaving the County Board of Supervisors this year after more than a 
decade of service. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, previously known as Bolsa Chica Regional Park, will stretch from 
Pacific Coast Highway up to the western edge of Huntington Central Park, at the 
corner of Talbert Avenue and Edwards Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It probably has one of the best views around," said Patti Schooley, parks 
district supervisor for the county. "You get a fantastic view of the (Bolsa 
Chica) ecological preserve and a fantastic view of the Pacific Ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 The county has been acquiring land for the linear park for several years. An 
initial 12-acre phase is expected to open in the spring. Officials hope the 
park one day will stretch for more than 50 acres as the county slowly acquires 
adjacent land. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the undeveloped land in the area is now used for oil extraction. As 
the oil wells are shut down, the county hopes to add the land to the park, 
Schooley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this fall, the Board of Supervisors voted to name the park after 
Wieder, who represents Huntington Beach and surrounding communities. SHELBY

 Veterans Receive Giant 'Thank You' Card 
</P>
<P>
 About 170 Newport Beach area residents signed a giant greeting card this week 
to show their gratitude to area veterans at Long Beach Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-foot card, decorated with hand-painted military emblems, was in the 
grocery store at Newport Dunes aquatic resort all week for visitors to see and 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of about 50 people enjoyed a flag-decorated cake and added their names 
to the card at a signing party yesterday, before it was delivered to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the water park's guests are veterans, and many of those signed the 
card. Some were moved to tears by the opportunity to thank their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In honor of the 12 I left behind, we salute the veterans," one person wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't let the enemy get you down, don't let the VA get you down," 
another wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital, a group of 40 wheelchair-bound patients -- most survivors of 
World War II -- received the card on behalf of the patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital spokeswoman Elaine Merrill said the card is on display in the medical 
center's lobby, where other patients can stop to see the greetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows them to start reminiscing and discussing things that happened to 
them during their service," she said. "It gives them an opportunity to talk and 
feel recognized. It makes them feel remembered." HOLLY J. WAGNER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; FAMED GUITARIST DONATES 1,000 ITEMS TO CSUN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The father of Bossa Nova, guitarist Laurindo Almeida, will donate more than 
1,000 items from his personal collection of original scores and vellum copies 
of his compositions to Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Also noted for the film scores he composed for "The Godfather" and "The 
Unforgiven," Almeida is widely recognized for introducing Brazilian music to 
this country by developing in the '50s what he calls "an amalgam of samba and 
jazz" that later evolved into the Bossa Nova. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made the United States very much aware of Brazilian music and then created 
a particular style that took hold and is still sweeping music, especially 
jazz," said Ronald Purcell, chairman of the guitar area at CSUN's School of the 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitarist and composer has won five Grammy awards and was nominated for 11 
more. He also won an Academy Award for his score for the animated short 
subject, "The Magic Pear Tree." 
</P>
<P>
 Purcell said the university is honored by Almeida's gift. "The first large 
carton has already arrived," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes into a database that is catalogued and then sent to the special 
collections at the Oviatt Library, where it will be available for students, 
researchers and all kinds of people doing musical studies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Purcell said Almeida has been involved with the university by coming out and 
rehearsing with the guitar groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been associated with the university for all of these years. I've 
composed things they have played," said Almeida, who recently hurt his shoulder 
and is recovering in his temporary home in Encino. (Almeida's own house in 
Sherman Oaks was severely damaged in the quake.) 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why he decided to donate his scores to CSUN, Almeida said, "When I 
travel I'm constantly asked by guitar lovers about the things I have done and I 
had to give them an address for where to send for catalogues." 
</P>
<P>
 Almeida began his career as a solo guitarist and arranger for the Stan Kenton 
Orchestra shortly after he moved to the United States from his native Brazil in 
1947. His historic recordings of the Laurindo Almeida Quartet, which he later 
formed, featured jazz great Bud Shank. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be honored for his contribution Nov. 18 at a reception at the home of 
CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson. MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CALENDARS BENEFIT YOUTH PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of calendars being sold in Glendale may help teen-agers live better 
lives, as well as keep track of the date, under a program sponsored by the 
Glendale Galleria mall to help four Glendale-area youth charities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's critical," said Linda Maxwell, co-founder of the We Care For Youth job 
training program."We don't have any funding sources at all." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the galleria gave at least 10,000 calendars to each of four 
charities. The 15-month calendars, which are being sold for $5, have dates of 
Glendale community events, important phone numbers and seasonal artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we can do that creates income is valuable to us," Maxwell said.  
</P>
<P>
 We Care For Youth helps teen-agers in improving self-esteem, setting goals and 
developing basic skills needed for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The calendar sales could raise as much as $50,000 for the program, which 
started in Glendale three years ago. That money could be used to buy a new 
laptop computer to allow weekend work and help finance jobs for some of the 
1,500 kids the agency has been helping in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fund-raising enables us to keep our equipment in good shape," said 
Glendale Police Officer Rodney Brooks, the administrator overseeing the 
Glendale Youth Boxing program. "It also enables us to provide for the 
extra-curricular activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks said that the money for the calendar sales can help pay for trips to 
take the teen-agers to parks or to professional boxing matches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Youth Orchestra and the Roosevelt Junior High School Varsity 
Spirit program are also selling the calendars. Information: (818) 240-9481. ED

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PARK AREA TO BECOME YOUTH SPORTS 
COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week unanimously agreed to set aside 50 acres at 
Huntington Central Park for a $20-million youth sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 youngsters and their parents turned out Monday night to urge the 
council to build the facility at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who attended the meeting was Matt Koruba, 10, who said that he is 
involved in local sports and wants more grass fields in the city to play on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fields are like junk," he said in an interview. "It's like playing in 
dirt. You get skinned knees." 
</P>
<P>
 Being involved in sports programs, he said, "gives the kids something to do. 
It keeps them occupied and it keeps them off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Beauregard, president of Save Our Kids, a coalition of more than 20 
youth sports groups, said it is time city officials make youths one of their 
top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you really care about the quality of life in Huntington Beach and its 
future, the last thing you can ignore is the children," Beauregard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council agreed and voted unanimously to set aside an undeveloped 
portion of Huntington Central Park for the sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think finally Huntington Beach is moving in the right direction as far as 
our young people are concerned," Councilman Jim Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
 The park area being set aside for the sports complex is on the east side of 
Golden West Street, between Ellis Avenue and the Huntington Beach Central 
Library parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will be built in three phases, said Ron Hagan, director of 
community services. The first 15-acre phase will include grass fields for 
baseball, soccer and football, and a roller-hockey arena. The cost is estimated 
at $4 million to $5 million. The next phases will include practice fields, 
followed by a gym, aquatic complex and community center. 
</P>
<P>
 The city does not have the money to build each of the phases, Hagan said, but 
it plans to work with youth sports groups to raise funds and seek government 
grants and public-private partnerships to build the playing fields.DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CITY OKS FEES, RULES FOR NEWSPAPER RACKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week voted in favor of imposing an annual fee for 
newspaper racks, despite a request from the Los Angeles Times to postpone a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, approved 4-0, sets a $15 installation fee per rack and a 
sliding scale of fees for renewals. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also regulates placement of news racks in public areas to clear 
sidewalks for disabled people. It also sets size limits on racks and allows 
city officials to impound those that need repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Amer, a Times representative, said the company is willing to relocate 
some of its 44 racks, but she objected to the fee schedule. She asked for a 
delay on the vote until newspaper representatives could discuss the fees with 
city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very strongly opposed to any ordinance that is a per-rack ordinance," 
Amer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Don R. Griffin said the fees reflect the cost of city inspections 
of news racks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence before us shows that the staff was extremely fair," Griffin said 
of the fee schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of newspaper racks have 90 days to comply with the regulations.LESLEY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; BOMB CASING AT CURB PROMPTS EVACUATION 
</P>

<P>
 A Canoga Park neighborhood was evacuated Thursday morning after a 250-pound 
bomb casing was left on the street for earthquake debris pickup, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bomb squad investigators examined the three-foot-long, gray metal casing from 
World War II that was left at the curbside with other debris outside of a home 
in the 20800 block of Bassett Street in Canoga Park.The bomb was reported by 
neighbors, said Sgt. William Maarschalk of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
West Valley Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bomb was completely gutted inside and they quickly determined that it was 
not a threat," said Maarschalk. "Some residents were apparently cleaning out 
their garage and put it out on the side of street." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 residents of Bassett Street were allowed to return to their homes 
after half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges were filed against the owners of the home, but some neighbors were 
plenty worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to be more discriminatory with the stuff they put out on the 
street," said Dorothy Green, who lives with her husband a few houses away from 
where the bomb casing was found. "We knew it was a bomb, but we didn't know if 
it was live or not." JEANNETTE REGALDO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; STUDY SESSION ON CLASS SIZES SLATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned over large class sizes, the Las Virgenes Board of Education will 
hold a study session Tuesday in an effort to find solutions to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The session is designed to clear up confusion about class sizes, said Bob 
Fraisse, the district's assistant superintendent of personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Numbers can be deceiving," Fraisse said. "You can have some kids sitting in 
classes of 25, and other kids sitting in classes of 42. Some of our physical 
education classes are in the low 60s." 
</P>
<P>
 The session will be held at 6:30 p.m. at the district office, 4111 N. Las 
Virgenes Road, Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take a walk through all of the alternatives that are available 
to reduce class size," Fraisse said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which adopted a fiscal 1994-95 budget that contains a deficit of 
$167,000, is unable to afford conventional solutions such as hiring more 
teachers, district officials say. The district, in an attempt to raise money, 
tried and failed twice in recent years to pass a parcel tax, which received 65% 
of the vote, but was unable to make the two-thirds majority required by law. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Jordan, a member of the Board of Education, said that in her opinion, 
it's unlikely that such a tax would pass this time around, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still would need the two-thirds," she said. "And I don't think people 
would go for it in anti-tax times and recessionary times." 
</P>
<P>
 The average class size, according to district records, is 30 at elementary 
schools and 35 in the middle and high schools. Several high school classes, 
according to school records, average 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, according to figures provided by the National Education Assn., as 
of fall, 1992, the ratio of students to teachers was 24.1 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, the district hires one teacher for every 31 students, Jordan said. 
It would cost $250,000 to reduce that figure to one teacher for every 30 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, because it has so many relatively wealthy families and because 
students generally score high on tests, receives less money per student from 
the federal government than most other schools in Southern California, 
according to district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraisse said that during the session, he will present a variety of options to 
reduce class size. One is to increase the use of instructional aides, who are 
paid about $10 per hour, as opposed to teachers, who are paid about $30 per 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, he said, could also reduce the number of classes in certain 
subjects. FRANK MANNING

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; AVOID OCEAN WATERS, HEALTH OFFICIALS ADVISE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 County health officials are advising beach visitors to stay out of the ocean, 
particularly near storm drains and creek outlets, for up to three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a rainstorm, bacteria levels increase significantly in coastal 
waters, said Robert E. Merryman, county environmental health director. 
</P>
<P>
 Large amounts of debris flow into the ocean from storm drains and rivers after 
a heavy rainfall, Merryman said. The discharge often holds large amounts of 
bacteria that can be harmful to people. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the environmental health division of the county Health Care 
Agency routinely test ocean water after a rainfall. Health officials will close 
beaches where unusual amounts of bacteria are found. 
</P>
<P>
 Merryman added that sewage isn't usually found in storm runoff because the 
sewer system is separate from the storm system. For information regarding beach 
quarantines or to report a sewage spill, call (714) 667-3752. FRANK MESSINA

<P>
 Cypress College will soon begin a long-awaited program that helps Latinos 
transfer to four-year colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Students had asked administrators for more than three years for the Puente 
Project, a program at 27 colleges throughout the state that offers Latinos a 
special writing course and individual counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress is the only community college in Orange County without the program. 
</P>
<P>
 An English instructor teaches the students writing skills and uses culturally 
relevant literature in the classroom. A counselor attends the class to provide 
help and guidance and also monitors student progress. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, volunteers from the Latino business community serve as mentors. 
Students are required to return as volunteer mentors once they complete their 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chance for educational advancement will now be a reality for historically 
underrepresented Chicano students," said student Geoffrey Richards. "The 
program will greatly increase Chicano students' graduation and transfer rates. 
. . . It was a long struggle, but it has paid off." 
</P>
<P>
 Richards was among those who led dozens of students over the years in asking 
for the program. Students rallied support from community leaders and activists 
who helped them stage a 24-hour candlelight vigil last May in hopes of 
persuading administrators to adopt the Puente Project.MIMI KO

<P>
 Police are searching for an unidentified gunman who shot and wounded a 
Glendale couple as they were driving home from work, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, a 46-year-old man and his 44-year-old wife, were leaving their 
business in the 500 block of West Garfield Avenue at about 5:45 p.m. Wednesday 
when they noticed a man loitering on the sidewalk across the street.The couple 
told police that the man appeared to be watching them, and then he walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a police report, the couple got into their car and drove 
northbound on Los Angeles Street, and saw the same man standing next to the 
curb. The man took out a gun from under his coat and fired three shots at their 
car as they drove by.  
</P>
<P>
 The man suffered a gunshot wound to his forehead and the woman was shot in the 
left shoulder and right arm. They were taken to Glendale Memorial Hospital, 
where the man was treated and released. The woman was scheduled to undergo 
surgery Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the wounded man had a gun of his own in the car and used it to 
fire back at the assailant, but it was not known whether the man was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman was described as a Latino or Middle Eastern man, between 5 feet, 5 
inches and 6 feet tall, weighing 170 to 180 pounds with dark hair combed back. 
He was wearing a dark, fluffy jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they do not believe the victims knew the gunman. The motive for 
the shooting is under investigation. STEVE RYFLE

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the arrival of flu season is not especially cheery news, Glendale Adventist 
Medical Center is softening the blow by offering free flu shots to seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will immunize 200 Glendale residents, 60 and older, at no cost 
Monday and Tuesday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. The shots will be given on a 
first-come, first-served basis in the emergency department at the hospital, 
1509 Wilson Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are allergic to eggs, are ill or have a fever, and pregnant women 
should not be vaccinated, the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical experts suggest that seniors be immunized to prevent or lessen the 
effects of influenza, and say those with health problems, including diabetes, 
heart conditions, high blood pressure or respiratory problems, are especially 
vulnerable to the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking will be available in the outpatient parking area. For more 
information, call (818) 409-8202. ERIC SLATER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; 3RD RECENT TRAFFIC DEATH STUNS COLLEGE

<P>
 Irvine Valley College students were shocked Thursday to learn of classmate 
Nicholas Sandoval's death in a traffic accident. Sandoval, 21, a well-liked 
honors student and college newspaper sports editor, died Wednesday after a car 
struck the bicycle he was riding shortly after 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval was the third student of the small community college to be killed in 
a traffic accident in the last six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have three of our students gone in such a short period of time -- it's all 
pretty devastating," said college spokesman George McCrory. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 28, Irvine resident Michael James Castenada, 19, died after he was 
struck by a car shortly after 10 p.m. while running across the Santa Ana 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, Laguna Hills resident John Michael McGlone, 19, died after his 
car collided with a truck on the Santa Ana Freeway, according to the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval, an Irvine resident who came to the United States four years ago from 
Bogota, Colombia, was struck when he rode in front of a car on East Yale Loop, 
according to Irvine police. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members of the small campus newspaper where Sandoval was known as a 
jack-of-all-trades said he could never do enough for his friends. "He was such 
a great guy; he always put others ahead of himself," said student editor Corey 
Grice. "It's so unfair that someone so nice has to go so soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval was also vice president of the campus honors society. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval's family flew in from Colombia on Thursday to arrange for the 
scattering of his ashes at sea off Newport Beach in a memorial service planned 
for Tuesday. "He was the best son a father could have," said Victor Sandoval, 
fighting back tears as he waited to meet with Irvine police late Thursday. "He 
was the best."RUSS LOAR

DAILY NEWS TO LAY OFF 75 WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 75 composing room workers at the Daily News of Los Angeles have been 
given 60 days notice of impending layoffs, as required under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers, whose contract expired Nov. 2, are being replaced by a new 
computer pagination system that the Woodland Hills-based newspaper says would 
eliminate the need for manual layout and composing work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily News said the first layoffs would occur from Jan. 9 to 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The composing room workers, who are represented by the Southern California 
Typographical Mailers Union Local 17, voted to strike earlier this month but 
have not publicly stated a deadline for the strike. Gerry Curran, Local 17 
president, said the union would continue to negotiate with the Daily News to 
try to save the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification (WARN) Act, 
employers of 100 or more workers are required to notify employees in writing 60 
days before mass layoffs or compensate them for 60 days of work.

VANDALS DAMAGE 3 BUILDINGS AT TAFT HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vandals set early morning fires at Taft High School on Thursday, throwing an 
incendiary device through one classroom window and torching seven exterior 
doors in three different school buildings, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire in the classroom had been extinguished by the building's sprinkler 
system before school workers arrived on campus and called authorities. The 
classroom had an undetermined amount of fire and water damage; the exterior 
doors were blackened and scorched, said Taft Principal Ron Berz. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators do not have any suspects or witnesses, said Bob Collis of the 
Los Angeles Fire Department. Berz would not speculate about a motive. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way of knowing if it's connected with Proposition 187," Berz said, 
noting the active student opposition to the measure to expel illegal immigrants 
from California public schools, "or if this is just a person or persons who 
wanted to light fires."

LANCASTER MAN GUILTY IN SLAYING OF FIANCEE; COURTS: CHRISTOPHER ROWLAND HAS 
BEEN DIAGNOSED AS PARANOID AND AT TIMES CLAIMED TO BE A VAMPIRE SLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old Lancaster man, who has at various times claimed to be a mind 
reader, fallen angel and vampire slayer, was convicted Thursday of 
second-degree murder in the 1990 slashing death of his fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Michael Rowland, 23, blinked rapidly, threw back his head and 
groaned in disbelief as the jury returned its verdict after two days of 
deliberations. He was acquitted of premeditated, first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff ordered Rowland to return to court Dec. 5 
for sentencing. A second-degree murder conviction carries a maximum sentence of 
15 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland had known 18-year-old Roberta Mosentheim just a few weeks when her 
body was found by a maid on a motel room bed on Feb. 12, 1990. Her throat had 
been slashed, and she had also been stabbed several times in the neck, chest 
and abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the verdict was right," said Frances Largent, the victim's mother, 
who said her daughter "was a very sensitive young lady" who had hoped to become 
a veterinarian. "She hadn't known him very long. . . . He was the first guy she 
ever cared for." 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony by prosecution witnesses, Rowland met Mosentheim's 
brother, Kurt, on a bus and soon afterward, Mosentheim fell in love with the 
muscular young man with blue eyes and curly blond hair. Within days of meeting, 
they were making plans to marry. 
</P>
<P>
 Some family members initially were concerned about the relationship because 
they believed Rowland had a criminal past. But Largent said, "My daughter 
always was taught to give everybody the benefit of a doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Trusting Rowland cost Mosentheim her life, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Collier 
alleged during the two-week trial. Collier contended that Rowland, who did not 
testify, had told other people several versions of his alibi -- that she was 
killed by gang members, that she was killed by robbers, that he'd stabbed a 
"green monster." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosentheim's father told police he last saw his daughter at about 10:30 p.m. 
the evening before she died. He said she and Rowland were headed toward a motel 
on Sepulveda Boulevard, a few blocks from the Mosentheim family's Van Nuys 
home, to discuss their plans for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland was gone when Mosentheim's body was found. But a T-shirt later 
identified as Rowland's was draped over her body.  
</P>
<P>
 Mosentheim's father later gave police a camera and told them it was discovered 
among Rowland's possessions, found in a car where he'd been sleeping. Police 
developed a roll of film found inside, which included pictures of Rowland 
wearing the goat's-head T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also found blood on Rowland's shoe tops and laces, but it could not be 
matched with the victim's because blood samples taken from her body were 
mishandled and had decomposed, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement Rowland gave police after his arrest also was not used at the 
trial because detectives spoke to him even after he asked four times for a 
lawyer. In the statement, Rowland told police Mosentheim was a vampire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Mark E. Montpas said police concocted the vampire story and 
put words in his client's mouth. Montpas added that he would appeal the jury's 
verdict because the evidence was insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his preliminary hearing, Rowland was twice found incompetent to 
stand trial on the grounds that his mental condition prevented him from 
understanding the proceedings or assisting in his defense. At one hearing, he 
claimed to be able to read minds and said he was a fallen angel. He claimed 
Jesus Christ had spoken to him three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland was diagnosed as paranoid and depressed -- conditions apparently made 
worse by drug use, a psychiatrist testified at one of the hearings. He had been 
confined at Patton State Hospital, but has received no treatment during the 18 
months he has spent at County Jail, his attorney said.

DORNAN'S NOT RULING OUT HOUSE BID ON LIST OF OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Robert K. Dornan, who promised that this year's reelection campaign would 
be his last, said Thursday that "all bets are off" if he decides not to run for 
President in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan said he plans to enter the 1996 New Hampshire and Iowa presidential 
primaries and does not see himself running for a 10th term in Congress. But 
should he decide against running for President, the Garden Grove congressman 
said his list of career options could include running for reelection to his 
46th Congressional District seat now that Republicans have control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see myself running for another House term . . . (but) I would have no 
problem saying: 'All bets are off. We are in the majority. I am going to stay 
in the House,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point last year, Dornan had considered bowing out of this year's 
election so he could dedicate all of his energies to a possible run for the 
White House. And when he decided to seek a ninth term, Dornan vowed it would be 
his last. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan was named this year as one of 15 "Term Limits Heroes" in the House by 
the U.S. Term Limits Group, because he has led the fight for a constitutional 
amendment that would limit Congress members to three two-year terms. California 
voters two years ago approved a similar term limits law that is now being 
challenged in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Thursday, Dornan said his family would decide during the 
Thanksgiving holidays whether he should go ahead with a presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not intimidated by (Texas Sen.) Phil Gramm," Dornan said, assessing the 
list of possible GOP presidential contenders. "Bob Dole is the man to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, the Kansas senator, will once again become the Senate Majority Leader in 
January following Tuesday's Republican landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he admires Dole, Dornan said that he plans to enter the early 1996 
primaries even if Dole also joins the presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could gladly and positively campaign for this inspiring, handicapped war 
hero," Dornan said of Dole, who was injured in World War II. "The others, I 
will leave in my dust." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan said he also is considering running against Democratic U.S. Sen. 
Barbara Boxer in 1998, as well as resuming a broadcasting career. He has 
frequently substituted for conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 And then again, he could decide to stay in Congress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have yet to see the first person who says that's hypocritical," Dornan 
said. "No one has to step aside who is for term limits and let someone take 
your place who is not for term limits." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Democratic Party Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia said she is not 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leave it to Bob Dornan not to keep his word," she said. "It does not surprise 
me at all. He's just a grandstander."

MAN FOUND SLAIN NEAR COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was found shot to death in a car parked near Mission College by campus 
police Thursday morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, believed to be in his 20s, was found in the driver's seat of a white 
Datsun 280-Z with the motor running just before 10 a.m. at Eldridge Street and 
Harding Avenue, Los Angeles Police Lt. Joe Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been shot in the face, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We drove by and saw exhaust coming from the muffler, but we didn't see anyone 
in the car," said Terry Duplessis, 32, the Los Angeles Community College 
District police officer who found the body. "We found him when we looked 
inside."

TWO COUNCIL WINNERS SEEK BROADER BASE FOR BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two winners of the City Council elections, the manager of a popular bar 
and a two-term incumbent, said they will try to improve the city by building a 
bigger business base and steering away from trivial matters that get in the way 
of progressive leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Monahan, 35, who manages Henry's and Harry's Goat Hill Tavern in Costa 
Mesa, and incumbent Peter Buffa, 46, a television producer, won the two open 
seats on the council on Tuesday, garnering about 7,500 votes apiece in a field 
of 11 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Both will be sworn into office in the first week of December. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to run a professional bar, so I'll try to run a professional city," an 
elated Monahan said on election night. 
</P>
<P>
 As a new member of the five-member council, Monahan said he would try to focus 
on the bigger issues affecting the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to worry about getting more cops on the streets and improving our 
parks and stop worrying about who's putting up Christmas banners in Triangle 
Square," he said, referring to an incident that became an issue last holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffa said he would try to build a bigger business base by creating more tax 
incentives. He said he would also do his best to maintain the city's police and 
fire protection, which has been a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also have to continue wrestling with the city's illegal immigration 
problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffa was the top vote-getter, getting 19.1%, or 7,575 of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan received 18.9%, or 7,501 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Libby Cowan, a Costa Mesa planning commissioner, came in third, receiving 
5,441 votes, or 13.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 And Chris Steel, a self-employed investor, earned 5,201 votes, or 13.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Korando, a planning commissioner, was fifth, receiving 3,492, or 8.8% of 
the vote.

2 COUNCIL NEWCOMERS FOCUS ON LA PALMA BUDGET ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two newcomers to ballot-box politics have been elected to the City Council, 
and both say that managing the city's strained finances is a major, continuing 
problem facing La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 The two, Kenneth Blake and Charlene Hatakeyama, won the seats in Tuesday's 
four-way race without having to face incumbents.Councilmen Larry Herman and 
David Lim chose not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake and Hatakeyama said that state government has in recent years cut back 
funds that once went to cities. The result has been strapped city budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an ongoing problem," Blake said. "I still anticipate more revenue 
reduction from the state over the next few years, and that is a major issue in 
still maintaining (city) staff and services." 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, however, said he thinks the city can survive the budget crunches 
without reducing existing services or staff. He also said he does not think 
increases in city taxes will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, 47, is a controller-accountant in private business. He is chairman of 
the city's Cultural and Beautification Committee and has served on the La Palma 
Days Parade Committee and the city's Blue Ribbon Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatakeyama, 48, is an insurance agent and has state credentials as an 
elementary school teacher. She is president of the La Palma Chamber of Commerce 
and has served on the city's Cultural and Beautification Committee and Blue 
Ribbon Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Blake, she said state cutbacks to city funding have made it difficult for 
city government. 
</P>
<P>
 She said one of her goals is to find "additional revenue sources for the city 
other than taxes." She added, "I'd like to strengthen the city's general fund 
reserves, and this means keeping a close eye on expenditures and looking for 
additional revenue."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; YOUTH KILLED IN HIGH-SPEED CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Lancaster teen-ager was killed Thursday when he lost control of his car, 
swerved into oncoming traffic and collided with a truck, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The noontime accident occurred when the youth, 18, tried to pass a car while 
driving south on Sierra Highway near Avenue D at about 80 m.p.h., witnesses 
told investigators.Seeing northbound traffic closing in on him, he veered back 
into the southbound lane. He lost control and collided head on with a truck in 
the southbound lane, which had veered across the road in an attempt to avoid 
him, said Officer Richard Perez of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth, whose name was not immediately available, was thrown from the car 
and died at the scene, Perez said. The driver of the truck was treated at 
Antelope Valley Hospital for minor injuries.

strapped in by a seat belt but was not in a car seat, Perez said. The 
investigation will continue, he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; OFFICIALS WONDER WHICH ROUTE TO TAKE NEXT; 
PALMDALE: IMPROVEMENT OF ONE ROAD WOULD CREATE JOBS, BUT WIDENING THE OTHER 
WOULD EASE TRAFFIC WOES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With limited funds available for road improvements, Palmdale officials are 
debating which street project to begin first: a long-planned improvement of a 
hazardous, heavily traveled commuter route, or a roadway that could be a boon 
to local industry and bring more jobs to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 At a City Council meeting Wednesday night, Mayor Jim Ledford argued that the 
city should go the jobs route, immediately extending Avenue O between 10th 
Street West and Sierra Highway to open up hundreds of acres for industrial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman David Myers said the city should first keep its promise to 
widen and straighten out a stretch of 25th Street East. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very frustrated that project has been given such a high priority," Myers 
said of the Avenue O plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In its current budget, the council has allocated $1 million to widen and 
realign 25th Street East, a winding street used by many residents of southeast 
Palmdale driving to and from Los Angeles. But city staff members suggested that 
the 25th Street project could be put on hold for a year to free funds for 
Avenue O. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was suggested because the owner of much of the proposed site for an 
industrial center recently offered to donate land for the roadway. The cost of 
its design and construction is estimated at slightly more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledford said the city should accept the offer because it would provide access 
to vacant land that could be offered to large industrial companies willing to 
relocate to Palmdale. The city has been trying to lure such employers to cut 
down on commuting to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the need for industrial land ready for immediate development became 
apparent during Palmdale's failed attempt to attract computer manufacturer 
Packard Bell to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no readily available site for them to locate on," the mayor said. 
"It's hard to shop property right now in the Antelope Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Root said he saw the need for both road projects. He suggested 
that the city fund the Avenue O project immediately because the property owner 
is ready to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also said the city staff could do inexpensive preliminary work on the 
25th Street project so that it will be ready to go when construction funds 
become available in next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen H. Williams, the city's public works director, said his staff could 
begin designing that road project and hold public meetings with nearby 
residents regarding the new alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's plenty we can do on 25th Street," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council postponed a decision on which road to take for one month, asking 
its staff to do further research on the projects.

METRO BRIEFS: LOMITA; RACIAL DATA TO FIGURE IN 2ND SECESSION BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time, the racial mix of students in Lomita's schools may affect 
the city's bid to secede from the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time the state Board of Education will compare the racial mix of the 
proposed Lomita Unified School District with the mix of the city's population, 
a comparison the board didn't make in denying a similar bid by Lomita in 1987. 
"It will be a consideration the board has not seen, so it could be a 
determining factor," said county spokesman Greg Magnuson. 
</P>
<P>
 The secession would push the racial makeup of Lomita's schoolchildren from 
28.3% to 43.8% white, according to a preliminary report submitted Nov. 2 to the 
county Committee on School District Organization. But the city itself is 68.4% 
white, according to the report. Since Lomita's proposed school district would 
be more integrated than the city itself, the mix might be considered favorable, 
Magnuson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Black student enrollment in Lomita schools would drop from 17.7% to 9.9%, 
while Latino enrollment would fall from 40.6% to 35.2%, the study estimated. 
Asian enrollment would increase from 6.4% to 7.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Lomita's first bid made it as far as the state Board of Education, which cited 
segregation concerns in its denial. The final county report and recommendation 
are to go to the state Board of Education on Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Lomita's new school district would serve about 2,000 students attending 
Eshelman Avenue Elementary and Lomita Elementary, a magnet school. Fleming 
Middle School would become a high school or a combined junior and senior high 
school.  
</P>
<P>
 The county committee is expected to investigate several other issues before 
submitting the final report to the state, Magnuson said. Prominent among these 
are Lomita's plans for its special-education students and for the estimated 
1,700 students who live outside the city but attend Lomita schools, he said.

MIKE PENNER: SELLING OUT MAKES FOR GREAT RIVALRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are probably more appropriate sites for Sunday's Battle To Leave Los 
Angeles -- the tarmac at LAX and the parking lot at Mayflower Moving & Storage 
come to mind -- but the Rams and Raiders will have to settle for Anaheim 
Stadium and an audience of 69,000 I-was-there chest-thumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be a war," Rams radio broadcaster Jack Snow predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time two teams are trying to get out of town, it makes for a great 
rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
 As we all know, this game is a sellout for only one reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows where these two teams will meet again? 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis? 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore? 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland? 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are, it will be anywhere but here, so the curiosity- and 
novelty-seekers will be flooding the freeways Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Heaven knows, it won't be for the football. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is indeed the last go-round, what a way to go out. Once, the Ram and 
Raider organizations represented polar opposites of the NFL experience. The 
Rams, with Eric Dickerson high-stepping and Jim Everett back-pedaling, played 
football to sip Chardonnay to. The Raiders, smashing mouths in the trenches, 
provided background noise for the muggings in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, if it weren't for the uniforms, the teams would be indistinguishable. 
Consider: RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: 4-5, third place in the NFC West, already three games behind the more 
glamorous team to the north, San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders: 4-5, third place in the AFC West, already three games behind the more 
glamorous team to the south, San Diego. HEAD COACH 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: Chuck Knox. Rumored to be on shaky ground. Former offensive lineman. 
Likes to draft offensive linemen in the first round. Feuded with quarterback 
last season. Denied/downplayed it afterward to the media. Took a while to 
settle on a go-to back, found one in Jerome Bettis, now can't stop pitching the 
ball to him. Idea of a big play is Bettis, off right tackle for nine yards. 
Idea of a keenly executed game plan is Rams 17, Giants 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders: Art Shell. Rumored to be on shaky ground. Former offensive lineman. 
Likes to build his teams around offensive linemen. Feuded with quarterback last 
month. Denied/downplayed it afterward to the media. Took a while to settle on a 
go-to back, found one in Harvey Williams, now can't stop handing the ball to 
him. Idea of a big play is Williams, around right end for 11 yards. Idea of a 
keenly executed game plan is Raiders 17, Houston 14. QUARTERBACK 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: Chris Chandler. Former career backup, signed with Rams as a free agent 
before 1994 season. While suffering from a concussion and a malfunctioning 
headset in his helmet, recently changed a play that was sent in from the 
sideline and was promptly pulled from the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders: Jeff Hostetler. Former career backup, signed with Raiders as a free 
agent before 1993 season. While suffering from impatience and a malfunctioning 
offensive playbook, recently changed a play that was sent in from the sideline 
and was promptly pulled from the game. RUNNING BACK 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: Jerome Bettis. Averaging 3.5 yards per carry, has scored three 
touchdowns, still gets the ball two plays out of every three. Typical Ram 
offensive possession: Bettis run, Bettis run, incomplete pass, Sean Landeta 
punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders: Harvey Williams. Averaging 3.8 yards per carry, has scored three 
touchdowns, still gets the ball two plays out of every three. Typical Raider 
offensive possession: Williams run, Williams run, incomplete pass, Jeff Gossett 
punt. RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: Flipper Anderson and Jessie Hester have caught a total of 43 balls, 
averaging 17 yards per catch. Potentially most dangerous receiver, Troy 
Drayton, spends his time either run-blocking or running downfield, turning 
around and waving his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders: Tim Brown has caught a total of 50 balls, averaging 15 yards per 
catch. Potentially most dangerous receiver, James Jett, spends his time either 
pacing the sidelines or running downfield, turning around and waving his hand. 
DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: Good enough to be 6-3. Held Green Bay to two offensive touchdowns and 
Atlanta to eight points in games the Rams lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders: Good enough to be 6-3. Held Miami to two touchdowns and Kansas City 
to 13 points in games the Raiders lost. SPECIAL TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: Kicker Tony Zendejas, team MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders: Kicker Jeff Jaeger, team MVP. LAME DUCK STATUS 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: See you in St. Looie. Or Baltimore. Next year, Anaheim gets Arena ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders: Back to Oakland a 60-40 proposition and growing stronger by the week. 
Next year, if Raiders leave, L.A. gets Dallas-San Francisco on the tube.

NHL PLAYERS SEEK COMPROMISE; HOCKEY: BUT WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT ENTRY-LEVEL 
SALARY SYSTEM ALONE PROBABLY WON'T END IMPASSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NHL Players Assn. confirmed Thursday it would accept an entry-level salary 
system if owners agree to drop a proposed levy on payrolls of the top 16 
revenue-earning clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it's doubtful that alone will persuade the league to lift the 
lockout, which is in its 42nd day. Owners claim they lost $70 million the last 
two seasons, and salary controls during players' first three seasons would not 
produce savings of anywhere near that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL officials refused to comment on the seven-hour session, which was held in 
Buffalo, N.Y. They said Commissioner Gary Bettman will contact union 
representatives today by phone. Said union chief Bob Goodenow: "We feel we have 
gone a long, long way in addressing the concerns of the owners. We feel it is a 
basis upon which progress can be made." 
</P>
<P>
 King defenseman Marty McSorley, a member of the NHLPA negotiating committee, 
called the union's gesture "a significant concession designed to sniff out any 
desire the owners may have to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley briefed players about the proposal Thursday, before the opening of a 
three-day charity tournament in Hamilton, Canada. The exhibition drew 14,640 
fans to the Copps Coliseum. "The players in those locker rooms are shaking 
their heads," McSorley said. "Every one of them is saying, 'Why wouldn't this 
end the lockout?' " 
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons why it might not produce an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping the payroll levy would not solve the economic woes of small-market 
clubs, who would get subsidies from the pool created by levies on payrolls and 
gate receipts. While there is some sentiment among NHL owners to eliminate the 
levy, they wouldn't do that without adopting an alternative. The players have 
not offered any other plans, and on Thursday they eliminated the gradual 
payroll levy and flat 3% gate levy they had previously proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor would an entry-level salary system dramatically slow the rapid growth of 
salaries, which the NHL claims has pushed it to the brink of financial 
disaster. According to figures compiled by the NHL, player costs have 
outstripped revenue growth by $1.14 for every $1 the last five years. Owners 
want to abolish salary arbitration, which inflates salaries, but players want 
to keep it in some form. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential pitfall is players' demand to be paid full salaries this 
season. Owners, who have already lost revenue from six canceled home games and 
will lose more games, won't agree to that. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow, possibly hinting that the league will rebuff his offer, said after 
the meeting, "Unfortunately, no significant progress was made." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Winter, a player agent, said if no agreement is reached by the end of the 
month he will explore forming a new league. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate developments, the league ended a lingering disagreement with 
on-ice officials and won a court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Referees and linesmen will receive 72.5% of their pay and a similar portion of 
the $6,000 playoff bonus each is guaranteed if the season is canceled. They 
will also be credited with a season's service toward salary increases and 
pensions. In addition, they will receive full pay until the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal magistrate in New York upheld Bettman's decisions to void an offer 
made by the San Jose Sharks to Edmonton's Craig Simpson and to void a portion 
of an offer San Jose made to Kelly Miller of the Washington Capitals.

WORTHY HANGS IT UP, AND SO WILL THE LAKERS; PRO BASKETBALL: TEAM WILL PUT 
RETIRED FORWARD'S NO. 42 NEXT TO OTHER GREATS ON FORUM WALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was Thursday as he had been for his previous 12 years as a Laker, eloquent 
and graceful, soft-spoken about his accomplishments, an athlete relating the 
frustration of a once-great body wearing out and making it all seem so 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 James Worthy said his knees had given out more than his will had. The end, he 
insisted, came not after serious contemplation following the sudden death of 
his mother, or after struggling with a reduced role on a team whose other 
players talked of having watched him in the NBA finals as junior high students, 
but after being struck with the achy joints of April and May in October. 
Two-a-days had hurt too much, he said, and he could imagine how he would be 
feeling by Game 63. 
</P>
<P>
 So he retired, making it official at a crowded Forum news conference and 
bringing the curtain down on an era in the process. Magic Johnson, Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar and Michael Cooper, among others, were there to say goodby to a 
friend -- and the last link to Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy that we can see James go out and we can all smile," said 
Abdul-Jabbar, the former captain. "We'll shed some tears later, but we can 
smile because he's walking out happy, the way he wants to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 He won't be entirely gone, either. Worthy said he might go into broadcasting 
and will probably stay close to the game, but, in any capacity, he will be part 
of the Forum. Owner Jerry Buss has decided to retire Worthy's No. 42 and hang 
it alongside those of the Laker immortals: Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, 
Jerry West, Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson. No date has been set, but the ceremony may 
be held in December. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't Buss' only tribute to the seven-time all-star. Retirement could 
have meant that Worthy was walking away from a contract that would pay $7.2 
million this season and $5.15 million in 1995-96, or at least that he would 
have to settle for a percentage as a buyout. But he will be paid in full. 
</P>
<P>
 "You make a commitment to do something, so you do it," said Bob Steiner, Buss' 
spokesman. "The same things were always true with (Johnson's) contracts and 
everyone else's contract. You sign an agreement to pay him. If you're not 
obligated to it legally, you certainly are morally from what James has meant to 
Jerry's happiness. Look at what the guy's done." 
</P>
<P>
 Buss is also paying $14.6 million worth of happiness to Johnson this season on 
a contract that was signed even as all parties realized that Magic would not be 
playing. In business, they call it a golden parachute. Around the Laker front 
office, where $26.95 million is now earmarked for two former players, it's 
known as thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 What it means to the future of the Lakers is quite different. Because of a 
salary-cap technicality, they will have $1.85 million to pay another player, 
good until Nov. 10, 1995. That would seem lucrative enough to lure a good free 
agent, although probably not a top-level talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy, 33, alluded to the front office -- primarily Buss, Executive Vice 
President West and General Manager Mitch Kupchak -- during his remarks, noting 
that he played with legends and worked for legends. But the most insightful 
comments were saved for his decision to retire after 12 seasons and three 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that really wore on me was that I could only play one way," he 
said. "Some players, when they get older, they have a tendency to be able to 
adjust and find a way to continue. I just couldn't do it. I think I may have 
tried it this past year, to modify, because I knew the minutes were going to 
decrease, but it was a forced situation. I can remember when my alarm clock 
would go off and I would be right up, right to practice, ready to go. It was 
fun. It got to the point where you hit the snooze five or six times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel good physically, and I knew I couldn't make the contribution 
that I needed and wanted to. So for the sake of the younger players that are 
really working hard, it was a mutual agreement with Dr. Buss and the Laker 
front office. I was able to make some room and really avoid any further 
frustration or embarrassment that I might cause myself trying to compete when I 
knew it just wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely think it's time for me. Parts of last year and a little bit of 
this year in training camp was like a test for me because I think you get to 
the point where you really aren't sure if you've got enough left. So I'm almost 
sure that it's the right time for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel relieved. I'm not looking back. I'm really just feeling very 
light, very happy that I was able to come to a decision and have it be the 
right one." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's proceedings were as much tribute as explanation, recollections of a 
spectacular small forward who probably never got his due from fans outside Los 
Angeles because he played with and was overshadowed by Johnson and 
Abdul-Jabbar. Many looked upon him as a complementary player when, in fact, he 
was a star in his own right. He could run the wings, even at 6 feet 9, with 
Magic at the controls of the trademark Showtime fast break, then a moment later 
embarrass a defender with a quick spin move from the low post. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy scored 16,320 points and stands 52nd on the all-time NBA list. He spent 
more years as a Laker than anyone other than Abdul-Jabbar and West. He was at 
his best in the playoffs -- thus the nickname "Big Game James" -- averaging 3.5 
more points than in the regular season and being named finals MVP in 1988. He 
got his first triple-double in that series -- in Game 7. He got his career-best 
40 points in the championship series the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson rates him as the second-best finisher on the break the game has seen, 
behind only Michael Jordan and right there with Julius Erving. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar said, "We always respected him as the cutting edge of what it was 
about to be a forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin McHale, the former Celtic, recalled him as "a real warrior, but a very 
classy warrior." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, to the surprise of no one, Worthy was gracious. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be a Laker," he said, "was everything to me." A Worthy Career 
</P>
<P>
 A look through the years at James Worthy, who announced his retirement 
Thursday after 12 seasons with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 * FEB. 15, 1980 -- The Lakers trade Don Ford and a 1980 first-round pick to 
Cleveland for Butch Lee and a No. 1 pick in 1982.  
</P>
<P>
 * SUMMER, 1982 -- The pick the Lakers get from the Cavaliers turns out to be 
No. 1 overall, the only time in league history the reigning NBA champion gets 
the top selection. Deciding against Dominique Wilkins and Terry Cummings, the 
Lakers take James Worthy, a 6-foot-9 forward who left North Carolina as a 
junior after helping the Tar Heels to the NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1982-83 -- The Lakers go 58-24 and win the Pacific Division title. Worthy 
averages 13.4 points, shoots 57.9% -- still a club record for first-year 
players -- and is a unanimous all-rookie selection. But he suffers a broken leg 
in the final week of the regular season and sits out the playoffs. The 
Philadelphia 76ers sweep the Lakers in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1983-84 -- The Lakers go 54-28, winning the Pacific Division and Western 
Conference titles before losing to Boston in seven games in the finals. Worthy 
averages 14.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1984-85 -- The Lakers win the division title by 20 games as Worthy averages 
17.6 points. He then sets an NBA playoff record for accuracy in a series by 
shooting 72.1% in the Western Conference finals against Denver. That helps set 
the stage for one of the greatest moments in franchise history: winning the 
championship by beating the Celtics in Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1985-86 -- Worthy improves his scoring average for the fourth consecutive 
season to 20.0 and makes the All-Star team for the first time. The Lakers start 
24-3 and cruise to a fifth consecutive Pacific Division title, this time by a 
league-record 22 games, only to be eliminated by Houston in the Western 
Conference finals when Ralph Sampson makes an off-balance shot at the buzzer of 
Game 5 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1986-87 -- Magic Johnson is named the regular-season and finals MVP and 
Michael Cooper is chosen as the defensive player of the year, but Worthy 
averages 23.6 points and shoots 59.1% during the playoffs as the Lakers defeat 
Boston for their fourth title of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1987-88 -- What a time for the first triple-double of his career: Game 7 of 
the championship series against Detroit. The Lakers beat the Pistons for a 
second consecutive title as Worthy gets 36 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists 
and is named MVP of the finals. He averages 19.7 points during the regular 
season as the Lakers go 62-20 before becoming the first team to win three 
consecutive seven-game series for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1988-89 -- Worthy builds on his reputation as a great playoff performer by 
averaging 24.8 points in postseason play and scoring a career-high 40 in Game 4 
of the finals. But he can't stop the injury-riddled Lakers from being swept by 
the Pistons after going 57-25 during the regular season and the Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar farewell tour. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1989-90 -- Worthy averages 21.1 points and becomes the first player in NBA 
history to shoot at least 53% in his first eight seasons as the Lakers finish a 
league-best 63-19. The season comes to a screeching halt when the Phoenix Suns 
win the second-round series, the Lakers' earliest exit since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1990-91 -- Worthy's 21.4-point average is a career best and helps the Lakers 
recover from a 1-4 start under new Coach Mike Dunleavy. The Lakers put together 
a 16-game winning streak in midseason, finish 58-24 and win the Western 
Conference championship. Worthy is hobbled in the finals by an ankle injury, 
and after winning the opener at Chicago Stadium on Sam Perkins' three-pointer, 
the Lakers lose the next four games to Michael Jordan and the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1991-92 -- The slide starts for the Lakers and Worthy, even as he makes the 
All-Star team for the seventh, and last, time. Johnson announces he is 
HIV-positive, Vlade Divac undergoes surgery for a herniated disk, Worthy spends 
the final 25 games on the injured list after arthroscopic knee surgery and in 
December the Lakers suffer through their first losing month since March of '79. 
They finish 43-39 and are eliminated by Portland in the first round of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992-93 -- Worthy's scoring drops to 14.9, the shooting to 44.7%. The Lakers 
finish below .500 at home for the first time since 1960 and limp in at 39-43 
before pushing heavily favored Phoenix to the limit in a first-round loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993-94 -- Worthy goes down with the ship, recording career lows in scoring, 
rebounding, shooting and minutes played and failing to score 1,000 points for 
the first time in his career as the Lakers go 33-49 and fail to reach the 
playoffs for the first time in 18 years. CAREER STATISTICS

MCNALL SET TO GIVE UP HIS TITLES WITH KINGS; HOCKEY: HE WILL NO LONGER BE 
PRESIDENT OR GOVERNOR, BUT HE WILL HAVE A SALARY UNTIL 2001. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN and JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce McNall is expected to give up his high-profile titles of president and 
governor of the Kings as early as next week, although he will continue working 
for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The impending move appears to be largely image-driven to ease any potential 
embarrassment for the Kings and the NHL when McNall is formally charged by 
federal authorities with bank fraud and three other counts. That may happen as 
early as Monday, in connection with a plea agreement he worked out with the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, sources maintain that many key issues related to McNall's status are 
still in flux and could change. McNall, under an employment agreement reached 
in May with new majority owners Jeffrey Sudikoff and Joseph Cohen, earns 
$650,000 a year, with the potential for significant additional bonus money. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, dated May 16, was filed among bankruptcy court documents and 
states that McNall's services can be terminated if he enters a guilty plea or 
no contest for any crime involving a felony punishable by imprisonment. 
However, he is still guaranteed an annual base salary of $487,500 until January 
2001, even after such termination of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for McNall declined comment Thursday, as did Cohen, the Kings' 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was reported that McNall had reached a plea agreement in August, Cohen 
offered a strong show of support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is, Bruce McNall is still very much a part of everything this 
organization is doing," Cohen told The Times. "The way I see it, Bruce is the 
fan's ombudsman. He's got that very special gift of being able to relate to the 
fans, and they to him." 
</P>
<P>
 But McNall's imminent plea bargain has posed a sticky image problem for the 
team in the face of mounting national attention. Having him relinquish the 
title of president would serve as a form of damage control when he is formally 
charged. He is expected to eventually enter his formal guilty plea in December. 
</P>
<P>
 However, according to sources, the move appears to be little more than a title 
change to curtail any embarrassment when the charges are made formally. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources note that McNall retains a minority interest in the team and 
holds a smaller stake in any potential arena project and therefore would not 
sever his ties with the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall has not spoken with reporters about his situation since late September. 
Then he said he would step down "if it was in the best interest of this team." 
But even then, he hinted that he may have a role in the organization even 
without a title. 
</P>
<P>
 His influence with the Kings and his leaguewide role have gradually decreased 
as his legal and financial problems have increased. He resigned as chairman of 
the league's Board of Governors on April 29, after it was revealed that a 
federal grand jury was investigating his banking practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, five of his business associates have been charged in the bank loan 
fraud investigation with three already having entered guilty pleas. The two 
others have agreed to enter guilty pleas, according to their lawyers. Another 
high-ranking McNall official reportedly has agreed to a plea bargain with the 
government but has not yet been formally charged, according to sources.

COMING ON FAST; INJURIES HAVE SIDELINED USC'S ED HERVEY, BUT NOW HE'S READY FOR 
STRETCH RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Through no fault of his own, USC fans probably haven't seen the best of the 
Trojans' fastest football player, Ed Hervey. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a glimpse last Saturday, at Washington State.  
</P>
<P>
 Just a glimpse.  
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter of a victory over the Cougars, the Trojans had third and 
11 at their 36. Quarterback Rob Johnson lofted a pass high over the middle and 
the 6-foot-3, 195-pound Hervey went airborne. 
</P>
<P>
 He made what might have been USC's catch of the season on the 44-yard play, a 
two-handed reception while sailing parallel to the artificial surface.  
</P>
<P>
 Four plays later, USC's Cole Ford kicked a 37-yard field goal, sealing the 
Trojans' 23-10 victory.  
</P>
<P>
 That kept USC in the Rose Bowl race with another big game Saturday against 
Arizona at 
</P>
<P>
 the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the kind of plays Ed can make," said Mike Sanford, who coaches the 
Trojan wide receivers. "He's had some tough luck with injuries here, and people 
haven't seen yet what he can really do. He's healthy now; maybe they soon 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 When the 1994 season began, Hervey, a senior, was viewed as USC's main wide 
receiver.  
</P>
<P>
 But newcomer Keyshawn Johnson, developing more quickly than expected, became a 
big-time receiver. And Hervey, for the second consecutive season, was set back 
by an injury.  
</P>
<P>
 So again, it has been his lot to play in the shadow of a headliner. Last year, 
while Johnnie Morton became USC's all-time reception leader, Hervey caught 22 
passes for 219 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 He sat out two games because of a sprained left ankle, an injury that slowed 
him the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the same sprain Rob (Johnson) has this year, high on the ankle," he 
said of the senior quarterback, who has sat out the equivalent of four games. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hervey's bad luck hadn't run out yet.  
</P>
<P>
 This season, in the opener against Washington, tailback Shawn Walters fell on 
top of him, leaving him with a strained knee. 
</P>
<P>
 He has played in only three games this year and has only 10 receptions. And he 
got half of those at Pullman last Saturday, gaining 70 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Keyshawn Johnson, a junior, has caught 36 passes for 742 
yards, second best in the Pacific 10 Conference.  
</P>
<P>
 Until transferring to USC from Pasadena City College, Hervey said he had never 
missed a game because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Hervey's principal asset is speed. He ran a 20.65-second 200 meters and a 
46.02 400 last spring with the USC track team. 
</P>
<P>
 He's the Trojans' fastest player. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . For flat-out speed, Ed is one of the fastest guys in college football," 
Sanford says. "He's also a very tough, strong kid who's fearless at going over 
the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Hervey, from Compton High, is playing wide receiver for only the second 
season. At Pasadena CC, he was a quarterback who took the Lancers to a 10-1 
season in 1992, passing for 919 yards and running for 791. 
</P>
<P>
 "That 10-1 team was my best team in eight years here and Ed ran the show," PCC 
Coach Dennis Gossard said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love Ed Hervey. He's got a great attitude, great intensity and he's got 
every intangible any coach could want." 
</P>
<P>
 Hervey became a high-profile junior college player in the mud.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was a backup his first year here and in our last game at Mt. SAC, when he 
got his chance, he won a game in rain and mud," Gossard said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He took the team 80 yards with 1:30 to go and got it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Three schools, Hervey said, recruited him as a quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kansas, UTEP and Washington State talked to me about playing quarterback, but 
I didn't like the situations there," he said, "I had my heart set on SC all 
along, and I wanted to play wide receiver.  
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed playing quarterback at Pasadena, I liked handling the ball on every 
play. But I'd like a shot at pro ball, and my best chance is at wide receiver." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he'll probably skip the track team this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to polish my route running for the NFL scout combines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admit I'm not a great route runner. I have the speed to play in the NFL, 
but I need to run better routes. Johnnie Morton was the best route runner I 
ever saw -- he could run every part of a route at top speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Hervey is delighted by the emergence of his running mate, Keyshawn Johnson, he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God we have an arsenal, that we had someone who could step up when I 
got hurt," he said. "Thank God we had (Brad) Otton when Rob went down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see early in training camp what a great athlete Keyshawn was, that he 
had to be on the field for us all the time. But I felt that way about me, too. 
I felt we could both make big plays.  
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches love matching Keyshawn with short cornerbacks -- they can't win 
that battle. Keyshawn is a great natural receiver. I'm a little different. I 
use my speed more than he does." 
</P>
<P>
 With USC's schedule down to Arizona and then UCLA and Notre Dame, a 
revitalized Hervey at last gives USC a potent double threat at wide receiver.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ed still hasn't played his best game yet for SC," Sanford said. "I really 
think he can come into his own over these last three games."

MIKE DOWNEY: LOOK OUT, BIG GEORGE! I'M READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the objections of my doctor, my attorney, my editor, my personal trainer 
and my next of kin, I have agreed to fight George Foreman for the heavyweight 
championship of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The bout will take place Thanksgiving Day in Las Vegas at the internationally 
famed Sizzler salad bar. Originally, we had planned this fight for the MGM 
Grand, but the showroom there already has been booked for December with the 
popular singing act, Congressman Bono and Cher. 
</P>
<P>
 After I had assured promoters that I was in no shape to box professionally, 
they looked me squarely in the eye and said, "Sign here." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman expressed delight at giving a sportswriter a shot at the title, 
observing that everybody who works for a paper should be beaten to a pulp. 
Brain damage, George agreed, would not necessarily be a handicap in journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Ring magazine immediately ranked me No. 9 among the top heavyweight 
contenders. Informed that I had never actually been inside a ring, the 
magazine's editor asked, "What's your point?" 
</P>
<P>
 The champion will receive $5 million, and I, $4.20 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 When told about Foreman's plans, reaction among boxers was swift, which is 
more than can be said for most boxers. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Holmes said, "How can George fight some old, out-of-shape sportswriter 
when there are plenty of old, out-of-shape fighters to fight?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Tyson said, "I've been with bars of soap tougher than most 
sportswriters." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Moorer said, "Huh? What? What time is it? Where am I?" 
</P>
<P>
 Evander Holyfield said, "I thought George had already promised to be in the 
Thanksgiving Day parade -- as a float." 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad Ali said, "Float like a butterball. Sting like a beet. George found 
himself another turkey to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for myself, I had serious doubts that any governing body would 
sanction this bout, including the WBA, WBO, HBO or GOP. But promoters Bob Arum 
and Don King agreed to approve the fight under boxing's new We Got Nobody 
Better clause. 
</P>
<P>
 "What type of fighter are you?" Arum asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Type O," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's your trainer?" King asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jenny Craig," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do you work out?" Arum asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baskin-Robbins," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "What will we call this fight?" King asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Thrilla in Vanilla," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 Main reason I wanted this fight was to contradict everyone who had the nerve 
to call the Foreman-Moorer fight a fix. I sat 10 feet from that ring, and the 
only thing anybody fixed was Moorer's nose. If he's a fake, he fakes bleeding 
really well. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fight, I wrote the champion's epitaph -- Here Lies Michael Moorer; 
Two Slugs From George Foreman; No Michael; No More. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I began thinking of possible opponents for Foreman, who hopes to defend 
his title several more times before reaching boxing's mandatory retirement age 
of 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Names I quickly eliminated included Joe Frazier, Joe Frazier's sons, George 
Burns, Tommy Morrison, Tony Danza, Robert Shapiro, Mark Gastineau, Brigitte 
Nielsen, Oscar De La Hoya, Oscar de la Renta, Joe Frazier's grandsons, any 
American without proper health care and the winner of the Mickey Rourke-Hotel 
Security showdown at Trump Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I thought, "What about me?" 
</P>
<P>
 I submitted myself to an examination by the state of Nevada Boxing 
Commission's medical director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say 'Ahhh,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ahhh," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You pass," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I had my own doctor examine me. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're in no shape for this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no shape to fight George Foreman?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no shape for this examination," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 My attorney also objected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you lost your mind?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you paid my bill?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have a nice fight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 My editor's reaction surprised me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppose you get killed?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppose I do?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you know what happens when an athlete kills a sportswriter?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a misdemeanor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody can discourage me. This is my one chance at winning a championship. I 
will make headlines of my own. I will be fighting an older man. I will avoid 
his punch. George Foreman is one of the few professional athletes in the world 
I can outrun, the others mainly being in Sumo wrestling and senior golf. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, I will try women's professional tennis. Many of them I can also 
defeat, just before they turn 15. More Mike Downey

RAMS CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE; NFL: PLAYERS DOWNPLAY NOTION OF A CROSS-TOWN 
RIVALRY, SAY RAIDERS ARE JUST ANOTHER SUNDAY OPPONENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raider week. In Kansas City, Denver and San Diego, the women and children are 
packed off to stay with relatives. Pregame hype prompts players to talk 
excitedly about the anticipated brawl, the unbridled hatred they have for 
football's renowned cheap-shot artists and the desire to make them eat dirt 
come Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The locker room bulletin board is burdened with nasty Raider rhetoric to 
agitate the hometown athletes. In response, someone questions Al Davis' genius, 
another cautions teammates not to be suckered into a fight and all agree the 
Raider rivalry is something special. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Orange County, the Raiders are just another football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rivalry? The Raiders?" said Anthony Newman, Ram defensive captain. "Yeah, you 
got that skeleton on their helmets and they're bad guys, ugly guys, villains. 
But come on, they're just another football team -- no uglier than us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now when we go up against the 49ers, that's a different story. They are 
uglier. They are in our division and we want what they have. The Raiders have 
nothing we want." 
</P>
<P>
 There are bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see those guys all the time when we go out to the clubs," wide receiver 
Flipper Anderson said. "So just to have bragging rights and be tops with the 
girls in the city, that's something. But other than that, I don't see it as a 
rivalry. I think you will see more fights in the stands than on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The battle for L.A. has attracted a sold-out audience at Anaheim Stadium for 
the first time since 1992. And although the players don't seem whipped into a 
frenzy, extra stadium security has been hired to referee any disputes between 
the Hatfields and McCoys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the fans in the preseason going at it, but I'm not really into this 
Raider rivalry thing," Ram defensive end Fred Stokes said. "I watch TV and I 
still get pumped up watching Dallas because of my days playing in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the Raiders? They say we're going to fight this team, but I don't have 
anything against them. I'm just a visitor here, and it's just another game we 
have to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Slater is the true-blue Ram with historical perspective. He played the 
Raiders while they still hailed from Oakland and has been in uniform for six of 
the seven games played between the teams, including the four since the Raiders' 
move to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater has blocked Lyle Alzado, John Matuszak, Ted Hendricks and Howie Long, 
and although most of his teammates plead ignorance, he not only knows who Otis 
Sistrunk was, but also played against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Raiders have traditionally had the reputation of being a bunch of 
fighting, scrapping, cheap-shotting guys, but you know what? I can't remember 
having a game with them where we experienced that," Slater said. "When we play 
the Raiders, all I get is a dose of hard-nosed football. There was nobody 
trying to gouge your eyes out. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, I have seen games where they are playing other people and 
you see a lot of things happening that they are known for. I don't know why, 
but when they play us, they just try to kick our butts straight up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders hold a 5-2 series edge, including a 16-6 victory in 1985 in the 
only regular-season game played in Anaheim Stadium, but the present-day Raiders 
have the same record -- 4-5 -- as their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Raiders' mystique comes from the old Raiders," Ram linebacker Joe Kelly 
said. "The Atkinsons, Tatums and Alzados established that attitude, but I don't 
think they have those kind of players anymore. No one is worried about that 
mystique anymore. If you go out there and smash them in the mouth, that 
mystique is over with. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like the Raiders have been dominating the last few years. They've 
been just a so-so team. They have some guys who like to portray that image, but 
I know they're not tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Tough-talking Kelly, of course, is a former Raider, a veteran of weekly trash 
talk who hasn't endorsed "the Raiders are just another team" position in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Raiders don't respect the Rams," Kelly said. "Look at it, it's not like 
they're going to Kansas City. They feel like they will have just as many fans 
as we will have in Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because they own L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "They own L.A. until Sunday," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the Rams this will be their first regular-season collision with 
the Raiders. They do not understand Kelly's war, and a so-called commitment to 
excellence doesn't mean much after watching videotape of dropped passes and 
missed opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you haven't played them, you can't really hate them," Ram running back 
Jerome Bettis said. "Fans can get all into a team and its image, but it's 
different for players because you see areas where they are vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black jerseys don't make you tough. I mean, I don't really buy into the image 
thing, because the way I look at it, we're going to go out there and pound 
those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Spoken like a true Raider opponent.

SPIRIT OF BASEBALL TALKS IMPROVES; STRIKE: RAVITCH'S ROLE IS APPARENTLY 
REDUCED, BUT NO SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE OCCURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives of baseball owners and players noted an improved, civil 
atmosphere during a six-hour negotiating session with special mediator William 
J. Usery on Thursday, but there was no substantive progress and no indication 
either side is prepared to change its position on a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The only discernible change -- aside from the tone -- was the appointment of 
Boston Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington as chairman of the 
owners' negotiating committee, diminishing the presence of chief negotiator 
Richard Ravitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Harrington and Ravitch, whose $750,000-a-year contract expires next 
month, insisted that Ravitch's role hasn't changed, but Philadelphia pitcher 
Curt Schilling, one of nine players to attend the session, said of Ravitch: "He 
didn't say a word the whole time. He just sat there." 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the situation said that Usery has come down on both 
sides at times regarding the frequent sniping and asked the owners to appoint 
one of their own as spokesman and lead negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
 While Harrington's demeanor is far more conciliatory than the sometimes 
abrasive Ravitch, the move appears more cosmetic than substantive, the source 
said, since there is no hint of change in the owners' position on the cap or 
the plan to implement it unilaterally if there is no agreement by Dec. 20, the 
deadline to tender 1995 contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's bargaining session at a resort in Rye Brook, N.Y., was only the 
sixth since the players went on strike Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Usery characterized it as constructive and said: "We have a long way to go to 
reach an agreement, but in some areas there is a lot of consensus." 
</P>
<P>
 Union leader Donald Fehr said he wasn't sure he would call it a consensus. "To 
the extent there was agreement, it was only to say we might have done better 
with our approach to this issue or that issue," he said.

MORNING BRIEFING: WHAT'S NEXT, BILLY SIMS FOR PRESIDENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state of Oklahoma is apparently fertile ground for former football players 
who want to become politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Victorious Republican Congressional candidates Tuesday included former Sooner 
quarterback J.C. Watts and former Tulsa wide receiver Steve Largent. And the 
current lieutenant governor is former Sooner quarterback Jack Mildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who were the five original members of the Baseball Hall of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
 Say what?In his report on the New York City Marathon, John Jeansonne of 
Newsday called German Silva's victory after surviving a wrong turn into Central 
Park "a little like Houdini locking himself in a trunk and being thrown into a 
lake, only to wiggle his way free before drowning." 
</P>
<P>
 Two and two make . . .: TV announcer and former quarterback Joe Theismann, 
during last Sunday's Raider-Chief game: "It's third and three for the Raiders. 
Illegal motion. They're penalized five yards. Now it's third and nine." 
</P>
<P>
 Viewer Ed Gilbert wonders if Theismann took math at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret weapon: Oregon's Kevin Parker sniffed a rose and otherwise mugged for 
television cameras after the Ducks' 34-10 victory over Arizona State at Eugene 
last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It smells nice, baby. We're two games away, baby," said the freshman 
tailback, who had not played a down that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistaken identity: Tired of being mistaken for Swedish professional golfer 
Liselotte Neumann, fellow pro Dottie Mochrie changed her look, going from 
blonde to redhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Tit for tat: Washington State Coach Mike Price, when told that defensive 
tackle Chad Eaton had criticized the Cougars' man-to-man coverage of 6-foot-4 
USC receiver Keyshawn Johnson with shorter cornerbacks in their 23-10 loss to 
the Trojans, replied: "I guess we could have put Chad Eaton back there covering 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mother's pride: When Trent Dilfer, a former star at Aptos High, came home as 
Tampa Bay's multimillion-dollar rookie quarterback to play the 49ers in 
Candlestick Park, his family, friends, former teammates and coaches were there. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer's play was disappointing and he was benched in the fourth quarter, but 
his mother, Marcie Lynch, was proud of her son when, as Santa Cruz Sentinel 
writer Brent Ainsworth reported, she watched a small girl ask Dilfer for his 
autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of thing is what pleases me the most," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One man's view: Mark Messier, the great New York Ranger center who has played 
on six Stanley Cup winners -- five with Edmonton and last year with the Rangers 
-- is philosophical about the hockey lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 "If things don't work out, I can say I won the Stanley Cup on my way out," he 
said. "There are worse ways to end a career." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1911, Jim Thorpe kicked four field goals to lead 
the Carlisle Indian School to an 18-15 upset of nationally ranked Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, Ty Cobb and Walter 
Johnson.

Boston Celtics: "The people are nicer. I haven't been given the finger here,

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: ONCE AGAIN, THERE'S NO WAY FOR LOCAL FANS TO OUTFOX 
NFL RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has to be said once more: The NFL's no-doubleheader rule is stupid, 
antiquated, asinine and unfair -- particularly to people living in two-team 
markets such as Los Angeles and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the rule, which forbids one network from televising two games in a 
market where an NFL game is being played, Fox can't televise Sunday's 
Dallas-San Francisco game in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The network's lone telecast has to be a 10 a.m. game because the Raider-Ram 
sellout at Anaheim will be on NBC at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 What's behind the no-doubleheader rule? The NFL's original thinking was that a 
television doubleheader could hurt attendance at the local game. But how many 
people would actually consider staying home if there were one more game on 
television? 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody with the NFL will say it, but maybe the rule has been kept, despite 
public outcry, because the league knew it was getting into the pay-per-view 
business. That began this season with the Sunday Ticket packages for satellite 
dish owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL hasn't wavered when it comes to the no-doubleheader rule. It would 
probably take an act of Congress to get the NFL to drop it. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to see the Cowboys and 49ers on Sunday and don't own a dish, 
you'll have to find a sports bar that is showing it.

 Why didn't the NFL give Dallas-San Francisco to ABC as a Monday night game? 
Well, Fox didn't fork over $1.58 billion to get second-rate games.

 Speaking of antiquated thinking, isn't it about time the Lakers stopped their 
longtime practice of delaying telecasts of road games in the East? 
</P>
<P>
 The old thinking was that the delays gave fans a chance to get through rush 
hour and home before the games started. But the days of rush hour ending by 6 
p.m. are long gone, and people now have VCRs if they don't want to miss the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more ridiculous than the Lakers' delayed telecasts are their delayed 
radio broadcasts.

 CNN landmark: ESPN's "SportsCenter" is a viewing habit for many sports fans, 
and Prime Ticket's "Press Box" has made inroads as a local half-hour news show. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is CNN's "Sports Tonight" with Fred Hickman and Nick Charles, 
who will do their 3,000th show together tonight at 8. 
</P>
<P>
 They did their first on June 1, 1980, the day the show made its debut. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're tired of Keith Olbermann and the gang at ESPN and all their cutesy 
little sayings and puns, Hickman and Charles are a good alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 They come across as if they really like one another. And you know what? They 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't fake chemistry," said Charles, 48. "He brings out the best in me, 
and I think it's the other way around too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're more than just good friends. I truly love the guy. We never play that 
game of one-upmanship. We talk to each other and listen to each other for eight 
hours a day, and the last half-hour we do the show together." 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman, 38, left the show for nearly two years in the mid-'80s to work in 
local television in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated the town, had bad experiences there," Hickman said. "I hated working 
in local television. I hated the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I belonged in Atlanta with Nick. I knew that is where I felt most 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Why did he leave in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 26 at the time and feeling 10 feet tall and bulletproof," Hickman said. 
"It was a little more money and I thought I needed a change." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles said he once came close to leaving, but now says, "I don't want to go 
anywhere else. This is home for me." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Charles, a Chicago native who graduated from an inner-city trade school, was a 
cabdriver when he talked his way into getting an audition for a sportscasting 
job at the television station in Springfield, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 24 at the time. He got the job, which paid $135 a week, $65 less than 
he had been making driving the cab. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't know it at the time, but there was a 14-year-old kid named Fred 
Hickman living in Springfield at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman grew up and went to Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He wanted to be 
a radio disc jockey, but ended up landing a job as a sports anchor at the same 
Springfield television station, WICS, where Charles began his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman is sometimes referred to as the "play-of-the-day-guy." His 
play-of-the-day gimmick was the brainchild of a producer at "Sports Tonight." 
Hickman didn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a ridiculous idea, and spoofed on it," he said. "But it 
didn't go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman apparently is doing something right. He is the 1994 winner of the 
Cable Ace award for best sports anchor in cable television. And "Sports 
Tonight" won Ace awards in 1986 and '87. TV-Radio Notes

 CBS, which is using figure skating to counter football programming on other

"Ice Wars: The USA vs. the World." The first segment was Wednesday night, the 
second will be Saturday, 9-11 p.m. CBS is expecting ratings of 12-13, and if it 
gets them, expect more of the same. Maybe the day isn't too far off when we

 Arizona-USC is on ABC Saturday at 12:30 p.m., with ESPN carrying UCLA-Arizona

Oregon at Stanford. The Prime Network's Pac-10 game Nov. 19 will be Washington 
at Washington State. . . . At least part of the KNX radio broadcast of last 
Saturday's USC-Washington State game sounded as if the engineer had fallen 
asleep. The flaws included commercials being overlapped by station promos, and 
announcers Pete Arbogast and Fred Gallagher being heard talking into a live 
mike during a commercial break. Also, at one point Arbogast went into a spiel 
about how Arizona State could easily end up in the Rose Bowl. He was cut short 
when Gallagher pointed out Arizona State was losing big to Oregon at the time.

 After undergoing a series of tests late Wednesday night, quarterback Chris 
Miller was reassured by doctors that he has suffered no serious damage from his 
concussion three weeks ago against New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had suffered from post-concussion syndrome and complained of headaches, 
dizziness and problems focusing since hitting the back of his helmet the 
Superdome artificial turf after a tackle by the Saints' Ernest Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said MRI and CAT scan tests showed no damage, adding that doctors 
thought some of his problems could have been from whiplash. 
</P>
<P>
 "My neck muscles have been real tight but I haven't paid much attention to 
it," he said. "Apparently, they have been squeezing off my nerves or arteries 
to my brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think everything brain-wise is fine. There's no damage on my brain cells 
or whatever the hell they're looking for."

 Coach Chuck Knox said team officials spoke with the NFL office about a 
malfunction in Chandler's helmet headset that prevented him from calling for a 
pass on second and goal from the Denver one. 
</P>
<P>
 The helmet headset allows coaches to relay plays from the sideline, but 
Chandler's didn't work. He misread a hand signal from the sideline and called 
the wrong play. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox has considered dumping the helmet headsets, as some NFL teams have done, 
and using hand signals. 
</P>

 Although Darryl Ashmore and Jackie Slater are available at tackle, rookie 
Wayne Gandy still start at right tackle. Knox expects Slater to be able to play 
Sunday after being out because of a torn triceps muscle. Slater played on 
special teams against Denver, but Knox wanted him to test the triceps injury in 
practice before playing tackle in a game situation. MIKE REILLEY

 When Raider defensive lineman Jerry Ball confronts Ram running back Jerome 
Bettis on the field Sunday, there may be plenty of ferocity, but no animosity. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis and Ball have met many times before in friendlier circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bettis, a Detroit native and star running back at Notre Dame, was 
considering leaving school after his junior year, he and his parents went to 
Ball, then a Detroit Lion, for advice on jumping early into pro football. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that he went to Ball and others told Ball that Bettis had a good 
chance of succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all starts with the home and the parents," said Ball, who has maintained 
the friendship formed with the Bettis family. "They keep him level-headed. They 
went around and got the information they would need to make the proper 
decision. He has stability and a firm foundation." STEVE SPRINGER

RAM SUITORS HAVE ANOTHER TEAM TO COURT IN BUCCANEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams might soon have company in the NFL's highly competitive relocation 
market after Thursday's announcement that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials running the Buccaneers said they would prefer to sell to someone who 
would keep the team in Tampa, Fla., but did not make that a condition of sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Angelos, the Baltimore Oriole owner who is attempting to purchase a 
minority share of the Rams and move them to Maryland, said he would renew his 
pursuit of the Buccaneers. Earlier this year he offered an estimated $200 
million for the franchise Financial World magazine estimates is worth $142 
million in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, we have an interest, and clearly, we intend to pursue it," said 
Angelos, who is expected to travel to Los Angeles soon to resume talks with Ram 
President John Shaw and, perhaps, Raider owner Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis investors also have expressed interest in the Buccaneers this year 
and are expected to renew their pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, meanwhile, continue to focus their attention on St. Louis. Former 
U.S. Senator Thomas Eagleton, lead negotiator for the group trying to bring NFL 
football to St. Louis, was in Southern California Thursday to meet with Shaw, 
and the two are expected to resume negotiations today. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Shaw nor Eagleton was available for comment Thursday. The St. Louis 
Post-Dispatch, citing an unidentified source, reported Thursday that Stan 
Kroenke, a Columbia, Mo., businessman who is attempting to purchase a minority 
interest in the Rams, was in Los Angeles this week to meet with Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroenke is poised to buy up to 40% of the team at an estimated cost of $80 
million, and he and Shaw are said to be close to a resolution on a buyout 
clause that would allow Kroenke, if the Rams move to St. Louis, to purchase the 
remaining interest in the Rams at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Newport Beach sports agent Leigh Steinberg, co-chairman of 
the Save the Rams task force, said he might meet with Shaw next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to flesh out all aspects of our proposal and specifically show them 
how we will guarantee profits for years to come," Steinberg said.  
</P>
<P>
 The local offer includes a $60-million renovation of Anaheim Stadium, new 
practice facility and business-backed guarantees on luxury-suite and 
season-ticket sales, a package Steinberg claims will assure the Rams profits of 
$15 million to $20 million annually. The Rams are projecting losses of about $6 
million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still here and fighting," Steinberg said. "We're still optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 The possible sale of the Buccaneers had been rumored for more than a year, 
even before owner Hugh Culverhouse died Aug. 25 of cancer. But the trustees 
appointed by Culverhouse to operate the team and his other assets said 
repeatedly in recent months that they were not taking offers. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed this week in the face of conflicts between the trustees and 
Culverhouse's heirs, as well as dismal performance by the team. The team's 2-7 
record and paltry attendance -- averaging 44,619 so far this year with only 
23,000 season tickets -- are among the NFL's worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The heirs want to keep the team in Tampa and will have to approve a deal, the 
source said. Steve Story, one of the three trustees overseeing the Buccaneers 
and the rest of Culverhouse's $360-million estate, said the trustees wanted to 
begin seeking a buyer now so the new owner could prepare for the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Story has said there is no provision in Culverhouse's will that restricts the 
sale to local investors. But he said Thursday: "I am very aware of the 
importance of the Buccaneers to this area." 
</P>
<P>
 NFL rules -- the legality of which are hotly debated -- require approval of 
three-quarters of the other team owners before a franchise can be sold or move. 
</P>

FLORA'S HARD LUCK CONTINUES; BASEBALL: SECOND BASEMAN HURTS WRIST WHILE TRYING 
TO PROVE TO ANGELS HE HAS MAJOR LEAGUE TALENT. 
</P>

 Kevin Flora walked into the clubhouse Thursday morning, slumped back against 
his locker, and groaned aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 Please, Lord, not now.  
</P>
<P>
 Come on, haven't I suffered enough?  
</P>
<P>
 Why, always me?  
</P>
<P>
 Flora shut his eyes and grimaced. Fate has dealt him yet another cruel hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, in the midst of trying to prove to the Angels and the rest of baseball 
that he can still be a major league player, was diagnosed Wednesday night with 
torn ligaments and torn cartilage in his left wrist. He will be in a cast four 
weeks. If it is not healed by December, surgery will be required. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, who was leading the Arizona Fall League with a .475 on-base percentage, 
and was batting .333, won't be playing baseball again until next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Hello, nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Kevin again. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else can go wrong for the guy?" said Angel pitcher Mark Holzemer, who's 
sharing a house with Flora. "After everything he's gone through, and now this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, God, why Kevin?" 
</P>
<P>
 Holzemer, perhaps Flora's best friend in baseball, understands as much as 
anyone the pain and torment Flora has endured the last 1 1/2 years. They were 
together that night, April 22, 1993, when the phone call came into the 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The call informed Flora that his wife, MaryAnn, was killed in a one-car 
accident outside Van Horn, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost all desire in life that day," Flora said, "and it's taken a long time 
for me to recover. I thought, at first, baseball would help me. But it got to a 
point where I didn't even want anything to do with the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, the way I felt this summer, I didn't think I'd ever be 
putting on another baseball uniform in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, I never would have imagined this." 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, who missed almost the rest of the 1993 season after his wife's death, 
was supposed to play in the Arizona Fall League last winter. He accepted the 
invitation, but later dropped out, saying he needed more time. The healing 
process was not complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora took the winter off, came to spring training, and declared himself ready 
to become the Angels' starting second baseman. The Angels, believing Flora was 
ready, announced the job would be his to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had every reason to believe it would turn out all right . . . until 
the first spring-training game against the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora suited up, grabbed his glove, stood for the national anthem, started 
thinking about MaryAnn, and began to sob. He could not play. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind," Flora said, "I thought I was ready to play. I thought I could 
handle it. Instead, all I was doing was suppressing those feelings all spring." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels stuck with Flora until the final week of spring training when they 
decided he was not ready for the big leagues. The Angels sent him back to 
triple-A Vancouver, signed Rex Hudler, traded for Harold Reynolds, and 
predicted Flora would be back within a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora never returned. 
</P>
<P>
 He played only six games for Vancouver when, again, he became emotionally 
distraught. Flora left the club and took a leave of absence, traveling back and 
forth between California and MaryAnn's hometown of Midland, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to a point where I just couldn't do it," Flora said. "I didn't want to 
play baseball anymore. I was going to go to college, learn to be a teacher, and 
pretend that I never played the game." 
</P>
<P>
 After counseling and advice from family and friends, Flora decided in July to 
give baseball a final try. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite playing only 107 games the last three seasons, Flora swung the bat in 
the Arizona Fall League as if he never missed a day. He his team-leading 
batting average, ranked him fifth in the league, and he again showed why he's 
one of the fastest runners in the Angel organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The only glaring problem was Flora's defense, prompting the Angels to ask 
Flora if he would consider playing in Puerto Rico the rest of the winter as an 
outfielder. Flora, who struggled making the throw from second base to first 
base, agreed to the switch. The only condition, Flora said, was that he would 
remain in the Arizona Fall League. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes this so frustrating," Flora said, waving his cast. "I was 
hitting the ball well, loving the game again, and now this." 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, who demonstrated enough talent in the fall league for Bavasi to reject 
two trade proposals this week, probably will enter the 1995 spring training as 
a utilityman candidate. He can play all of the infield positions, along with 
left and center field. His winter season may be over, but the impression he 
made will last until spring.

 Ron Perranoski, fired as Dodger pitching coach in September, was named minor 
league pitching coordinator by the San Francisco Giants on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Perranoski had been a coach in the Dodger organization since retiring in 1973 
after 13 seasons as a relief pitcher. He was the Dodgers' major league pitching 
coach for 14 seasons and a minor league pitching coach for seven years before 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Perranoski's firing came as a surprise. As pitching coach, his staffs finished 
with the first- or second-best earned run averages in the National League nine 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Perranoski was replaced by Dave Wallace after Fred Claire, executive vice 
president, decided that Wallace could better relate to the Dodgers' younger 
pitchers.

SOUTH GATE GETS COACH EXCITED THIS TIME 
</P>

<P>
 When his South Gate High football team defeated Jefferson last Friday, Coach 
Gary Cordray earned his 100th victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cordray downplayed that milestone, placing greater significance on the 
Rams' home game Thursday night against Fremont with first place in the 
Southeastern Conference on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 And significant it was as the Rams pulled off their second big victory in a 
row with a 19-13 win over the Pathfinders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't celebrate when we won number one or 25 or 50," Cordray said. "One 
hundred is just a number. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest win of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate improved to 9-1 overall and 8-0 in the conference; Fremont dropped 
to 8-1, 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The City playoff pairings will be announced today, and both teams are expected 
to make the Division 4-A field. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual for South Gate, defense was the story. The Rams, who give up only 
nine points a game, forced seven Fremont turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The turnovers did us in," Fremont Coach Taja Rodisha said. "We're a young 
team, and we weren't ready to play championship ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont, which had three turnovers in the fourth quarter, had its most costly 
mishap with 3:39 left in the game when defensive back Sergio Velasquez 
recovered a fumble by Vince Thomas -- who scored in the first half on a 90-yard 
run -- and returned it 21 yards for a touchdown giving South Gate a 19-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pathfinders pulled within 19-13 on a 35-yard pass play from quarterback 
Robert Loera to running back Delonte Walker, but could get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate running back Hoffman Cortes had 172 yards and two touchdowns in 25 
carries.

PREP EXTRA / FRIDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; NO. 1 LOS ALAMITOS FINISHES WITH ROUT OF 
HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In what was supposed to be a rebuilding season for Los Alamitos, the Griffins 
have showed few signs of letting up. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos finished an undefeated regular season with a 53-7 victory over 
Huntington Beach Thursday at Veterans Stadium. The Griffins also clinched the 
Sunset League title outright with a 5-0 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory extends Los Alamitos' unbeaten streak to 45 games. The Griffins 
are the top-ranked team in Orange County and third-ranked the Southern Section 
Division I poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos, despite being dominated by juniors and sophomores, has outscored 
opponents, 362-128. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it's amazing that we could be undefeated this year," Los 
Alamitos Coach John Barnes said. "I still say we're an awfully young team." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos broke up a somewhat close game with three touchdowns in the final 
3 minutes 34 seconds of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 After an interception, Los Alamitos had a first down at the Huntington Beach 
33. On the next play, junior quarterback Kevin Feterik completed a touchdown 
pass to junior wide receiver Stan Guyness who was wide open. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair combined for another 33-yard touchdown pass with 1:09 left in the 
half to put Los Alamitos up, 27-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins' final score of the half came when defensive back Damon Houston 
intercepted a pass and went 19 yards for a touchdown with 38 seconds left.  
</P>
<P>
 Feterik completed his night's work with a three-play drive in the third 
quarter. The series started at the Los Alamitos 25. 
</P>
<P>
 His first pass was good for seven yards to Brad Melsby. Feterik then completed 
a 33-yard pass to Tony Hartley and ended the 46-second drive with a 35-yard 
scoring pass to Melsby with 2:40 left in the quarter. The pair had also 
combined on a 37-yard scoring pass at 9:53 in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach's touchdown came on a 77-yard pass play from quarterback 
Jason Bartusick to tight end Billy Campbell with 9:49 left to play. The Oilers 
end 1-9, 0-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik, the top-ranked passer in Orange County, was 13 of 18 for 228 yards 
and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure if we are a good team," Barnes said. "But we are a big-play 
team."

PREP EXTRA / FRIDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; TRABUCO HILLS GETS BREAK, BEATS 
CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This probably won't comfort Capistrano Valey High's Blake Laidlaw too much 
now, but life isn't always fair and that's just the way it goes sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unluckily for Laidlaw, he happened to be the guy whom misfortune floored 
Thursday night when his costly error with 1 minute 1 second left led to Trabuco 
Hills' winning score in a 21-14 South Coast League victory in front of 
approximately 1,500 at Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 With Capistrano Valley at its 30-yard line and only 1 minute 1 second to play 
in a 14-14 tie, Laidlaw, the Cougars' junior long snapper, snapped the ball 
over punter Chris Culbertson's head. Culbertson finally caught up to the ball 
at the Cougars' two-yard line and was tackled there by the Mustangs' De Sha 
Runnels. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, Trabuco Hills running back Bobby Johnson (14 carries for 64 
yards) took the handoff from quarterback Chad Collins and scored to give the 
Mustangs a 20-14 lead. Mike Junge's point-after provided the final point for 
Trabuco Hills (8-2, 4-1 in league). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to tell him to keep his chin up," said Cougar Coach Eric 
Patton, whose team dropped to 5-5 and 2-3. "It's too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley sophomore quarterback Tim Hirchag, who completed only four 
of 14 passes for 51 yards, tried to rally the team with 34 seconds remaining 
and the Cougars at their 26-yard line. But Trabuco Hills defensive back Bryan 
Carter made his second interception of the game with nine seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley sophomore running back Malaefou MacKenzie gained 100 yards 
in 25 carries. He had one rushing touchdown and one on a kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
 MacKenzie caught the second-half kickoff at the Cougar six-yard line. He ran 
through the middle of the Mustangs' coverage team until reaching the Trabuco 
Hills' 40-yard line, where he changed direction and went down the left sideline 
for the remainder of a 94-yard touchdown return. Jason Purvis caught a 
two-point conversion pass from Hirchag to give the Cougars a 14-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mustangs tied the score on their next possession on a 21-yard 
touchdown pass from Collins to Bryan Flournoy and Mike Junge's point-after 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills led, 7-6, after a mostly uneventful first 24 minutes of play. 
Each team scored on its opening drive and then went 0 for the rest of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs appeared poised to take control quickly when running back Johnson 
grabbed a handoff from Pintsak and outran the Cougars' defense into the left 
corner of the end zone with 8:40 remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley closed the half's scoring when MacKenzie ran the ball in 
from the one-yard line with 17 seconds to play in the first quarter.

PREP EXTRA / FRIDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; FULLERTON SHARES LEAGUE TITLE AS TROY'S 
COLLAPSE CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a word, Fullerton persevered while Troy imploded. Which is why the Indians 
are making plans for their first postseason appearance in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two touchdowns and 134 rushing yards by senior back Christopher Young were 
enough to propel Fullerton past the staggering Warriors, 14-7, in front of 600 
Thursday at Fullerton. The victory gives the Indians (6-4, 3-2 in league) a 
share of the Freeway League title with Buena Park, Sonora and Sunny Hills, and 
their first Southern Section playoff berth since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Young also joined the growing list of county backs this season to rush for 
more than 1,000 yards; he has 1,092. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means a lot to the school," Indian Coach Julian Smilowitz said. "It's 
been a long drought." 
</P>
<P>
 For Troy (6-4, 2-3) the season ended on a bitter note. The Warriors -- who 
could claim Rancho Alamitos and Costa Mesa among their victims -- dropped three 
of their last four games to drop out of playoff contention. But when you fumble 
four times -- losing two -- are intercepted twice and collect 80 yards in 
penalties, it's hard to sustain offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't deserve to win," a disappointed Warrior Coach John Turek said. "Not 
when you make the kind of mistakes we did. And that's been the story of our 
lives the past three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Only once did the Warriors break through the Indians' defense. Ryl Relatores, 
back for the first time after a three-week absence because of injury, bolted 32 
yards for a touchdown in the third quarter -- the first time Fullerton has been 
scored on in the third quarter this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Indians, starting out with a first and 26 on their 13 after a clipping 
penalty, still took the ball downfield with Young racing around right end for 
the final 19 yards and a touchdown. He scored off the same play in the second 
quarter, but then it was from nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each time the play was designed to go off-tackle," Young said. "But our line 
really crunched them, and I was able to go outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Troy running back Larry Montgomery -- wearing uniform No. 41 instead of 31 
because his old jersey was tattered and could not be replaced -- rushed for 106 
yards but had two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy enjoyed the better field position in the first half, but had three drives 
stopped by two fumbles and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting quarterback Kevin Gray completed only one pass for the Warriors, and 
that did not come about until Troy's second-to-last drive of the game.

PREP EXTRA / FRIDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; NEWPORT HARBOR SINKS EL TORO, 35-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Giordani responded quickly, getting halfway through his answer, when he 
paused for a long while to consider its conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we're beat," he said, "you can't say anyone's better than us." 
</P>
<P>
 So it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor won its 10th game without a loss Thursday night in front of 
about 1,600, overwhelming El Toro, 35-14. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors already had clinched the Sea View League title, but with their 
victory, they broke a 52-year-old school record for consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1942 Sailors began the season 9-0, then lost their first playoff game 
against Bonita. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 1994 Sailors (10-0, 5-0) win their first playoff game -- and they 
should be seeded No. 1 in the Division V playoffs -- they will match the best 
victory total in school history when the '92 team won 11. 
</P>
<P>
 That should be a piece of cake, especially if Newport Harbor gets the kind of 
performance it did against El Toro, including a pair of bookend touchdown runs 
by Brian Johnson that gave him some amazing numbers: six rushes, 194 yards, two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson scored on the game's first play when he took a simple handoff to the 
right side -- and went 84 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter, Newport Harbor no doubt trying to run out the clock to 
protect a 14-point lead with 9 minutes 33 seconds to play, Johnson took a 
simple handoff to the left -- and went 73 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Between, the Sailors did what they do best -- play error-free ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're 10-0 because there's no one guy (who is a star)," Giordani said. "No 
one is more important than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident as the game progressed. The second touchdown drive consisted 
of Edon Kagasoff rushing six times for 51 yards, and then Giordani throwing a 
little pass to Matt Riggle, who ran in for the 11-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
 And when El Toro (5-4-1, 2-2-1) cut the lead to 14-7 with 2:04 left in the 
half on Jamie Hanaway's one-yard run, Newport Harbor responded by scoring with 
25 seconds to go. On that drive -- it covered 64 yards -- Kagasoff carried 
twice for 17 yards, Giordani threw seven yards to Jon Benzinger, Johnson 
carried for 17 and then Giordani hit Danny Pulido for a 23-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one was the key one," Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley said. "We 
responded to them; we came right back. Any time you can do that, it gets you 
back in the hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Or it helps to finish the kill. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor added another touchdown in the third when, on an El Toro punt 
from the 34, the ball was snapped over Wilson's head; he tried to fall on it, 
but it squirted away from him. Scott Sandstrom finally fell on it -- in the end 
zone. Jeff Pardy's fourth extra point made it 28-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a better team than we are," El Toro Coach Mike Milner said, "and they 
proved it tonight."

 When he's playing against Shaquille O'Neal, Patrick Ewing usually finds a way 
to win. Thursday night in New York provided yet another example. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing, hampered by four fouls for most of the second half, got open for a 
17-foot fadeaway jumper with two seconds left to give the New York Knicks a 
101-99 victory over the Orlando Magic, spoiling a 41-point, 17-rebound night by 
O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just playing my game," said Ewing, who had 24 points but only two 
rebounds and one block in 26 minutes. "I got in foul trouble, and Orlando made 
a good run for the lead." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal scored eight points in a row to cut New York's lead to 99-97 with 49 
seconds remaining. He grabbed a defensive rebound, then muscled inside for a 
basket to tie the score with 11 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Knick guard John Starks drove upcourt before passing to Ewing on the right 
wing, where Ewing launched his game-winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal said the last play took the Magic a bit by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were going to call a timeout," he said. "We were kind of in 
limbo. Starks penetrated, and I went to get Starks. Patrick made a great shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Oakley scored 16 points and had 12 rebounds for New York. Anfernee 
Hardaway scored 27 and Nick Anderson 19 for the Magic. 
</P>

LOS ALAMITOS; AQHA CHALLENGE COULD DETERMINE TOP AGED MARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonight is AQHA Challenge Championship night at Los Alamitos, with horses from 
across the country competing for more than $350,000 in purse money. Ten of the 
12 races are stakes, including the $100,000 AQHA Challenge Championship.  
</P>
<P>
 The Grade I AQHA Challenge Championship figures to be one of the pivotal races 
in determining the year's champion aged mare. Expected starters in the race are 
championship contenders Sound Dash, Junos Request and Down With Debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound Dash and Junos Request have raced each other often in the Midwest, with 
both mares dominating. Their main rival may prove to be morning-line favorite 
Down With Debt, undefeated at Los Alamitos this year. The Challenge 
Championship will be the first race in which all three mares are running this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine other stakes will feature such horses as three-time distance champion 
Griswold, Los Alamitos Championship winner Brotherly, Vessels Maturity winner 
Avison, Southern California Derby winner Artesias Special Gal and the top 
870-yard runner, Mr Diddy Wa Diddy.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the best female racehorses at Los Alamitos can be found in the barn of 
one man, trainer Charlie Bloomquist. Bloomquist conditions not only Down With 
Debt but also has the tough freshman filly Ah Sigh, whose most recent 
accomplishment was a stunning victory in last Friday's $185,000 Ed Burke 
Memorial Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah Sigh, owned by Frank Nakamura, has been drawing attention since her debut 
April 23, when she broke her maiden by three-quarters of a length. When she 
easily won a trial for the Grade II Miss Kindergarten Futurity, then returned 
to post an effortless victory in the June 25 final, the verdict was in -- Ah 
Sigh was one tough filly. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no surprise, then, that Ah Sigh was favored in the final of the 
Governor's Cup Futurity. The surprise was that she finished third, suffering 
her first defeat. The reason soon came clear to Bloomquist. Ah Sigh had been 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a little temperature and wasn't feeling good," Bloomquist said. "We 
thought it was better to give her a little time off." 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-month rest, Ah Sigh reappeared Oct. 21 in the trials for the Grade 
I Ed Burke and won the first trial by 1 3/4 lengths in 17.57 seconds, the 
fastest time of the meeting for a 2-year-old filly. Then last Friday, the 
speedy filly won the Ed Burke Memorial Futurity by three lengths in 17.63 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . I don't believe I've ever had a 2-year-old that had everything together 
and was as big and as strong and as willing as Ah Sigh," Bloomquist said. 
"(When she races), she acts like a 4-year-old. Around the barn, she doesn't act 
like a 2-year-old, she acts like an old horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomquist, with no horses entered on last Sunday's card, celebrated Ah Sigh's 
victory and his daughter's first birthday at Disneyland, and he may be 
celebrating again tonight if Down With Debt continues her winning campaign in 
the AQHA Challenge Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Down With Debt is trying for her first year-end award after losing the 
champion 3-year-old filly title last year to multiple stakes winner Royal Down 
Dash, who is also a probable starter in the AQHA Challenge Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everybody gets a fair chance and you get outrun, then you get outrun," 
said Bloomquist. "I feel they have to outrun (Down With Debt) right now. Until 
somebody beats (her), I think she's the best." Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Kits Merrilimits finished third in the fifth race on Oct. 1, but was 
disqualified last Friday because of a positive drug test. Trainer Bonifacio 
Rayas and owner Edgar Maldonado were suspended for 30 days each because of the 
positive test and each was fined $1,000. . . . Jockey G.R. Carter won five 
races -- four in succession -- last Saturday night. . . . Time For Royal Cash's 
victory in the $131,600 Golden State Derby last Saturday made him the first 
horse since Tolltac in 1983 and '84 to win both the Golden State Futurity and 
Derby.

TAFT'S POLK MAKES A BIG IMPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What was billed as a showdown between tailbacks Jerry Brown of Taft High and 
Antwane Smith of Kennedy instead turned into a stage for the big-play 
capability of Taft's DaShon Polk. 
</P>
<P>
 Polk caught five passes for 79 yards and a touchdown and returned a kickoff 92 
yards for another score as the host Toreadors defeated Kennedy, 32-12, Thursday 
night in a North Valley League game. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the ninth in a row for Taft (9-1, 7-0 in Northwest Valley 
conference play) since a 20-19 loss to Crespi in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was talking about, 'Jerry Brown this, and Antwane Smith that,' " 
said Polk, a 6-foot-3, 215-pound wide receiver-defensive back. "It was like 
they all forgot about me. I mean, I've caught some touchdown passes this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft had a 20-12 lead midway through the fourth quarter when Polk made his 
final clutch play. 
</P>
<P>
 On fourth and 16 from the Kennedy 37-yard line, he caught a 30-yard pass from 
quarterback Dayon Shaw to give the Toreadors a first down on the seven. Two 
plays later, Shaw scored on a one-yard sneak to give Taft a 26-12 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do anything fancy on that play," said Polk, who has 24 receptions 
for 382 yards and seven touchdowns this season. "I just ran to the first-down 
marker and caught the ball. But they were giving me a lot of room. I guess it 
was because I had been running those fade routes all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who rushed for 188 yards and two touchdowns in 21 carries, gave Taft 
its final margin with a 84-yard run with 1 minute 37 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Polk gave the Toreadors a 6-0 lead with 7:33 left in the first quarter when he 
caught a nine-yard pass from Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy (6-4, 4-3) cut the deficit to 14-6 with 2:17 remaining in the first 
half when Damion Thompson scored on a one-yard run, but Polk returned the 
ensuing kickoff for a score. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who had rushed for 1,465 yards entering the game, was held to 21 yards 
in nine carries before leaving because of a strained left knee late in the 
second quarter. He did not return. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's Jaret Harris scored on a 58-yard run in the second half and finished 
with 89 yards.

WESTLAKE VICTORY JUST ICING; MARMONTE: WARRIORS COMPLETE UNBEATEN LEAGUE SEASON 
AND WARM UP FOR PLAYOFFS, 28-6. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Benkert has been soaked in ice water twice already this season, and if 
things continue to go well for the Westlake High football coach, it'll happen 
one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Benkert was drenched after the Warriors beat Agoura, 28-6, on Thursday night 
at Thousand Oaks High. The game finished off Westlake's perfect Marmonte League 
season and the Warriors' first league title since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Benkert, who was also doused after a victory over Thousand Oaks, will take the 
Warriors, who are ranked second in Division III of the Southern Section, into 
the playoffs next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got four more games to go and we're going to play each like it's our 
last and hopefully win (the Southern Section title)," said Westlake's Billy 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's confidence level is up because the Warriors have been playing well 
lately in nearly all aspects of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake (9-1, 7-0 in the league) rolled up 301 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Scott Spruill completed 12 of 19 passes for 127 yards and a 
touchdown. Miller caught four passes for 39 yards and Mike Leibin caught six 
passes for 72 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Harris rushed for 88 yards in 10 carries and scored a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake's defense nearly posted a shutout, allowing only a fourth-quarter 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive back Steve Aylsworth helped keep Agoura off the scoreboard for most 
of the game, intercepting three passes, all deep in Westlake territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Aylsworth has seven interceptions this season, including three against Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura (5-5, 4-3) struggled early, but its offense picked up as the game went 
on. Quarterback Eric Fitzgerald completed 14 of 28 passes for 150 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura running back Tommy Kim, who gained 250 yards last week, managed only 36 
in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers, who got off to a 3-1 start in league play, must hope for an 
at-large bid to playoffs. They needed a victory, and help, to get in 
automatically, and chances for the former seemed to evaporate in the first 
quarter Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake's Jason Victor returned the opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 After Agoura ran three plays and punted, Westlake drove 54 yards on its next 
possession for another score, a 20-yard pass to Miller, giving Westlake a 14-0 
lead not five minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake added another first-half touchdown on a 15-yard run by Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors took a 28-0 lead in the fourth quarter when backup quarterback 
Brian Shubin threw a five-yard scoring pass to Victor.

HARVARD SPEEDS TO PLAYOFF WIN; WATER POLO: DUFF LEADS WOLVERINES OVER ANAHEIM 
CANYON, 20-12, IN FIRST-ROUND MATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Water polo is a lot like basketball: If speed and conditioning are your team's 
forte, run. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, swim. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake High took advantage of its attributes and beat Anaheim 
Canyon, 20-12, in a Southern Section Division I first-round playoff match 
Thursday at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines (21-5) scored most of their goals on counterattacks, 
particularly during an 8-1 run that put a close game away in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exciting water polo," Harvard Coach Rich Corso said. "You play good 
defense and get the kids to anticipate and then you look for numbers -- 
two-on-ones and three-on-twos." 
</P>
<P>
 A typical exchange during the third quarter went something like this: Harvard 
forces a turnover or stops a shot. The Wolverines sprint quickly to the other 
end of the pool while their goalie fires a long pass. Canyon defenders, 
scrambling furiously to get back, look to see who they were supposed to be 
covering just as an open Harvard player scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did fine for two-and-a-half quarters," Canyon Coach Mike Giles said, "but 
then we ran out of gas and they got some counters on us. We just got tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior driver Jimmy Duff, a preseason All-American, led Harvard with six 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the third quarter we just showed that we were the better-conditioned 
team," said Duff, who competes in triathlons. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard, the fifth-ranked team in Division I, will play fourth-ranked 
Foothill, a 15-7 winner over Mission Viejo, on Tuesday in the quarterfinals at 
a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon (18-7), which finished third in the Century League, was making its 
first playoff appearance in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Jeff Hamilton, who scored five goals, Canyon was ahead, 3-1, early and 
pulled to within 10-9 with 5 minutes 24 seconds to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Harvard put the game away. Ricki Rauth scored twice and Duff once 
-- all on counterattacks -- in the next 88 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton scored for Canyon, then the Wolverines finished the quarter with four 
consecutive goals. 
</P>
<P>
 J.J. Arden scored four goals and Rauth and Brett Hool each had three for 
Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Lozano and Brad Schaefer each scored two goals for Canyon.

JUNIOR COLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW; CONFERENCE CALL: CANYONS' CUNNAN IS 
BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you think forward Rebekah Cunnan of College of the Canyons was tough last 
season, just wait until she takes the floor this year. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be difficult to imagine, Canyons Coach Greg Herrick says, but the 
5-foot-9 sophomore is stronger and quicker than 1993-94 when she led the 
Cougars (18-13, 10-0 in Western State Conference play) to the WSC South 
Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's just a workhorse," Herrick said. "We can't be successful without her on 
the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunnan led the conference in scoring (24 points a game) last season and ranked 
among the league's top 10 rebounders (8.8 a game). 
</P>
<P>
 She's also a strong defensive player who usually guards the opponents' top 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just does everything," Herrick said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember anyone in our conference who works as hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons has two other returning starters who, combined with the addition of an 
All-City Section point guard and a 6-4 center, will give the team a big boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlisa Hamagaki is back at guard and Wendy Wiggins at forward. Hamagaki 
averaged 12 points last season and Wiggins averaged 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Kyetra Brown, a three-time All-City selection from Jefferson High, 
will start at point guard, with freshman Kerri Garland (Kennedy) at center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kyetra may be the best point guard I've coached in 10 years," Herrick said. 
"She is a phenom. She's a great passer and she is fast." 
</P>
<P>
 The team's other key players are freshman forward Stephanie Labor (Crescenta 
Valley) and 6-1 freshman center Cathy Noriega.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars play host to Fullerton in their opener Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at other area teams: GLENDALE 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Kathy Pudelko, fifth season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 11-14 
</P>
<P>
 This is the tallest team Pudelko has had at Glendale.  
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros will start 6-2 Heather Green (Crescenta Valley) at power forward. 
Judith Nagy (6-2) plays the other forward and her sister, Monica Nagy (6-0), is 
at center.  
</P>
<P>
 Both played at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a lot from them," Pudelko said. "They are both great players." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Cindy Thai and Debbie Magana return at guard.  
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Keri Peterson (La Crescenta High) gives Glendale back-court depth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros play host to Antelope Valley tonight. MOORPARK 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Lisa Ziegler, third season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 13-16 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have little depth so they must dictate the tempo in order to win, 
according to Ziegler. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're few in numbers so we're going to be very patient," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's top returners are forward Janette Oriza, who averaged 17 points a 
game last season, point guard Joy Garcia, who scored 15 a game, and guard Misty 
Goodnight, who averaged nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Oriza is also a solid rebounder and plays tough in the lane.  
</P>
<P>
 Garcia ranked among the WSC's best three-point shooters last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Knox, a 5-10 sophomore from Thousand Oaks, will start at center as will 
Khrysla Scanlon( at forward.  
</P>
<P>
 Scanlon, an Agoura graduate, played at Cal State Dominguez Hills last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders open against state champion Harbor College today in the Chaffey 
tournament. OXNARD 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Alex Flores, fifth season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 8-18 
</P>
<P>
 The most-exciting thing about this team is that it has an on-campus gym to 
call home. In past years the team has practiced and played at high school gyms 
and local recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be great," Flores said. "We're all very thrilled about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard has 10 freshmen, many of whom have been out of school and away from 
competitive basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, 5-8 guard Sonya Dolittle, is battling for a starting position.  
</P>
<P>
 Dolittle played at Oxnard High six years ago and is up against 5-9 Stacey 
McMillen, who recently moved to the area from the state of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Faifuaina Liufau, an all-league player at Channel Islands last season, will 
start at point guard.  
</P>
<P>
 Allison Jones, Liufau's high school teammate, will start at forward along with 
Monica Maestas. 
</P>
<P>
 Laren Newman (6-1) will start at center. As a senior at Oxnard High last 
season, Newman led the Channel League with 13 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This group is stronger than any team I've had," Flores said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have a little bench and good talent. By the time we hit conference (play) 
we will have jelled and we'll be a force to reckon with." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard will play Antelope Valley at home in its opener on Nov. 22. PIERCE 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Larry Albritton, first season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 5-22 
</P>
<P>
 Allbritton served as a two-year assistant before taking over the program this 
season. He has 10 players, the most he has seen on the Brahmas' roster.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had this many," Allbritton said. "We're looking good and the 
depth is great. It's really going to help us." 
</P>
<P>
 The downside is that the school's gym is still off limits because of damage 
caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake, so the team must practice and play at nearby 
Taft High. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Ana Gonzalez, who ranked second in the WSC in assists last season, 
is back at point guard. Diane Lakatta is back at forward and much improved, 
according to Allbritton. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really worked hard during the summer," Allbritton said. "She didn't have 
a great season last year but she's our go-to person." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Butler, a 6-1 freshman from Simi Valley, will start at center. The rest of 
the starting lineup is still being decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce's season opener is Nov. 19 at Saddleback College. VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: John Taylor, second season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 14-18 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs have three starters back from last season and a total of seven 
returning players. 
</P>
<P>
 Vonya Dangerfield, a second-team All-WSC pick, will start at forward. 
Dangerfield, the team's most valuable player as a freshman, averaged 10 points 
and seven rebounds a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerfield will be joined by Nikki Hamilton in the front court. Hamilton, an 
All-City selection at North Hollywood High, is the team's best defensive 
player. She averaged seven points and six rebounds in '93-94. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs' other returning starter is point guard Maggie Hause, a Burroughs 
High graduate who averaged seven points and five assists as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the starting lineup includes freshmen Dimara Haymond and Valery 
Brady. Haymond, a 5-10 center, averaged 20 points and 15 rebounds at Monroe 
High last season and was an All-City selection.  
</P>
<P>
 Brady, a 5-6 guard from Notre Dame, was an All-Mission League choice last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a very experienced team and a very quick team," Taylor said. 
"The chemistry is also outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley will play in the Mt. San Antonio College tournament this week. VENTURA 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Ned Mircetic, fifth season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 26-6 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates have two players back from last season's team that lost to Cypress 
in the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Hardy, the area's only returning All-State pick, is a 5-11 forward from 
Buena High who averaged 21.6 points and 9.6 rebounds a game for Ventura last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's going to be better this year," Mircetic said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Aside from the fact that's she's physically better, she's more mature and 
that will make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Amy Blackburn, who averaged eight points and six rebounds a game last 
season, is the team's other returning starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Amber Magner, a transfer from Loyola Marymount, and freshman Tori Anderson of 
San Diego will share one guard spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amber is a great all-around scorer and her maturity will help us a lot," 
Mircetic said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tori is one of the best athletes I've seen. She has explosive quickness and 
she's a great ballhandler." 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Marina Reyes, who recently moved to Ventura from Mexico, will start 
at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-4 Reyes is a skilled defender with good speed, Mircetic said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates open the season this weekend at the Chaffey tournament in Rancho 
Cucamonga. ANTELOPE VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Jackie Lott, fifth season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 11-13 
</P>
<P>
 The Marauders have one player back from last season, forward Wendie Tjulander, 
a part-time starter who averaged seven points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lott says she has several talented freshmen who played in competitive 
high school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Furman, an All-Southern Section Small Schools Division selection from 
Bethel Christian in Lancaster, will start at point guard, with 6-foot freshman 
Valesha Fletcher at forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Krista Martinez, Fletcher's teammate at Quartz Hill High last season, will 
start at guard. The last starting position is still up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very inexperienced, but we have a lot of athletic ability," Lott said.

 Davis Love and Fred Couples, in search of a record third consecutive title for 
the United States, held a three stroke lead Thursday when darkness halted play 
in the rain-delayed opening round of the World Cup of Golf in Dorado, Puerto 
Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair, at 12 under par, were three shots ahead of the Zimbabwe team of Mark 
McNulty and Tony Johnstone when poor light forced them to stop after 16 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 They will finish this morning, after which the 32 teams will tee off for the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimbabwe, playing without Nick Price, is two strokes ahead of Italy and three 
ahead of Ireland.

 Jim Albus played the back nine in a sizzling 29 en route to a course-record 
eight-under-par 64 and a one-shot lead after the opening round of the 
season-ending $1.35-million Senior Tour Championship at Myrtle Beach, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Albus' effort, which included nine birdies, broke the Dunes Club record of 67 
set in 1960 by Billy Joe Patton in the Southern Amateur.

<P>
 "It was one of those fun days you're always hoping to have -- and I had it," 
said Albus, 54.

 Rocky Thompson was second after a bogey-free round of 65.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: STEWARTS IN THICK OF THINGS AS THEY HEAD INTO BAJA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two members of the Stewart family, son Brian of Riverside and father Ivan of 
Alpine, are looking at today's SCORE Baja 1,000 from different perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian, 30, will be trying to maintain his lead in the overall SCORE off-road 
standings against challengers Robert Nolin of Ramona and Ryan Thomas of La 
Mesa. Brian, who drives one of Walker Evans' trucks in the full-size production 
pickup class, has 177 points to 175 for Nolin, in a 1,600cc VW desert buggy, 
and 173 for Thomas, in a 1,650cc desert car. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan, 49, will be trying to catch Rob MacCachren of Las Vegas in the final 
championship race of the new Ford Tecate Trophy-Truck class. SCORE introduced 
trophy-truck this year after other entrants in Class 1 complained about having 
built-for-racing trucks in their category, which was originally designed for 
single-seat racing buggies. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Stewart won the Baja 1,000 last year in a Class 1 Toyota truck, but 
trails MacCachren, 261-235, with only the Baja 1,000 remaining in this year's 
seven-race season. MacCachren, driving a Jim Venable-prepared Ford pickup, 
needs only to finish ninth or better to clinch the championship. Stewart won 
the Baja 500, Fireworks 250 and San Felipe 250, but disappointing finishes in 
two other races dropped him behind MacCachren. 
</P>
<P>
 MacCachren, driving for the B.F. Goodrich Roughriders, won the last race, the 
Gold Coast 300, increasing his margin over Stewart, Larry Ragland of Phoenix 
and other trophy-truck drivers. He won the production truck class last year in 
the 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, MacCachren will campaign with Venable in NASCAR's new oval-track 
truck racing series. In two exhibition races, he won at Portland Speedway and 
finished second at Bakersfield's Mesa Marin Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27th annual 1,000 will start this morning in Mexicali in front of the 
civic center and make a 625-mile loop down the Laguna Salada before returning 
to the border city next to Calexico. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Venable's former drivers, Robby Gordon, will be a formidable challenger 
for MacCachren and Stewart in a new Ford built in the Gordon-Vessels Racing 
shop in Anaheim. Gordon, who races Indy cars for Derrick Walker, tested the 
truck extensively after the Laguna Seca finale for Indy cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Gordon won the Baja 1,000 overall championship while driving solo in 
a truck when the race was one-way from Ensenada to La Paz. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Hall of Reno, the only driver to have raced in all 26 previous Baja 
1,000s, will be back in a Hummer, the converted U.S. Army vehicle used 
extensively in the Gulf War. Hall and his son, Chad, piloted Hummers to first- 
and second-place finishes in the full stock class last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest of the 223 entries is a diesel-powered, 9,000-pound Cummins 
Navistar truck-tractor that stands 8-feet 8-inches tall and is 16 feet long. It 
will start with 160 gallons of diesel fuel and try to run the distance without 
refueling. Off-road veteran Mike Lund of Corona, who has experience in all 
types of desert racing from buggies to four-wheel-drives, will do the driving. 
Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 DRAG RACING -- Bill (Grumpy) Jenkins and his '74 Chevy Vega pro stocker that 
made drag racing history two decades ago, will be featured this weekend at the 
third annual California Hot Rod Reunion at Bakersfield Raceway. The nostalgic 
event is expected to attract more than 200 cars from earlier eras. The Greer, 
Black & Prudhomme top-fuel dragster that launched Don Prudhomme's career has 
been restored and will be on hand with its driver. Linda Vaughn, former Miss 
Hurst Golden Shifter, will be grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 Also being honored are members of the original National Hot Rod Assn. Safety 
Safari, which toured the country in the '50s, urging hot rodders to take drag 
racing off the streets and onto organized strips. . . . A new one-eighth mile 
strip will open Saturday at the San Bernardino International Airport, formerly 
Norton Air Force Base. Bracket racing will be open to all street stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 DRAG BOATS -- Clinton Anderson, who nearly lost his life when his 
4,000-horsepower boat, Fatal Attraction, flipped in practice for last year's 
World Finals at Firebird Lake in Chandler, Ariz., will return to the same site 
this weekend with a second world championship likely. All Anderson, the 1992 
champion, needs to do to replace Ron Braaksma in the No. 1 position is qualify 
for Sunday's eliminations in the International Hot Boat Assn.'s Coors Light 
World Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 LAND SPEED -- With Bonneville Speed Weeks having been washed out, Southern 
California Timing Assn. enthusiasts will get their final opportunity for speed 
runs in a two-day meet this weekend at El Mirage Dry Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 PAGE JONES -- According to family and therapists, the 22-year-old driver who 
has been unconscious for more than seven weeks is showing steady improvement in 
his physical movements while undergoing rehabilitation at Daniel Freeman 
Hospital in Inglewood. Jones suffered head injuries in a sprint car accident 
Sept. 25 in Ohio and has not regained consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- Mike Cofer, former San Francisco 49er kicker, was named rookie 
of the year in the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Tour after finishing fifth 
overall. Cofer plans to drive in NASCAR's SuperTruck series next year. . . . 
Street stocks will race Saturday night at Sunrise Valley Raceway in Adelanto. . 
. . Bill Tempero, with first- and second-place finishes in his Pontiac in two 
heats last Sunday at Willow Springs, won his second American IndyCar Series 
championship. . . . Mike Carver of El Cajon won the Tellus Industries series 
with a second-place finish last week in the Blythe 100.

VENTURA LIGHTS UP OXNARD, 57-32 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The flashing lights and wailing siren of a police cruiser enlivened the 
Ventura High sideline Thursday night, but the only people in trouble were the 
Oxnard Yellowjackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the running of quarterback Erik Olson and fullback Eric Blair, Ventura 
overwhelmed Oxnard, 57-32, in a Channel League game in which each team had 
police escorts in honor of the youth deterrents program, Cops 'n Jocks. Ventura 
finished in a three-way tie for the title with San Marcos and Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson ran into the end zone twice in the first four minutes of the second half 
to put the Cougars (5-5, 5-2 in league play) on cruise control after they led, 
29-26, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stuck with the run pretty much because my shoulder got banged up in the 
first half and we knew we could do whatever we wanted on the ground," said 
Olson, who carried nine times for 77 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson clipped the Yellowjackets' wings for good with a stumbling 45-yard run 
up the middle 3 1/2 minutes into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wasn't the way the play was called," said Olson, who improvised with a 
quarterback draw after spying room in the midst of the Oxnard defense. "You 
hope it works out right or else you're going to be in real trouble when you get 
back to the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 On a night with chilly temperatures and a large rectangle of mud in the center 
of the field, a low-scoring game was to be expected. However, both teams came 
out firing in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams traded touchdowns in the first half, but Oxnard missed three of four 
extra points and trailed at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellowjacket tailback David Cameron (17 carries for 109 yards, four 
touchdowns) found the end zone on a 25-yard pass from Taj Lewis, 45 and 21 runs 
from scrimmage, an 81-yard kickoff return and a two-point conversion. Lewis 
completed 10 of 23 passes for 177 yards and a touchdown. He also threw two 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Aiding Olson, Ventura got a pair of touchdown runs from Blair (12 carries for 
201 yards) and Aaron Davis (13 carries, 127 yards) and an 11-yard scoring 
reception from Ramsey Jay. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson was appreciative of both his backfield and line. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Blair and Davis) are good backs, but our line makes them great," Olson said. 
"There are 57 points on the board. We have to be doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard opened the scoring on a 25-yard pass play from Lewis to a wide-open 
Cameron on the right sideline. Five minutes later, Ventura answered when Olson 
threw an 11-yard scoring strike to Jay. 
</P>
<P>
 A minute later, Oxnard climbed back on top with 45-yard quarterback draw by 
Lewis from shotgun formation. Ventura forced the game's only deadlock with 2 
1/2 minutes to play in the first quarter on a six-yard run by Davis.

 Buena High's chances of winning the Channel League title outright were ruined 
when San Marcos scored in the second half to steal a 7-6 victory Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Nathan Ridgell scored on a 60-yard run to tie the score, 6-6, 
with 9 minutes 25 seconds remaining in the third quarter.Alfredo Moreno kicked 
the decisive extra point for San Marcos (6-4, 5-2 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
 With eight minutes remaining in the first half, Buena linebacker Damon Deck 
forced a fumble and recovered it at the San Marcos 16-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, quarterback Glenn Dudley hit Nathan Coyle on an 11-yard 
scoring pass. After a high snap, kicker James Hammer missed the extra-point 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena (6-2-2, 4-1-2) committed two second-half turnovers and fell into a 
three-way tie for the league championship with San Marcos and Ventura, which 
trounced Oxnard, 57-32. All three teams qualify for the Southern Section 
playoffs.

 The tone of the game was set on Newbury Park's first two possessions.On the 
opening drive, the Panthers (6-4, 4-3) moved to the Thousand Oaks 28, but on 
fourth down, Sperry intercepted a pass in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 After forcing a punt, the Panthers drove to the Lancers' seven, but Brock 
Diediker was stopped on fourth down at the six.

by Brandon Jackson, who gained 101 yards in 11 carries. Jackson's 47-yard run 
in the third quarter set up a 22-yard field goal by Andy Carpiac.

with 10 minutes to play. Czernek completed 27 of 43 passes for 216 yards, but 
Sperry made his second interception late in the fourth quarter to stifle a 
Newbury Park rally.

 Buena Park's strong running game and aggressive defensive front finished off 
La Habra, 23-13, in a Freeway League game Thursday night at Buena Park High, 
and kept the Coyotes in contention for a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park, Sonora, Fullerton and Sunny Hills are in a four-way tie for 
first.Only three teams will advance to the playoffs. Those teams will be 
decided by a coin toss. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the way for the Coyotes was quarterback David Barrios, who threw a 
45-yard touchdown to Corey Lyday on the first play of the fourth quarter that 
appeared to put the game out of reach, 16-7. Barrios' touchdown pass was the 
Coyotes' only completion of the game in five attempts. The touchdown capped a 
14-play, 98-yard march that consumed nearly seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, La Habra (3-7, 1-4) responded quickly, driving 65 yards in eight 
plays to score. Wide receiver Will McIntosh made it 16-13, when he turned a 
short pass into a 45-yard score, his second touchdown reception of the game, 
with nine minutes 21 seconds remaining. The Highlanders' two-point conversion 
attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyday fumbled the ensuing kickoff and La Habra recovered at the Buena Park 37. 
Quarterback Johnny Marshall, who was forced out of the pocket throughout the 
game and sacked six times, fumbled the snap on his third play from scrimmage. 
The Coyotes recovered, but were unable to convert. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall completed nine of 24 passes for 147 yards, including two touchdowns 
and two interceptions, for the Highlanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park's leading rusher, Tim Jones, carried 18 times for 117 yards. COREY

 Nate Pivaroff's 11-yard run with under three minutes left gave Laguna Beach a 
22-20 victory over Estancia in a Pacific Coast League game Thursday at Laguna 
Beach High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting at their 47, the Artists drove 53 yards in four plays, sparked by a 
30-yard screen pass from Pivaroff to Ryan Steel. 
</P>
<P>
 The come-from-behind victory spoiled an impressive performance by Estancia's 
running tandem of Carlo Amaya and Bachy Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaya led the Eagles with three touchdowns and 113 yards rushing; Gonzalez 
added a game-high 139 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach led, 7-0, on Pivaroff's one-yard sneak set up by Steel's 24-yard 
run to the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of two out-of-bounds kickoffs to start the third quarter, 
Estancia drove 60 yards in six plays for its first score. Amaya's five-yard run 
and a two-point conversion run by Gonzalez gave Estancia its first lead, 8-7, 
minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Pivaroff hit Zeda Stone with a 63-yard touchdown pass to 
regain a 13-8 lead. Stone caught a game-high five catches for 99 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaya's second score, a one-yard run, put the Eagles ahead, 14-13, going into 
the fourth quarter. His 11-yard run with 4:18 left gave Estancia a 20-16 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Pivaroff threw for 236 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach finishes its season 2-8, 1-4 in league. Estancia is 4-6, 1-4.

<P>
 Sonora had an opportunity to win its first league title since 1973, but the 
Raiders lost to Sunny Hills, 17-7, Thursday night at La Habra High. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora (5-5 overall, 3-2 in league) was the only Freeway League team that 
could have won the title outright with a victory this week, but will have to 
settle for a share of the title and rely on a coin flip to determine its 
playoff future.The Raiders, who won the Orange League championship in '73, 
reached the playoffs last year on a coin flip. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost our destiny," Sonora Coach Mark Takkinen said. "Now we'll have to 
hope for the luck of the draw." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the end of the half, Sunny Hills (4-6, 3-2) got on the board with 
a 37-yard field goal by Nick Walton to lead, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second half, the Raiders' Mark Gonzalez intercepted a pass and 
returned it to the Sunny Hills 27-yard line. On the next play, Shawn Brass 
skirted the left side and raced down the sideline for a touchdown and a 7-3 
Sonora lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the third quarter, Jeff Renaud leaped to catch a Greg Garand pass in 
the middle of the field and outran the defense to give the Lancers the lead for 
good, 10-7. Garand added a 20-yard touchdown run with 2:17 left in the game 
after the Raiders turned the ball over on a fake punt.  
</P>
<P>
 "Offensively, I was real pleased with the way our kids were able to control 
the clock in key situations and pick up key first downs," Sunny Hills Coach Tim 
Devaney said. "We haven't been able to do that all year." TED APODACA

PREP EXTRA / FRIDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; COSTA MESA, LAGUNA HILLS BATTLE COULD BE 
QUITE A RUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What qualifies as the biggest surprise of the 1994 prep season? 
</P>
<P>
 Well there's Newport Harbor's undefeated season, although the Sailors have 
been a regular in the playoffs for many seasons. There's Western and 
Brea-Olinda challenging for the Orange League title, where many people figured 
Anaheim -- among others -- would be. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing compares to having the state's top two running backs -- Charles 
Chatman of Costa Mesa and Brendan McGraw of Laguna Hills -- from the same 
league and both rushing after the county single-season yardage mark of 2,596 
set in 1992 by Rancho Alamitos' Jeff Byrd. It adds spice to tonight's game, 
which will decide the Pacific Coast League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman figures to get there first. Last Friday's 340 yards against University 
leaves the 5-foot-10, 170-pound senior with 2,247 yards after nine games. 
Earlier this season, he had a 414-yard performance against Aliso Niguel, four 
yards short of the single-game county record set in 1979 by Dana Hills' Jim 
Gleed -- against Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman has a 300-yard lead on McGraw. But the Hawks' 6-1, 190-pound senior is 
ahead of Chatman in the county scoring race. The six touchdowns (and 265 yards) 
he had last Friday against Laguna Beach -- in one half -- give McGraw 33 
touchdowns and 198 points. That's the fourth-highest single-season touchdown 
total in county history (Southern California Christian's Mike Jacot set the 
record of 37 in 1991) and the fifth-highest scoring total (Jacot scored 222 in 
1991 and Byrd 222 in '92). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing when you consider in three games he's only played a half," 
Laguna Hills Coach Steve Bresnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman has 27 touchdowns (and 12 extra points) for 174 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Their final totals will include all playoff games, giving both a shot at the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, both have the attention of opposing defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously he will carry the ball," Bresnahan said of Chatman. "We have to 
play hard every play; the one you let up on is the one he can go all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Costa Mesa Coach Myron Miller: "Laguna Hills is McGraw. We've got two 
other very good backs, so if Charles is under 100 yards we can still win. If we 
can keep McGraw under 100 yards, they lose. They need him to come up big, where 
any combination of our three has to come up big." 
</P>
<P>
 Both players say they are aware of one another, but won't make tonight's 
matchup personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be better if it was his team against my team instead of Chatman 
against McGraw," Chatman said. "I don't know how McGraw looks at it, but it's 
more between who has the best line. I like to look at it like Chatman's line is 
blocking good, not Chatman is running good." 
</P>
<P>
 Said McGraw: "I'm not looking at individual things. That's selfish. I want to 
win the league championship first. Whoever wins the rushing title that's fine, 
but I want the league title." 
</P>
<P>
 At least McGraw had an offensive history. Last year -- mainly as a flanker -- 
he had 22 catches for 499 yards and seven touchdowns. But with the graduation 
of Fred Kim, he moved to the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bresnahan: "He's the best I've ever had in 23 years and I've been at 
every level of high school and college. No question he is Division I caliber." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman, however, last season was primarily known as an outstanding 
cornerback; indeed, it is the position most colleges are interested in having 
him play. He was, at best, the third back on Costa Mesa's roster, behind 
budding star Dewayne Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crenshaw's season has been marred by a bad hamstring, a torn muscle in the 
shin and a sprained ankle. (He has still managed 717 yards.) Crenshaw is 
healthy now and will get more attempts, which figures to cut into Chatman's 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Chatman doesn't have enough to do. Along with carrying the ball 25 
times per game, he plays every down on defense at cornerback. "He is a Division 
I cornerback," Miller said. "The people he covers stay covered." And he's not 
above playing on the kickoff and punt squads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles has done everything we've asked," Miller said. "And I've never had a 
runner have a year like him." LAGUNA HILLS VS. COSTA MESA 
</P>
<P>
 Featured Game 
</P>
<P>
 When: 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Laguna Hills (7-2 4-0); Costa Mesa (7-1-1, 3-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Rankings: None. 
</P>
<P>
 Noteworthy: Both teams have standout runners -- the Mustangs' Charles Chatman 
(2,247 yards) and the Hawks' Brendan McGraw (1,947 yards) -- meaning the ball 
rarely goes into the air other than on punts and kickoffs. The winner claims 
the Pacific Coast League title and a high seeding in the Division VIII 
playoffs.

PREP EXTRA / FRIDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; EMPIRE LEAGUE; HUSKEY OVERCOMES JITTERS, 
LIFTS CYPRESS

<P>
 Bryan Huskey was nervous. He had a right to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Huskey kicked a 27-yard field goal with six seconds left as Cypress beat 
Katella, 17-15, Thursday night in Empire League play at Western High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous," Huskey said. "When I went to plant my foot, I slipped and hit 
the (kicking) tee." 
</P>
<P>
 The ball had just enough to clear the crossbar, but at first it didn't seem 
like enough for Cypress (3-7, 1-4).  
</P>
<P>
 Especially not after Katella (0-10, 0-5) drove down and Josh Welton kicked a 
27-yard field goal with 59 seconds remaining to give the Knights a 15-14 lead 
and an apparent victory.  
</P>
<P>
 Cypress came back on the passing of David Wheeler. The senior quarterback hit 
two key passes on the final drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler passed 22 yards to Bobby Brito and then hit Huskey for 19 more yards 
to the Katella 22-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Huskey knocked out the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella got off to a quick start when it took the opening kickoff and scored 
in four plays. Sal Viramontes scored on a 20-yard run. Viramontes rushed for 97 
yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler hit Brito with a three-yard touchdown pass with 51 seconds left in the 
first quarter to give Cypress a 7-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Cleave ran 72 yards for a third-quarter score. Cleave finished with 151 
yards in 16 carries for Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Welton caught an eight-yard pass from Viramontes late in the third quarter.

WISCONSIN'S MOSS JAILED FOR COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wisconsin tailback Brent Moss, the 1994 Rose Bowl most valuable player who was 
on the verge of breaking the school's career rushing mark, was suspended from 
the team Thursday after his arrest on a cocaine possession charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss was jailed Thursday after an anti-drug task force pulled him over and 
reportedly found two rocks of crack cocaine in one of his socks. 
</P>
<P>
 He left jail Thursday night after Circuit Judge Jack Aulik authorized his 
release on a $2,500 signature bond, co-signed by Moss and his father, Henry. 
District Attorney William Foust and defense attorney Gerald Mowris both 
requested his release. No formal charges were filed by the district attorney 
pending an initial court appearance scheduled for next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin Coach Barry Alvarez, who suspended Moss "pending a legal 
resolution," said he was "shocked" by the player's "apparent involvement." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very difficult day," Alvarez said. "I feel as if it was one of my 
own children." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior offensive lineman Joe Rudolph said, "It's as though you have a brother 
that's done something that isn't supposed to be done."

INDICTED IN TEXAS

<P>
 Notre Dame football player Michael Miller was free on bond in Texas on 
Thursday after being indicted on a charge of organized criminal activity in 
what authorities say was a fraudulent check-writing scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller turned himself in Wednesday, a day after Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz had 
announced without explanation that Miller had left the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "He showed up with an attorney in one hand and bond in another," said Rodney 
Glendening, a sheriff's detective in Ft. Bend County, just southwest of 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignment was set for Nov. 21 in state court in Ft. Bend County. Conviction 
on a charge of organized criminal activity could get Miller 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deal is, several guys in Houston have legitimate checking accounts, go to 
police departments and report the checks stolen and sign affidavits that they 
are stolen," Glendening said. "In the meantime, they go on shopping sprees." 
</P>

 Stanford announced that quarterback Steve Stenstrom will sit out the final two 
games of the season. Stenstrom, 22, a fifth-year senior, had surgery Wednesday 
to repair a broken right little finger, which he injured Saturday. The Cardinal 
will start sophomore Scott Frost against Oregon on Saturday.

 The Big Eight Conference suspended lame-duck Coach Jim Walden for Iowa State's 
season finale at Colorado on Nov. 19 because he had criticized officials, 
breaking a league rule prohibiting such comments. The league also fined Iowa 
State $5,000. If the suspension stands, Iowa State's home game with No. 1 
Nebraska on Saturday will be Walden's last. He announced last week he will 
resign at the end of the season.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior quarterback Matt Rutter completed eight of 13 passes for 119 yards and 
two touchdowns and ran for another score Thursday night to lead Reseda High to 
a 42-14 victory over Monroe in a Valley Pac-8 Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda jumped to a 14-0 lead when Rutter hooked up with tight end Alonso 
Arreola on a pair of first-half touchdowns.The first covered 24 yards and 
completed a 10-play, 74-yard opening drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes later, Rutter hit Arreola on a 38-yard scoring pass. Monroe 
closed within 14-7 in the second quarter when Jesse Jones scored from 58 yards 
on his first carry. Jones finished with 117 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda (7-3, 6-1 in conference play) opened the second half by scoring 21 
consecutive points. Rutter scored on a three-yard run and tailback Charles 
Shells (14 carries, 80 yards) added touchdown runs of six yards and one yard 
for a 35-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Nuccitelli scored on a 13-yard run in the fourth quarter for Monroe (5-5, 
4-3). Nuccitelli finished with 136 yards in 14 carries. JAMES TEMMEL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Scott Jr. and Sal Mojica have been named co-coaches of the Verdugo Hills 
High football team, Principal Gary Turner announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 They will replace Buzz Johnson, who announced his resignation last week, 
citing health and personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Hills, which on Thursday lost its season finale against Hollywood, 
21-12, finished 1-7-2 . The Dons were 5-23-3 in Johnson's three seasons as 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott and Mojica coached Verdugo Hills' frosh-soph team to a 9-1 record this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott is the son of Verdugo Hills Athletic Director Don Scott Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Scott Jr. graduated from Verdugo Hills in 1985 and was a linebacker at 
Glendale College and Cal State Northridge. DAVE DESMOND

SIDELINES; NORTHRIDGE WOMEN FACING ANOTHER SEASON DOWN UNDER .500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The start of a new season usually begins with optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, in the case of the Cal State Northridge women's basketball team, it's at 
least a fresh start. The Matadors were 3-22 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 If Tuesday night's exhibition opener against the Australian Institute of 
Sports is any indication, it will be another long season for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 The scoreboard provided the first bit of bad news: an 83-53 loss to the 
Aussies. A close look at the game program supplies an even worse blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 12 players listed on Australia's roster, four were 15 years old, three 
were 16, four were 17, one was 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-olds -- the age of an American high school freshman -- combined 
for 24 points. Northridge's five starters accounted for 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome back: More than 300 Notre Dame High alumni are expected to attend 
Friday night's homecoming game in which the Knights play host to Chaminade for 
the Mission League title. 
</P>
<P>
 That includes Chaminade Coach Rich Lawson, a 1973 Notre Dame graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the alumni got something in the mail that said, 'How many guests will you 
be bringing?' " Lawson said. "I put down 47." 
</P>
<P>
 So close, yet . . .: For the second year in a row, the Ventura College men's 
water polo team narrowly missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates (18-10-1, 4-2 in the Western State Conference) were rated ninth in 
the southern region of the state. The top eight teams made the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Ventura defeated Cuesta last week it would have received the automatic bid 
awarded to each conference champion. The Pirates lost that match, 14-13 -- in 
double overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrating? Yep, and typical too. Ventura lost seven games by two goals or 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 Still a wizard: His coaching helped establish UCLA as a basketball power. Now 
John Wooden has given Northridge's program a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden was the featured speaker Sunday at a Northridge basketball fund-raising 
dinner and auction that netted the Matadors $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 fans paid $50 per ticket for dinner and to hear Wooden talk about 
his coaching philosophy and "Pyramid of Success." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a sharp as a tack," said Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy, who was an 
instructor at Wooden's first basketball camp back in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden, 84, still attends most UCLA home games, so presumably he will be 
watching Nov. 26 at 2 p.m. when the Matadors face the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion 
to open the regular season. Stats 
</P>
<P>
 What does it take to be recognized among the Western State Conference's 
football players of the week? 
</P>
<P>
 Valley College quarterback Jim Arellanes passed for a state junior college 
record 644 yards against Bakersfield last week, completing 31 of 55 of his 
attempts. The 6-foot-4, 212-pound transfer from Northern Arizona finished only 
33 yards shy of the national JC record set in 1990 by Jim Bergstedt of Hibbing 
(Minn.) College. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes completed 11 for 20 or more yards, including passes of 51 and 68 
yards to Brian Comer and of 42 and 49 yards to Jason Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet three receivers were selected ahead of him for top weekly honors in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance was good enough to bring Arellanes within striking distance of 
the national single-season record of 3,555 passing yards set by Sal Genilla of 
San Mateo in 1985. Arellanes is 829 yards behind with two regular-season games 
plus a potential bowl game to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit woman: Outside hitter Missy Clements, who broke the Northridge career 
record for kills in Saturday's women's volleyball match against Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo, is on the verge of setting a Matador single-season record for 
kills per game. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-11 senior from La Habra High is averaging 4.75 kills with two 
matches left in the regular season. Aimee Stone set the school record of 4.20 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Drought ends: When Ryan Duston of St. Bonaventure High won the boys' race in 
last week's Tri-Valley League cross-country finals, he became the first Seraph 
athlete -- male or female -- to win a league title in that sport. Honors 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge junior receiver David Romines caught six passes for 141 
yards and two touchdowns last week in a 45-20 loss to Southern Utah and was 
named the American West Conference's offensive player of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Oscar Wilson recorded 12 solo tackles and one quarterback 
sack and was selected Northridge's defensive player of the week. Jonas Walker 
averaged 24.2 yards on five kickoff returns to earn the special-teams award. 
Punter Ron Lindberg of Southern Utah, a Canyon High graduate, was the AWC 
special-teams player of the week. Things to Do  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, 7:30: High school football league championship games: Foothill League 
-- Saugus vs. Hart at College of the Canyons; Mission League -- Chaminade at 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, 7:30 p.m. at Alemany High: Village Christian needs a victory over 
L.A. Baptist to win the Alpha League football title. Kilpatrick needs a victory 
over Marshall Fundamental in a 2 p.m. game to qualify for the playoffs.

 Running back Durell Price and receiver Davon Young each scored three 
touchdowns to lead Sylmar High to a 59-0 rout of Grant in a Valley Pac-8 
Conference finale Thursday night at Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar (10-0, 7-0), which has won 39 consecutive conference games since 1988, 
clinched the East Valley League title outright for the fifth season in a row 
and is expected to be seeded first in the City Section Division 4-A 
playoffs.Sylmar is the only undefeated team in the section. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, who rushed for 62 yards, scored on three of his six carries on runs of 
27, two and three yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Young returned a punt 57 yards for the first Sylmar score and added touchdown 
receptions of 19 and 68 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar's swarming defense knocked two Grant starters out of the game in the 
first half. Quarterback Adam Crespo left the game late in the first quarter 
because of a leg injury and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. Running 
back Di-Onte Smith, who entered the game with 1,584 yards rushing and 18 
touchdowns, was held to a season-low 19 yards in nine carries and left the game 
in the second quarter because of a leg injury and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant (2-7-1, 1-6) completed only two passes for five yards against a Sylmar 
defense that forced three fumbles and posted its fifth shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar quarterback Greg Marquez completed six of nine passes for 132 yards and 
two touchdowns in three quarters of work to fuel a 53-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerrod Taylor rushed for 57 yards in three carries and scored on runs of 46 
and four yards. STEVE GALLUZZO

 Sale Isiah, who has started four games at defensive tackle and played the 
lion's share of all nine there for UCLA this season, will line up at left guard 
on some plays Saturday night at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 That's left offensive guard. 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent much of the time since the Stanford game two weeks ago working at 
left guard, where the Bruins are short-handed, and where coaches believe he has 
a future in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a leg injury to James Christensen and Mike Rhome's absence because 
of a family illness, the Bruins will have only three guards available Saturday: 
starters Mike Soenksen and Chad Sauter and Isiah.

Saddleback Coach Jerry Witte said. "But they've worked hard for this. And we 
deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (4-6 overall, 3-2 in league), with offensive linemen Jimmy Ambriz 
and Morrow Potts dominating up front, scored on its opening two drives and had 
no trouble with Tustin. A 44-yard touchdown pass by quarterback Danny Rodriquez 
to Gary Critchfield gave the Roadrunners a 7-0 lead with only 2 minutes 33 
seconds gone in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 On its next possession, Saddleback ground out a 53-yard drive in 11 plays -- 
all on the ground -- as Palacios scored on a two-yard run with 3:26 left in the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 A 38-yard field goal by Joseph Meza late in the second quarter made it 17-0. 
Palacios scored on a one-yard run at 8:57 of the third, then caught a 
seven-yard scoring pass from Rodriquez four minutes later to finish the rout. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin (1-9, 1-4), which has lost 15 of its last 16 games, managed only 72 
yards in offense and committed five turnovers.

PREP EXTRA / FRIDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; ARROWHEAD LEAGUE; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
CHRISTIAN STILL HAS HOPE AFTER VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California Christian kept its slim playoff hopes alive with a 12-8 
victory over La Verne Lutheran Thursday night in an Arrowhead League game. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their victory, the Flames (3-7, 2-3) also need a Hesperia 
Christian victory at Arrowhead Christian tonight, which would put the three 
teams into a three-way tie for third place in the league.The winner of a coin 
flip would then advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd love to go, but I'm not sure we are ready for playoff-caliber 
competition," Flames Coach Bert Esposito said. "But we'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Flames scored two touchdowns on their first three possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Schinofen's one-yard quarterback sneak with 6 minutes 5 seconds left in 
the first quarter gave the Flames a 6-0 lead. The opening drive covered 62 
yards and the key play was a 40-yard pass from Schinofen to Jeremy Smith that 
advanced the ball to the La Verne six-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 With 7:31 left in the first half, Mark Caballero went up the middle for an 
11-yard touchdown and a 12-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans (2-8, 0-5) scored on their first possession of the second half 
when Matt Keller pounded it in from three yards. Keller ran in for two points 
and La Varne trailed, 12-8, with 8:56 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flames were able to shut out the Trojans the rest of the way with Manny 
Marquez, Ben Morookian and Ken Buhler making key stops on fourth-down plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Caballero led the SCC offense, rushing 15 times for 52 yards. Ken Thomason led 
La Verne with 92 yards in 18 carries.

<P>
 At the very least, Edison proved Thursday night it's the third-best team in 
the Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (8-2, 3-2) earned the final automatic playoff qualifying berth by 
virtue of a 26-16 victory over Marina at Huntington Beach High School in front 
of a homecoming crowd of 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're 8-2 and the two games we lost were Los Al and Esperanza," Edison Coach 
Dave White said. "Somebody's going to have to be tough to beat us in the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Pat Markovsky led the Charger attack, completing 17 of 29 passes 
for 219 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers took an early lead, as Brad Lisotto ran in from two yards with 4 
minutes 19 seconds remaining in the first quarter. But the Vikings came back on 
their next possession with a 20-yard field goal from Peter Mignosa. 
</P>
<P>
 Markovsky connected with Mike Ogas for a 38-yard touchdown pass and Lisotto 
added another two-yard run to put Edison ahead, 20-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina (6-4, 1-4) battled back, as Viking Steve Cooper recovered a shanked 
punt at the Edison three-yard line and ran it into the end zone to cut the 
Charger lead to 20-10 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams scored in the second half, but Marina could not draw closer as 
Edison shut down the Viking running attack in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers compiled 339 yards in total offense, besting the 291-yard effort 
from Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Williams rushed for 130 yards in 19 carries to lead Marina. MATT FARMER

 Canyon High School quarterback Adam Hoover threw for 250 yards and three 
touchdowns to lead the Comanches to a 28-10 Century League victory over Orange 
Thursday night at El Modena High. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon clinched a playoff spot.The Comanches will await the outcome of 
Saturday's game between Villa Park and Santa Ana Valley to determine their 
league standing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comanches scored on their opening possession, driving 80 yards in seven 
plays, before Hoover connected with wide receiver Larry Witt on a 15-yard 
touchdown pass. Orange tied the score midway through the second quarter, as 
Markus Garza capped a 16 play, 79-yard drive, with a two-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Arguello kicked a 46-yard field goal to give the Panthers a 10-7 
halftime lead. On the third play of the second half, Canyon took the lead for 
good when Troy Mills intercepted a pass by Orange's Andy Laurdisen and returned 
it 31 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the game, Hoover completed touchdown passes of eight yards to Witt and 
23 yards to Greg Jacobs. Jacobs finished the night with five catches for 104 
yards, and Mills had four receptions for 73 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Garza rushed for 83 yards in 22 carries for the Panthers. Laurdisen left the 
game late in the third quarter because of a knee injury suffered while playing 
safety. DALE RUHE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santiago moved one step closer to a playoff berth Thursday night, knocking off 
host Garden Grove, 27-13, in the regular season finale for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers (4-6, 3-3), who won only one game in the last two seasons, moved 
into a tie with Garden Grove (4-5, 3-3) in the league standings.If Pacifica 
(5-4, 3-2) losses to Los Amigos tonight, the three teams would flip coins to 
determine the third playoff team from the league. Rancho Alamitos and Los 
Amigos have already clinched the top two spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove fumbled on its first play from scrimmage, and Ivan Kim recovered 
at the Argonaut 24. Tommy Sokanthong scored from seven yards out four plays 
later and Santiago led, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Sokanthong blocked a Ryan Cleary field-goal attempt on the next Argonaut 
possession, leading to a 61-yard scoring pass from Christian Cortez to Octavio 
Villa and a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove would score twice before the half, getting scoring runs of 22 
yards from Manuel Millan and three yards from Ruben Reyna. The conversion on 
the second score failed, leaving Santiago with a 14-13 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argonauts never got any offense going in the second half, gaining only 49 
yards and turning the ball over three times. Santiago upped the lead to 21-13 
on a six-yard Anthony Callari run early in the fourth quarter. ERIC MADDY

<P>
 Esperanza staked its claim to second place in the Sunset League with a 
resounding 59-14 victory over Fountain Valley Thursday night at Valencia High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 3 Aztecs (7-3 overall, 4-1 in league) totaled 438 yards in offense, 
led by running back Dahrin Footman's 183 yards and three touchdowns and 
quarterback Chris Stretch's 228 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza scored the first play of the game when Footman returned the kickoff 
90 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman scored the next time he touched the ball, on a 25-yard run to give the 
Aztecs a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretch nearly put the game out of reach with 7 minutes 55 seconds left in the 
first quarter when he connected with Brian Forth on a 46-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Barons' Mitch Ryerson hit Michael Rumford for a 12-yard scoring pass 
to cut the lead to 20-7, the Aztecs (4-6, 2-3) scored on their next three 
possessions before the end of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Clark connected for a 27-yard field goal, Dannon Brown tackled Ryerson in 
the end zone for a safety and Footman scored on a 43-yard run to give Esperanza

 Fountain Valley's Matt Harrison scored on a one-yard run to start the third 
quarter, cutting the lead to 39-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretch connected with Forth for a 50-yard score and hit Nathan Cardena for an 
18-yard touchdown pass late in the third quarter.

PREP EXTRA / FRIDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SEA VIEW LEAGUE; CORONA DEL MAR SQUEEZES 
BY WOODBRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corona del Mar held off a late Woodbridge rally to post a 7-6 Sea View League 
victory and clinch a Southern Section playoff berth Thursday night at Irvine 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar improved to 5-5 overall and 3-2 in League.If Irvine wins its 
game Saturday against Santa Margarita, the Sea Kings will finish in third 
place. If the Vaqueros lose, Corona del Mar will finish second. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge (5-5, 0-5) had a chance to win the game in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors took over on their 15-yard line with two minutes remaining and 
marched the ball to the Corona del Mar 32. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woodbridge eventually ran short on time. As time expired, Nathan Bennett's 
52-yard field goal fell short. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar took a 7-0 lead when quarterback Josh Walz connected with Miles 
Davis on a 65-yard touchdown pass with 5:59 remaining in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woodbridge closed the gap to 7-6 on a seven-yard touchdown run by Theo 
Wakefield with 1:35 remaining in the half. However, Bennett missed the 
point-after kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge had a chance to go ahead early in the fourth quarter when it 
advanced the ball to the Corona del Mar 11. 
</P>
<P>
 But Darren MacDonald intercepted a pass at the Sea King six-yard line.

 Paul Foster, who led the Moorpark College basketball team in several 
categories last season, signed a letter of intent Thursday to play at UC Irvine 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, a 6-foot-8 forward, averaged 19.9 points and 9.5 rebounds.He led the 
Western State Conference in field-goal percentage at 65.7% (253 of 385) and 
helped the Raiders finish in second place in the WSC North Division.

CAL LUTHERAN FLIPS NEW PAGE IN ITS VOLLEYBALL TURNAROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal Lutheran women's volleyball team can add another chapter to its 
turnaround this weekend when the Regals participate in the four-team NCAA 
Division III West Regional at UC San Diego in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran (19-8), seeded second in the tournament, will face Occidental 
(19-5) at 5 p.m. today. Top-seeded UC San Diego (25-6) will play Chapman (23-8) 
at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners will meet for the regional title at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight regional winners will pair off at home sites on Nov. 18 and a final 
four will be played Dec. 2-3 at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Cal Lutheran's first journey into postseason play since 1987, when the 
Regals won the NAIA District 3 championship. The Regals didn't have another 
winning season until 1993, going 14-13 in Coach James Park's first year. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Cal Lutheran won the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference title with an 11-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't take all the credit (for the turnaround)," Park said. "I hope I can 
take some, but I think the kids have done a great job working hard at every 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior outside hitter Darcy White has 237 kills and holds Cal Lutheran's 
all-time record with 528. Sophomore Tracy Little and freshman Jamey Light are 
known for their jump serves. Light had eight aces in a three-game match, 
breaking a school record set in a five-game match. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Tara Thomas has set a single-season school record with 326 digs and 
holds the career record with 610. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental handed Cal Lutheran its only SCIAC loss this season. The Tigers 
beat the Regals in five games on Oct. 28, earning a split in their two 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Regals lost two of three meetings with Chapman. UC San Diego, which has 
qualified for postseason play in each of the 14 seasons the NCAA has held a 
Division III women's volleyball tournament, is ranked third in the nation. The 
Tritons beat Cal Lutheran in five games in the teams' only meeting this season.

ONE FOR ALL, ALL FOR ONE; DRITZ AND PAUL HAVE MUSKETEER ATTITUDE AT MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterbacks Tyler Dritz and Bryan Paul could have become bitter rivals this 
season, and perhaps distracted the Moorpark High football team. But the two 
players were unselfish enough not to let individual ambitions get in the way of 
team goals. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the Musketeers enjoyed the best season in their history with Dritz 
playing quarterback and passing for more than 1,000 yards. Moorpark finished 
9-2-1, reaching the second round of the Southern Section Division IX playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But an arm injury forced Dritz, a senior returning starter at quarterback, to 
move to receiver during two-a-day workouts before this season. Paul, who 
figured to play receiver while backing up Dritz at quarterback, won the 
position by default. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong-armed junior might have challenged Dritz for the starting job. But 
he also might have transferred to Thousand Oaks had the Southern Section not 
flagged a Thousand Oaks assistant coach for illegal recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Dritz and Paul have played prominently in the Musketeers' 7-2 
start. The Musketeers (2-1 in Frontier League play) are winding down their 
second-most-successful season. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul is the 11th-highest-rated quarterback and Moorpark ranks fifth in total 
offense (313.1 yards per game) among area schools in the Southern Section. He 
has thrown 10 touchdown passes and only two interceptions while completing 
53.9% of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Dritz is) a good quarterback," Paul said. "That puts more pressure on me to 
perform better. At the beginning, it worried me a lot. But not as much now, 
with us doing well and seeing that he's a great receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I always feel something, just because he's here. I'm looking over my 
shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 Dritz rates as one of the league's most-exciting players. He has caught only 
nine passes (or one per game), but three have gone for touchdowns. He averages 
23.7 yards per reception. Dritz has scored seven touchdowns, almost all of them 
coming on big plays -- a 66-yard run on a reverse, a kick return, a punt return 
and two fumble recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Coach Rob Dearborn said Dritz, who also plays cornerback, is his best 
defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't tell me this, but I've got the feeling Tyler wouldn't go back to 
quarterback," Dearborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until his injury, Dritz had every intention of passing for more than 1,000 
yards for the second consecutive season. Last year Dritz, 6-foot-1, 185 pounds, 
completed 54.4% of his passes for 1,139 yards, 12 touchdowns and nine 
interceptions. He dreams of getting a football scholarship and figured another 
good season at quarterback would be his ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ready for this year," Dritz said. "I figured I'd get good stats. I was 
disappointed at first. But so far I'm having fun. If I was having a bad season, 
I'd be dying to play quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 In late summer, before the Musketeers met for two-a-day practices, his arm 
went dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started losing strength," Dritz said. "My arm would start shaking after 
practice during passing league. Toward the end, I couldn't even throw a ball 10 
yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Dritz was suffering from strained ligaments in his shoulder and his elbow in 
addition to a stretched biceps. His doctor didn't clear him to throw the ball 
until two weeks ago. By then, Paul had established a stronghold on the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul, 6-3, 185 pounds, has completed 62 of 115 passes for 1,084 yards. With 
his current statistics applied to the same number of games that Dritz played 
last year (12), Paul would finish with 13 touchdowns, 2.5 interceptions and 
1,445 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the same circumstances, other players probably would be grateful for the 
opportunity. Not so for Paul, who had planned to be a varsity starter as a 
sophomore last year. He had started on the junior varsity as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dritz, a virtual unknown last year, transferred from Westlake and won the 
job. Injuries sidelined Paul for six games and he threw only eight passes. It 
was a blow. 
</P>
<P>
 During the winter, Paul and his father met with then-Thousand Oaks volunteer 
assistant coach Bob Shoup and discussed a transfer -- a Southern Section rules 
violation. As penalty for the illegal contact, Paul was forced to stay at 
Moorpark.

 "I was ready to go (to Thousand Oaks)," Paul said. "But after that situation 
was over, it was over. I don't even think about it anymore. I'm very happy 
where I am now. The coaches are great, the players are great. They're all good 
friends. Everything worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Dritz, the strong senior year he expected has also worked out -- but 
with plenty of surprises. Instead of throwing touchdown passes, he returned the 
opening kickoff of Moorpark's season 80 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was awesome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice he has stripped the ball from opposing players for fumbles and returned 
them for long touchdowns. Two weeks ago, in a victory over Santa Paula, Dritz 
caught a screen pass from Paul and rambled 50 yards for a score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's luck, what I've done so far," Dritz said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Paul moving to quarterback and the Moorpark game plan centered on 
standout running back Bryan Wilkins (1,304 yards rushing, 21 touchdowns), Dritz 
feared he might get lost in the shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 But his propensity for the big play has attracted the attention of opponents 
and taken pressure off Paul and Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilkins, he's the star here," Dritz said. "I'm just an average player. But I 
want the ball. So when I get the ball I want to do something good." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wilkins: "I knew we'd be just as good with Bryan Paul at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's actually keeping three good players on the field, instead of two, 
because I don't think the coaches would have put (Paul) at receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the start, Tyler didn't want to face the fact he wouldn't be able to throw 
this year. But he's a good athlete. He's a threat at receiver. And I knew he 
was a good runner." 
</P>
<P>
 Dritz and Paul have a new respect for each other. Dritz is no longer the 
quarterback, but he is still a leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gives me a lot of confidence by catching the ball," Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His talking on the field helps, too. He'll say, 'Come on, Bryan. Lead us down 
the field.' He's a big help." 
</P>
<P>
 Dritz said Paul hasn't performed like a quarterback fearing for his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, Bryan didn't do much," Dritz said. "He wasn't looked to as a 
leader. Now he has to be a leader, and I think he's done a good job so far."

 Chris Young rushed for 186 yards and five touchdowns as Rancho Alamitos 
rounded out an unbeaten Garden Grove League season with a 50-0 rout of Bolsa 
Grande Thursday at Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros (7-2-1, 6-0 in league) scored twice in the game's first five 
minutes, as John Frank connected on touchdown passes to Aaron Trigg for 57 
yards and Jeff Turbarg for 36 yards.Young then added a 26-yard scoring run in 
the final minute to give Rancho Alamitos a 20-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Young displayed his versatility as a two-way player in the second quarter, 
recording touchdown runs of 11 and one yard, and intercepting a David Price 
pass and sacking him. Young's sack forced the Matadors (2-8, 1-5) to punt, 
setting up the Vaqueros' final possession of the half and an eventual 35-yard 
field goal by Frank that made it 37-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Young capped Rancho Alamitos' next two possessions with one- and five-yard 
scoring runs, but Kevin Allen and Leo Kosi assumed the bulk of the second-half 
rushing for the Vaqueros. Allen gained 67 of his 102 yards after the half; Kosi 
entered the game after halftime and gained 85 yards in 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, playing catch-up all night, finished a frustrating three for 14 passing 
for 44 yards and three interceptions. ANDY EISER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine and Edison girls' cross-country teams, ranked No. 1 and 3 in the 
final Orange County Sportswriters' poll, begin their quests for back-to-back 
State championships at the Southern Section preliminaries Saturday at Mt. San 
Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition begins at 7:30 a.m., with a Division I girls' race finishing the 
day at 3:42 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three teams from each race, of which there are 32 Saturday, and the 
top two individual runners not on one of the top three teams, advance to the 
Southern Section finals, Nov. 19 at Mt. San Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison remains the favorite in Division II, but should receive stiff 
competition from Trabuco Hills (No. 4), the South Coast League champion, and 
Aliso Niguel (No. 8). 
</P>
<P>
 The most competitive boys' race of the day figures to be in Division III at 8

SEMAZA'S BACK WITH A KNOCKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When his night's work was done, Mike Semaza found the ring announcer's 
microphone and said all he needed to say to the crowd at the Irvine Marriott 
ballroom: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm back." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after his last fight, Semaza, a featherweight from Fullerton, 
returned looking more powerful than before his once-promising career was halted 
by injury. 
</P>
<P>
 It was tough to determine how strong, how much more mature Semaza has become 
because he needed only 1 minute 34 seconds to knock out John Ramirez of Oxnard 
in Thursday's main event. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of three strong punches, the last a left that sent Ramirez (10-7-2) 
to the canvas, made Semaza a winner for the 11th time in 12 pro fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a different fighter as far as power goes," said Semaza, 11-0-1. "I wanted 
to be cautious, but I saw the opening and went after him. I stunned him, so I 
kept after him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great. I was hoping to get in some rounds, but I'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Semaza was originally scheduled to face Frankie Avelar on Aug. 18 at Irvine, 
but he suffered a cracked rib during a training session a week before the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Semaza threw a left hook that missed. His sparring partner countered with a 
right hook that landed solidly enough to tear cartilage in one of Semaza's 
ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, hand injuries had sidelined Semaza for the better part of two 
years. He also took some time away from the ring for financial reasons, and 
there's no question the layoff has hurt his career.

that definitely played a part in my decision." BRYAN RODGERS

 Rose Kuhn had 11 kills to lead a balanced attack for Laguna Beach (21-3), 
which advanced to Tuesday's quarterfinals to play Huntington Beach, a 16-14, 
15-7, 15-7 winner over Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mater Dei's Roberta Gehlke had a match-high 19 kills, the Artists won 
with better ball control and a strong attack from the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew Roberta would be their bread and butter," Soylular said. "Although we 
have a young team, we have a lot of playoff experience. That really helped us." 
</P>
<P>
 Setter Christy Collison, a three-year starter, had 32 assists for the Artists. 
Middle blocker Lisa Ravensberg, a returning starter, had nine kills and four 
blocks and teammate Michelle Christ finished with eight kills and four blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach took a 9-2 lead in Game 1 before the Monarchs (15-5) rallied. 
Abigail Daniels' block drew Mater Dei even, 14-14, but the Artists quickly 
closed out the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravensberg blocked Adams for a side out, then after Gehlke netted a spike to 
make it 15-14 Laguna Beach, Christ blocked Gehlke's spike attempt for game 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our chances in the first game," Mater Dei Coach Pete West said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach demolished the Monarchs in Game 2 and took command in Game 3. Two 
errors by Gehlke pushed the Artists' lead to 14-9, but Mater Dei didn't quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach needed six match points before Mater Dei's Laurie Layton, who had 
34 assists, set the ball too close to the net for Gehlke and the error ended 
the match. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

 El Toro's last-second steal preserved an 8-7 victory over Villa Park in a 
Southern Section Division I first-round water polo game Thursday at Corona del 
Mar High. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-time defending Division I champion Chargers (16-11) extended their 
playoff winning streak to 23 games, spoiling Villa Park Coach Jeff Ehrlich's 
bid for his 400th victory in 21 seasons at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Another milestone was reached as Allen Basso led El Toro with five goals, 
giving him 134 for the season to break J.P. Mathot's single-season school 
record of 132 set in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Basso, one of only two seniors on the team, scored three goals in the first 
quarter as the Chargers built a 5-1 lead. However, Villa Park (20-8) cut the 
lead to one on Philip Johnson's goal with three minutes left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro, ranked ninth in Orange County, took an 8-4 lead midway through the 
fourth quarter, but again the sixth-ranked Spartans rallied to within one on 
Peter Cornue's fifth goal with 1:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Charger turnover, El Toro's Shane Lindstrom was able to steal the ball 
from Aaron Waldrip in front of the goal with seven seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro will play host to third-seeded Long Beach Wilson in the second round 
Tuesday. DAN ARRITT
